That will always be the case.\"</p><p> To overcome the challenges of climate change, international and local government bodies need to plan ahead and drive a concerted effort to adapt, the panellists said.</p><p> Panellist Debra Roberts, co-chair of a working group under the United Nations' top climate science body, said national governments need to take the lead and provide local governments with both guidance and funding.</p><p> \"Because of our multiple pressures that we're dealing with, generally we're not going to move in a particular direction unless a policy tells us we've got to go there.\"</p><p> The panellists' comments come as Singapore shores up its protection against rising sea levels triggered by climate change.</p><p> The island-state has launched site-specific studies and invested heavily in enhancing its coastal defences over the past three years.</p><p> Sea levels are projected to rise by up to 1m by the next century, a recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned.</p><p> In Singapore, they could rise by as much as 4m to 5m, according to national water agency PUB.</p><p> About 30 per cent of the island is less than 5m above sea level, making rising sea levels a significant risk.</p><p> In 2019, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said $100 billion or more may be needed over the long term for the Republic to address this challenge.</p><p> An initial injection of $5 billion into a coastal and flood protection fund was announced a year later.</p><p> Speaking at the panel yesterday, PUB deputy chief executive for policy and development Chua Soon Guan said that Singapore intends to build up its research and development ecosystem in coastal protection.</p><p> He added: \"The question really is how to ensure adequate and timely protection of Singapore coastlines, while at the same time, because of the uncertainty, we need to preserve flexibility for us to adapt to future developments in terms of climate science, technology and engineering.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1040830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6588-H891-DYX4-01VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

SM Teo was on a working visit to Jakarta, Indonesia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My good friend</p><p>Menko Luhut Pandjaitan,</p><p>Excellencies,</p><p>Distinguished Guests,</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Indonesia International Sustainability Forum 2024. I would like to congratulate Kemenko Marves and Kadin Indonesia for hosting this significant event.</p><p>The world is currently on a pathway to 2.1 to 2.8 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100. This is too much. Increasingly, through floods and heat waves, all of us are seeing how climate change can profoundly disrupt lives and livelihoods.</p><p>Combating climate change will require the collective and consistent action of all stakeholders.</p><p>Asia must be at the forefront of change. We have more than half of the world's population, and are one of the key engines of global economic growth.</p><p>Today's ISF gathers many stakeholders who are committed to advancing ASEAN's net-zero ambitions. There is much that we can do and do together. Let me suggest three key practical sustainability pathways towards a net-zero ASEAN.</p><p>Building up Energy Infrastructure and the ASEAN Power Grid</p><p>The first sustainability pathway is building up green energy infrastructure. ASEAN is blessed with significant renewable energy potential. Indonesia itself has abundant solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy resources.</p><p>We can work together to realise this potential through our vision of an ASEAN Power Grid. Regional grids can better match supply with demand - countries that can produce more renewable energy than they need can export the excess. An ASEAN Grid will also allow seasonal variations in green energy output to be balanced out across the region. The revenue created will improve the bankability of renewable energy projects, which will in turn accelerate the deployment of more of such projects and support the phasing out of fossil fuels. It is a virtuous cycle.</p><p>Within ASEAN today, we have several bilateral interconnections over land. But much of ASEAN is archipelagic, especially Indonesia. We need stronger transmission systems to underpin our regional energy transition, and to build climate resilience. If we want a truly interconnected regional grid in ASEAN, we must work together to develop subsea cables. This will allow electricity to be traded along multiple routes and in multiple directions.</p><p>Indonesia and Singapore are collaborating to advance the development of a regional power grid. At the inaugural ISF last year, Indonesia and Singapore jointly announced Conditional Approvals for five projects to import 2GW of low-carbon electricity from Indonesia to Singapore. This year, we will advance these projects to the next step of development by issuing them Conditional Licences.</p><p>We will also be issuing new Conditional Approvals to two more projects to import an additional 1.4GW of low-carbon electricity from Indonesia to support our future energy needs. Singapore's Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng will elaborate on this later.</p><p>When these projects are realised, they will catalyse Indonesia's green economy by supporting investments for manufacturing solar photovoltaics and battery energy storage systems. These projects will also be one of the first building blocks for an expanded ASEAN Power Grid.</p><p>Let's work together to strengthen both domestic grids, and cross-border energy infrastructure overland and under the sea. This will create new pathways and new possibilities, and a stronger, more climate resilient and integrated ASEAN. All of us know there is no transition without transmission!</p><p>Scaling Up New Technologies</p><p>The second sustainability pathway is the scaling up of new green technologies, by mainstreaming them, and lowering the costs.</p><p>Carbon Capture and Storage, or CCS, has an important role to play in allowing us to achieve our net-zero targets. There is growing international recognition that CCS technology can safely and permanently store carbon within the ground to decarbonise our emissions.</p><p>We will need to devote resources to develop this technology, bring the costs of implementation down, and make it a viable part of ASEAN's decarbonisation path. Governments will also need to establish legal frameworks to encourage the use of CCS.</p><p>Indonesia and Singapore are also collaborating closely on CCS. In January 2024, Indonesia became the first Southeast Asian country to develop cross-border CCS-related legislation. One month later in February 2024, Singapore signed a Letter of Intent with Indonesia to collaborate on CCS.</p><p>We hope to continue working with Indonesia and other partners in the region to catalyse the deployment of cross-border CCS projects in ASEAN.</p><p>Financing</p><p>The third sustainability pathway is financing for decarbonisation projects.</p><p>Large-scale investments in renewables cannot be financed solely by the public sector nor solely by the private sector. Blended financing initiatives can help derisk projects, improve project bankability, and draw in more commercial capital.</p><p>One way that Singapore is supporting blended financing is through Singapore's Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, or FAST-P. FAST-P aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion from public and private sector partners to de-risk and finance currently marginally bankable green and transition projects in Asia. This will complement the existing suite of initiatives aimed at financing climate-related projects in the region.</p><p>Closing</p><p>The size of the climate challenge is daunting, and time is not on our side. But there are clear pathways to success. There are many opportunities for Indonesia and Singapore to work together, and with other ASEAN member states, to create a sustainable ASEAN for the future together. Through today's ISF, I hope we will be able to turn more of these opportunities into reality. I thank all of you for your attention and I wish you all the best in our sustainability journey.</p><p>[Category: Consumer Durables &amp; Apparel, Events]</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064856312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CWS-68X1-DXMP-K0NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 5, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Business &amp;

Good morning to all, and for many of our guests from around the world, welcome to Singapore. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Asia-Pacific Agri-Food Innovation Summit.</p><p>2. This week is significant for the global discourse on sustainability and innovation. As the 29th Conference of the Parties takes place in Azerbaijan to discuss climate action, we are gathered here with the shared goal of transforming the agri-food sector and securing a sustainable future for food production.</p><p>Innovation's role in food security</p><p>3. The agri-food system is facing unprecedented challenges due to factors such as climate change, disease outbreaks and geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world. Climate change is already disrupting food supply through erratic weather patterns. Prolonged droughts, heavy rainfall and floods are becoming more frequent, putting strain on crop yields. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global crop yields could fall by as much as 30 per cent by 2050 from 2022. Rising temperatures are also accelerating the spread of diseases among livestock, further threatening our food supply. Geopolitical tensions have disrupted agricultural infrastructure and policies by some governments to restrict food trades have also disrupted food supply chains, leading to higher food prices worldwide. Similarly, disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 pandemic underscored and intensified food security challenges, revealing vulnerabilities across logistical and distribution networks.</p><p>4. For a small nation like Singapore that imports more than 90 per cent of our food we consume here, we are particularly vulnerable to global food supply disruptions. This highlights the need for a local production buffer against global food supply disruptions, a form of insurance to grow some of our own food locally.</p><p>5. Innovation will continue to play a key role in helping us overcome various constraints and build our local production capabilities. In the agriculture and aquaculture sector, new technologies like precision farming, vertical agriculture, and closed-containment aquaculture systems are just a few examples of how innovation is transforming the way we grow food here. These technologies allow us to grow more with greater efficiency and climate resilience that we used to. At the same time, as we adopt new technologies and develop alternative proteins, innovation is crucial to ensuring that the food we produce is safe to eat.</p><p>6. Through the strong partnerships forged between Governments, businesses, researchers and industry, we can ensure that novel foods are developed in a well-regulated and science-based ecosystem, so consumers can feel confident with these new novel products.</p><p>7. In my speech today, I would like to share about how my Ministry, together with the Singapore Food Agency and a diverse group of stakeholders across the entire food value chain have also taken an ecosystem approach to co-develop the Singapore Aquaculture Plan.</p><p>Building a Resilient, Sustainable Aquaculture Sector</p><p>8. At last year's Singapore International Agri-Food Week, I shared on plans to co-develop the Singapore Aquaculture Plan and uplift the local aquaculture sector. Various parties, Industry, nature groups, academia and research institutions, as well as various Government agencies, were interested in solutions to achieve sustainable and productive aquaculture in Singapore.</p><p>9. Hence we got together - This is the first time we have brought stakeholders from across the entire system to collectively create a roadmap and vision for our aquaculture sector in Singapore. After several months of discussions and co-creation, I am pleased to announce today the launch of our Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP) paper. The paper is a collaborative effort that embodies our collective vision for the sector and serves as a roadmap for future aquaculture development in Singapore.</p><p>10. Through the discussions, we sought innovative approaches to balance sustainability with productivity and to uplift the aquaculture sector. The plan has five pillars.</p><p>Pillar 1: Space &amp; Infrastructure Planning</p><p>11. The first pillar is Space and Infrastructure Planning. Space and infrastructure are critical to supporting the growth of Singapore's aquaculture sector. SFA regularly launches land and sea space tenders with long-term leases to provide the stability farms need to invest and grow. Environmental studies for key aquaculture sites ensure we balance growth with environmental responsibility.</p><p>12. We will explore the implementation of site selection studies to assess feasibility of potential aquaculture sites early in the planning process, leverage renewable energy solutions like floating photovoltaic systems and study shared infrastructure solutions like processing and storage facilities to support the sector's growth.</p><p>Pillar 2: Enabling Regulations</p><p>13. The second pillar is Enabling Regulations. A strong regulatory framework is vital to shaping the industry's growth and ensuring its long-term sustainability. Our regulatory framework is designed to ensure that aquaculture development aligns with national standards for safety, space optimisation and environmental sustainability. Thus, to keep up with global developments in sustainability, SFA will manage farms via a nutrient budget approach. The carrying capacity model establishes the maximum allowable production from a farming area to meet environmental quality targets, protecting sensitive habitats like coral reefs and maintaining water quality. This science-based approach sets limits on nutrient (i.e. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Carbon) discharge rather than limits on production level, and encourages farms to adopt sustainable practices and technologies to minimize nutrient output, allowing more production within a site while protecting the environment. This is in addition to our plans to strengthen farm management and animal husbandry practices under the planned Food Safety and Security Bill.</p><p>14. We will continue to support farms to meet production requirements. We recently operationalised the Aquaculture Sensing Network (ASN) to support the aquaculture industry in water quality monitoring, and to better monitor the nutrient discharges from farms, The ASN comprises of a network of water quality sensors at aquaculture zones and complemented by water and sediment sampling. This data provides operational insights on various water quality parameters, providing early warning against environmental threats such as harmful algal blooms. The ASN is an example of how sustainable growth can be achieved through technology and collaboration, to better manage our aquaculture industry in relation to global trends.</p><p>Pillar 3: Research, Innovation, Enterprise</p><p>15. The third pillar is Research, Innovation and Enterprise. Innovation is key to unlocking the potential of our aquaculture industry. Through our partnership with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, the Marine Aquaculture Centre (MAC) has achieved significant breakthroughs. An example is the improvement of growth rates for Asian Seabass through a long-term selective breeding program, resulting in a significant increase in average body weight of the fish from the initial generation to the latest selectively bred line.</p><p>16. Additionally, MAC has developed large-scale indoor aquaculture system for Asian Seabass fry production and has pioneered husbandry techniques to combat disease, such as low salinity culture methods to address Big Belly Disease in seabass hatchery production.</p><p>17. To further innovation in agri-food, over $300 million has been made available under the Singapore Food Story (SFS) R&amp;D Programme to enable R&amp;D in the aquaculture, urban agriculture, future foods and food safety domains. Within the aquaculture domain, research efforts are focused on areas such as the development of superior fry and fingerlings, improving feed conversion ratio and cost effectiveness, and reducing fish mortality from key diseases. Under the SFS R&amp;D Programme, we also established the AquaPolis Programme to strengthen the collaboration between local and international aquaculture researchers and industry players. AquaPolis stakeholders have been actively engaged to identify key problem statements and develop research proposals relevant to the industry. Together, we will embark on scalable translational R&amp;D projects to advance industry technological capabilities, promote knowledge sharing and technology transfer, and strengthen the local ecosystem to raise the productivity and profitability of local farms. MAC will continue to play a key role in supporting AquaPolis research efforts. Researchers can already tap on MAC's expertise in breeding and hatchery production as well as resources and test-bedding facilities to develop innovative solutions.</p><p>Pillar 4: Ecosystem Development</p><p>18. The fourth pillar is Ecosystem Development. Building a robust ecosystem is essential to driving the growth and competitiveness of Singapore's aquaculture industry. Several initiatives are already in place to strengthen the sector. The Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund provides co-funding to help farms to adopt sustainable farming technologies to boost productivity and lower costs. The Aquatic Animal Health Services was introduced to provide veterinary support to farms to enhance their farm biosecurity and disease management.We have also been developing a local talent pipeline through partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learnings to equip our workforce with the skills needed to support agri-food industry innovation.</p><p>19. Dedicated funding under the ACT Fund will support the development of Closed Containment Aquaculture Systems. Central to our efforts is the launch of the National Broodstock Centre and the Hatchery Development and Recognition Programme.</p><p>20. A key focus within this pillar is the upgrading of local hatchery capabilities. They play a vital role in translating genetically superior eggs into high quality fingerlings to meet industry needs. This will reduce reliance on overseas sources, lower mortality rates, and enhance the sector's resilience.</p><p>21. These initiatives will collectively enhance Singapore's aquaculture ecosystem and unlock export opportunities, positioning Singapore as a leading tropical aquaculture hub.</p><p>Pillar 5: Demand Offtake and Promotion of Local Produce</p><p>22. The fifth and final pillar is strengthening demand offtake and promotion of local produce. We are taking a holistic approach to increase demand across individual, industry, and national levels. Since 2019, we have launched marketing campaigns and educational initiatives to raise awareness of the benefits of local seafood. We have also collaborated with supermarkets, sponsored events, and engaged the community through culinary programs. At the industry level, we've partnered with the Hotel, Restaurant and Catering (HoReCa) sector and introduced the Farm-To-Table Recognition Programme to recognise businesses that procure local produce. Nationally, we piloted the Food Resilience Preparedness Programme in schools to educate young Singaporeans on food security and the importance of supporting local produce.</p><p>23. SFA has been working closely with international partners to enhance market access for our locally farmed fish, providing the impetus for our farms to scale up their production. Just earlier this month, we signed protocols with China, allowing six species of our locally farmed fish to be sold into the Chinese market. This agreement represents a significant opportunity for our local farms to reach China's vast population and further elevate Singapore's brand of high-quality, fresh produce.</p><p>24. Moving forward, we will continue to expand marketing and consumer education efforts, highlighting the nutritional benefits of local aquaculture products, and continuing to strengthen supply chains for broader access. Through these initiatives, we aim to build consumer trust and support the sustainable growth of our aquaculture industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>25. The Singapore Aquaculture Plan paper represents the collective vison and resolve of all stakeholders in transforming our agri-food industry. This plan not only strengthens our local food production but also paves the way for Singapore to establish itself as a leader in sustainable aquaculture practices.</p><p>26. The success of our efforts will depend on strong collaboration across the public and private sectors, as well as meaningful engagement with the wider community. The innovations discussed at this summit in both agriculture and aquaculture will play a crucial role in shaping the future of food security, not just in Singapore but across the world.</p><p>27. Let's continue to work together to create a sustainable, resilient agri-food system that can weather the challenges of tomorrow. Thank you, and I wish you all a fruitful summit ahead.</p><p>[Category: Paper/Forest Products, Fertilizers &amp; Agricultural Chemicals, Chemicals, Specialty Retail, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065299937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFY-53F1-JB5M-W28F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2351\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 19, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Long Term Commercial Leases</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIyNzJFNEQ1MEE5NDZDMDgxRTAwQzIxQzI3ODk5RkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkExOTIxOTg3RUQxNDgzNEFEQjczOTlGNzdBRjhBMkM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Good morning. I am pleased to join you for the annual RICS x REDAS conference, and I congratulate RICS and REDAS for successfully organising yet another year of this conference. This is a meaningful platform that brings together professionals and practitioners from the building and real estate sector to exchange views and gain insights into the opportunities and challenges the sector faces in our move towards a net zero future.</p><p>2. Today, we gather under the banner of \"Net Zero Carbon Cities: Dream or Reality\", a theme that challenges us to reimagine cities of our future. The pursuit of net zero cities is not a mere aspiration, but an essential reality that we must actively shape with sound decisions.</p><p>3. Cities are responsible for over 70% of global CO2 emissions today. More specifically, the Built Environment sector accounts for approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions. One of the factors causing cities to have higher emissions is the Urban Heat Island, or UHI effect. This is where urban areas are warmer than the surrounding areas due to increased human activities, reduced green spaces, and more built-up areas. The United Nations projects that approximately 2.5 billion more people will be living in cities by 2050. Urbanisation, along with its associated infrastructure and energy needs, will exacerbate the UHI effect as cities replace natural landscapes with concrete, trapping heat. As the temperatures in cities rise, the energy demands for cooling also increases, leading to even higher emissions and creating a vicious cycle for cities and indeed, globally.</p><p>4. It is important to strike a balance between preserving nature and urban development. As we grapple with emissions from growing cities, the building and real estate sector can help with creative solutions to green our buildings and to reduce rising emissions driven by urbanisation. How we design our buildings and the materials we choose can either aggravate or mitigate the impacts of heat on our built environment. For example, we can reduce the heat on buildings using cool paint coatings. In Singapore, HDB has started to pilot cool paint technology in Tampines. The cool paint has shown to potentially reduce on-site temperature by up to 2 degrees Celsius. If the pilot initiative, expected to be completed by the end of this year, is found to be successful, the application of cool paint can be extended to more estates.</p><p>Building a Net Zero Singapore</p><p>5. The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to urban development and prioritises the greening of our built environment. Using innovation and technology, we seek to build a liveable green city in every aspect of our daily lives, be it designing climate resilient buildings, greening our energy sources, or promoting sustainable commuting options. Allow me to share some of our national-level strategies to promote this.</p><p>6. As a city-state, buildings account for over 20% of Singapore's emissions. Greening our buildings is therefore a key strategy to achieve our sustainability ambitions under our Singapore Green Plan 2030, and to fulfil our international commitments on climate change. Under our Singapore Green Plan, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) have jointly developed the Singapore Green Building Masterplan (SGBMP), which captures our collective commitment to pursue more ambitious sustainability standards in our built environment. The masterplan aims to deliver three targets of \"80-80-80 in 2030\". The first 80 is to green 80% of our buildings by 2030. The second 80 strives to have 80% of our new developments be Super Low Energy buildings from 2030. The third is to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency for best-in-class green buildings by 2030. As of the end of 2022, about 55% of Singapore's buildings by gross floor area (GFA) have been greened, nearly 20% of new developments by GFA are Super Low Energy buildings, while the best-in-class buildings have achieved a 71% improvement in energy efficiency compared to 2005 levels .</p><p>7. We are also aiming to make Singapore a net zero city by harnessing greener energy such as solar power and emerging low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen. Given our limitations as a small nation and being disadvantaged in alternative energy, we are prioritising innovation and collaboration to reshape our energy supply. One example is the Keppel Infrastructure @ Changi, where solar panels have been seamlessly incorporated into the facility's design, maximising energy while minimising environmental impact. Together with solar panels on its rooftop, the building can generate approximately 600,000 kWh of renewable energy per year, enough to offset more than twice of the building's energy consumption.</p><p>8. Beyond that, we are also transforming Singapore into a City in Nature. By 2030, every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park. Our urbans areas will be naturalised and greened even further. Our Jurong Lake District (JLD) for example, is planned as the largest mixed-used business district outside the city centre and will serve as a living lab for urban sustainability solutions. Notably, the 90-hectre Jurong Lake Gardens within JLD will help to promote climate resilience through water sensitive-urban designs which will cleanse water runoff and harvest rainwater to irrigate plants. JLD serves as an example of advanced urban design that combines extensive green spaces, smart technology, and sustainable infrastructure, setting a new standard for urban development. Such projects allow us to demonstrate, test and refine new technologies and solutions, which enable us to find an optimal solution to achieve our net zero goals.</p><p>Support for the Built Environment Sector</p><p>9. I am heartened that many of you are driving sustainability in your sector through the many iconic buildings and infrastructure that the building and real estate sector has worked hard to build. We have also made progress in developing net zero buildings. One example is the National University of Singapore's School of Design and Environment which won the Green Mark Platinum Champion Award by BCA. The building incorporates innovative features like solar panels and a hybrid cooling system which balances out the energy it generates and consumes. Another is DBS Newton Green, which was certified by BCA as a Green Mark Platinum Zero Energy development and is Singapore's first net zero building by a bank. Samwoh Smart Hub industrial building, too, has been recognised with BCA's Platinum (Positive Energy) award for generating more energy than it uses and has close to 2,600 solar panel to generate enough energy to achieve net energy surplus.</p><p>10. But we understand that incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into business practices often entails significant investments, not just in terms of capital, but also in innovation.</p><p>11. To support the industry, BCA has several schemes. The Green Mark Incentive Scheme, for example, has been instrumental in promoting the adoption of environmentally friendly building technologies and designs practices through cash and gross floor area incentives. Recently, we announced key amendments to the Building Control Act to enact the Mandatory Energy Improvement (MEI) regime. The MEI regime requires owners of energy intensive buildings to engage a professional to carry out the energy audit of the building's energy consuming system. This in turn pushes industry players to implement measures to reduce energy consumption.</p><p>12. While the Government has a significant role to play in supporting our journey towards net zero, the impact will be much bigger if every company and every individual in the built sector champions environmental sustainability across various domains in their organisations.</p><p>13. Over the years, we have seen technology in the built environment, ranging from climate control materials, energy, water and waste management to air quality control quickly developing. Though the science of climate change is still evolving, we must continue to boldly experiment with cutting-edge technologies available to pave the way for innovative solutions that can transform the built environment of Singapore into a greener and more sustainable one.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>14. In conclusion, the building and real estate sector is vital to Singapore's continued commitment to achieving net zero. I encourage all companies to take bold steps in integrating innovation, collaboration and eco-friendly practices into your next projects.</p><p>15. With the proactive engagement and commitment of all players in the industry, together, we can build a future where Singapore remains a world-class city, and where real estate developers and stakeholders collectively build legacies that stand the test of time and contribute towards a resilient, vibrant and sustainable home for all Singaporeans.</p><p>16.

Let me first say that Singapore is very gratified to be the latest Dialogue Partner of the Pacific Islands Forum. Thank you all for your warm welcome. Thank you for your guidance and hospitality, and the chance for me to visit this part of the world for the first time. I recall the words of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka of Fiji - he talked about the Pacific being once referred to as \"the corner of the world\", but now actually being the centre of the future.</p><p>2 Singapore, like many of you, was colonised because we missed the Industrial Revolution. That is why we all speak English today. Secondly, like many of you, we were also the theatre of war during the Second World War and (while) we were not privy to those political conflicts, we were victims nevertheless. Our third similarity is that, for most of us, we would claim our independence in the last five or six decades. Our key goal from thereon has been development - to give our people the skills to master the technologies of the future, jobs, and especially for young people, prospects for the future. A fourth area of similarity is that as small island states, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, climate change is a clear and present threat. The rising sea levels, the high frequency and intensity of storms and droughts, are clear, present and future threats to all our well-being.</p><p>3 In the case of Singapore, we view our relations with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) as strategic, and it will make a difference for our collective future. Although we are the latest Dialogue Partner, we have longstanding relationships with many of you. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the leaders and Foreign Ministers in this room over the past decade or so.</p><p>4 Singapore, as a Dialogue Partner, wants to work with you on human capacity development. We established the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992 as a way to pay forward the assistance which Singapore had received decades earlier from the international community and from the multilateral organisations, many of which are represented here today. Over the past 30 years, we have welcomed more than 5,800 Pacific Island officials to Singapore under the Singapore Cooperation Programme.</p><p>5 With our accession as a Dialogue Partner, I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package, which will be a specially customised three-year programme for the Pacific to support your priorities in the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. This programme will run from 2024 to 2026 and focus on three areas: first, climate resilience, second, cybersecurity, and third, international law.</p><p>6 On the first point, we will run a modular programme on urban governance, on planning and development to enhance climate resilience. Second, we will make available placements in Singapore's Cybersecurity Agency's Cyber Leadership Programme to equip officials with the knowledge on cyber and digital security to support national policymaking and participation in international discussions. I think if any of us think we have not yet been penetrated, it just means we have not discovered it yet. It is a clear and present threat, and we need to approach this both at the operational level - (with) the engineers, and also at the policy level. We hope to share and exchange ideas with leaders and officials from the Pacific Islands. The third area in which we want to work with you is in international law, and with a particular focus on climate and sea-level rise issues. We will disseminate a factsheet with more details on the SPARKS package separately and welcome feedback from all of you on how we can improve the package and make it more relevant for your needs at the national and regional levels.</p><p>7 I hope we will be a positive and constructive Dialogue Partner for the PIF, and I invite all of you to visit us on your many expeditions around the world. Thank you very much.</p><p>. . . . .</p><p>Annex B</p><p>FACTSHEET ON THE</p><p>SINGAPORE-PACIFIC RESILIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING (SPARKS) PACKAGE</p><p>At the 52ndPacific Islands Forum (PIF) 2050 Thematic Dialogue on 10 November 2023, Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan reaffirmed Singapore's commitment as a PIF Dialogue Partner to enhance engagement with the Pacific, guided by the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Singapore supports the PIF Leaders' Vision for 2050 to develop a new generation of leaders who are able to tackle the unique needs of the Pacific to build a resilient Pacific Region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity.</p><p>To that end,Minister Balakrishnan announced that Singapore will launch a special Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package. The SPARKS package will be provided under the auspices of the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), through which Singapore has served as a partner to the Pacific on its development journey for the past 30 years. The SPARKS package, which will run from 2024 to 2026, will focus on supporting the capacity building efforts of the Pacific in the priority areas of climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law to address challenges identified in the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. For a start, the SPARKS package will comprise the following programmes:</p><p>(a) Climate Resilience. Singapore will offer a customised 3-year modular programme for city leaders and senior officials from PIF members to enhance capacity building in urban governance, planning, and development to achieve climate resilience. The programme, which comprises one module each year over three years, would cover policy frameworks as well as implementation strategies to help cities formulate their development plans, including through preliminary draft planning of their city action plans with the assistance of domain experts. Participants will also learn more about the longer-term strategies for climate resilience and climate change adaptation.</p><p>(b) Cybersecurity.Singapore will offer placement to senior officials from PIF members in Singapore Cyber Security Agency (CSA)'s newly launched SG Cyber Leadership Programme to be delivered through the ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence in Singapore from 2024 to 2026. The programme will comprise Foundational-level and Advanced-level modules which seek to equip officials responsible for national cyber and digital security-related policies with the broad-based training on the operational, technical, legal and diplomatic aspects of cyber and digital security, with the view of providing tools to support national policymaking and participation in regional and international discussions. As part of the programme, participants will have the opportunity to engage with key representatives from industry and various international organisations, as well as other senior officials from regions across the world. Participants in the SG Cyber Leadership Programme can also look forward to future Alumni programmes and resources that will be set up following the first run of the programme in 2024.</p><p>(c) International Law.Singapore will offer up to three runs of an online course on international law, covering topics of direct relevance to the Pacific, such as Climate Change and Ocean issues, the work of the UNInternational Law Commission on Sea-Level Rise, the preservation of maritime zones, and climate change litigation before domestic and regional courts and human rights treaty bodies. The course aims to provide participants with an understanding of how international law can help address challenges posed by climate change, particularly rising sea levels.</p><p>For more details on the SPARKS package, please contact the Technical Cooperation Directorate at the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs via Ms Charmaine Yeow, Technical Cooperation Officer <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atcharmaine_yeow@mfa.gov.sg\">atcharmaine_yeow@mfa.gov.sg</email>  For enquiries on the cybersecurity programme, please contact CSA's International Cyber Policy Office via Mr Vikneswaran Selvam, Manager <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atvikneswaran_selvam@csa.gov.sg\">atvikneswaran_selvam@csa.gov.sg</email> , Ms Clara Ho, Manager <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atclara_ho@csa.gov.sg\">atclara_ho@csa.gov.sg</email> , and Mr Nasri Sadi, Assistant Manager <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:atmuhammad_nasri_sadi@csa.gov.sg\">atmuhammad_nasri_sadi@csa.gov.sg</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMFAPS-158326178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMFAPS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69MD-FKM1-F11P-X0DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">476773</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Government of Singapore Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Participants will meet with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and several Singaporean ministers.</p><p>Key Highlights:</p><p>* The visit includes briefings on Singapores experiences in climate change mitigation, sustainable development, and maritime connectivity.</p><p>* Singapore became a Dialogue Partner of the Pacific Islands Forum in 2022.</p><p>* Singapore has shared development experience with over 5,900 Pacific officials through the Singapore Cooperation Programme in the past 30 years.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>May 19 -- Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore issued the following news release:</p><p>Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan will host the 3rd Singapore-Pacific High-Level Visit from 20 to 22 May 2024. The High-Level Visit is a platform for Singapore and Pacific Ministers to foster closer ties and exchange views in areas of common interest such as climate change, sustainable development and urban planning. This is the third run of the High-Level Visit following its first two iterations in 2012 and 2017. Ministers and senior officials from Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, as well as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) Secretary General will participate in the visit.<br/><br/>During the visit, the participants will call on Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. They will also meet Minister Balakrishnan, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Education and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and Ministry of Transport Baey Yam Keng. They will visit the Marina Barrage, Singapore City Gallery, the Maritime and Port Authority's Port Operations Control Centre and Our Tampines Hub to be briefed on Singapore's experiences in climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable development, development planning, as well as maritime connectivity.<br/><br/>The High-Level Visit builds on the longstanding relations between Singapore and the Pacific, including Singapore's admission as a Dialogue Partner of the PIF in 2022. As fellow Small Island Developing States, Singapore and the Pacific share a commitment to tackling global challenges, particularly the existential issue of climate change. Singapore has shared our development experience with more than 5,900 Pacific officials under the Singapore Cooperation Programme over the past 30 years. In November 2023, Singapore launched a three-year customised technical assistance package for the Pacific named the \"Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing\" (SPARKS) package, which comprises courses in climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064219297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2P-7MK1-DXMP-K3K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 19, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Adaptation has historically been underfunded and receives much less financing from the private sector, which has generally channeled capital towards mitigation projects as these tend to be productive assets that can generate an income, such as a solar power plant.  </p><p> Besides the fact that the focus has been on reducing greenhouse gas emissions instead of adjusting to increasing risks of climate change impacts, climate adaptation tends to mean public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems, which do not lend themselves to commercial financing models.</p><p> However, Drew noted during a panel discussion that the investment case for climate adaptation projects comes from the increasing necessity of such goods and services -- with all metrics indicating that the world is not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- and therefore demand for them. </p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Jay Koh, the co-founder and managing director of The Lightsmith Group, said the challenges brought about by climate change present \"unavoidable opportunities\". </p><p> Citing the sixth assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Koh, who runs a private equity firm that focuses on climate resilience solutions, said that the trajectory of climate change between the present day and 2030 is almost entirely baked in by greenhouse gas emissions that have already accumulated. \"So there is a great growth investment opportunity -- that is intertwined with the decarbonisation investment strategies that people are pursuing in the market -- for climate resilience and adaptation solutions,\" said Koh, who was speaking at the same panel. </p><p> One example is an artificial intelligence company that analyses vegetation management for utility companies. Given that many major wildfires in the United States and Australia are sparked by vegetation encroaching onto power lines, most utility companies are managing this problem by having workers manually cut down trees getting too close to the power lines. </p><p> With satellite drone imagery, utility companies are able to manage such risks in a much more efficient way. </p><p> Yet, Drew pointed out that there is still currently a low level of awareness and understanding among financial institutions on what constitutes adaptation finance.</p><p> In the midst of developing the guide, she was often asked by banks and asset managers: \"What do you mean by (adaptation finance)? Do you mean \"loss and damage\"? Isn't that the job of the government'\"</p><p> \"Loss and damage\" refers to a fund, established by countries at the United Nations climate change conference, that will be financed by developed countries to compensate developing countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change. </p><p> There is therefore a need for the industry to have a common definition of adaptation finance and the commercial opportunities arising from it, as well as an understanding of the financing mechanisms and the type of projects available, said Drew.</p><p> \"Inaction is not a world that you can conceive. It's loss of economic prosperity, it's loss of livelihoods, it's people's health, it's life, et cetera... We can either invest in it now and do it in a nice, orderly way. Or we can wait till it's disaster, and then it's chaos,\" she added.</p><p> The importance of taking adaptation and resiliency actions early is also highlighted by Lubomir Varbanov, Swiss Re's managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific.</p><p> Physical impacts from a climate event can be mitigated if climate resiliency is built into urban planning sufficiently early, he said at the same panel. </p><p> It is a misconception that disaster risk insurance only has a role to play in the aftermath of a climate disaster as a shock absorber, Varbanov noted.</p><p> He cited an example of Swiss Re partnering with local governments in Australia to financially quantify their natural hazard risks. This allows them to pre-emptively identify their highest risk assets across all types of natural disasters and their locations, so as to factor this information into their planning processes.   </p><p> If more action to increase climate resiliency is not taken, the rising costs of insurance will lead to affordability issues, especially for vulnerable communities.</p><p> Varbanov noted that four of the last five years have seen over US$100 billion of insured losses from natural disasters. </p><p> He said that there needs to be more public and private partnerships, where data is shared and common objectives are set. </p><p> An enabling environment, with regulations that promote an open market and optimal price setting that does not make the insurance industry more expensive, are also important. </p><p> Helping livelihoodsOn the issue of policy reforms, Drew noted that local governments often cite how policy suggestions, such as the redirection of subsidies, are politically challenging to implement. </p><p> However, she added that it is important for the private sector and development finance institutions to highlight to policymakers how these policy reforms \"are going to actually create an enormous amount of opportunity for the livelihoods of (their) people\".</p><p> \"So politically, (they're) helping (their) people. (They're) creating that longevity and that resiliency and that endurance.\" said Drew, referring to governments.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>StanChart's chief sustainability officer Marissa Drew (left), speaking at a panel with Swiss Re's managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific Lubomir Varbanov during Ecosperity Week on Apr 17.

She said at the time: \"We can't afford to see what happened to solar panels happening again to electric vehicles, wind or essential chips.\"</p><p> The influx of cheap Chinese solar panels drove many European manufacturers out of the market in the late 2010s.</p><p> The EU has imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), with levies of up to 37.6 per cent that kicked in on July 4. </p><p> This has prompted China to further an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy. It launched a second probe into pork imports from the EU in June, also in retaliation against the tariffs on EVs.</p><p> On the EU tariffs, Ms Vestager said they are not meant to be punitive to the extent of nullifying Chinese competitiveness, but simply to correct the unfair advantage brought about by factors such as subsidies.</p><p> \"We do not want to start a trade war,\" she said. </p><p> Chinese media have criticised the EU, which similarly gives subsidies to companies in green industries, accusing it of having double standards. </p><p> Ms Vestager readily admits Europe is not subsidy-free. \"We have no problem saying we have subsidies. They are just very different kinds of subsidies.\"</p><p> \"Subsidies should not over-compensate and give companies a head start, when they should instead be competitive based on their level of investment in research and innovation, their workers' productivity, their technology readiness,\" she added.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice-president of the European Commission in charge of implementing the political priority of \"A Europe fit for the Digital Age\", was on a three-day visit to Singapore. st photo: SHINTARO TAY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-LCARMTH</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CDJ-YNW1-JCF2-801R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Trump\u2019s standing in American politics is now more powerful than ever with what he calls an \u201cunprecedented and powerful mandate\u201d from the American people. He secured a decisive victory in the presidential election, winning 312 electoral college votes compared to Harris\u2019 226 and becoming the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        An era of intensified Trumpism</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        How radically Trump will push his agenda will depend a great deal on whether there would be effective checks and balances in the American political system and among his own advisers. With a Republican majority in the Senate and potentially in the House of Representatives, alongside a conservative-bending Supreme Court, he may have a freer hand, at least until the mid-term elections in 2026. </p><p>                        As for the personnel, Trump was reportedly constrained by mainstream Republicans during his first term; this time round, he could pursue his goals more assertively and pack his inner circle with Trumpist loyalists first, and policy practitioners second.\u00a0The coming years could herald an era of intensified\u00a0Trumpism. His officials could possibly provide some restraint on him, but it is reasonable to expect that Trump will act with greater compulsion and fewer restraints on signalled priorities, alongside abiding unpredictability.</p><p>                        Trump 2.0 will be preoccupied with the challenge of delivering his campaign promises to swiftly end the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East.</p><p>                        Southeast Asia is a critical hub in global supply chains, a major player in international trade, the world\u2019s second-largest destination of foreign investments, as well as a focal point in the US-China strategic rivalry. Consequently, the region faces high stakes with the expected policy shifts during Trump\u2019s second term.</p><p>                        Trump\u2019s first presidency provides insights into what may lie ahead. His first term was marked by a disdain for the liberal internationalist principles that have shaped US foreign policy since World War II \u2014 particularly regarding multilateral institutions, alliances and trade. This, along with Trump\u2019s impulsive style, bombastic rhetoric and \u201cAmerica First\u201d transactionalism will continue or even intensify.</p><p>                        Against this backdrop, what does the future hold for Southeast Asia?</p><p>                        This photo illustration shows the front pages of the newspapers in Manila on 7 November 2024 showing the re-election of US President-elect Donald Trump.</p><p>                        Southeast Asia is unlikely to be a priority in Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda. During his first term, Trump\u2019s attendance at ASEAN and APEC summits \u2014 especially the high-profile Trump-Kim meetings in Singapore and Vietnam \u2014 appeared driven more by specific circumstances than a dedicated interest in the region itself, as seen under Obama, or the strategic focus on Southeast Asia\u2019s role in US-China competition under Biden. </p><p>                        Trump 2.0 will be preoccupied with the challenge of delivering his campaign promises to swiftly end the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East. Given Trump\u2019s personal disinterest in the region as well as his scepticism towards multilateralism, the region may face another four years of Trump\u2019s absence at ASEAN summits and minimal direct engagement with Southeast Asian leaders. During his first term, Trump attended only the 2017 ASEAN summit meetings, failed to send a cabinet-level official to subsequent summits in 2019 and 2020, and failed to appoint US ambassadors to ASEAN and Singapore.</p><p>Southeast Asian countries may see a reduction in American development assistance.\u00a0</p><p>                        Trump\u2019s return will also mark a retreat of US global leadership on shared challenges. Under Biden, addressing global issues like climate change and pandemics was elevated as one of the two pillars of its\u00a0national security strategy, alongside great power competition. His administration launched\u00a0various initiatives\u00a0supporting Southeast Asia in areas like climate resilience, smart cities, environmental protection, public health, education, youth leadership and women\u2019s empowerment.</p><p>                        Trump 2.0 may deprioritise these initiatives, given his track record of attempting to\u00a0reduce American foreign aid\u00a0and his scepticism towards climate change, green transition, public health and gender equality. As a result, Southeast Asian countries may see a reduction in American development assistance. The future of significant programmes like the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETP) \u2014 the financing scheme strongly backed by the Biden administration to help\u00a0Vietnam and Indonesia\u00a0transition to cleaner energy sources \u2014 now hangs in the balance.</p><p>                        Trade risks to Southeast Asia</p><p>                        Trade is where the risks to Southeast Asia\u2019s economic well-being are most apparent under Trump 2.0. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) involving seven Southeast Asian states was Biden\u2019s initiative to keep America engaged in regional economic rule-making, without offering a traditional free trade agreement with market access. Trump, who coined it \u201cTPP Two\u201d, may axe it on his first day in office. Although the impact of an IPEF cancellation will be much less profound than the shock of his 2017 withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it would further weaken the US\u2019s commitment to sustain its economic engagement in Southeast Asia.</p><p>                        Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could result in a 3% decline in exports from Asia (excluding China) to the US, and an 8% drop in US exports to those Asian economies.</p><p>                        More critically, Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for tariffs, which he\u00a0called\u00a0\u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, will spell great trouble ahead for the region. His threats to impose sweeping tariffs \u2014 10-20% on all imports and 60% on imports from China \u2013 would trigger disruptions in global trade and growth, severely undercutting the rules-based international trading system that has underpinned Southeast Asia\u2019s economic growth for decades.\u00a0Oxford Economics\u00a0projects that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could result in a 3% decline in exports from Asia (excluding China) to the US, and an 8% drop in US exports to those Asian economies.</p><p>                        Shipping containers are seen as US President Joe Biden delivers remarks on his administration\u2019s Investing in America agenda at the Port of Baltimore on 29 October 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>                        Ironically, Southeast Asian countries have largely benefited from the US-China trade war waged by Trump 1.0, which spurred companies to shift supply chains to the region to avoid Trump\u2019s tariff hikes on Chinese goods. US-Southeast Asia trade has grown steadily throughout the Trump 1.0 and Biden administrations, with Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia\u2019s exports to the US almost or more than doubling between 2017 and 2023. These countries, which have large trade surpluses with the US, will come under heightened scrutiny. His first administration labelled Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore as \u201ccurrency manipulators\u201d. They are off the list under Biden but remain under monitoring.</p><p>                        Under the Biden administration, the de-risking of global supply chains due to US-China tensions primarily impacted the semiconductor industry and the green sectors of electric vehicles and solar panels. This left Southeast Asian economies \u2014\u00a0deeply integrated\u00a0into the supply chains linking China and the US \u2014 largely unscathed in most other industries. However, Trump\u2019s proposed tariff hikes on Chinese imports \u2014 and products with significant Chinese components \u2014 combined with the threat of Chinese retaliation, would significantly heighten the risk that the world\u2019s two largest economies may decouple. ASEAN economies, of which China and the US are the largest trading partners, would be caught in the middle. </p><p>                        ASEAN exports to the US rely heavily on Chinese intermediate goods (not to mention the re-routing and relabelling of Chinese goods going to the US via Southeast Asia) and Chinese exports to the US also use raw materials and intermediate goods from ASEAN. A sharp decline in Chinese exports to the US would also negatively impact Southeast Asian exports to China, which in turn would affect overall regional economic performance. In sum, the globalisation model that Southeast Asia has long depended on for growth faces an increasingly uncertain future.</p><p>                        Table 1: Exports to the US from ASEAN and top five Southeast Asian nations</p><p>(2017-2023, US$ billion)</p><p>                        Table 2: Trade surplus with the US by ASEAN and top five Southeast Asian nations</p><p>(2017-2023, US$ billion)</p><p>                        Defence and security: all about China</p><p>                        On the security front, discerning Trump\u2019s approach and potential implications is more complex. On one hand, Trump is deeply sceptical of alliances, often accusing US allies of \u201cfree riding\u201d on America\u2019s defence commitments. This approach threatens the sustainability of the expanded network of US alliances and minilateral coalitions in Asia that Biden has spent years cultivating. </p><p>Manila may need to recalibrate its hardline stance towards China or establish more safeguards to avoid a conflict outbreak, because Trump 2.0 will be less inclined to come to Manila\u2019s rescue in such an event.</p><p>                        The Philippines, in particular, stands to be most impacted. In recent years, it has significantly\u00a0strengthened its alliance\u00a0with the US and joined multiple plurilateral arrangements involving the US and other allies such as Japan and Australia. Manila may need to recalibrate its hardline stance towards China or establish more safeguards to avoid a conflict outbreak, because Trump 2.0 will be less inclined to come to Manila\u2019s rescue in such an event.</p><p>                        On the other hand, balance of power has been central to the US\u2019s strategic competition with China. Recognising this reality, Trump 1.0 invested in building security-defence ties with key Southeast Asian nations. For instance, it transferred two Coast Guard cutters to help bolster Vietnam\u2019s maritime capabilities. </p><p>                        In 2018, the USS\u00a0Carl Vinson\u00a0became the first American aircraft carrier to visit Vietnam since the Vietnam War, followed by the USS\u00a0Theodore Roosevelt\u00a0in 2020. The US also renewed crucial defence agreements with Singapore, including the 2019 memorandum of understanding to extend the use of the island\u2019s air and naval bases by 15 years. </p><p>                        The first Trump administration also raised its stakes in the South China Sea (SCS) by\u00a0significantly increasing\u00a0US freedom of navigation operations in SCS to challenge excessive maritime claims. In 2020, the US State Department issued an important policy\u00a0statement\u00a0regarding maritime claims in the SCS, aligning US policy with the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in favour of the Philippines against China.</p><p>                        Chinese Coast Guard vessels fire water cannons towards a Philippine resupply vessel Unaizah May 4 on its way to a resupply mission at Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, on 5 March 2024.</p><p>                        The hard-line approach focused on balancing against China will likely intensify in Trump 2.0, given the China hawks potentially forming his national security team, including Vice-President-elect JD Vance, incoming national security adviser\u00a0Mike Waltz, and\u00a0figures\u00a0like Robert O\u2019Brien,\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0or Bill Hagerty. It bears reminding that the paradigm shift in the US\u2019s China policy from engagement to strategic competition started under Trump 1.0, and has now become an organising principle of US foreign policy.</p><p>                        That said, Trump could inject significant uncertainty into this dynamic. His penchant for \u201cdeal-making\u201d raises concerns that he might strike deals with China on issues like Taiwan or the SCS, bypassing regional countries\u2019 interests. Southeast Asia, therefore, continues to oscillate between potentially being drawn into the escalating US-China tensions or potentially being left in the lurch by Trump\u2019s isolationist and unilateralist instincts.</p><p>Singapore supports 270,000 \u201chigh-quality jobs\u201d in the US and is a key gateway for 6,000 American firms in Southeast Asia. Often unsaid but critically, Singapore plays a crucial role in the projection of US power in the region.</p><p>                        The three \u2018Ts\u2019 of managing Trump: trade, transactionalism and team America</p><p>                        Ultimately, no one can be certain as to what Trump would do, given his mercurial nature. But a reasonable assessment is that his approach towards Southeast Asia countries could boil down to a Trumpian triumvirate of \u201cTs\u201d: their trade relations with the US, transactionalism (how Trump assesses a partner country pays its fair share for American defence guarantees), and how far they can align with Team America in its objectives vis-\u00e0-vis China.</p><p>South Korea is a good example. Given its growing\u00a0trade surplus\u00a0with the US, Seoul is considering\u00a0increasing energy imports\u00a0from the US. In October, Trump labelled South Korea a \u201cmoney machine\u201d which could pay US$10 billion annually for hosting US troops. To pre-empt Trump, Seoul recently agreed to raise the figure by 8.3% to US$1.13 billion in 2026 \u2014 though still well below Trump\u2019s figure.</p><p>                        Going by the three \u201cTs\u201d, Southeast Asian countries could see varying fortunes. Non-US allies or those with trade deficits or small surpluses with the US may fly under the radar. Singapore could be well-positioned: it ran a\u00a0US$40 billion trade deficit\u00a0with the US in 2022, and is the third-largest Asian investor in the US. As\u00a0Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\u00a0noted in his congratulatory message to Trump, Singapore supports 270,000 \u201chigh-quality jobs\u201d in the US and is a key gateway for 6,000 American firms in Southeast Asia. Often unsaid but critically, Singapore plays a crucial role in the projection of US power in the region.</p><p>                        A man jogs along the promenade near the financial business district in Singapore on 14 October 2024.</p><p>                        The cases of the Philippines and Vietnam will be more intriguing. The Biden administration\u2019s planned\u00a0US$500 million\u00a0to boost Manila\u2019s military capabilities, on top of US$1.14 billion of US military assistance from 2015-2022,\u00a0may not sit well with Trump. Meanwhile, Vietnam had the\u00a0third-largest trade surplus\u00a0with the US last year, after China and Mexico. Yet, both countries are on the frontlines of the SCS disputes, hence their value to the US\u2019 strategic competition with China. Will they receive a pass due to their geopolitical importance?</p><p>                        Southeast Asian countries navigated Trump 1.0 relatively well and hope they can do the same with Trump 2.0. However, the region should guard against complacency because Trump 2.0 will be far more emboldened and unrestrained. Southeast Asian leaders should leverage their pragmatism, build a good rapport with Trump, and avoid ideological posturing or virtue signalling, as European counterparts often do. While no preparation can fully account for what\u2019s ahead, resilience, adaptability and a cool head will be key to weathering the Trumpian storm.</p><p>                        This article was first published in\u00a0Fulcrum, ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute\u2019s blogsite.</p><p>                        Related: Bracing for Trump 2.0: A world on edge | Tommy Koh: Trump\u2019s second term and its implications for Singapore and ASEAN | Bilahari Kausikan: What does the American presidential election mean for Singapore and Asia?</p><p>                        A woman flies flags from the bed of her pick-up truck outside US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, US, on 11 November 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-5337672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDP-TBP1-DXX5-V2D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The rise in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has led to unprecedented changes in Earth's climate system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world over, many tech entrepreneurs are working to mitigate the impact of climate change, and they need support and capital to achieve their mission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Radical Fund is an investor helping climate-tech companies with capital and guidance in Southeast Asia (SEA). The fund invests in early-stage disrupters.</p><p>In an interview with e27, The Radical Fund Managing Partner and CEO Alina Truhina delves into the fund's unique approach to identifying and nurturing ventures aligned with the climate resilience needs of SEA. With a focus on scaling businesses for impactful climate solutions, Truhina outlines the rigorous criteria used to select founders and ventures, emphasising a tailored, hands-on approach post-investment.</p><p>Edited excerpts:</p><p>What specific criteria do you use to identify founders and ventures that are aligned with the climate resilience needs of Southeast Asia?</p><p>The Radical Fund invests in entrepreneurs and business models that can scale. A scaling business is the best engine for impact; it delivers a self-financing economic model with capacity and inclination towards innovation and adaptation.</p><p>To achieve this, we seek and identify local entrepreneurs with a personal connection to the opportunity and the drive and ambition to conquer a scaled addressable market.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/new-year-new-funding-strategies-powering-up-sustainability-tech-startups-20240213/\">New year, new funding strategies: Powering up sustainability tech startups</url></p><p>Every business in our portfolio is evaluated for its potential to drive climate resilience in Southeast Asia. We measure this in three ways:</p><p>The entrepreneur's prior experience in and openness and commitment to the issue,</p><p>The setting of clear and defensible metrics that estimate and validate the venture's potential to drive climate mitigation/adaptation,</p><p>The designing of tactical solutions to reach those metrics by aligning the business model and value chain to the climate goals.</p><p>Specifically, we focus on/ look for:</p><p>1. Founders/founding team : Early-stage investing requires a heavy reliance on identifying founders as there is often a lack of historical performance data:</p><p>Personal motivation and connection to the solution are critical. Being a founder is hard, and personal motivation is key in providing drive in the hardest moments.</p><p>Domain and sector expertise : we seek deep experts, not all-rounders, who can deliver unique solutions to exceptional problems.</p><p>Empathic strong leaders : we believe in entrepreneurs who can understand the needs of all their stakeholders (customers, employees, investors, etc.) and chart a direct and efficient path to success. We seek founding teams who approach building a business with a user-centric, not technology-first, approach (iteration, agility, customer centricity, etc.)</p><p>Coachability : we seek entrepreneurs who are lifetime learners and open to radically transparent feedback.</p><p>2. Scaled commercial opportunity : In evaluating a business's potential, we look at the total addressable market (TAM), unit economics and margins, MOAT, and cap table for incentivisation. We also seek and validate user demand and product-to-market fit.</p><p>3. Climate potential : We unpack whether the venture already has - or has the potential to have \u2013 climate impact in SEA. We look at the specific applicability of opportunities to SEA through 3 main lenses:</p><p>Is SEA the primary or significant strategic geography where the venture's climate impact occurs or could occur in the future?</p><p>How important is it to SEA based on the sectors with the most emissions and/or adaptation potential?</p><p>Is the solution contributing to an inclusive climate transition (affordability, accessibility)?</p><p>How do you ensure that the ventures you invest in address the unique challenges communities face in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia?</p><p>The Radical Fund starts with selecting the founders and ventures that can show their understanding of the unique challenges faced by communities across SEA:</p><p>SEA investment focus : we are uniquely focused on founders building and scaling ventures in Southeast Asia. This means that, unlike other funds, we do not invest in US or European companies and expect them to expand to SEA.</p><p>Evaluation of the problem-solution fit : in our due diligence, we evaluate the extent to which the founding team understands the specific challenges of their market and customer. This is critical to us, and one of the most important aspects that we review is whether the founding team has done enough validation and can prove that the problem they are trying to solve is real (this is called \"problem-solution fit\").</p><p>Local founders : We also have a significant bias toward local founders \u2013 this means that the entrepreneur was either born and raised in the SEA market or has spent a significant amount of time here and understands the specific geographic, social and sector nuances.</p><p>Post-investment, we ensure we support our companies in a very tailored and hands-on manner:</p><p>Our hyper-localised approach is strategic: our team is embedded into the local ecosystems of each market to source and originate deals, as well as to support then the ventures post-investment across all aspects of the ventures' needs:</p><p>Climate management; product, growth, and talent; commercial and business model design; commercial partnerships; investment; governance and financials; operations.</p><p>For example, our Chief Product Officer works closely with our ventures to support them with getting to product-to-market-fit faster, which means understanding the users of the communities and their specific needs;</p><p>Another example is that our Head of Climate works closely with our founders to ensure we capture and design the relevant climate management frameworks and KPIs that help the founding team address the country's most appropriate climate needs.</p><p>Can you provide examples of successful ventures in your portfolio that have demonstrated a strong understanding of their target market's needs and behaviours?</p><p>One of The Radical Fund's recent investments is Arkadiah Technology:</p><p>A seed-stage nature technology company that uses AI to fuse lidar and remote sensing to bring transparency and traceability to unlock nature as an investment asset in Asia, delivering high-quality carbon/nature credits, community impact and investment returns.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/arkadiah-secures-seed-funding-for-ai-driven-nature-restoration-solution-20240125/\">Arkadiah secures seed funding for AI-driven nature restoration solution</url></p><p>Arkadiah operates across Singapore and Indonesia and will soon be in the Philippines and Malaysia.</p><p>Arkadiah's platform was purpose-built to cover Southeast Asia's rich biodiversity and landscape. Its founding team is local and consists of practitioners and experts in reforestation and landscape restoration, ecology, geospatial technology and software development.</p><p>How do you evaluate the scalability potential of the solutions proposed by the ventures you invest in?</p><p>We analyse the following elements:</p><p>Differentiation of the product/service - the moat of the business</p><p>Unit economics/commercial model</p><p>Business model (e.g. B2B/asset light/capex heavy, etc.)</p><p>Current and prospective primary and secondary customers/users</p><p>Current and future market expansion opportunities (market size)</p><p>Regulatory tailwinds (in SEA).</p><p>Could you elaborate on the types of new business models that your ventures are exploring to address climate resilience in Southeast Asia?</p><p>Deeptech/IP-led businesses</p><p>Business model innovation</p><p>Examples of business models:</p><p>Marketplaces</p><p>Software and data</p><p>Manufacturing</p><p>Retailing</p><p>SaaS</p><p>Distribution-based business model</p><p>Project management</p><p>Resource Management</p><p>What strategies do you employ to support ventures in achieving mass adoption of their solutions within the region?</p><p>The Radical Fund helps our entrepreneurs understand their market in direct ways that deliver unexpected insights and stimuli that create unique solutions and strategies. Through a combination of human-centred research, on-the-ground technical expertise, and creativity, we enable our portfolio to grow beyond just our capital investment.</p><p>Specifically, we push our founders to think narrowly about achieving product-to-market fit while maintaining an eye on the scale (TAM, unit economics, distribution partnerships, etc.). We work in sprints, aligning outcomes with cash flow and funding, and only pivot when the data supports the need.</p><p>We also work hard to help the entrepreneur see their pathways to scale. In general, after reaching product-to-market fit, we believe that businesses scale in one of two ways: product/service extension and new markets. This choice is often overlooked and mishandled.</p><p>Perhaps the most important support The Radical Fund provides is in being the entrepreneur's partner. Being a leader is a lonely role, and we work hard to remove that pressure. Beyond a sense of community, we try to give the entrepreneur the sense of controlling time rather than time controlling them. We do this through careful planning, prioritising outcomes to deliver sustained capital investment, and identifying and engaging unexpected risks.</p><p>Can you explain how you facilitate the entry of ventures into new markets within Southeast Asia?</p><p>Our model rests on the principle that our team is local, which means we have an on-the-ground presence in several of SEA's markets (and will soon be in the majority). We facilitate expansion and entry into new markets through:</p><p>Business growth strategy : we define their expansion strategy with the founders. See above Q on strategies for scale.</p><p>Product &amp; growth : we support testing and validating with customers in the new market. This is critical, as it would define the venture's market entry strategy and positioning.</p><p>Operations &amp; talent : we support defining the right talent and hiring plant (including which roles to hire when), and also help with actual recruitment of the team in new markets.</p><p>Network : our LPs and partners are in each market.</p><p>How do we work with ventures on their climate strategies?</p><p>The Radical Fund diagnoses their needs and level of \"climate maturity\" pre-investment so that post-IC, we can develop tailored approaches and plans for each company. This could be developing clear KPIs and climate metrics (GHG emissions reduced or dollars saved due to avoiding losses, for example) and/or developing a clear climate strategy for avoiding unintended negative impacts throughout the business's value chain.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-key-to-tackling-climate-change-electrify-shipping-20230127/\">The key to tackling climate change: Electrify shipping</url></p><p>This is part of our value creation and portfolio management and is closely aligned with and embedded with the commercial growth of the business \u2013 we believe that the companies that can scale significantly are commercially viable and will have the greatest chance of delivering scaled climate outcomes in the region.</p><p>How do you determine the appropriate ticket size and investment instruments (SAFE notes, direct equity, grants) for each venture in your portfolio?</p><p>Each venture and founder is different, so we take an individualised approach to every company. This means that some pre-seed ventures may need a SAFE note based on their maturity and stage of venture development, while those that raised previous rounds may be ready for a priced equity round. We also work closely with all of our co-investors, which means we consider their requirements. We lead, as well as follow, depending on the deal.</p><p>Overall, the main principles behind our decisions are:</p><p>i) Does this make sense for the founders, and does this set them up for success, based on what we have learned about them in due diligence?</p><p>ii) Does this make sense for us as investors in our conviction of the venture's growth and, therefore, future exits and returns from the company as it scales?</p><p>We usually invest on average US$250,000 at pre-seed, US$500,000 at seed, and up to US$850,000 at pre-Series A, but there are always exceptions.</p><p>-</p><p>X marks Echelon.

With rapid urbanisation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/sustainable-urbanisation-decarbonising-sea-s-built-environment.html\">over 100 million people are projected to migrate to cities by 2030. While these urban dwellers will be an important catalyst for economic expansion, they will also be contributors to an unprecedented surge in energy demand - projected at a staggering</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/sustainable-urbanisation-decarbonising-sea-s-built-environment.html\">42 per cent increase anticipated over the next decade.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin challenges of the built environment sector in SEA</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The built environment is one of the planet's most pollutive sectors. It currently accounts for approximately <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/2022-global-status-report-buildings-and-construction\">39 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Despite the urgency to address climate change, obstacles persist. Escalating energy price volatility and rising interest rates hinder investments in building decarbonisation efforts.</url></p><p>As a consequence, the sector is v <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/2022-global-status-report-buildings-and-construction\">eering off course from its decarbonisation pathway and is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 without immediate and decisive action, The gap between actual climate performance and the necessary trajectory for decarbonisation continues to widen.</url></p><p>SEA is also particularly vulnerable to climate change, facing rising temperatures and sea levels. While decarbonising buildings toward net-zero emissions remains a significant challenge, the accelerating impact of climate change on our cities and homes is deeply concerning, including rising mean and variance of temperature, increased precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and solar radiation.</p><p>Globally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/april-2024-was-earths-warmest-on-record\">April 2024 sets a new record as the hottest month ever recorded, marking the 11th consecutive month of unprecedented global warmth. The region's extensive coastlines and low-lying areas make us susceptible to extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and heatwaves. These events pose threats to environmental degradation, exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions, impact economic productivity, and endanger human health and safety. The</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/extreme-heat-continues-to-scorch-large-parts-of-asia\">escalating temperatures drive excessive air-conditioning use, further contributing to global warming.</url></p><p>In Jakarta,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44636934\">excessive groundwater extraction is causing the city to sink, prompting the government to relocate its capital. In Singapore, the government has established a</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-first-of-coastal-protection-studies-to-commence-this-year-jurong-island-east\">US$5 billion fund to mitigate coastal erosion and flooding risks. The Philippines government's Department of Environment and Natural Resources has also completed</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechange.denr.gov.ph/\">resilience roadmaps for 16 vulnerable areas to guide disaster risk management and climate resilience efforts.</url></p><p>Regulations and certifications in built environment space</p><p>Given the significant challenges related to decarbonisation and climate resilience faced by the built environment sector, SEA lacks mandatory building regulations, contributing to slow progress in decarbonising the built environment. However, the situation is gradually changing.</p><p>Green building certifications, such as the Green Building Index, Green Real Estate, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and BREEAM are gaining traction. These certifications evaluate the sustainability attributes of buildings and provide recognition for environmentally responsible practices.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/balancing-act-carbon-balances-quest-to-tackle-climate-crises-with-tech-driven-sustainability-20240202/\">Balancing act: Carbon Balance's quest to tackle climate crises with tech-driven sustainability</url></p><p>They assess various criteria, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, waste management, and occupant health and well-being. Although these certifications are primarily voluntary, the demand for them is increasing for several reasons:</p><p>Sustainability policy of tenants: Companies and individuals are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their actions, leading to a rising demand for sustainable practices, including green buildings. This trend is particularly driven by global Fortune 500 companies, where institutional shareholders demand greater sustainability practices that trickle down to procurement functions when in search of real estate offices. Moreover, leading regional enterprises are also adopting these practices to attract institutional investors and retain their best employees.</p><p>Availability of green loans: Building construction is a competitive and capital-intensive industry where access to affordable labour, materials, and financing is essential for profitability and success. The availability of green loans with lower interest rates encourages developers to construct new green buildings. The Malaysian government actively promotes green building investment through policies and schemes, such as the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidb.gov.my/eng/green-buildings-in-malaysia-increasing-demands-for-sustainable-practices/\">Green Technology Financing Scheme, which incentivises sustainable practices.</url></p><p>Lower operating expenses: Potential savings from efficient operations serve as an attractive incentive for tenants. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting make up 60-70 per cent of energy costs. Hence, energy-efficient designs, renewable energy sources and smart technologies in these areas can reduce utility bills for occupants in the long term. In an economic environment marked by high cost of capital and cost cutting, lower operating expenditures could better retain tenants.</p><p>Green buildings, certified by third parties, represent valuable assets and attractive business opportunities. They have the potential to generate higher revenue by attracting and retaining high-quality multinational clients.</p><p>Additionally, their lower operating costs, thanks to more efficient use of energy, and reduced cost of financing, drive further demand and innovation for building decarbonisation and climate resilience.</p><p>Therefore, it is no secret that such coveted certifications are highly sought after by real estate owners like Capitaland, Ayala Land and IJM Land. A portfolio of green buildings is now considered a compelling and fast-growing business segment.</p><p>To be clear, they are not perfect either. According to a report 'Seeing is Believing, Unlocking the Low-Carbon Real Estate Market' by  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/\">Systemiq released in June 2024, it identifies two major issues with 3rd-party certifications and ratings:</url></p><p>Inconsistency with decarbonisation pathways: Analysis showed that there is no clear correlation between certified assets and better energy performance, indicating potential gaps in these independent assessments. Many of these tools do not have a target that is consistent with 1.5 degrees Celsius pathways.</p><p>Lack of transparency on carbon and energy performance: Major certification bodies offer limited insights into how their building portfolio performs against energy use and carbon emissions.</p><p>The implication is that such factors might be muting demand signals for low-carbon buildings, resulting in a lack of confidence to invest in truly sustainable buildings. However, this is changing and major certification bodies like LEED and BREEAM are updating their schemes to be more transparent and ambitious. While the progress is highly encouraging, there is still more to be done to be on track for the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway.</p><p>Decarbonising our building infrastructure</p><p>One critical area for achieving green building status involves reducing GHG emissions. These emissions from buildings can be categorised into two main aspects.</p><p>Source: Hello Tomorrow Asia Pacific</p><p>Embodied carbon emissions</p><p>These are emissions resulting from the raw material extraction, production, supply chain and installation of building materials such as cement, glass and steel structures. New building projects are estimated to generate approximately <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/system/builtenvironment/\">half of their emissions from embodied sources. Strategies for decarbonising embodied carbon emissions include offering substitutes for raw materials and adopting green building products such as green cement and steel.</url></p><p>Notably, this opportunity is massive at some US$20-30 billion in Southeast Asia, requiring significant capital expenditure and working capital. Therefore, venture capital investments alone will not suffice; debt and infrastructure funds will be necessary.</p><p>Some startups innovating in this space include:</p><p>Neocrete, a New Zealand startup, uses a proprietary additive to enhance concrete properties while reducing carbon footprint.</p><p>CarbonCure injects recycled CO2 into concrete during the mixing process and repurposes buildings as carbon storage.</p><p>H2 Green Steel is a Swedish startup that produces steel using hydrogen made from renewable energy instead of coal.</p><p>Despite their potential, these innovations currently come at a higher cost compared to conventional materials, necessitating further engineering and economies of scale to reduce costs for mass adoption.</p><p>Operating carbon emissions</p><p>These are emissions from building operations like energy consumption such as HVAC and lighting which collectively contribute to c.70 per cent of operating emissions. These operations contribute <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/system/builtenvironment/\">to the other half of emissions from the built environment. Decarbonising building operations presents a combination of asset-intensive and asset-light opportunities and represents a US$10-20 billion addressable market.</url></p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/on-the-sustainability-of-ai-why-measuring-digital-carbon-emissions-is-key-to-a-greener-future-20240604/\">On the sustainability of AI: Why measuring digital carbon emissions is key to a greener future</url></p><p>New HVAC systems such as district cooling require a significant upfront investment but there are also automation and optimisation software which can enhance the efficiency of traditional HVAC systems. Artificial intelligence and automation play enabling roles in enhancing real-time human comfort, optimisation and energy consumption efficiency.</p><p>Additionally, there is potential for creating carbon-negative operations such as the installation of solar panels on building surfaces using innovative photovoltaic technology to generate excess energy beyond immediate needs.</p><p>Notable homegrown startups in the region include:</p><p>uHoo specialises in indoor air quality and temperature monitoring to measure various air quality parameters ensuring a healthy and comfortable environment.</p><p>SensorFlow measures the energy consumption of boilers and chillers and correlates the measured consumption with heating and cooling demand.</p><p>Solano Energy deploys new energy assets forming a distributed energy resource management system enabling every building owner to produce and store renewable energy.</p><p>Despite these innovative solutions, challenges related to incentives and financing remain during implementation.</p><p>Building for a new climate norm</p><p>As temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, we must rethink and enable the design of our built environment. Unlike decarbonisation, strategies to defend against climate catastrophes require a comprehensive approach involving a broader range of stakeholders and public-private partnerships.</p><p>Policymakers: City officials, particularly in areas prone to climate disasters, must prioritise upgrading early warning and communication systems using digital infrastructure. Additionally, urban vegetation and improved water management strategies can help manage heat waves while enhancing coastal defences against rising sea levels. These measures not only protect communities but also improve urban liveability.</p><p>Building Managers: Given prolonged heat waves in Southeast Asia, building managers will face increased cooling demands and peak loads. The implementation of energy-efficient cooling systems and the adoption of smart building technologies will be crucial in reducing energy consumption and maintaining occupant comfort.</p><p>Construction companies and real estate developers: Architects and civil engineers should scrutinise new building designs and review existing material selection to withstand harsher environmental conditions. Project managers must also account for delays caused by extreme weather events, adjusting timelines and budgets accordingly.</p><p>Insurers and Financiers: They need to prepare for more frequent natural catastrophes by incorporating new longitudinal climate data into their underwriting frameworks. National grants may also be made available for disaster management and relief support for affected communities</p><p>Source: The implications of a changing climate for buildings</p><p>These are a new set of challenges that come with climate change. Fortunately, there are already startup founders with long-term vision who have been already working on these problem statements to tackle such opportunities.</p><p>Komunidad harnesses the power of data and analytics to help enterprises and governments tackle the risks of climate change.</p><p>Nafas provides businesses with a flexible &amp; data-driven way to provide healthy air quality to their employees and customers against low air quality.</p><p>IBISA's parametric insurance offers end-to-end resilience to protect businesses and communities against climate change-induced natural catastrophes.</p><p>It is essential to recognise that not all climate adaptation opportunities in the built environment are suitable for venture capital investments. Nature-based projects, such as urban vegetation and mangroves, play a crucial role in defending against extreme heat and coastal erosion. Infrastructure developments, like coastal walls and drainage systems, are equally important.</p><p>Professional services, such as innovative building designs and material selections by architects and civil engineers, contribute to the total solution universe but may not align with climate venture capital investments.</p><p>How VCs are catalysing innovation</p><p>The increasing prevalence of green buildings and challenges of climate change are opening up vast opportunities for sustainable innovation within the built environment sector across all areas like,</p><p>Embodied carbon emission</p><p>Operating carbon emission</p><p>Re-thinking building in a new climate norm</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/meet-the-4-sea-startups-of-pepsicos-climate-tech-accelerator-programme-20230627/\">Meet the 4 SEA startups of PepsiCo's climate tech accelerator programme</url></p><p>Consequently, this sector is drawing substantial venture capital investments to capitalise on this trend. For example:</p><p>Proptech and real estate VC fund Fifth Wall had closed  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220721005373/en/Fifth-Wall-Closes-500-Million-for-its-First-Climate-Fund\">US$500m for its 1st climate fund in 2022, underscoring the sector's potential impact on climate solutions.</url></p><p>Australia's proptech manager, Taronga Ventures, had closed  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perenews.com/apg-ivanhoe-backed-proptech-fund-to-close-at-200m/\">US$170m to focus on the ESG space, far exceeding its original target of US$50m. Their commitment highlights the growing interest in sustainable real estate solutions.</url></p><p>There is also no lack of successful startup stories:</p><p>Brimstone was selected by  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240325688385/en/Industrial-Demonstrations-Program-Selects-Brimstone-for-Transformational-189-Million-Federal-Investment-to-Decarbonize-Cement-Industry\">US DOE for an up to US$189m award to build a commercial-scale facility that will demonstrate the start-up's novel technology at scale for the very first time.</url></p><p>Closer to home, Accacia, an India-based decarbonisation platform for real estate and infrastructure, has closed a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techinasia.com/indiabased-accacia-bags-65m-real-estate-decarbonization-tool\">US$6.5m Pre-Series A round from Illuminate Finance, Accel and B Capital.</url></p><p>These opportunities coupled with strong macro and ESG tailwinds in Southeast Asia meant that the built environment will be one of the focus areas for our fund. Some of the key themes that are explored (non-exhaustive) may include:</p><p>Digitalisation: Deploying next-generation software to supplant outdated systems like building management systems.</p><p>AI-led optimisation and analytics: Empowering building managers to leverage AI for heightened energy efficiency, minimised waste, and optimised resource utilisation.</p><p>Material innovation: Introducing novel sustainable materials, including cooling-effect paints, transparent solar panels as glass substitutes, and carbon-negative cement.</p><p>Resource management: Covering critical areas such as energy storage, waste stream processing, indoor air quality and water conservation.</p><p>Hardtech: Investing in hardware advancements, including sophisticated sensors, IoT devices and solar panels to revolutionise the built environment.</p><p>Challenges in adopting innovative solutions</p><p>While clear problem statements, compelling business cases, and available solutions are essential, they do not always guarantee swift adoption in the built environment sector. This industry is notorious for its slow-moving momentum, which can be frustrating for startups and investors.</p><p>Some of the challenges include:</p><p>Legacy challenges: Many existing buildings and infrastructure operate on legacy systems. Integrating these systems seamlessly with new technology can be challenging. Retrofitting old buildings often proves to be more expensive than constructing new ones, especially in high-cost markets like Singapore-even after accounting for carbon emissions.</p><p>Lack of/inconsistent regulation: Inconsistent and unclear policies across the region hinder the creation of a robust incentive or penalty framework. Such a framework is crucial for accelerating the adoption of new technologies. Without regulatory alignment, stakeholders may hesitate to invest in innovative solutions.</p><p>Lengthy adoption cycles: Building materials like concrete and steel are critical for structural integrity. Replacing these conventional materials requires extensive testing to ensure strength, workability, and durability. Consequently, implementation cycles can become lengthy, delaying the adoption of alternative materials.</p><p>Economic challenges: Many new solutions haven't achieved the economies of scale necessary to compete with conventional materials in terms of cost. HVAC upgrades, for instance, are typically planned well in advance, leaving little room in the budget for exploring alternatives beyond fixed-asset schedules.</p><p>Lack of awareness: Stakeholders, ranging from building owners to occupants, may not fully grasp the benefits of green solutions or be aware of the available options. Some sustainable solutions are perceived as risky or unproven. Demonstrating their reliability and effectiveness is crucial for overcoming this perception.</p><p>In navigating these challenges, collaboration among industry players, policymakers, and investors is essential. By addressing these roadblocks collectively, we have a better chance to accelerate the adoption of innovative solutions and create a more sustainable built environment.</p><p>Partnership for win-win with Keppel</p><p>Given the aforementioned challenges and the nascency of the sector, The Radical Fund has partnered with Keppel Real Estate Group to tackle decarbonising the built environment sector.

But what of damage that eludes precise measure'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Two oil-slicked collared kingfishers, for example, died after they were rescued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is also not yet clear how Singapore's coral reefs, already weakened by a marine heatwave, could be affected by the incident in the longer term.</p><p> Marine Honour could be held accountable for the consequences.</p><p> But the quandary of how to price nature -- and whether that accurately reflects its value -- is one that a growing number of governments and companies are grappling with as awareness grows of humanity's reliance on nature, and the declining health of natural ecosystems. </p><p> \"Free of charge, nature provides countless services and resources that we depend on, such as fresh air and water,\" said Mr Vikalp Sabhlok of global environmental organisation The Nature Conservancy (TNC). </p><p> Yet, many of those resources are being recklessly depleted, with about a million plants and animals at risk of extinction, compromising the multitude of services that nature provides to humanity.</p><p> About US$44 trillion (S$57.4 trillion) of economic value generation -- a bit less than half the world's total gross domestic product in 2022 -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services, according to one estimate from the World Economic Forum.</p><p> \"These resources are often exploited because the true value of natural capital is not accounted for or priced into the markets -- this has clearly contributed to its deterioration,\" added Mr Sabhlok, who is the Asia-Pacific director of NatureVest, TNC's impact investing arm. </p><p> The United Nations has estimated that the biodiversity financing gap -- referring to the difference in the amount available for nature's protection currently and the amount needed -- to be at US$700 billion a year. </p><p> How this gap can be narrowed is expected to be a major theme in discussions at the COP16 UN biodiversity conference, to be held in Colombia, from Oct 21 to Nov 1. </p><p> The good news is that a bevy of financial schemes has blossomed in recent months to address this financing gap.</p><p> In July, for example, the US government said it would forgive US$35 million of Indonesia's debt over the next nine years in return for the latter undertaking coral reef conservation efforts. </p><p> And in August, the World Bank announced a US$225 million Amazon reforestation-linked outcome bond -- a new kind of bond that aims to save the Amazon rainforest by linking investors' financial returns to the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere. </p><p> There are others, too, including rhino bonds, coral reef bonds and blue bonds, which focus on financing freshwater or ocean-related sustainable projects. </p><p> Buyers of these bonds tend to be corporations. </p><p> The development of such novel financial products points to the growing involvement of the private sector in funding nature's conservation. </p><p> The business case for natureCorporate interest in nature is being driven by different factors, including the adoption of international agreements by countries, the growing understanding of how nature loss is affecting supply chains, as well as greater awareness about the interlinks between the climate and nature crises, say financial institutions, conservation groups and experts interviewed. </p><p> The adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022 -- UN treaties that require signatories to take action to cut emissions and protect nature -- has forced governments to implement stronger regulatory stances to prevent environmental decline. </p><p> For instance, England has a law that requires land developers to deliver a biodiversity net gain of 10 per cent -- meaning the development should result in more natural habitats or better quality ones than there was before development.</p><p> Companies are also increasingly facing pressure from regulators and customers to disclose their nature-related risks and impacts via reporting initiatives such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. </p><p> While usually voluntary, these developments have prompted the private sector to be more conscious of the impact of their business on the planet.</p><p> Nature's value to basic economics should not be underestimated.</p><p> Think about the necessity of healthy soils to growing crops -- from wheat to rice and palm oil. Or the role played by forests as sources of water for city reservoirs. Pollinators, including bees and butterflies, are also vital for crops. In South-east Asia, bats are important pollinators of the durian, the region's spiky delicacy. </p><p> As Ms Jan Yoshioka, vice-president of sustainable finance at non-profit organisation Conservation International's (CI) Asia-Pacific region, put it: \"It is in the self-interest of corporations to adopt environmentally and socially sustainable business practices and to invest in the conservation of the natural resources they depend on.\" </p><p> The realisation that healthy natural ecosystems are key to thriving businesses has put new wind in the sails of the nature conservation movement, widening the circle of those involved beyond just conservationists and governments to include the private sector too. </p><p> Mr Carlos Pagoaga, president of the Coca-Cola Foundation, said nature often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health and reducing water stress for communities.</p><p> \"The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners invest in nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management, which build on natural processes to manage water systems,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"Through this work, we recognise that nature-based solutions often have multiple co-benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration, increased climate resilience, and enhanced richness and variety of life of natural habitats,\" Mr Pagoaga added.</p><p> Do more with nature-based solutionsWhile the intention to contribute to nature's restoration is there, the question is how companies can do so in a more sustained manner than a one-time donation in the name of corporate social responsibility. </p><p> Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Singapore, said: \"In our current market environment, in order to ensure better conservation, we either have to put a price on nature or make it a rule -- or both.\"</p><p> Mr Sivaprasad, who is BCG's South-east Asia lead for climate and sustainability, added: \"This means defining the economic value of things like clean water, air, food security, carbon storage that are enabled by nature and/or creating government regulations that make conservation a requirement.\"</p><p> The close links between the climate and biodiversity crises mean that some financial instruments developed to help companies address climate change are also having positive effects on nature. </p><p> This is most clearly seen in the carbon markets. </p><p> Habitats such as forests and mangroves have the ability to sequester carbon -- or capture and store planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This locks the carbon away from the atmosphere, contributing to climate mitigation. </p><p> One carbon credit represents 1 tonne of planet-warming greenhouse gases that is either prevented from being released, such as when a forest is saved from the axe, or removed from the atmosphere, such as through a forest restoration project.</p><p> Mr Law Heng Dean, managing director of the Singapore office of the Pollination Group, a global climate change investment and advisory firm, said that nature-based solutions to sequester carbon or prevent it from being emitted in the first place could contribute to around 30 per cent of global mitigation needed to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement. </p><p> Companies buy carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint so that they can meet their commitments of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 -- the timeline that could help the world avoid the harshest impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate science body. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said a key driver of the increased interest shown by the private sector in nature is its demand for nature-based carbon credits. </p><p> And when companies buy carbon credits to meet their climate targets, nature reaps the dividends: In one area, a forest is saved from the axe. In another, a mangrove is restored. </p><p> Amid the growing consensus that the world cannot achieve net-zero emissions without nature-based solutions, private and public sectors are becoming increasingly involved in nature conservation, said Ms Hoon Ling Min, investment director at investment firm GenZero.</p><p> But between 2010 and 2022, voluntary carbon markets managed to unlock only a fraction of the potential of nature-based solutions, said Pollination's Mr Law. </p><p> Figures from Ecosystem Marketplace, a global environmental finance news and markets analysis site, show that the global voluntary carbon market was worth about US$2 billion in 2022. </p><p> This is nowhere near the US$700 billion the UN says is required every year for nature's protection. </p><p> For the nature funding gap to be narrowed, the private sector needs to be motivated to loosen their purse strings further.</p><p> \"Today, more than 80 per cent of finance to nature comes from public sources; private financing, whether by corporates or financial institutions, remains an under-tapped source,\" Mr Law noted.</p><p> Can companies be convinced that investing in nature is not just about meeting regulatory requirements or avoiding potential losses, but that it could actually help to turn a profit too? </p><p> People, profit and planet As nature's true value -- to lives, livelihoods and bottom lines -- starts to come into focus, attempts are now being made to put a price on nature. </p><p> This ability to capture value in instruments that can be invested in and traded is what the financial sector excels in, said GenZero's Ms Hoon. </p><p> Take, for example, the World Bank's rhino bond, which was issued in 2022 to increase the population of the critically endangered black rhinoceros, native to Africa. </p><p> The five-year US$150 million bond -- the first wildlife conservation bond of its kind -- will pay investors returns based on the rate of growth of black rhino populations at South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park and the Great Fish River Nature Reserve.</p><p> The bond was sold to institutional investors, such as investment firm Nuveen and Mackenzie Investments, and high-net-worth clients from Credit Suisse International and Citi private banking arms. </p><p> Similarly, a newly proposed Indonesia Coral Bond -- another initiative of the World Bank -- will see investors receiving a \"success payment\" at maturity.</p><p> Mr Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer at DBS Bank, said: \"Beyond providing essential funding, financial expertise is instrumental in developing innovative financial products that can support nature-based solutions.\"</p><p> Another instrument gaining traction is biodiversity credits.</p><p> These credits come from projects that seek to provide measurable improvements in biodiversity, be they focused on a specific species or across an entire ecosystem.</p><p> The credit is a certificate that a corporate buys representing a specific outcome, such as a measurable improvement to a hectare of forest over 10 years. </p><p> For example, Colombian project developer Terrasos has issued credits that each represents the protection of 10 sq m of conserved or restored ecosystems in a high-conservation area of Colombia for 30 years. </p><p> \"Governments are interested in leveraging biodiversity credits as a mechanism to help drive private sector investment into positive outcomes for nature,\" said Ms Laura Waterford, executive director at the Pollination Group in Australia. </p><p> Corporates and financial institutions were also starting to think about buying biodiversity credits on a voluntary basis as part of their broader nature strategies, she added.  </p><p> Ultimately, the goal is to have a global market in tradeable biodiversity credits, though this will take some more time, given the complexity of measuring the benefits. Ms Waterford said the foundations for effective voluntary biodiversity credit markets could be in place by 2030. </p><p> The pricing complex The emergence of innovative financial instruments like rhino bonds can help to unlock new sources of funding from the private sector for nature's conservation, since firms now have a financial -- not just regulatory -- incentive to do so. </p><p> But these tend to be project-specific, and are challenging to implement on a wider scale. </p><p> Observers point to a few obstacles to scaling them up: the difficulty in measuring impact; the uniqueness and complexities of each and every ecosystem, which makes it difficult to develop replicable models that can be implemented quickly across different regions; and the difference in timelines for nature's recovery against investor expectations. </p><p> \"Where there is a globally agreed upon unit for measuring emissions, reductions and removals, there is currently no common unit of measurement for nature and biodiversity,\" said CI's Ms Yoshioka. </p><p> For carbon credit projects, the unit of measure appears to be straightforward. </p><p> Closing down a coal plant in favour of a solar farm prevents the release of a quantifiable amount of carbon dioxide. </p><p> But developments over the past two years have shown that even the suggestion that a carbon project will not truly deliver climate benefits -- such as carbon credits sold for protecting a forest that was at low risk of being cut down in the first place -- can send carbon markets into turmoil, as buyers fear accusations of greenwashing and reputational backlash. </p><p> This has triggered a major shift towards stronger standards and methodologies that back only high-quality carbon projects -- a much-needed reset for the market, experts say. </p><p> Measuring the impacts of a conservation initiative is much more complicated. </p><p> For example, should the focus be across an entire ecosystem or habitat or specific species? Or should protecting what is left be prioritised, over restoring the degraded parts of the land? </p><p> DBS' Mr Muenkel pointed to how nature conservation projects are influenced by unique cultural, societal and environmental factors. </p><p> Restoring a mangrove in Indonesia, for example, would be vastly different from doing the same in India or Colombia, owing to different species compositions, different drivers of deforestation, different environmental conditions and so on. </p><p> Yet, being able to measure outcomes of conservation interventions will be critical to get investor buy-in. </p><p> \"Scientific robustness, impact measurement and risk management are some of the key factors considered by private entities and financial institutions before making a decision on biodiversity-linked financial products,\" Mr Muenkel said.</p><p> Monitoring mechanisms are also needed to measure the impact of conservation efforts, and independent third-party verification processes help to prevent greenwashing and manage any related reputational risks, he added. </p><p> The Coca-Cola Company, for example, said it is partnering with other organisations to develop a methodology to help it quantify and test the co-benefits of nature-based projects, which can help to provide a means to value social return on investment. This, said a spokesperson, can help to build the business case for nature-based solutions. </p><p> This is all part of efforts by academic institutions, companies and standards bodies to develop common frameworks to govern biodiversity investments to ensure they boost nature, can bring social benefits and that this can be measured and verified. </p><p> Further complicating the situation is that nature's progress is oblivious to investor timelines. </p><p> Mr Mike Ng, group chief sustainability officer at OCBC Bank, said: \"Some nature-related projects also come with long timelines and uncertainty, which may require longer financing timelines than traditional loan tenures. These factors contribute to the lack of bankability for nature conservation projects globally.\" </p><p> A coral reef, for example, can take up to 10,000 years to develop. As the reef accretes, habitat complexity deepens -- providing creatures like shrimp, baby fish and flatworms -- with nooks and crannies to hide and rest in. </p><p> But if that reef is destroyed by trawling or bomb fishing, and reef restoration efforts are needed to help it recover, how long would it take to restore the life that it once held? </p><p> Overcoming roadblocks Despite -- or perhaps because of -- these challenges, new schemes that attempt to put a price on nature continue to bloom. </p><p> One area being explored is to leverage the success of the carbon market and tie biodiversity benefits more closely to carbon financing. </p><p> Carbon credit projects have benefited nature and developing nations for decades, said Mr Duncan van Bergen, co-founder of Calyx Global, which rates carbon credit projects. </p><p> He added that recent innovations focusing on shoring up the climate integrity of credits will help the market scale up, \"maximising its impact and enabling companies to participate with greater assurance\". </p><p> In other words, buyers want to be certain that credits can hold up to scrutiny. Add in nature and social benefits, such as health and education support for local communities, and it is a winning combination. </p><p> For any land-based carbon project, it is now mandatory to include biodiversity and community components, said Mr Pablo Fernandez, chief executive of ecosecurities, a global carbon project developer and advisory firm. </p><p> TNC and its Indonesian partner, Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara, are studying a project concept in East Kalimantan on Borneo island that would conserve a large area of forest but also generate money to compensate several land concession owners. </p><p> Revenue would come from sustainable timber production, carbon credits and payments for biodiversity conservation. </p><p> \"It is hard to change the behaviours in the landscape, whether that is corporate behaviour or a small holder or a government if you are not bringing a viable financial alternative to the table,\" said Mr Will McGoldrick, TNC's managing director for the Asia-Pacific. </p><p> Also in Indonesia, a new effort between CI and its local partner, Yayasan Konservasi Indonesia, aims to combine marine conservation with sustainable fishery practices under its Blue Halo S initiative. </p><p> A grant funding mechanism under the initiative, to be implemented from 2025 to 2031, has received interest from private sector groups, including fisheries and aquaculture technology start-ups, business incubators and impact investors. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said: \"The (grant facility) aims to improve the climate resilience of around 162,000 Indonesian coastal communities while contributing to the sequestration of more than half a million tonnes of... emissions through restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove and seagrass, and improved management of marine protected areas.\"</p><p> Another idea to bridge commercial returns with societal benefits is that of ecotourism, said BCG's Ms Alia Kaz, a knowledge expert in sustainability. </p><p> Scientists, ecologists and organisations involved in nature conservation usually focus on improving a public good. \"They are often funded on the basis of grants with no or limited expectation of economic return. Their work results in societal returns, not commercial returns,\" she said. </p><p> \"But individuals in the private sector and financial sector are measured on commercial returns,\" Ms Kaz added. \"Nature conservation can generate ecotourism and ecotourism-related revenues.\"</p><p> Reining in destructionIncreasing funding for nature conservation, however, is just one part of the picture. </p><p> Figures show that the world is spending much more on activities that damage nature. For one thing, subsidies that drive the destruction of nature -- such as tax breaks and cheap diesel that fail to account for the cost of environmental damage from the fossil fuel, agriculture, water and forestry sectors -- amount to an estimated US$1.8 trillion, a study in 2022 found.</p><p> Activities that cause harm to nature and the subsidies they receive must also be re-evaluated, said Dr Francesco Ricciardi, an environmental specialist working at a developmental organisation. </p><p> Speaking in his personal capacity, Dr Ricciardi said he is doubtful the market can solve environmental issues, since much of nature's degradation is the result of the pursuit for economic growth. </p><p> \"Mining, building roads in pristine rainforests to push mining and logging interests, constructing large dams that bring fish to extinction, these are all still happening now in a bid for more economic growth,\" he said. </p><p> The global reckoning of the value of nature must also consider that the cost of destroying nature -- whether it be clearing a forest for a plantation, discharging pollution into a freshwater stream or spilling oil into the ocean -- is no longer free.</p><p> To move the nature needle, said TNC's Mr McGoldrick, the right regulatory environment is critical. </p><p> \"You have to get the government policy settings right to both incentivise the right type of investment, but also limit or prevent the wrong type of investment,\" he added. </p><p> Where the private sector can come in is in the realm of innovation.</p><p> Dr Alfredo Giron Nava, head of the Ocean Action Agenda at the World Economic Forum, said: \"We cannot achieve the scale needed to increase financing for nature without the private sector. There simply isn't enough development or philanthropic money.\" </p><p> What is needed is a common language between the profit-driven motives of the private sector and conservationists, he added.</p><p> \"Our job is to come up with realistic models, and collaborate with one another to create them, to show that there can be models that are good for nature, are good for business too,\" said Dr Nava. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>After a collision on June 14, Singapore- flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour's damaged cargo tank leaked oil into the sea.

Health professionals in Singapore deeply echo this view, as 82% of them support action towards a more sustainable healthcare system. At the same time, two-thirds believe that Singapore should be a role model for the international community - according to findings from a research survey commissioned by the Centre for Sustainable Medicine (CoSM), Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To facilitate this into action, the CoSM at NUS Medicine hosted its inaugural public plenary at its launch, serving as a platform in which local leaders, and distinguished guests from the Lancet Commission on Sustainable Healthcare (LCSH) shared about steps towards a sustainable, carbon-free healthcare system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the first research centre in Asia and the largest in the world to lead and support healthcare decarbonisation and climate resilience, the CoSM at NUS Medicine will be the vanguard of an emerging multidisciplinary field of practice dedicated to improving the health of our patients in the face of climate change, and driving the transition to net zero healthcare.</p><p>Under the theme \"Driving Net Zero Healthcare in Asia and Across the World\", Yong Loo Lin</p><p>School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine) held a Panel discussion at Singapore's NUHS featuring local and international leaders from healthcare, health policy, and the sustainability sectors. Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, had graced the event in support of the launch of the CoSM and its inaugural public plenary. Biospectrum Asia explored this crucial topic further with Professor Nick Watts, Director, Centre for Sustainable Medicine (CoSM), Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine).</p><p>How do you define the urgency of climate action in healthcare? How significant is Singapore's launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine to support the cause?</p><p>Climate change is the biggest health threat of the 21st century. It will impact our ability to deliver care and it will increase the need for healthcare. As a result, if we're not careful, we will see further increase in healthcare-related emissions. Singapore, like the rest of Asia-Pacific, is seeing an increase in the effects of climate change that lead to direct impacts on health, like vector-borne diseases and heat-related illnesses. Climate change is also causing more wildfires which are worsening ambient air quality. We have seen, during periods of transboundary air pollution from forest fires, substantial increases in asthma-related presentations. Singapore's launch of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine (CoSM) is highly significant as it addresses this urgency by integrating sustainability into medical education, research, and policy, thereby fostering a culture of sustainability within healthcare.</p><p>The CoSM will pioneer and lead the health profession's response to climate change in Singapore, Asia and across the world. The Centre is dedicated both to decarbonising healthcare and developing climate resilient health systems to accelerate the transition to net zero.</p><p>During the inaugural public plenary held on 13th March 2024, held as part of the official launch of the Centre, we had over 375 attendees. This speaks to the urgency that health professionals in Singapore feel in relation to climate change, and their willingness to be part of the solution.</p><p>As the first research centre in Asia and the largest in the world, how will CoSM lead and support healthcare decarbonisation and climate resilience?</p><p>The Centre for Sustainable Medicine aims to deliver change in healthcare sustainability through:</p><p>Preparing and training future healthcare leaders by:</p><p>Transforming medical education and embedding sustainable clinical practice as a core foundation into everything we teach</p><p>Empowering the next wave of health leadership, with advanced educational opportunities for senior health and sustainability professionals</p><p>Providing the practical tools to support clinical and policy decision making towards sustainable, net zero healthcare.</p><p>Accelerating the delivery of net zero healthcare by:</p><p>Providing direct analytical and decision-support for health policymakers and health systems responding to climate change across Asia</p><p>Utilising our delivery and analytical expertise to broker trust and assurance between clinicians, Governments, and industry partners</p><p>Growing the field of sustainable medicine with opportunities for clinicians at every stage in their journey to engage in interdisciplinary research and direct service improvement;</p><p>Equipping clinicians with the best available evidence by:</p><p>Mapping the carbon impact of key clinical pathways, drugs, and medical devices to identify new opportunities for rapid decarbonisation</p><p>Bringing new approaches and methods to the field that leverage expertise from across artificial intelligence, digital healthcare, and the behavioural sciences.</p><p>How is the healthcare industry impacting climate change, and how does a warming planet exacerbate global inequality? Could a collective effort alleviate the burden?</p><p>Healthcare is a significant carbon emitter, contributing between 5-7% of global carbon emissions- that is more emissions than shipping and aviation combined. Health systems are exacerbating the threat to human health, undermining their central mission to deliver care for our patients and the public.</p><p>Greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare system come from a variety of sources. They come from the electricity that is purchased to power hospitals and healthcare centres - which are far more energy intensive than regular buildings, from petrol combusted in ambulances from transporting patients and staff to and from hospitals. A good chunk of carbon comes from the production and movement of drugs and medical supplies. Supply chains represent the most significant part of healthcare-related emissions, but the good news is that the healthcare industry is responding - quickly.</p><p>Anaesthetists are phasing out desflurane, an anaesthetic gas and increasingly replacing it with other clinically equivalent gases with a lower global warming potential. Our use of single-use items in clinical settings is also under increased scrutiny, and we're seeing innovations around this take place.</p><p>Climate change is an immense driver of global inequity. Wealthy nations, to some extent, will have the ability to adapt, but in no way can we completely adapt to unmitigated climate change. It is critical to adapt to the climate impacts that are coming at us, and to prepare our healthcare services to be able to continue delivering during acute events (i.e. floods, storms, supply chain or electrical grid disruptions, etc.) but also endure more chronic impacts.</p><p>A collective effort is absolutely necessary. What is promising is that various governments, health systems and health professionals are starting to organise towards seriously decarbonising, both from a top-down and bottom-up approach. They increasingly appreciate the significant cost savings and health co-benefits that decarbonisation will bring. Bearing witness to this in Singapore- in real time- is incredibly exciting. Markets respond acutely to these shifts. We have seen a sliver of this with inhaled anaesthetics, inhalers, single use devices etc; I trust we will continue to see more positive signals from an industry that indicate a desire to respond synergistically to these developments. After all, carbon literacy among health professionals is fast escalating, disclosure standards are increasingly rigorous; there will be less and less breathing space for greenwashing to exist comfortably, if at all.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from BioSpectrum Asia.

I thank the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), RX, sponsors and partners for the opportunity to join you at the International Built Environment Week Conference.</p><p>THRIVING IN A LOW-CARBON, CLIMATE-IMPAIRED WORLD</p><p>Let me begin with a quick reflection on the state of the planet. It is not in a good place. Climate change is already happening. We are seeing more extreme storms, floods, wildfires, and heat waves. 2024 could be the world's hottest year on record. Tropical cyclones are picking up more energy from warmer ocean waters and intensifying more quickly, leading to major floods. Droughts have become persistent across many parts of the world[1].</p><p>It will only get worse in the coming decades. To mitigate climate change, we need to limit global warming to 1.[5] degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius higher and are continuing to rise[2]. The main driver of global warming - the emission of greenhouse gases - is also continuing to rise. The climate crisis - and that is exactly what it is - is gathering pace.</p><p>To avert climate catastrophe, the world has been stepping up decarbonisation. As of June 2023, 149 countries have committed to achieve net-zero emissions[3]. In the advanced economies, emissions have fallen to their level of 50 years ago[4]. The share of renewables in global power generation has been growing over the years and surpassed 30% in 20235. The global demand for each fossil fuel - coal, oil, and natural gas - is expected to peak before 20306. Globally, investment in energy transition technologies has surged from US$240 billion in 2012 to US$1.8 trillion in 20237.</p><p>What do these two ongoing trends - climate change and decarbonisation - mean? It is likely that the world will accelerate the current pace of decarbonisation in the face of worsening climate change. We will not sit still. But it is also likely that decarbonisation will not occur at a fast enough pace to stop climate change. We will not act decisively.</p><p>We are thus looking at two scenarios co-existing: a low-carbon world and a climate-impaired world. These are the two futures that Singapore needs to prepare for.</p><p>Preparing for a low-carbon world is both an international obligation and an economic necessity. Two years ago, Singapore committed to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. We account for only 0.1% of global emissions but every country must do its part. The transition to a low-carbon world will likely entail the biggest economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. Those countries, industries, and businesses that successfully transition towards net-zero will thrive in a low-carbon world. Singapore must ensure that it is among these countries.</p><p>Preparing for a climate-impaired world is an existential issue for Singapore. We are vulnerable to rising sea levels. We are low-lying, with 30% of Singapore less than five metres above mean sea levels. We are vulnerable to severe heat stress. We are a densely populated tropical city subject to urban heat effects and high humidity. We must ensure that we remain a resilient, vibrant and liveable city in a climate-impaired world.</p><p>Finally, Singapore can and must play a constructive role in Asia's transition. Asia accounts for half of global emissions. To mitigate climate change, Asia needs to decarbonise, and the rest of the world must help it to do so. As an international business, financial, transportation and technological hub, Singapore can play a useful role in partnership with others to facilitate Asia's transition.</p><p>In short, we need to fight on three fronts: drive our own transition to net-zero; strengthen our resilience to climate change; and facilitate Asia's transition to a low-carbon future.</p><p>SINGAPORE'S TRIPLE TRANSITION</p><p>Today, I will focus on Singapore's transition to net-zero. In fact, our approach comprises three transitions: a carbon transition; an energy transition; and an economic transition.</p><p>The triple transition will require us to fundamentally rethink the way we produce and consume. I will discuss each transition in turn, using the built environment to illustrate.</p><p>Carbon Transition</p><p>Let me start with the carbon transition, to reduce primary carbon emissions to net-zero across all sectors. As of 2021, primary emissions, or emissions arising from non-electricity related activities, made up 60% of Singapore's total emissions. About 73% of these primary emissions come from industrial activity and 23% from transportation. Buildings account for about 1.5%, and households, waste and water, and others account for the rest.</p><p>The government has been working with various industries on decarbonisation plans and mitigation packages. For instance, we are piloting the use of carbon capture, storage, and utilisation technologies. We are also exploring the use of low-carbon hydrogen for industrial heating, which is a major source of emissions in the manufacturing sector. These efforts will take time. The technologies are nascent, and the cost implications are not trivial.</p><p>The land transportation sector's strategy for decarbonisation is based on cleaner energy and modal shift. For cleaner energy, we will cease the registration of new diesel cars and taxis from next year, and install 60,000 charging points for electric vehicles by 2030. As for modal shift, the aim is for mass public transport to make up 75% of travel at peak hours by 2030.</p><p>For the built environment, the Singapore Green Building Masterplan has set the target to green 80% of our buildings by 2030. To qualify as green, buildings not covered under existing Environmental Sustainability Regulations must be certified under the Green Mark scheme. To obtain Green Mark certification, a building will have to achieve required energy performance standards along with other good sustainability practices such as: one, conducting whole-of-life carbon assessments; two, significantly reducing the embodied carbon in the building's concrete, glass and steel; and three, publishing a transition plan that delineates the steps to deliver a net zero carbon building from 2030.</p><p>I am encouraged that building owners are taking decarbonisation seriously. For example, City Developments Limited has pledged to achieve net zero carbon by 2030 for all its wholly-owned buildings, through onsite or offsite renewable energy sources and carbon offsets. Lendlease, a multinational construction and real estate firm, has set targets to achieve net zero carbon by 2025, and absolute zero carbon - meaning without using offsets - by 2040.</p><p>Energy Transition</p><p>Next, the energy transition, to achieve a resilient net-zero electricity grid and enhance energy efficiency. Electricity generation accounts for about 40% of Singapore's total emissions. Of those emissions, the building sector accounts for nearly one-third. Reducing these emissions is a shared responsibility: the government must progressively shift to a cleaner energy mix at the production stage, while the private sector must enhance energy efficiency at the consumption stage.</p><p>Singapore faces significant disadvantages in producing clean energy. Our average wind speeds are below what is needed for commercial wind turbines. We have no river system with fast flowing water, limiting our hydroelectric potential. We have no conventional underground geothermal energy sources. Solar energy is the most promising option, but its scale is limited by Singapore's dense cloud cover and limited land. Even if we reach the full technical potential for solar deployment by 2050, it will barely meet 10% of our projected electricity demand.</p><p>But we are doing what we can, pursuing multiple avenues to a cleaner grid, while taking into account energy security and cost competitiveness.</p><p>First, we are trying to maximise solar energy through innovative deployment. Singapore is now home to one of the world's largest inland floating solar PV systems. The Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm comprises 122,000 solar panels and spans across an area of about 45 football fields.</p><p>Second, we are looking to import low-carbon electricity from our neighbouring countries. The Energy Market Authority has granted conditional licenses to import a total of 2 gigawatts from Indonesia. Conditional approvals have also been granted to projects importing electricity from Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Just yesterday, we announced that we will raise our ambition and seek to import [6] gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, up from 4 gigawatts previously.</p><p>Third, we are exploring hydrogen - and its derivatives such as ammonia - as a low-carbon energy source. Hydrogen is relevant for both our energy transition and carbon transition. As a low-carbon energy carrier, hydrogen produces electricity when combined with oxygen in a fuel cell or combusted in a gas turbine. As a low-carbon fuel, hydrogen can be used directly in many industrial processes and transportation. But the technologies to produce, transport, and use hydrogen are nascent and costly. To realise the potential of hydrogen, we are: bringing together academia and industry to scale up hydrogen R&amp;D, and forging international partnerships to build up hydrogen supply chains.</p><p>In particular, Singapore sees strong potential for ammonia - as a hydrogen carrier as well as a fuel for shipping and power. The Energy Market Authority and Maritime Port Authority are selecting a lead developer to provide an end-to-end low-carbon ammonia solution on Jurong Island. If successful, Singapore will be one of the first countries in the world to directly combust ammonia for power generation and deploy ammonia bunkering for international shipping.</p><p>Beyond producing cleaner energy, the energy transition is also about enhancing energy efficiency by users.</p><p>The Singapore Green Building Master Plan will hold buildings to high energy efficiency standards. From 2030, 80% of all new developments by gross floor area must achieve at least 60% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 levels. Achieving this standard will contribute towards eligibility for a bonus gross floor area incentive. Beyond this, BCA will support best-in-class buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 levels by 2030.</p><p>Achieving higher energy efficiency in buildings will require advances in automation systems. Conventional building automation systems are not intelligent enough to achieve multiple objectives like energy efficiency and occupant well-being. A so-called model predictive control solution can do much better, optimising and coordinating air-conditioning, ventilation, lighting and shading, to achieve energy savings of up to 60%. What started as a research project by the National Technological University has since been commercialised and deployed at several buildings, including Jurong Town Hall and the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base.</p><p>Economic Transition</p><p>The third transition is economic, to capture new green growth opportunities and restructure the economy to remain competitive in a low-carbon future. Decarbonisation will require broader changes in industrial structure, business processes, and workforce skills.</p><p>The economic transition is about greening the brown and growing the green. We have to progressively decarbonise hard-to-abate carbon-intensive sectors like semiconductors, chemicals, and maritime services. We also have to grow new green sectors like carbon services, green and transition finance, and green ecosystem enablers like Measurement, Reporting and Verification, or MRV, services. The low-carbon economy of the future is likely to look quite different from today.</p><p>Greening the brown is not just about decarbonising Scope 2 emissions but also Scope 3. With the International Sustainability Standards Board requiring Scope 3 reporting, the pressure on companies to clean up their supply chains will increase. In the built environment sector, Scope 3 forms the lion's share of total emissions. These emissions are also hard to abate, like cement and steel. The challenge for companies in Singapore's built environment sector is greater because most of these materials are imported. Our companies would need to work together across the supply chain to explore ideas and push innovation in areas such as low-carbon concrete, electric furnaces, and use of low-carbon hydrogen in steel production.</p><p>KEY ENABLERS FOR THE TRIPLE TRANSITION</p><p>Achieving the triple transition - in carbon, energy and the economy - will require several key enablers:</p><p>* Carbon Pricing. Progressive increases in carbon taxes will send the right price signals for economy-wide decarbonisation.</p><p>*Technology.  Many of the barriers to cost-effective decarbonisation will require significant advances in climate-related technology.</p><p>* Finance. More private capital and innovative financing instruments will be needed to support the triple transition.</p><p>* Data and Disclosure. The disclosure of reliable and comparable sustainability data is necessary to guide and sustain decarbonisation efforts by businesses.</p><p>* Green Procurement. Incorporating sustainability considerations in procurement decisions can be a powerful lever for decarbonisation across supply chains.</p><p>Let me highlight three of the enablers - Technology, Finance, and Data and Disclosure.</p><p>Clean Technology</p><p>To effectively harness technology for decarbonisation, we need to strengthen collaboration across the public sector, industry, and academia.</p><p>The government has been stepping up support for solutions with high levels of technology readiness. BCA has enhanced the funding under its Green Buildings Innovation Cluster or GBIC programme to S$45 million. The enhanced programme will support research into alternative cooling technologies, smart building solutions, and next-generation building ventilation.</p><p>The SMU Connexion building is an interesting project supported by the GBIC programme, deploying a wide range of sustainable technologies. Their smart control system integrates building services with networked sensors for temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and occupancy. By adjusting for outdoor weather conditions, the system avoids overcooling - a common problem in many of our buildings - and thereby minimises energy consumption. The fans in their air-conditioning units are integrated with CO2 sensors, introducing fresh air only when CO2 levels reach the upper range. The SMU Connexion building has achieved an energy efficiency improvement of nearly 65% from the 2005 baseline.</p><p>We are also seeing interesting innovations in buildings to better harness solar energy. At the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base, solar PVs are not just being deployed on rooftops, but also on the building's vertical faade. At DBS Newton Green, the PV modules have solar panels on both sides. This enables harvesting not just the sunlight that falls on the roof but also the sunlight reflected from the roof surface.</p><p>Transition Finance</p><p>The challenge in financing decarbonisation is not green finance but transition finance.  Getting financing for fully green activities, like renewable energy deployment, is becoming easier notwithstanding high capital intensity and long payback periods. But financial institutions find it more difficult to assess transition activities - activities that move away from brown but are not yet fully green. Examples include the switch in electricity generation from coal to natural gas, or the use of carbon capture for the combustion of fossil fuels. The question around the pace of decarbonisation is also important. How fast should a company be transitioning, for it to be considered favourably for financing?</p><p>A key enabler for transition finance is international standards. Well-conceived standards enable financial institutions to more confidently invest in a company's decarbonisation. Let me cite an example from the building sector. An international alliance of leading green building rating system organisations has launched a guide to help bridge knowledge gaps[8]. The guide helps institutional investors and financial institutions better understand major building certification systems, and how those certifications align with the goals of sustainable finance.</p><p>Another enabler is taxonomies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, in collaboration with industry, has established the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance. The taxonomy aims to serve as a common reference point for financial institutions to inform their financing decisions. It classifies activities into \"green\", \"red\", and \"amber\", with the last category of \"amber\" signifying activities that are credibly transitional in nature, moving from \"red\" to \"green\". Take for example the renovation of an existing building: it will be considered \"green\" if the renovation enables the building to reach the prevailing Green Mark Certification or align with relevant Climate Bonds Building Criteria; it will be \"amber\" or transition if the renovation leads to at least a 30% reduction in emissions or energy consumption up to the category's sunset date of 2030. It will be \"red\" if it does not meet the above criteria.</p><p>Data and Disclosure</p><p>Finally, data and disclosure. What gets measured gets done and what gets disclosed gets done even better. The disclosure of reliable and comparable sustainability data is a powerful tool to accelerate the triple transitions. It enables companies to benchmark themselves to their competitors. It enhances supply chain accountability and management of Scope 3 emissions. It helps governments to prioritise their decarbonisation efforts. It helps sectoral regulators to calibrate their emissions or efficiency-related requirements. It enables financial institutions to make more informed sustainable financing decisions.</p><p>As a key step towards a robust data and disclosure ecosystem, Singapore will introduce mandatory climate-related reporting. From FY2025, all listed issuers will be required to make annual climate-related disclosures, aligned with ISSB standards. From FY2027, all companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion and total assets of at least $500 million will be required to do the same.</p><p>BCA has taken steps to increase the transparency of buildings' energy performance. Building owners can benchmark the performance of their buildings to the top quartile of buildings in Singapore using the BCA's Building Energy Benchmarking Report.</p><p>CLIMATE RESILIENCE</p><p>I have not touched on adaptation and resilience strategies to deal with the physical effects of climate change.</p><p>Even as it plans for the triple transition, the built environment sector must prepare for climate resilience. Many of Singapore's climate vulnerabilities, like heat stress and rising sea levels, will have a significant impact on the built environment. This is why all new developments are required to be built on higher platforms, at least four metres above mean sea levels. Critical infrastructure will be built an additional metre higher. The sector must also prepare for the effects of heat stress on related industries like construction. As our climate continues to deteriorate, even more adaptation measures may be required in the built environment sector in future. In short, resilience must become an integral part of our transition planning.</p><p>THE FOURTH TRANSITION</p><p>I have spoken about our triple transition - carbon, energy, and economic. I have also touched on three key enablers for this transition - technology, finance, and data and disclosure.</p><p>Perhaps there is a fourth transition that the world and Singapore need to make - a transition in mindsets. It begins with building awareness - that climate change is no longer a prediction but a current reality that will progressively worsen. We need to transition from short-term thinking to long-term thinking. The time for action is not 2030 or 2050, but now.  We need to transition from viewing carbon as a constraint on economic growth to viewing low-carbon as a source of competitive advantage. This is how many of the most progressive companies in the world are approaching the issue. We need to transition from seeing decarbonisation purely as a cost to seeing it as an investment in future growth.

health</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) will study over three years the impact of the urban environment on mental health, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on June 3.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The study will examine factors such as urban design features, density and human behaviours, Mr Heng said at the opening plenary of the World Cities Summit 2024, held at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Mr Heng, who is chairman of the National Research Foundation Board, said insights from the study will \"serve to better inform the way we rejuvenate, reinvent and reimagine our city-state\". </p><p> The A*Star study, which costs $1 million and was commissioned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing Board, will be funded by the Government's $28 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan. </p><p> The five-year plan was launched in December 2020 with an initial sum of $25 billion.</p><p> The mental health study was awarded to A*Star in May 2024, and will be carried out by the agency's Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences.</p><p> The Ministry of National Development (MND) said the study will devise a data-driven method to assess how different aspects of the built environment affect the mental well-being of the general population.</p><p> Given Singapore's highly built-up environment, said MND, the country \"offers a unique opportunity to conduct mental health research\".</p><p> \"Current research in our local context has primarily focused on the impact of our built environment on physical well-being, and the benefits of greenery on mental well-being,\" MND added.</p><p> \"This project aims to expand this knowledge by investigating other aspects of the built environment more holistically, and their impacts on mental well-being.\"</p><p> As part of the study, a list of indicators that link the built environment to mental well-being will be developed.</p><p> MND said that these indicators could help urban planners understand how factors such as the provision of facilities, land use configuration, and the intensity of development on a piece of land may affect mental well-being.</p><p> Researchers plan to validate the study's findings against four ongoing Singapore cohort studies: Growing Up In Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes, Singapore Preconception Study Of Long-Term Maternal And Child Outcomes, Singapore Longitudinal Early Developmental Study and Mapping Antenatal Maternal Stress.</p><p> MND said that the four studies have collected extensive data from study participants using validated questionnaires, including mental well-being indicators.</p><p> The ministry added that findings from the new study will inform how the authorities plan, design and prioritise built environment interventions to enable a healthier and more liveable environment.</p><p> The three-day World Cities Summit, held every two years in Singapore, ends on June 4. </p><p> It gathers city leaders, industry experts and others who work on urban environments, and the 2024 edition has delegates from more than 90 cities around the world.</p><p> Among its highlights was the Mayors Forum, chaired by National Development Minister Desmond Lee on June 2.</p><p> Speaking at the summit's opening plenary on June 3, Mr Lee announced an updated Singapore Liveability Framework -- a set of principles and systems that guide city planners and policymakers.</p><p> The upgraded framework has a new emphasis on \"collaborative ecosystems\".</p><p> Such systems involve the public, the private sector and the Government, recognising that citizens have a part to play in policymaking, and in the governance of cities.</p><p> A series of memorandums of understanding (MOUs) will be signed during the summit. </p><p> The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Singapore Management University (SMU) signed an MOU on June 3.</p><p> SLA said that its geospatial information -- referring to data associated with a particular location such as aerial images and street maps -- will be used in the Cooling Singapore 2.0 research project, which SMU co-leads.</p><p> Among the project's products is a Digital Urban Climate Twin of Singapore that will explore the heat effects of buildings, transport and industry.</p><p> SLA said its data, and the digital twin, will aid policymakers in Singapore in assessing effective climate adaptation solutions that can enhance the city's climate resilience.</p><p> During a panel discussion on leveraging geospatial data to improve citizens' quality of life, Mr Vincent Karremans, vice-mayor of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, said such data has helped his city to prioritise investments in climate adaptation.</p><p> \"Due to this geospatial technology, we know exactly which neighbourhoods, which streets -- even portions of streets -- are the most vulnerable to heatwaves or heavy rainfall because we can put that all into a model,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat touring the booths at the World Cities Summit on June 3.

Good afternoon. I am happy to join you here at the 2024 National Engineers Day Engineering Innovation Challenge. Let me first begin by congratulating all our young engineers here with us today! Over 200 teams submitted projects for the challenge this year, and there was a wide range of high-quality projects showcased today. These projects exemplified the spirit of innovation and persistence that underpin good engineering. You identified a problem, developed a good understanding of the theoretical and technical challenges involved, came up with creative solutions, and took practical steps to test out these solutions and turn them into reality.</p><p>Engineering as the foundation of our future</p><p>2. The engineering approach to solving problems and improving processes has contributed greatly to our progress as a society. It begins with being observant of the everyday challenges faced by those around us. For example, the team from ITE College East came out with a good solution to help the visually impaired to navigate around more safely. While canes or guide dogs can help the visually impaired navigate around effectively, these aids don't do well in detecting obstacles that are higher up, closer to their upper body or head. One of the things that inspired them to start the project was reading a report from the Straits Times of a visually impaired person who got a head injury after knocking into an obstacle. The ITE team then drew inspiration from the concept of echo-location, designed and prototyped a Smart Mobility Aid to help the visually impaired identify hazards and avoid danger. This project is a good reminder that being a good engineer is not just about knowing science and technology, but having the drive to find practical solutions to improve the lives of those around us.</p><p>3. We know that Singapore is a small country with many constraints - we have land constraints. We also have labour constraints; with aging, there are more and more people that are getting older and our local workforce will not keep growing. We will hit a saturation point, after which the size of the local workforce will start to decline. We also have a new constraint - carbon constraint. If we want to achieve our goal of net-zero by 2050, we cannot do things as usual. So what we need to do is to work with all of you, and our companies and workers, to find innovative solutions that can help us to tackle the problems of today, and seize opportunities tomorrow.</p><p>4. The theme of this year's competition, \"Innovating a Circular Economy through Engineering\" is timely. Engineering innovations will be critical to supporting our economic ambitions and global competitiveness, while also strengthening climate resilience and resource efficiency. We should not see reaching net zero and protecting the environment as at odds with economic growth. If we do it well, they can be mutually supporting and reinforcing - growing in a sustainable way, and in a manner which still protects the environment. This is what we hope to do with the right solutions.</p><p>5. Many of the projects I saw today involved reducing waste, and creative reuse of materials. Nationally, this is also something that we are pursuing in a big way. For example, we have been reusing recyclable materials from Pulau Semakau - Singapore's only landfill - to reclaim land for the construction of Tuas Port. For those of you may not be aware, we are currently building the world's largest container port - the Tuas Port. When completed in the 2040s, it will have a capacity of 65 million TEUs. To reclaim the land to build the port, a lot of materials are needed. If we can reuse some of the landfill materials from Pulau Semakau, we would be killing two birds with one stone - by extending the life of the landfill, while also reducing the amount of sand required for Tuas Port reclamation and construction. It is a win-win, but this is not easy because it needs to be done properly.</p><p>6. We are now studying the possibility of mixing cement with landfill waste, such as incineration ash and wastewater, as a more sustainable alternative to conventional materials like sand. Our engineers are hard at work to see how we can achieve something that would be good for Singapore, supporting our development in a more resource constrained world.</p><p>Nurturing future generations of engineers</p><p>7. To continue driving such innovations, the key is to have a strong core of engineers. It is the engineers and the people behind that the ideas that can make the project work. I'm heartened that IES has been successfully organising the Engineering Innovation Challenge for the past decade, to inspire our students with the possibilities of engineering, and to encourage them to consider a future in engineering fields.</p><p>8. This is but one of the many initiatives by IES to build a talent pipeline needed across various sectors of our economy. For example, IES has partnered with ITE to jointly develop certification courses for Technical Officers in Mechanical &amp; Electrical engineering, and Civil &amp; Structural engineering.</p><p>9. Speaking for our public transport sector, a strong pipeline of talent is crucial in helping us to provide a core service for Singaporeans. From the challenges of building rail lines in a densely -populated city, to maintaining the intricate mechanical and electrical systems required to keep our rail network operating smoothly, engineers play a critical role to keep Singapore moving. The same is true for the development and operation of our airport and seaports. As we continue to strengthen our connectivity, engineers will have many opportunities to make a difference to the lives of fellow Singaporeans. At the airport and seaports, we are also embarking on automation projects that will allow us to improve productivity and reduce labour costs.</p><p>10. I am also glad that IES will be launching a new Scholarship Fund to provide financial assistance to deserving students to pursue engineering studies. I thank the donors for their generous contribution to the fund, and for nurturing the aspirations of our next generation of engineers, so that they too can contribute back to our community.</p><p>Concluding Remarks</p><p>11. I encourage our young student engineers to make the best use of these opportunities to pursue your dreams. Your journey as an engineer certainly does not end today. I hope that each of you will continue to pursue your interests in engineering in one way or another, and challenge yourselves to continue innovating and exploring the limitless possibilities within the field.</p><p>12. Let me conclude by once again thanking all students for participating in this year's Engineering Innovation Challenge. I look forward to seeing more of your great ideas come to life, and your contributions to a more sustainable, prosperous Singapore.</p><p>13.

Disasters supercharged by climate change are now so frequent it is hard to keep track of them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But beyond the headlines and the immediate crisis is the real story and the greatest impact of climate change: As climate-linked disasters become more frequent and severe, so do the impacts on people, livelihoods, and communities. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The costs are immense and long-lasting. From physical and mental health of victims and their families, to damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure. Food and energy supplies are disrupted and the cost of rebuilding, especially for those without insurance, can be crippling for victims and local governments. Hurricane Beryl provided a bitter reminder. </p><p> 'Blunt force trauma'In an emotional video message on July 17, the United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell, who is from Grenada, spoke from the shattered remains of a neighbour's house on the flattened island of Carriacou. </p><p> \"My own grandmother's house down the street has been totally destroyed.Initial reports are that 98 per cent of homes and buildings have been either destroyed or severely damaged by Beryl.\" </p><p> The devastation, he said, has become all too familiar to hundreds of millions of people around the world. </p><p> \"These colossal climate costs have reached the level of severe national security threat in every country.These climate-driven disasters don't just cripple lives and communities when they hit. They inflict huge ongoing costs the world over. </p><p> \"If governments everywhere don't step up, every economy and eight billion people will be facing this blunt force trauma head on, on a continuous basis.\"</p><p> Poorer nations often fare far worse in the aftermath of major climate-linked events. The 2022 floods in Pakistan lasted four months, inundated a third of the country, displaced millions and destroyed farmland and livelihoods in a disaster felt to this day. Total economic costs were estimated at US$30 billion. </p><p> In India, relentless heat in recent months has killed more than 100 people and more than 40,000 were estimated to have suffered heat stroke. </p><p> The economic and human costs are piling up in wealthy nations, too. In 2023, there were a record 28 weather and climate disasters in the United States, costing at least US$92.9 billion. Severe thunderstorms alone caused US$66 billion in overall losses, of which US$50 billion was insured, according to global reinsurer Munich Re. </p><p> Globally, natural disasters caused US$250 billion in losses in 2023, of which 76 per cent were weather-related. </p><p> In 2022, more than 60,000 people were estimated to have died during the brutal summer heatwaves and fires that scorched Europe, while record wildfires burned millions of hectares across Canada in 2023. </p><p> \"An increase in disasters leads to higher damages and higher economic costs,\" said Mr Ernst Rauch, chief geo and climate scientist at Munich Re. </p><p> More frequent and more intense disasters could mean lengthy recovery periods, he told The Straits Times. He cited labour shortages or the availability of construction materials to rebuild as among the reasons for this.</p><p> The financial health of the affected community also plays a crucial role in how quickly normal operations can resume. </p><p> What can be done'Plenty can be and is being done. </p><p> Nations need to urgently boost resilience to weather disasters to reduce the impacts. This means strengthening building codes, better urban planning such as deeper drainage, hardening electricity grids, such as putting power lines underground in some cases, elevating trunk roads and building storm-proof community shelters that can also double up as cooling centres during heatwaves. </p><p> And it makes financial sense to do so. </p><p> A 2024 study by Allstate, the US Chamber of Commerce and the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, found that every US$1 spent on climate resilience and preparedness saves communities US$13 in damage, cleanup costs and economic impact.</p><p> Better early warning systems are also key. The UN Secretary-General has called for every person on the planet to be protected by early warning systems by 2027. Advances in early warning systems and preparedness have saved tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). </p><p> The positive sideEarly warning systems likely saved hundreds of lives during Beryl's rampage through the Caribbean, said Mr Kamal Kishore, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. </p><p> And while the aftermath of a disaster can be painful, he tells ST that nations are increasingly focused on resilient recovery -- building back better to withstand the next disaster. </p><p> \"In a very sustained way, many countries are actually putting a lot of focus on recovery and reconstruction,\" he said. And the payoff, if the rebuilding is done right, is stronger infrastructure and better livelihood outcomes and an economic boost. </p><p> \"It's not always the speed of recovery. What we are looking for is the quality of recovery, so that this recovery is resilient, and what we rebuild lasts for 20 years, 50 years, for multiple generations,\" said Mr Kishore, who is also head of the UNDRR. </p><p> Government agencies and insurance firms can help take the lead in boosting resilience. </p><p> On July 10, 2024, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) announced a rule change that requires the agency to factor in the impact of climate change on future flood risk when it decides where and how to build. All construction projects funded by Fema must be strengthened against climate-related flood impacts, including sea-level rise.</p><p> Mr Rauch said there was a need for a dedicated risk manager at the community decision-making level, similar to how the private sector relies on risk managers. </p><p> \"Next, stop allowing construction in high-hazard zones in the first place, keeping in mind that climate change is, at the same time, redefining these zones.</p><p> \"Then after an event: build back better. Preventing building permits in high-hazard zones would have an immediate effect on reducing exposure. The insurance industry (globally) has been successful in promoting more stringent building codes and defining hazard zones,\" he said. </p><p> The long and costly aftermath of most weather-related disasters shows climate change is far from a transient phenomenon typified by short-lived headlines. With millions affected every year, investment in resilience and reducing risks is vital. There is an urgent need to boost climate finance for the poorest and most vulnerable communities across the globe. </p><p> And here the media can also play a role in tracking the aftermath of disasters, to tell the human and economic story as a way for others to learn and see the full, unvarnished consequences of climate change and the need for global action. </p><p> \"Recovery is by definition a longer-term effort,\" said Mr Kishore. \"It would be good to look at how decisions taken in the early phase of recovery lead to good or not so good outcome for the people who are affected. We want to hear people's stories, whether their hopes and aspirations are being met.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Damaged houses in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl on Carriacou, Grenada, on July 2.

The Southeast Asia's Green Economy 2024 report showed that Asean had a 20 per cent rise in green investments in 2023, and eight of its 10 member nations have set net-zero targets. Among them, Singapore and Vietnam have made the most progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the past year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Slowing down efforts to decarbonise is not an option: the International Energy Agency reported that energy demand in Asean has increased by 3 per cent annually over the past 20 years, and will continue to do so until 2030. </p><p> To accelerate the net-zero agenda, renewable energy production must catch up and more capital is needed to fund the energy transition. The stakes are high, as the region faces the real and present effects of climate change.</p><p> As a bloc, Asean's diverse markets have different priorities and strengths. But what they have in common are intent and determination -- while acknowledging the need to balance growth and the costs of a green and sustainable transition. For example, Singapore is a pioneer in innovative green financing; Vietnam's government is making a clear push towards renewable energy; Indonesia is seeking to retire coal-fired power plants early; and Malaysia is guiding financial sector players to develop taxonomies and progress on climate risk initiatives.</p><p> In addition, several countries are discussing a potential cross-border green energy grid. With such purpose and intent, the rewards from regional cooperation could be substantial. Up to six million new jobs could be created by 2030, with up to US$2 trillion in green investments regionally.</p><p> Riding Asean's momentum is key. According to the Southeast Asia's Green Economy 2024 report developed by Standard Chartered in partnership with Bain &amp; Company, GenZero and Temasek, there are five accelerators that can help Asean expedite its climate action progress. </p><p> The two I wish to highlight are innovative finance mechanisms and regional collaboration.</p><p> Blending innovation and financing for a greener futureAsean needs an additional US$1.5 trillion to support its green transition. Scaling innovative finance mechanisms -- such as blended finance, carbon credits and project financing -- will be crucial to ensure that investors have sufficient incentives and business cases to fund.</p><p> Take the project financing for the Phu Yen solar power plant in Vietnam as an example. </p><p> Not only is the plant helping to significantly reduce the country's emissions, but it is also one of the largest solar-powered facilities in Asean and Asia's first \"green B\" loan certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative.</p><p> Blended finance is also set to play an important role. This leverages catalytic capital -- which carries slightly lower financial returns in favour of social and environmental impacts aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals -- to de-risk projects and reduce costs of capital, attracting more private sector funding.</p><p> Take for example the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) for fossil fuel phase-outs and renewable energy investments. Alongside our JETP partners, which include governments and monetary authorities, as well as fellow private sector financiers, we have committed a combined US$15.5 billion to support Vietnam's energy transition and US$20 billion to help Indonesia phase out coal energy and invest in renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p> By scaling concessional capital and other enablers, up to US$20 billion for blended finance per year could become available for decarbonisation opportunities in Asean, if a common approach is developed for the region.</p><p> The priority now is to scale blended finance beyond single projects. To replicate blended finance structures, a framework needs to be developed to encompass different forms of catalytic capital, matching investments with appropriate projects and attracting commercial capital in the right way.</p><p> This ecosystem would include the private and public sectors, supported by efficient long-term policies and regulations aimed at simplifying the decarbonisation agenda for investors.</p><p> Leading the charge is Singapore, which is host to one of Asean's leading blended finance initiatives. </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is mobilising up to US$5 billion as part of Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, or FAST-P, a regional blended finance platform that will contribute significantly to Asean's sustainability ambitions.</p><p> Climate action as a joint effortBeyond its financial contribution, Singapore is also well-suited as a super-connector between Asean and the world, given its strengths in long-term planning and consensus building.</p><p>Singapore's example shows that collaboration is vital: building resilience to climate change goes beyond siloed action. There's more to be achieved from collective efforts, across Asean and the rest of the world, and between the public and private sectors.</p><p> In this equation, the role of financial institutions is key. </p><p> As the only international bank with a presence across all Asean markets, Standard Chartered plays an important role in facilitating capital to support corporate emissions-reduction efforts. We're committed to mobilising US$300 billion in sustainable finance by 2030, and directing capital and climate solutions to where they are needed most. </p><p> Our long-established relationships with governments, companies and investors mean we also add value by bringing them together. Whether helping to scale the carbon market through our founding partnership in Climate Impact X (a Singapore-based global marketplace, exchange and auction house for trusted carbon credits), or our participation in MAS' Transition Credits Coalition (which aims to expedite the phase-out of coal-fired power plants), we continue to work closely with our partners to help finance the green transition and boost climate resilience.</p><p> For collaborative projects such as these to reach their potential, a unified approach is crucial. This would encompass standards, incentives and disclosures that all markets in Asean, and globally, can adopt and follow.</p><p> Stakeholders across Asean understand the importance of the climate agenda and are planning commitments and investments to reach a sustainable future. But at the same time, we must recognise the challenges ahead.</p><p> Acting now and collaborating to build momentum will give us our best chance at achieving our climate goals.</p><p> When there's a will there's a way, and across Asean, there is no shortage of will. I am confident that it has a bright future as a sustainability leader.</p><p> The writer is CEO, Singapore and Asean, Standard Chartered</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>To accelerate the net-zero agenda, renewable energy production must catch up and more capital is needed to fund the energy transition, says Standard Chartered's Patrick Lee.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.</p><p> Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.</p><p> Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.</p><p> Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.</p><p> With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.</p><p> Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.</p><p> Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub. \"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.</p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.</p><p> Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.</p><p> In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.</p><p> Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.</p><p> While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.</p><p> Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.</p><p> For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.</p><p> Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.</p><p> Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.</p><p> One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.</p><p> This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.</p><p> Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.</p><p> Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.</p><p> \"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.</p><p> Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.</p><p> The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.</p><p> However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.</p><p> In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.</p><p> Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.</p><p> The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.</p><p> \"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mangrove trees on Singapore's Semakau island; beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers say.

It is my pleasure to join all of you for this year's Singapore Sustainability Scholarship Award Ceremony.</p><p>2. I am glad to meet our young Singaporeans here today who are pursuing a career in environmental sustainability. Congratulations to our newest scholarship recipients! A warmwelcome to our MSE family! Today, we also have our in-service scholars here with us. Theyhave contributed well to their respective organisations and have been selected to develop themselves further in their areas of expertise. Our in-service scholarship is a testament to MSE family's commitment to continually develop and nurture our officers along the course of their careers. Each generation of scholars plays a crucial role in advancing MSE family's mission and vision. In the same way, we are committed to nurturing and preparing future scholars to ensure they are well-equipped to continue and build on the progress made by their predecessors.</p><p>Singapore's Sustainability Journey</p><p>3. Singapore is regarded as one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the world. Our sustainable development strategies over the years have helped to lay a good foundation upon which our economic and social achievements today are anchored. But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.</p><p>4. Climate change and its impacts are increasingly felt in Singapore and around the world. Sea levels are rising and extreme weather events have increased in both frequency and intensity. We are seeing hotter weather, heavier rainstorms and longer drier periods. Being a low-lying island state, Singapore is especially at risk. Climate change can disrupt global supply chains and threaten our food and water supply.</p><p>MSE Family Scholars in Diverse Areas of Work</p><p>5. Multi-disciplinary expertise is required to address the increasingly complex environmental challenges of our time. Through the Singapore Sustainability Scholarship, we hope to nurture future leaders to strengthen Singapore's climate, economic and resource resilience. We need officers with: deep skill sets in many science and technical areas, and the ability to bridge different disciplines, lead project teams and communicate effectively with our stakeholders.</p><p>Singapore Sustainability Scholarship recipients</p><p>6. This year, we are awarding scholarships to 17 outstanding individuals to pursue courses in earth and planetary science, molecular and cell biology, alongside other science and engineering disciplines. Alicia The, who did an internship with NEA, found the work to be so meaningful that she decided to pursue a career with NEA. She hopes to use science to tackle Singapore's environmental issues and create a more sustainable future for our home. Alicia will be pursuing a Master of Science in Environment Science at the University of St Andrews.</p><p>7. We also have Melissa Koi, PUB's scholarship recipient who will be pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Environmental Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University. From a young age, Melissa has had a passion for environmental conservation. This drove her to pursue a Diploma in Environment and Water Technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic instead of taking the conventional Junior College route. Melissa's studies will help her learn and understand more about rising sea levels and we look forward to her contributions in coastal protection and sustainability upon graduation.</p><p>8. Some of us would be familiar with Abie Chi who represented Singapore in gymnastics. Shifting her focus to food security, she is one of SFA's scholarship recipients this year. Abie will be pursuing a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Her studies will equip her with necessary skills to address Singapore's food safety challenges. Her future involvement in research projects will enable her to contribute innovative solutions from a veterinarian's perspective.</p><p>In-service Scholarship recipients</p><p>9. Our MSE family believes in life-long learning and committed to nurturing a future-ready workforce. This year, we have offered in-service scholarships to 13 of our officers from MSE, NEA, PUB and SFA.</p><p>10. Ackburally Mohammad Djamil is from NEA's Vector Control Operations Division. He is responsible for designing strategies and executing plans to keep vector population low in Singapore. He will be pursuing a Master of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. The Master programme will enhance Djamil's ability to devise and execute current, and robust plans to control the vector population.</p><p>11. Faisal Ahmad oversees PUB's Smart Operations Division in its Infotech and Digitalisation Department, and implements enterprise digitalisation projects to build a future-ready PUB. Faisal will be pursuing a Master in Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Development at University College London. He hopes to better integrate AI into PUB's core operations.</p><p>12. Ong Yihang is from SFA's Urban Food Solutions Division and he is exploring the production of microalgae-based single-cell protein as a sustainable feed ingredient for Asian seabass. Yihang will pursue a Master of Engineering (Chemical and Biomedical Engineering) at the Nanyang Technological University. His work will pave the way for further research and innovation in sustainable protein sources for our aquaculture industry.</p><p>13. While our scholars may come from diverse backgrounds, they have in common a passion for our shared commitment to build a more environmentally sustainable and resilient future for Singapore. Our MSE family's Singapore Sustainability Scholarship and in-service scholarship offer curious minds and passionate individuals the opportunity to pursue their dreams and develop their capabilities to help Singapore navigate the increasingly complex climate challenges ahead of us.</p><p>MSE Family Employee Value Proposition</p><p>14. MSE family's recently updated Employee Value Proposition is \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday\". This proposition aptly reflects our shared mission to drive sustainability initiatives, enhance water, food and climate resilience, to improve the everyday lives of Singaporeans. One of our core promises is to enable our officers to do work rooted in purpose. The earlier examples I shared demonstrate how our scholars and officers can make a direct and meaningful impact by securing the food we eat, the water we drink and the environment we live in. Our work can be challenging, but at the same time, fulfilling and satisfying knowing that what we do contributes towards a greater mission of making our nation a better and liveable home for our current and future generations.</p><p>15. Innovation is another core value of ours. In the face of an uncertain future and global changes, we must remain forward-thinking and seek new solutions to address evolving challenges. We are dedicated to our officers' continuous growth and learning.</p><p>16. As a team, we look out for one another and strive towards an inclusive, safe and supportive MSE family that values our staff and prioritises workplace safety and health.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>17. Let me conclude by once again congratulating all our scholars. Today is a significant milestone for all of you, and you would not be where you are today without the support of your family and loved ones along the way. Do also take time to reflect on the support and guidance you have gained from your teachers and colleagues.</p><p>18. The journey ahead can be both challenging and exciting for the MSE family as we press on in tackling a wide range of challenges - from public health, carbon mitigation, coastal protection, circular economy, as well as food and water security.</p><p>19. I look forward to your contributions to help build a green and sustainable Singapore. I sincerely hope that you find meaning and purpose in your career with us.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub.\"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. </p><p>So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus\u00c2\u00a0resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.\"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.\"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:697T-88G1-JCF2-817V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

China market participants have been facing a similar test of perseverance, as they wait to see to whether the sharp rebound in its equity market will prove short-lived, like the stop-start market rebounds of the past two years. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Will it be more durable this time'</p><p> Over the past three months, the MSCI China Index rebounded by over 20 per cent from its mid-January 2024 trough, entering a technical bull phase that significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index and MSCI World Index. </p><p> Despite the recent pullback in China and Hong Kong markets from profit taking in May, we believe this market recovery is in its early stages and poised for gains over the medium to long term. </p><p> We recently upgraded China and Hong Kong in our equity strategy to \"overweight\", as the fundamental risk-reward of China and Hong Kong equities has reached an inflection point. </p><p> Our confidence is driven by the following:</p><p> Macroeconomic recovery is on trackChina's economy remains on track to meet our forecast of a solid 5 per cent growth this year. But its post-pandemic recovery is still unbalanced against a backdrop of cautious consumers, indebted local governments reticent about raising borrowing and a nascent property market recovery.</p><p> Policies to boost consumption and growthChina policymakers have dry powder for further easing, as government bond net issuance is set to accelerate in the coming months. </p><p> Only for the fourth time since 1998, China has announced the issuance of special sovereign bonds, such as the one-trillion-yuan (S$186.4 billion) issuance of ultra-long government bonds for strategic investments.</p><p> Unprecedented real estate policy playbookWhile the property downturn remains a major drag, China announced a comprehensive suite of measures in May, including easing of its rules on purchases and removing the floor on mortgage rates to address key issues of weak demand, excess supply and sector liquidity in the real estate sector. </p><p> One of the most significant is 500 billion yuan in loans; of this amount, 300 billion yuan will be funded by The People's Bank of China's relending facilities through 21 national banks for local governments to purchase unsold completed properties from developers for affordable social housing. </p><p> While the jury is still out on the scale and efficacy of the current policies, we believe policymakers stand ready to expand the policy magnitude, especially if incoming residential property transaction volumes and prices remain weak in the run-up to the Third Plenum in July.</p><p> Supportive capital markets regulationsThe \"five measures\" announced by Chinese regulators to boost capital markets are supportive of Hong Kong as a regional financial centre. </p><p> They include expansion of ETF Connect, inclusion of real estate investment trusts in Connect, onshore HKD-RMB Dual Counter launch and further mutual recognition of funds. Potential further inflow of domestic funds can improve Hong Kong's liquidity over the long run. </p><p> Investor positioning and technical factorsChina equities tend to outperform after entering a technical bull phase, with a 60 per cent ex-post likelihood of extending gains. </p><p> Global fund managers who had been underweight Asian markets have also started to rebalance in favour of Asian stocks in recent months, on the back of attractive valuations and improving fundamentals.</p><p> Geopolitical risks and US-China uncertaintiesUS-China geopolitical risks remain a concern, but given the experiences of the past six years since the US-China trade war started in 2018, investors have by now priced in a higher resting heart rate for US-China related geopolitical risks. </p><p> However, in the run-up to the first debate between President Joe Biden and ex-president Donald Trump on Jun 27, financial markets may be volatile in pricing the likely effects of a second Trump term.</p><p> Asia opportunities in H2 2024Against global market uncertainties, Asia offers diversification for investors seeking exposure to longer-term structural themes. They include access to a growing middle class, the prospects of near-shoring, rebuilding of supply chains and intra-Asian trade amid US-China geopolitical uncertainties. </p><p> Infrastructure investments to support climate resilience, artificial intelligence (AI) innovation and social infrastructure also offer investors a wealth of opportunities. </p><p> Invest in key China equity themesWithin China equities, we remain selective and favour undervalued names that provide exposure to broad themes including AI, large market leaders and quality yield names.</p><p> Upgrading Asia ex-Japan equitiesIn our overall equity asset allocation, we upgraded our Asia ex-Japan positioning as a result of our preference for China and Hong Kong. The downward earnings revision cycle for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index has likely bottomed. We expect earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23 per cent in 2024 and 16 per cent in 2025, led by South Korea, Taiwan, India and China.</p><p>Japan's structural drivers versus short-term volatilityWhile we remain positive on Japan's equity market on improvements in corporate governance, share buybacks and dividend increases, currency volatility is a key risk as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stays cautious in terms of rate hikes. </p><p> Since the BOJ ended its negative interest rate policy in March (setting the overnight call rate at zero to 0.10 per cent) to combat inflation, its subsequent dovish stance has supported Japanese markets this year. However, potentially tighter monetary policy, with another rate hike to around 0.25 per cent, and a firmer yen may test equity markets this year. </p><p> Fixed income opportunities in China, Indonesia and IndiaAsian high-yield bonds are preferred, relative to investment-grade bonds, on valuation grounds. The recent real estate policies in China are likely to limit further downside, rather than stimulate a major turnaround. </p><p> Within the China property bond universe, we expect still-surviving developers with quality land banks to benefit more from the headlines. But, defaulted names are unlikely to benefit much from the recent measures. Instead, we favour selected asset management companies within China financials and Indonesian quasi-sovereign bonds. </p><p> Despite recent market volatility on the back of India's election outcome, where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party under Prime Minister Narendra Modi lost its outright majority, we believe Indian companies benefit from macroeconomic growth, favourable demographics and structural improvements. </p><p> While we currently hold an \"overweight\" position on Indian fixed income and favour corporate issuers selectively across sectors (including renewable energy and airports), the newly formed government's policies in relation to key sectors will be closely watched.</p><p> The writer is global chief investment officer, Bank of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>China announced a comprehensive suite of measures for its real estate sector, including easing of its rules on property purchases and removing the floor on mortgage rates to address the key issues of weak demand, excess supply and sector liquidity.

The region, home to nearly 100 million of the world's 500 million smallholder farmers, finds itself at the heart of this multifaceted challenge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the globe, a remarkable 1,400 digital agricultural technology (D4Ag) solutions have emerged to address these needs. Southeast Asia accounts for a mere seven per cent of this supply while seeing its own surge from just 59 digital agritech solutions in 2018 to 92 by 2022.</p><p>However, the active adoption of digital tools among the region's farmers remains concerningly low at merely six per cent - on par with sub-Saharan Africa and just a third of Latin America's rate. Compounding this, not a single solution has reached the one million registered users mark, hinting at a vast untapped potential.</p><p>The shifting landscape toward digital commerce</p><p>The focus of these D4Ag solutions is shifting, increasingly leaning towards providing market linkage services for farmers. This mirrors a global pivot away from pure farmer advisory offerings that proved to be challenging to monetise for the startups, catalysed further by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet obstacles like users' digital literacy gaps, infrastructure deficits, and limited access to capital persist, tempering the pace of digital adoption in the region.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/invest-in-women-accelerate-progress-why-gender-equality-matters-now-more-than-ever-20240306/\">Invest in women, accelerate progress: Why gender equality matters now more than ever</url></p><p>Empowering women, fostering inclusion</p><p>Crucially, D4Ag promises to reconfigure long-standing gender dynamics within agriculture. While gender-disaggregated data on usage patterns remains lacking, a growing body of evidence supports claims that D4Ag positively impacts women's economic empowerment. Digital tools enhance productivity and income by improving access to knowledge, resources, financing, and professional skill development.</p><p>In Southeast Asia, this potential is palpable - women constitute over 46 per cent of farmers in the region. However, only 30 per cent of digital agritech users are female. The current 54 per cent gender gap in D4Ag adoption underscores significant growth opportunities. With concerted efforts, this divide could halve to 26 per cent within a decade, onboarding an additional 8 million women into digital agriculture.</p><p>The climate action catalyst</p><p>As the fight against climate change intensifies, digital agritech is rapidly aligning with climate tech - empowering farmers to adapt and mitigate environmental impacts. Digital agricultural tools enable sustainable practices like reducing input use (water, fertilizer, and pesticides), optimising production practices to decrease waste, and reducing emissions. Besides, they often allow farmers to rapidly identify and respond to emerging climate threats.</p><p>Despite progress, daunting hurdles remain in unlocking climate-smart D4Ag's full potential. Adoption of affordable, digitally-enabled insurance lags, with only around three per cent of farmers in Asia outside China and India covered (GIZ, 2021). The lack of adequate and affordable products, as well as limited farmers' understanding and trust, create barriers to unlocking the potential of digitally enabled agricultural insurance.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/can-agritech-solve-the-worlds-growing-food-security-problem-20220110/\">Can agritech solve the world's growing food security problem?</url></p><p>The scope of digital monitoring, reporting, and evaluation (d-MRV) products also remains narrow. Granular, reliable local baseline emissions data is scarce, while high costs, technical complexity, and shortages of critical skills like data analytics and environmental science expertise further hinder implementation.</p><p>Lastly, 'climate-smart' digital advisory services are often challenged by a lack of access to high-quality, granular, and context-specific data, as well as farmers' limited abilities to act on the provided recommendations. Monetising such services also proved to be difficult, with most startups still struggling to find a viable business model.</p><p>An immense opportunity</p><p>Yet the promise is transformative - digital agritech could reduce up to 78 megatons of CO2 equivalent annually over the next decade for Southeast Asia under optimal conditions. This highlights the sector's capacity to drastically cut emissions while underscoring the urgent need to overcome persistent barriers.</p><p>As Southeast Asia stands at the crossroads of innovation and tradition, the role of D4Ag in forging a sustainable agricultural future has never been more vital. Realising digital's full potential demands coordinated efforts between technology providers, governments, and farming communities. Overcoming current obstacles will not only propel climate action but secure an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient agricultural sector.</p><p>In an era where agriculture both drives and bears the brunt of climate change, digital technologies offer a path to empowerment - helping farmers adapt, mitigate impacts, and thrive amid adversity. By embracing D4Ag's transformative capabilities, Southeast Asia can unlock a future where gender equity, social inclusion, and climate resilience are woven into the fabric of its agricultural practices and rural landscapes.</p><p>To read the full report, please download <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.beanstalkagtech.com/d4aglmic\">here</url> .</p><p>-</p><p>Editor's note: e27 aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

Mr Ong Tze-Ch'in will be appointed Chief Executive (CE) of PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, with effect from 1 November 2023. He succeeds Mr Goh Si Hou, who will be taking on another senior leadership appointment in the Public Service. Mr Ong will continue to hold the appointment of Deputy Secretary (Resilience) in the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).</p><p>Contributions of Mr Goh Si Hou</p><p>2. Mr Goh Si Hou, 45, was appointed CE PUB in 2022. Under his leadership, PUB set out long term strategies to strengthen Singapore's water security and climate resilience.</p><p>3. Mr Goh led PUB in the development of the Water Masterplan, charting out the long term infrastructure plans to ensure Singapore's water security. These include the significant expansion of its water reclamation and NEWater capacity as a sustainable water source for Singapore. PUB also achieved progress in major infrastructure projects, including the completion of tunnelling works for DTSS and the redevelopment of Kranji Water Reclamation Plant. To move towards sustainable growth in long term water demand, PUB stepped up partnership with the community and industry to strengthen water conservation, through introducing new measures such as mandatory water recycling for water-intensive sectors and enhanced water efficiency funding. Mr Goh also put in place PUB's sustainability drive to reduce energy use, treatment waste, and carbon emissions over the long term. These thrusts to expand water resources, manage demand growth, and green PUB's operations will move Singapore towards a sustainable water future.</p><p>4. During Mr Goh's tenure, PUB also advanced its new mandate as the national coastal protection agency. He oversaw the development of policies and plans to set the foundation for long-term coastal protection work, the launch of public consultations, and the establishment of a new research programme in coastal protection and flood management to build up local capability and enable the development of innovative solutions for Singapore. He brought together coastal protection with PUB's stormwater management function to drive integrated planning, modelling and solutioning to our flood risks. Together, these serve to strengthen Singapore's resilience against rising sea levels and extreme rainfall amidst climate change.</p><p>Incoming CE Mr Ong Tze-Ch'in</p><p>5. Mr Ong Tze-Ch'in, 48, is currently Deputy Secretary (Resilience) in MSE, overseeing water and food policies, international relations, communications and engagement, and emergency planning. Prior to this, he held various key leadership roles, including as Chief Executive of SkillsFuture Singapore and concurrent Deputy Secretary (SkillsFuture) in the Ministry of Education (MOE), Director of Military Intelligence / Chief C4I, and Commander of the 3rd Singapore Division in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Mr Ong received a Masters in Business Administration from INSEAD in 2010 and a Masters in Defence Studies from King's College London in 2006, and graduated from Stanford University in 1998 with Masters and Bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering.</p><p>Registration of Appreciation</p><p>6. MSE expresses our deep appreciation to Mr Goh for his leadership and invaluable contributions to PUB and the MSE Family and looks forward to Mr Ong's continued contributions in his new capacity.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp;

He also highlighted the need for SIDS to work together on climate change, digitalisation, and other global challenges. Minister Maliki announced Singapore\u2019s new technical assistance package, \u201cSIDS of Change\u201d, which aims to better equip SIDS to implement the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS to achieve a more resilient and prosperous future. The technical assistance package will include customised courses on blue carbon and digitalisation. The full transcript of the statement is appended.</p><p>. . . . .</p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p><p>SINGAPORE</p><p>28 MAY 2024</p><p>. . . . .</p><p>NATIONAL STATEMENT BY SPECIAL ENVOY OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMANAT THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES,</p><p>ANTIGUA &amp; BARBUDA,</p><p>27 MAY 2024</p><p>Thank you, Mr President.</p><p>Excellencies</p><p>Distinguished Guests</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p><p>1 -First, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the people of Papua New Guinea for the tragic loss of lives and injuries arising from the deadly landslide.</p><p>2 -Ten years ago, we adopted the SAMOA Pathway, a programme of action for SIDS to address multifaceted challenges. I am glad to see that SIDS have since made strides in their development. The 2022 UN Secretary-General\u2019s Report on the Follow-up to and Implementation of the SAMOA Pathway showed that most SIDS are progressing in sustainable energy, food security and nutrition, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, as well as water and sanitation.</p><p>3-But our work is far from over. Over the last decade, new issues have arisen and the past few years have been particularly challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic, sharpening geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, climate change, and food and energy insecurity have been major threats. New issues such as technology and AI have also emerged, which present both opportunities and challenges. As the SAMOA Pathway draws to a close, we need to refresh our approach and strengthen our partnerships to deal with this new environment and accelerate progress towards the SDGs.</p><p>4-We therefore strongly welcome the adoption of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS, our programme of action for the next decade. This action-oriented document highlights emerging issues that we must collectively address, and which also require strong support from the international community for SIDS. Let me share Singapore\u2019s views on two emerging challenges for SIDS.</p><p>5 -First, climate change. SIDS are on the frontline of feeling the impacts of climate change. We are increasingly affected by tropical cyclones, storm surges, droughts, and changing precipitation patterns, as documented by the IPCC and which we have all experienced acutely. Last year was the warmest year globally. The IPCC\u2019s forecast of global mean sea-level rise of up to 1.1 metres by 2100 would be a disaster for many of us. Adaptation is clearly an urgent priority for SIDS. Singapore therefore fully supports the ABAS\u2019 call for timely support for action on adaptation, including the operationalisation and implementation of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience. In addition, SIDS must work together to push for a successful COP-29 in Azerbaijan which ensures all countries fulfil their climate pledges to keep the Paris Agreement temperature goal of 1.5\u00b0C within reach.</p><p>6-Second, digitalisation. Singapore agrees with the ABAS\u2019 recommendation to harness digital technologies to achieve sustainable development. The ITU has reported that internet use in SIDS since 2014 has grown faster than global growth, at an annual growth rate of 8.4 percent. This is encouraging as connectivity is the enabler for digital transformation, which could yield economic benefits. For example, the UNDP projected that the adoption of financial digital public infrastructure can contribute to 20 to 33 percent of economic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Singapore\u2019s experience in adopting mobile banking and digital payment systems such as the Singapore QR code \u2013 the world\u2019s first unified national e-payment system \u2013 has been a positive one as it allowed us to scale up e-payments and create innovative business opportunities.</p><p>7-In the spirit of South-South cooperation, Singapore is contributing our digital solutions for healthcare, electronic verification, and accessibility to the UNDP\u2019s and ITU\u2019s open registries of digital public goods. To reap the full benefits of digitalisation, SIDS should also create an enabling environment to foster innovation, while promoting digital inclusion to ensure that no one is left behind in this digital revolution. To this end, Singapore and the UNDP have been working on a joint challenge where innovative solutions from SIDS on managing coastal risk and transport infrastructure can be showcased and applied.</p><p>Mr President,</p><p>8 No SIDS can tackle these challenges alone. As a tiny island-state, Singapore understands the unique challenges faced by SIDS. We have benefitted much in learning from other countries during our development journey and are happy to share our experiences. We echo the call in the ABAS to strengthen partnerships for human resource development as this is also reflected in Singapore\u2019s belief that a country\u2019s most valuable asset is its human capital. Singapore has been offering technical assistance packages for SIDS since 1999, in response to the evolving challenges. For example, the Singapore Partnership for the SAMOA Pathway, which we launched in 2019, offered tailor-made programmes including on climate change and disaster risk reduction. I am glad that more than 2,200 officials have participated in this programme. As we prepare for the challenges of the coming decade, I am pleased to announce Singapore\u2019s new technical assistance package for SIDS, which we call \u201cSIDS of Change\u201d. This package includes new customised programmes on emerging issues such as blue carbon and digitalisation. We will also continue to sponsor civil aviation and maritime fellowships for SIDS officials to build up capabilities in these important areas that will enhance our connectivity. We invite all SIDS to participate actively in these programmes.</p><p>9 Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMFAPS-429906948</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMFAPS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4M-8951-F11P-X4NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">476773</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Government of Singapore Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

This requires a more proactive investment strategy when building portfolios. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That is the key advice of BlackRock Investment Institute (BII), the research arm of global investment giant BlackRock.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it's time to take the controls,\" BII declared in its 2024 Global Outlook report released this week. \"It's important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk and expect to deploy more risk over the next year.\"</p><p> Prepared by BlackRock vice-chairman Philipp Hildebrand, and BII head Jean Boivin and his team, and released on Dec 6, the report said the world is entering a phase of slower growth, higher inflation, higher interest rates -- and greater volatility.</p><p> Although the United States economy seems robust, it is still growing at a below-trend rate of 1.8 per cent since the Covid-19 pandemic, BII said. And despite its seeming strength, the US jobs market is simply reflecting the recouping of about 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic struck. The tight labour market is symptomatic of a worker shortage as a growing share of the US population ages into retirement.</p><p> \"Something has changed -- and it's structural in nature,\" the report said, referring to the investment environment. \"We are on a weaker growth path and got here with more inflation, higher interest rates and much higher debt levels. The upshot for investors? We think the key is to focus on how the economy and markets are adjusting to the new regime. Adopting the typical cyclical playbook may be misguided.\"</p><p> BII warned that exposures to macro risk can be punished as well as rewarded, and advised investors to be deliberate about what they take on. </p><p> \"We believe the new regime rewards an active approach to portfolios. We don't see one-and-done strategies working as in the past.\"</p><p> Explaining the findings of the report to The Straits Times, BII's chief investment strategist for Asia-Pacific Ben Powell (no relation to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell), said portfolio construction should also take into account a higher interest rate environment.</p><p> \"Our view is that the Fed will cut rates later than the market is expecting, and by less,\" he added.</p><p> Many analysts believe the Fed could start cutting its key lending rate by 100 basis points in 2024, starting in June 2024.</p><p> In its report, BII advised investors to go beyond traditional building blocks and transcend traditional asset classes. It called for a focus on \"mega forces\" such as digital disruption, artificial intelligence (AI), the future of finance, the impact of ageing populations and the push towards climate resilience. </p><p> \"Mega forces are key drivers of the new regime, affecting the long-term growth and inflation outlook and creating shifts in profitability. We see them as a source of return now and far into the future.\"</p><p> It likened the emergence of AI and the overarching race to build the smartest machines to a revolution -- \"like the industrial and information revolutions of the past\". It added that markets may also be under-appreciating the prospects for climate resilience to become a mainstream investment theme within the low-carbon transition story.</p><p> Meanwhile, global fragmentation is deepening and accelerating, driven by competing geopolitical and economic blocs. A rewiring of economic ties along geopolitical lines could create investment opportunities.</p><p> Mr Powell, who is based in Singapore, said that in the Asia-Pacific region, countries like Vietnam and Malaysia could benefit from the China-plus-one strategy being adopted by global companies.</p><p> One country that he is particularly bullish about is India.</p><p> \"India is in an unusual situation,\" he said. While it is deeply embedded in the US ecosystem via the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue -- comprising India, Australia, Japan and the US -- it also \"practises astute multilateralism that enables (it) to have free conversation and connections with other geographies\". </p><p> \"We see India as being strongly positioned to capitalise on its multilateral relations at a time when the world is drifting apart,\" he said. </p><p> Farther afield, Mr Powell also sees Mexico benefiting from \"near-shoring\" by the US.</p><p> China's October 2022 reopening has not delivered, he added. </p><p> \"The property situation remains unresolved and this presents a problem for Chinese risk assets. More fiscal stimulus is needed to restore confidence,\" he said. </p><p> On real estate, BII noted that valuations have adjusted to the higher inflation and interest rate environment. Real estate investment trusts have reacted to rising interest rates better and further, thus making them more attractive investments. </p><p> From a tactical viewpoint, BII is underweight on most developed market (DM) equities, except for Japan.</p><p> \"We upgraded Japan twice this year on appealing valuations, earnings growth, and as corporate reforms aimed at boosting shareholder take root. It remains our strongest DM equity view. Investors are latching on, partly explaining the broad market's surge this year,\" it said.</p><p> It is also overweight on short-term government credit and inflation-linked bonds. As for finance, it sees the private market -- especially private credit -- competing with the traditional banking sector. </p><p> BII concluded that an increasingly competitive and volatile world could see a surge of investment in strategic sectors like tech, energy, defence and infrastructure.</p><p> \"We also see opportunities in firms with expertise in managing and reducing cyber-security risks. War in the Middle East, ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and structural competition between the US and China mean increased geopolitical risks. And 2024 is set to be the biggest election year in history, with more than half the world population voting. We see the US and Taiwan elections as particularly significant.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Attendees viewing an exhibit at The AI Summit New York 2023 on Dec 6.

This network will comprise the use of proprietary phase change material-based thermal energy storage, interconnected cooling systems and innovative outdoor cooling technologies.</p><p> These technologies will also be integrated with the AC/DC hybrid microgrid.</p><p> Keppel expects this to lead to significant reductions in its carbon footprint, and serve as a showcase of artificial intelligence-optimised energy consumption.</p><p> Ms Cindy Lim, Keppel's chief executive of infrastructure, said such sustainability-related solutions will help businesses and communities decarbonise and work towards carbon neutrality.</p><p> Beyond these initiatives, Keppel and NUS are exploring partnerships in other energy innovations, such as ammonia cracking and solar energy-related research.</p><p> Keppel said it does not expect the collaboration to have a material impact on its earnings per share or net tangible assets per share for its current financial year.</p><p> Shares of Keppel Corp closed four cents, or 0.6 per cent, lower at $6.43 on Nov 20.

When it comes to institutional and corporate clients, a few banks have set out decarbonisation targets for sectors such as power, automotive, and oil and gas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Singapore Management University associate professor of finance Liang Hao noted that many motorists still rely on petrol, and until cleaner-energy vehicles become more widespread, banks need to continue supporting their current customer base. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Transitioning too abruptly could alienate customers and limit the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives,\" said Prof Liang, who is co-director of the Singapore Green Finance Centre.</p><p> But he added that credit cards can significantly influence consumer behaviour, and banks can play a pivotal role in facilitating the transition through incentives such as rewards for EV charging and discounts on green products and services. </p><p> Petrol and diesel cars accounted for nearly 84 per cent of total cars in Singapore as at the end of May, while petrol-electric hybrids made up 13 per cent. </p><p> EVs and plug-in hybrids contributed to just 3 per cent of total cars, but their number had risen to 18,173 as at the end of May, up from about 13,300 as at the end of 2023.</p><p> From 2030, all new car registrations here will have to be of cleaner-energy models, including electric, hybrid or hydrogen fuel cell cars. </p><p> Banks have continued with long-running perks for motorists who use petrol, but they are also increasingly catering to EV drivers. </p><p> UOB offers fuel savings at Shell of up to 24 per cent for UOB One credit card holders, and up to 20 per cent for those who have the UOB Reserve Card. All other UOB credit and debit cards offer fuel discounts of up to 17 per cent. The bank also has a similar tie-up with the Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC). </p><p> Petrol-related billings on the UOB One credit card rose by over 30 per cent from 2021 to 2023, and nearly 10 per cent on the UOB Reserve card. </p><p> Ms Jacquelyn Tan, UOB's head of group personal financial services, said: \"We are seeing a continuation of this upward trend in the first quarter of 2024.\" </p><p> Rising prices are also contributing to motorists' growing expenditure on petrol. For example, national data in May showed that petrol prices increased at a faster pace and contributed to higher private transport inflation. </p><p> Meanwhile, Ms Tan said that while petrol-related spending remains strong, UOB has also observed a growing popularity of EVs and EV charging.</p><p> EV-related billings on the UOB One credit card and UOB Evol card doubled from 2022 to 2023. The number of card holders spending on services related to EV charging increased by more than 130 per cent. </p><p> At DBS Bank and POSB, card holders receive discounts at SPC and Esso stations. POSB Everyday Card customers can access higher fuel savings, of up to 20.1 per cent, at SPC, while DBS Esso card customers can save up to 23 per cent at Esso stations.</p><p> The POSB Everyday Card also gives 3 per cent cash rebates when card holders charge their EVs with SP Group. </p><p> OCBC 365 card members get 6 per cent cashback on fuel spend at all petrol service stations, and up to 23 per cent off fuel at Caltex, Esso and Sinopec. </p><p> The card also offers 3 per cent cashback at all EV-charging stations in Singapore. The bank saw a 400 per cent increase in EV-related transactions from 2022 to 2023 across OCBC 365 card holders, said Ms Chan Sow Han, OCBC Bank's head of group lifestyle financing. </p><p> The three local banks have in the past two years mapped out decarbonisation targets in carbon-intensive sectors they finance, as they strive to meet their net-zero commitments. </p><p> A Monetary Authority of Singapore spokesperson said: \"Our supervisory focus in relation to environmental risk is for banks to have a sound transition planning process, to build climate resilience and to facilitate robust climate mitigation and adaptation measures by their customers.\" </p><p> The authority added that it expects banks' business strategies to be consistent with internal risk appetite and publicly communicated climate-related plans and commitments. </p><p> NUS Business School professor Lawrence Loh said incentivising customer expenditure on fossil fuel products such as petrol needs to be \"fundamentally relooked\", as the practice does not square with banks' broader plans to decarbonise their portfolios.</p><p> Cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs), running mainly on petrol and diesel, release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. </p><p> Prof Loh, who is director of the school's Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said the issue needs to be addressed together with oil companies. </p><p> \"But I think banks can actually make the first move. If one bank does not get into the picture (of offering petrol discounts), another bank will, so I think, collectively, some banks will have to set the standard.\" </p><p> An ExxonMobil spokesperson noted that Esso has introduced Esso Renewable Diesel R20, made with at least 20 per cent renewable content, at four retail service stations in Singapore. The fuel has an estimated 15.4 per cent lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional diesel.</p><p> There are also EV-charging points operated by CDG Engie at Esso Pioneer, Esso East Coast and Esso Upper Aljunied. </p><p> A Chevron spokesperson noted that customers can access a voluntary carbon offset programme via the CaltexGO app.</p><p> Instead of earning reward points, customers can use the points from their fuel purchase to offset a portion of certain carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from the combustion of the fuel purchased.</p><p> Ms Tessa Er, Maybank Singapore's head of cards and personal loans, said petrol spend among card holders has grown year on year but risen at a slower pace in recent years, likely due to a shift towards EVs.</p><p> Maybank started offering petrol discounts in 2010. Its flagship Maybank Family &amp; Friends card currently offers 8 per cent cashback on petrol and transport globally. </p><p> Ms Er said demand for pooled car services and EV usage rose by more than 10 times in 2023, compared with before the pandemic. \"In Singapore, we have EV-charging promotions in the pipeline to be rolled out this year.\" </p><p> Mr Sanjay Nambiar, head of international cards and unsecured lending at Citi Global Wealth, said the bank has seen muted growth in fuel spend since the Covid-19 pandemic, amid hybrid work arrangements and greater popularity of EVs.</p><p> Citi card benefits on fuel at Shell and Esso have been in place for over a decade and are available to all of the bank's credit cards. On top of the fuel discounts, the Citi Cashback card gives an additional 8 per cent cashback on petrol spend worldwide.  </p><p> Besides cards, banks have in recent years taken other steps to encourage the use of EVs, including loans that offer lower interest rates for EVs compared with petrol and diesel cars. In April, OCBC expanded the range of EVs that can be financed under its Eco-Care car loan scheme to include used EVs of up to 10 years old. </p><p> DBS also collaborates with automotive partners on EV discovery sessions that include longer distance test drives and address common concerns such as range anxiety about EV charging.</p><p> But Singapore still has some way to go in its adoption of EVs. </p><p> SMU's Prof Liang said existing petrol-related financial products may still have a market for a while due to the legacy vehicle fleet and customer preferences.</p><p> NUS' Prof Loh said banks can only do so much through credit card rewards, and there are other factors like a lack of charging infrastructure and range anxiety that deter motorists from switching to EVs. </p><p>Singapore aims to have 60,000 EV-charging points by 2030. As at the end of December 2023, there were nearly 6,000 charging points in public and private spaces islandwide. </p><p> Costs are another big consideration for motorists, even as the authorities have introduced incentives and rebates to narrow the upfront cost gap with ICE cars.</p><p> Army regular Tristen Kian, 28, bought a second-hand hybrid car with a couple of years left on its certificate of entitlement in 2023. He drives for about one to two hours almost every day, and uses a DBS Esso credit card for 18 per cent petrol discounts. </p><p> He said: \"While owning an EV is a dream because of its positive environmental impact, the cost is currently too high for me.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An electric vehicle (EV) charging point in a public carpark.

Minister Maliki announced Singapore's new technical assistance package, \"SIDS of Change\", which aims to better equip SIDS to implement the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS to achieve a more resilient and prosperous future. The technical assistance package will include customised courses on blue carbon and digitalisation. The full transcript of the statement is appended.<br/><br/>NATIONAL STATEMENT BY SPECIAL ENVOY OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMANAT THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES,<br/><br/>ANTIGUA &amp; BARBUDA,<br/><br/>27 MAY 2024<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr President.<br/><br/>Excellencies<br/><br/>Distinguished Guests<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen<br/><br/>1. First, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the people of Papua New Guinea for the tragic loss of lives and injuries arising from the deadly landslide.<br/><br/>2. Ten years ago, we adopted the SAMOA Pathway, a programme of action for SIDS to address multifaceted challenges. I am glad to see that SIDS have since made strides in their development. The 2022 UN Secretary-General's Report on the Follow-up to and Implementation of the SAMOA Pathway showed that most SIDS are progressing in sustainable energy, food security and nutrition, gender equality and women's empowerment, as well as water and sanitation.<br/><br/>3. But our work is far from over. Over the last decade, new issues have arisen and the past few years have been particularly challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic, sharpening geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, climate change, and food and energy insecurity have been major threats. New issues such as technology and AI have also emerged, which present both opportunities and challenges. As the SAMOA Pathway draws to a close, we need to refresh our approach and strengthen our partnerships to deal with this new environment and accelerate progress towards the SDGs.<br/><br/>4. We therefore strongly welcome the adoption of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS, our programme of action for the next decade. This action-oriented document highlights emerging issues that we must collectively address, and which also require strong support from the international community for SIDS. Let me share Singapore's views on two emerging challenges for SIDS.<br/><br/>5. First, climate change. SIDS are on the frontline of feeling the impacts of climate change. We are increasingly affected by tropical cyclones, storm surges, droughts, and changing precipitation patterns, as documented by the IPCC and which we have all experienced acutely. Last year was the warmest year globally. The IPCC's forecast of global mean sea-level rise of up to 1.1 metres by 2100 would be a disaster for many of us. Adaptation is clearly an urgent priority for SIDS. Singapore therefore fully supports the ABAS' call for timely support for action on adaptation, including the operationalisation and implementation of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience. In addition, SIDS must work together to push for a successful COP-29 in Azerbaijan which ensures all countries fulfil their climate pledges to keep the Paris Agreement temperature goal of 1.5C within reach.<br/><br/>6. Second, digitalisation. Singapore agrees with the ABAS' recommendation to harness digital technologies to achieve sustainable development. The ITU has reported that internet use in SIDS since 2014 has grown faster than global growth, at an annual growth rate of 8.4 percent. This is encouraging as connectivity is the enabler for digital transformation, which could yield economic benefits. For example, the UNDP projected that the adoption of financial digital public infrastructure can contribute to 20 to 33 percent of economic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Singapore's experience in adopting mobile banking and digital payment systems such as the Singapore QR code - the world's first unified national e-payment system - has been a positive one as it allowed us to scale up e-payments and create innovative business opportunities.<br/><br/>7. In the spirit of South-South cooperation, Singapore is contributing our digital solutions for healthcare, electronic verification, and accessibility to the UNDP's and ITU's open registries of digital public goods. To reap the full benefits of digitalisation, SIDS should also create an enabling environment to foster innovation, while promoting digital inclusion to ensure that no one is left behind in this digital revolution. To this end, Singapore and the UNDP have been working on a joint challenge where innovative solutions from SIDS on managing coastal risk and transport infrastructure can be showcased and applied.<br/><br/>Mr President,<br/><br/>8. No SIDS can tackle these challenges alone. As a tiny island-state, Singapore understands the unique challenges faced by SIDS. We have benefitted much in learning from other countries during our development journey and are happy to share our experiences. We echo the call in the ABAS to strengthen partnerships for human resource development as this is also reflected in Singapore's belief that a country's most valuable asset is its human capital. Singapore has been offering technical assistance packages for SIDS since 1999, in response to the evolving challenges. For example, the Singapore Partnership for the SAMOA Pathway, which we launched in 2019, offered tailor-made programmes including on climate change and disaster risk reduction. I am glad that more than 2,200 officials have participated in this programme. As we prepare for the challenges of the coming decade, I am pleased to announce Singapore's new technical assistance package for SIDS, which we call \"SIDS of Change\". This package includes new customised programmes on emerging issues such as blue carbon and digitalisation. We will also continue to sponsor civil aviation and maritime fellowships for SIDS officials to build up capabilities in these important areas that will enhance our connectivity. We invite all SIDS to participate actively in these programmes.<br/><br/>9.

In the face of mounting climate challenges, women are uniquely positioned to serve as catalysts for climate mitigation and adaptation.

A common standard for gender lens investment is the 2XC criteria, which requires that an investment meet certain targets in support of women in entrepreneurship, leadership, employment, and consumer roles,\" the report says.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-key-to-tackling-climate-change-electrify-shipping-20230127/\">The key to tackling climate change: Electrify shipping</url></p><p>\"While there is a distinct relationship between gender inequality and climate change, investment mandates rarely combine a climate and gender lens, and there is a lack of communication and understanding between the two \u02bbworlds.\u02bc Climate financiers are not always aware of the potential for gender equality to help catalyse positive climate action, and gender-lens investors may perceive climate science as being less relevant, difficult to understand, or difficult to integrate into their efforts.\"</p><p>Supporting underfunded women's businesses to tackle climate change</p><p>SecondMuse Capital is the impact-focused capital arm of SecondMuse. Supported by Visa Foundation and AVPN, the organisation carried out Future Economy Lab focusing on 'Financing Gender-Smart Climate Businesses in Asia.' The lab addresses financing barriers faced by gender-smart, climate-positive micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in South and Southeast Asia, specifically in India, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p><p>SecondMuse Capital reviewed more than 40 recent literature sources for this report, including reports by leading institutions, academic research, news articles, and webinars.

Mr Speaker, heat resilience is an important issue for Singapore. Rising temperatures will be compounded by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, as our densely built-up environment absorbs and retains heat, and activities such as transportation and industrial works generate heat.<br/><br/>2. Various Members had previously filed questions on heat resilience, including just yesterday. We would like to assure this House that the Government has for some time now and will continue to address this as part of our overall climate resilience efforts.<br/><br/>3. The Government adopts a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy, which has three prongs: (i) First, implementing national-level cooling strategies to benefit all segments of our society, including the vulnerable; (ii) second, strengthening the community's resilience, especially among more vulnerable population segments; and (iii) third, deepening our scientific understanding of the impact of rising temperatures.<br/><br/>Implementing national-level cooling strategies to benefit all segments of our society<br/><br/>4. First, cooling strategies aim to keep us cool in our warm climate.<br/><br/>5. Greening Singapore is a key strategy that has multiple benefits, including providing shade and reducing ambient temperatures of our surroundings. As we transform Singapore into a City in Nature, we are setting in place a network of green spaces across the island so that by 2030, every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park. We are also intensifying greenery beyond just our parks. This includes planting trees along roads. Under the OneMillionTrees Movement, with the help of our partners and the community, we have planted over 630,000 trees. Other greening measures include increasing skyrise greenery and greenery on building facades, such as through URA's Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) scheme. As part of greenery intensification efforts under the Green Towns Programme, suitable top decks of HDB multi-storey car parks are converted to greenery and community or allotment gardens.<br/><br/>6. We are also deploying other cooling strategies across the island. The Member may be aware from MND's PQ response yesterday that HDB conducts environmental modelling for new towns and estates. This enables us to site new flats and orientate blocks to optimise wind flow and reduce heat gain. For existing towns, under HDB's Green Towns Programme, we are studying the application of cool coatings.<br/><br/>7. Besides these broad-based measures, there are also specific measures to help various vulnerable groups cope with the impact of higher temperatures. For instance, HDB has created more openings along corridors in some older rental blocks by removing some units from each floor. This enhances airflow and natural ventilation in these blocks. Migrant worker dormitories are required to be provided with adequate fans to ensure good air circulation and ventilation in the dormitory rooms and Recreation Centres. MOM is also installing ice machines in Recreation Centres.<br/><br/>Strengthening the community's resilience to heat<br/><br/>8. Second, we have taken steps to empower the community to cope with a warming world.<br/><br/>9. We launched the Heat Stress Advisory in July last year, to guide the public on ways to minimise the risk of heat stress. The public can easily check the prevailing heat stress levels on the myENV app before embarking on outdoor activities, and take simple steps to protect ourselves. This is no different from checking the weather forecast for rain, in deciding whether to bring an umbrella. Similar to the other weather data on the myENV app, readings are based on the monitoring station nearest to the app user automatically.<br/><br/>10. We currently have 9 WBGT stations islandwide, and will be expanding our network.<br/><br/>11. Access to water is important to address heat stress. We have easy access to clean drinking water. Singapore's tap water is perfectly safe for direct consumption, without the need for boiling or water filters.<br/><br/>12. Furthermore, water dispensers are widely available at hawker centres, parks, bus interchanges and terminals. SUSS undergraduate Tng Ming Kang has created a crowd-sourced map on these existing water dispensers in Singapore.<br/><br/>13. We also have targeted sector-specific guidelines for various groups including outdoor workers, athletes, uniformed personnel, residential homes and schools. Let me elaborate.<br/><br/>14. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) introduced an enhanced set of measures to reduce the risk of heat stress for outdoor workers last year. These include measures focusing on four aspects: acclimatise, drink, rest, and shade. Of note, employers are required to provide a minimum rest break of 10 minutes hourly under shade for workers carrying out heavy physical activities when the WBGT (degree celsius) is 32 or higher. Employers should also reschedule outdoor work to cooler parts of the day where feasible and re-deploy workers vulnerable to heat stress.<br/><br/>15. Beyond MOM's guidelines, we are also heartened that organisations have taken additional steps to protect outdoor workers. For instance, Changi Airport Group provides refresh pods at staff rest areas which circulate cool air at the touch of a button. They also deploy trucks with isotonic drinks to remind workers to stay hydrated. For our delivery workers, Grab and Foodpanda remind riders on heat stress. Deliveroo provides water for riders at its delivery-only kitchens and encourages merchants do so too.<br/><br/>Deepening our scientific understanding of the impact of rising temperatures<br/><br/>16. Finally, on deepening our scientific understanding. Our heat-resilience strategies are based on science. For instance, we set the Heat Stress Advisory thresholds in consultation with experts, and we are reviewing our heat resilience plans based on the climate projections from our Third National Climate Change study.<br/><br/>17. We leverage R&amp;D to design more effective heat resilience strategies. For example, the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project is developing a digital model, to simulate Singapore's urban climate and assess the effectiveness of various cooling strategies. Researchers in NUS are also investigating the impact of warmer and more humid nights on sleep quality, to develop novel cooling solutions such as smart systems that can adjust fan wind speed and air-con temperature. This will ensure that rising temperatures do not take a toll on people's rest while we remain energy efficient.<br/><br/>18. The Cooling Singapore 2.0 project also investigates the impact of heat on different segments of the population, such as the elderly and children. We may also consider studying other relevant social-economic dimensions in the future. Through the Climate Impact Science Research (CISR) Programme, we will examine the effects of rising temperatures on our physical and mental health, as well as second-order effects such as increased mosquito population.<br/><br/>19. We also cooperate with international partners on future collaborations and knowledge-sharing. The Heat Resilience and Performance Centre (HRPC) at NUS will be the Southeast Asia node of the Global Heat Health Information Network, an initiative by the World Health Organisation and World Meteorological Organisation.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>20. Even as the government takes steps to address warming temperatures and UHI, I would like to call on the public to join us on this journey to make Singapore and our communities more heat-resilient.<br/><br/>21. Individually, we can take steps to reduce heat emissions by taking public transport, and using less air-conditioning and more energy-efficient electrical appliances. As a community, we can look out more for one another and co-create solutions such as setting up community cool spaces, to beat the heat together.</p><p>[Category: Construction &amp; Materials, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063624415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B95-9521-DXMP-K2DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 7, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DSE6</classCode><className>ACCESS TO WATER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D0TN</classCode><className>WATER CRISES &amp; SHORTAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DRQJ</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX002299</classCode><className>MIGRANT WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CYGN</classCode><className>PARKING SPACES &amp; FACILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

At the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)'s Committee of Supply debate on 4 March 2024, Minister Ms Grace Fu, Senior Ministers of State Dr Amy Khor and Dr Koh Poh Koon, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey Yam Keng shared the Ministry's key initiatives in creating a clean, green, and resilient shared Singapore.<br/><br/>2. This year, we are focusing our efforts on enhancing public hygiene to better protect public health and create a thriving urban environment for Singaporeans. We have inherited a clean and green environment from earlier generations, but it is up to us to leave an even better environment for our future generations. In the spirit of the Forward Singapore exercise, we are designating 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene to inspire collective responsibility and to galvanise a whole-of-nation effort to upkeep our hygiene standards across four key areas: clean environment, safe food, clean air, and clean water.<br/><br/>3. We will also continue to work with our stakeholders to press on towards net zero and strengthen our climate resilience. We will expand the Government's green procurement policies and strengthen our support for businesses and households to become more resource- and energy-efficient. We are also enhancing coastal protection measures and strengthening efforts to secure a supply of safe food.<br/><br/>Year of Public Hygiene<br/><br/>Clean Environment<br/><br/>4. While most members of the public are socially responsible, a small number of people continue to litter, particularly at certain hotspots. To tackle this issue, NEA will step up enforcement at cleanliness hotspots, employ greater use of technology and rally the community to help keep Singapore clean. This includes increasing the frequency and scale of anti-littering enforcement blitzes, and a four-fold increase in the deployment of CCTVs at hotspots (See Annex A(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>5. Improving the cleanliness of public toilets is another area that we will focus on, in partnership with our stakeholders. MSE will form a Public Toilets Taskforce, which will study and recommend solutions to improve the cleanliness of public toilets, particularly those at coffeshops and hawker centres. The Taskforce will be co-chaired by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Baey Yam Keng and Chairman of the Public Hygiene Council, Mr Andrew Khng. It will comprise representatives from across public sector agencies, town councils, trade associations, non-governmental organisations, academia, professionals, premises managers and industry associations. Details will be announced in due course (See Annex A(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20A%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20NEA's%20stepped%20up%20efforts%20in%20the%20Year%20of%20Public%20Hygiene.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>Safe Food<br/><br/>6. Ensuring food safety is a joint responsibility shared by all parties along the food supply chain. Even as the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) puts in place a regulatory system and enabling environment to ensure food safety, the food industry must also play an active role in maintaining good food safety standards.<br/><br/>7. SFA is refining the grading system for assessing the food safety performance of food establishments. The current grading system, which provides a snapshot of food safety performance at the point of inspection, may not adequately reflect whether food safety standards have been consistently maintained by the food establishments. This refined grading system, the Safety Assurance for Food Establishments (SAFE) framework, will provide consumers with a better representation of food establishments' food safety performance by taking into account the establishments' track record and food safety management systems. Further details will be announced later this year.<br/><br/>Clean Air<br/><br/>8. Formaldehyde is currently added to some paints as a preservative to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. Exposure to formaldehyde can be harmful to our health. We will introduce limits on formaldehyde in building products in a phased approach, starting with interior paints. From 1 January 2026, NEA will require paints sold in Singapore intended for application on interior surfaces of buildings not to contain formaldehyde (See Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20B%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Limits%20on%20formaldehyde%20in%20interior%20paints.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20B%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Limits%20on%20formaldehyde%20in%20interior%20paints.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>Clean Water<br/><br/>9. Safeguarding our precious water resources to ensure a supply of clean water for Singaporeans is of utmost importance. In this regard, PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, will look to introduce measures to better protect our waterways, reservoirs and sewerage system. The measures would further deter silt discharges into our waterways and reservoirs, and illegal discharge of harmful substances into our public sewerage system. More details will be released later this year.<br/><br/>Rallying Businesses and Individuals to Action<br/><br/>10. Sustaining high levels of public hygiene requires all of us to play a part. The Year of Public Hygiene goes beyond just doubling down on our enforcement efforts. We will also rally businesses, community and individuals to play an active part to upkeep good public hygiene practices for our collective well-being.<br/><br/>11. The Public Hygiene Council (PHC) will launch the latest edition of the annual Keep Singapore Clean campaign on 28 April this year to galvanise Singaporeans to do their part to uphold higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness. This year's campaign will rally PHC's business, government and community partners to reaffirm their collective commitment to keep Singapore clean.<br/><br/>12. Building on last year's inaugural campaign, MSE will roll out the second edition of Go Green SG across June and July this year with an expanded range of exclusive activities, including on public hygiene. This will allow more participants and partners across the People, Public and Private sectors to join us in taking care of our environment.<br/><br/>Pressing On Towards Net Zero<br/><br/>Green Government<br/><br/>13. In 2022, we raised our national ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We will enhance the public sector's green procurement policies to support this goal.<br/><br/>14. Last year, we announced that the Government will set aside up to 5 per cent of evaluation points for environmental sustainability for large government construction and ICT tenders starting from FY2024. We will extend this green public procurement initiative to government tenders for Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions (MICE) and other events organised by the public sector from FY2025. Further industry consultations will be conducted before finalising details.<br/><br/>Supporting Households and Businesses in Improving Resource- and Energy Efficiency<br/><br/>15. Through the existing Climate Friendly Households Programme, 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB households were given vouchers to be used between November 2020 and 20 March 2024 for the purchase of energy-efficient refrigerators, LED lights and water-efficient shower fittings. This helps to reduce energy and water consumption, lower utility bills, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br/><br/>16. To encourage wider adoption of more energy efficient products in households, NEA and PUB will enhance the Climate Friendly Households Programme. From 15 April 2024, all HDB households can look forward to receiving $300 worth of Climate Vouchers, which can be used to purchase ten types of energy- and water-efficient household products at participating retailers (See Annex C(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20C%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Enhanced%20Climate%20Friendly%20Households%20Programme.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20C%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Enhanced%20Climate%20Friendly%20Households%20Programme.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>17. NEA's Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) and the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) has helped consumers and businesses make informed decisions to purchase more energy efficient appliances. From 1 April 2025, we will expand the schemes to include household water heaters and commercial storage refrigerators (See Annex D(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20D%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20MELS%20MEPS%20for%20commercial%20storage%20refrigerators%20and%20household%20water%20heaters.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20D%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20MELS%20MEPS%20for%20commercial%20storage%20refrigerators%20and%20household%20water%20heaters.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>18. We are also helping businesses shift towards more circular and zero waste business models. NEA has worked with training providers and the waste management industry association to introduce a Zero Waste Manager course to train personnel to lead and champion waste management and reduction efforts in their organisations (See Annex E(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20E%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Zero%20Waste%20Manager%20Course.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20E%20-%20Media%20Release%20on%20Zero%20Waste%20Manager%20Course.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>Strengthening our Climate Resilience<br/><br/>Enhancing Coastal Protection<br/><br/>19. Sea levels are projected to rise by up to 1.15m by 2100 under the high emission scenario. We must protect Singapore from rising sea levels by ensuring that coastal protection measures are implemented effectively.<br/><br/>20. PUB will propose new coastal protection legislation to delineate the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, and safeguard land for coastal protection measures and future upgrades to cater for uncertainties in climate projections. It will also regulate and enforce against activities that could pose a risk to coastal protection measures and ensure that PUB's coastal protection standards are met. We intend to kickstart consultations on this new legislation this year (See Annex F(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20F%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Coastal%20Protection%20Legislation%20and%20Code%20of%20Practice.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20F%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Coastal%20Protection%20Legislation%20and%20Code%20of%20Practice.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>21. PUB also commenced a two-year study in November 2023, to develop a new Code of Practice to guide and standardise the design, implementation, as well as operation and maintenance of coastal protection measures.<br/><br/>Securing a Supply of Safe Food<br/><br/>22. We are working to transform our aquaculture sector, given its potential to contribute to Singapore's '30 by 30' vision. Along with other Government agencies, SFA is updating the Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP) in collaboration with key stakeholders, including industry, academics, nature groups by deep diving into ways to transform the aquaculture sector to be more productive and sustainable. The multi-stakeholder group is midway into its discussions and will consolidate its recommendations in an updated version of the SAP, to serve as a roadmap as we navigate the way forward for the sector (See Annex G(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20G%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Singapore%20Aquaculture%20Plan.pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/cos2024/Annex%20G%20-%20Media%20Factsheet%20on%20Singapore%20Aquaculture%20Plan.pdf</url>)).<br/><br/>23. We will introduce a Food Safety and Security Bill to strengthen our food safety and security regime to better protect consumers, and safeguard Singapore's food supply resilience. Industry consultations are ongoing, and public consultation will be conducted in phases starting from this month.</p><p>[Category: Household &amp; Personal Products, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063778768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGH-72V1-DXMP-K2WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1944\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 4, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

He has been a principal investigator for the multi-institute Cooling Singapore initiative since 2017, and leads interdisciplinary research on how Singapore's urban climate risks will change as its climate warms. </p><p> The elections of various top positions were held from Tuesday and are expected to conclude on Friday in Kenya's capital of Nairobi.</p><p> In a Linkedin Post on Thursday, Prof Chow said that he was honoured to have been elected.</p><p> \"I have never shaken so many hands in my life before -- but I guess it is a testament to the strong faith many countries have in my capacity to lead this body in assessing global climate change impacts and adaptation over the next several years,\" he added.</p><p> He stressed that solutions to the climate crisis cannot be \"ad hoc or piecemeal\", and that successful climate resilience that strengthens global climate action requires inclusivity and collaboration both within and beyond the IPCC community.</p><p> Congratulating Prof Chow, Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Facebook: \"With his experience, I am confident that he will serve the IPCC well.</p><p> \"A/P Chow will contribute towards a better understanding of the impact of climate change, and the continued development of resilient climate adaptation solutions.\" </p><p> Prof Chow will work with Professor Bart van den Hurk from the Netherlands, his fellow co-chair.</p><p> The IPCC's work continues to guide the global community, especially developing countries, in their environmental response. Singapore also takes reference from the panel's Seventh Assessment Report's (AR7) findings in refining the Singapore Green Plan 2030, said Ms Fu. </p><p> Prof Chow will also work closely with British Professor Jim Skea, the newly elected chair of the IPCC Bureau, in shaping the work of AR7, which will inform global climate action, she said.</p><p> Prof Chow had said on Saturday that in an increasingly climate-vulnerable world, human and natural systems face more adaptation challenges, especially communities that did the least to contribute to climate change. </p><p> Many are facing the worst risks arising from its impacts, he noted.</p><p> This underscores the need for a strong IPCC Working Group II assessment in order to enable the right adaptation approaches, reduce risk and help enhance climate resilience, he added.</p><p> The IPCC is divided into three working groups and a task force, and publishes reports every six to seven years to ensure that the scientific aspects of climate change are continually updated according to the latest available data. It is now in the seventh assessment cycle. </p><p> Each report comprises content from three working groups. Aside from Working Group II, Working Group I looks at the physical aspects of climate change, such as temperature rise, while Working Group III focuses on ways to mitigate climate change.</p><p> There are also special reports that zero in on particular issues, such as the ocean and its related ecosystems, as well as the links between climate change and land. </p><p> Each working group has two co-chairs -- one from a developing country and the other from a developed country -- with 15 vice-chairs across all three working groups. </p><p> The Ministry for Sustainability and the Environment said in April that it had nominated Prof Chow for the post, given his extensive experience in the field. </p><p> It noted that the IPCC had decided to include a Special Report on Cities and Climate Change in the AR7 cycle, an area where he has done extensive research and field work. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As a developing country co-chair, Associate Professor Winston Chow, a climate change scientist, will contribute to the IPCC Working Group II, which focuses on climate change impact and adaptation measures.

I thank the UAE Government, the City of Dubai, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising COP28 this year. I also thank the UAE COP Presidency for your leadership in advancing discussions and placing the focus of COP28 on facilitating a just and inclusive transition.</p><p>Amid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, the latest UNFCCC Synthesis Report has laid bare how far we are from achieving the Paris Agreement's goals. The world is on a pathway to 2.1-2.8C of global warming by 2100. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events today - from droughts in Africa and the USA, to heat waves in Asia and Europe - are clear warning signs for us to take decisive action and secure our collective future.</p><p>The first Global Stocktake presents a timely opportunity for the world to course-correct to keep the target of 1.5C within reach. This can only be achieved if we deliver substantive, inclusive, and balanced outcomes at COP28 across mitigation, adaptation as well as means of implementation. At this critical juncture, we need to foster even stronger multilateral cooperation than before. Today, Singapore reaffirms its commitment to domestic climate action, regional partnerships and global collaboration.</p><p>Domestic climate action</p><p>First, Singapore is committed to doing its part by delivering progress on domestic climate action.</p><p>Last year, Singapore raised our climate ambition. We submitted our enhanced Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) with a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and our updated 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce our emissions to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier.</p><p>Since then, Singapore has been focusing our efforts on implementation and delivering progress. Our climate targets are backed by concrete policies and plans.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax covers around 80% of our national greenhouse gas emissions and has one of the highest coverages in the world. We will raise our carbon tax level five-fold to 25 Singapore dollars, or around 19 US dollars, per tonne of emissions in 2024 and progressively to 50-80 Singapore dollars, or 37-60 US dollars, by 2030, making it one of the highest in Asia. This will send a strong price signal and drive emitters to decarbonise, while giving companies greater price certainty for forward planning.</p><p>We have mandated zero vehicle population growth since 2018 and have put in place policy levers to support our vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. Our 2040 target is for public, active and shared transport modes to account for 9 in 10 of all peak-period journeys.</p><p>We are developing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply ecosystem for Singapore. Neste, a Finnish energy company, recently completed its US$1.76 billion expansion to increase SAF production capacity to up to 1 million tonnes per annum, making Singapore home to the largest SAF production site in the world. Following a 20-month pilot completed in November 2023 which found Singapore to be operationally ready to supply SAF, we are developing a structural offtake mechanism to support SAF adoption in Singapore.</p><p>We have put in place stronger emission standards for the power sector. From 2024, we will require all new and repowered natural gas power plants to be 10% more efficient and at least 30% hydrogen-compatible by volume.</p><p>Singapore is alternative energy disadvantaged and faces an uphill challenge given the lack of domestic mitigation options. Nevertheless, we have invested in holistic and innovative solutions to overcome our constraints.</p><p>Although we have limited to no potential for hydroelectric, tidal, wind and geothermal power, we have spared no effort in harnessing solar power. We are already halfway towards achieving our target of 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar deployment by 2030.</p><p>Given our small physical size and high population density, we have made innovative use of our limited land. We have deployed large-scale floating solar farms, which leverage the surface area of our reservoirs to scale up solar deployment. In 2024, Southeast Asia (SEA)'s first floating and stacked Energy Storage System, Seatrium's Floating Living Lab, will also start operations in Singapore.</p><p>Regional partnerships</p><p>Second, Singapore is committed to working with other Parties to deliver on our pledges through regional partnerships. Through such collaboration, we aim to unlock decarbonisation potential across national boundaries more quickly and effectively for all Parties, to accelerate Asia's low-carbon transition.</p><p>One key enabler is the channelling of finance to catalyse our region's transition. It is estimated that Asia will need US$1.7 trillion in climate and infrastructure investments per annum through 2030. This is a substantial amount - it will be necessary to crowd in both concessional and commercial capital. At COP28, Singapore will announce Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships (FAST-P), a new blended finance initiative that aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion in finance. FAST-P will bring together public and private sector partners to de-risk and finance transition and marginally-bankable green projects in Asia. Through FAST-P, we hope that climate action will be realised as an opportunity for collective regional growth.</p><p>Another key enabler is the promotion of win-win partnerships to fast track our region's energy transition. As cross-border clean energy trade develops, Singapore has announced plans to import around 4GW of low-carbon electricity from Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam by 2035. This lead demand forms the buildings blocks of our joint vision of an ASEAN Power Grid, which will strengthen energy resilience and decarbonise power generation across Southeast Asia.</p><p>Beyond mitigation, regional partnerships are essential to strengthening our collective climate resilience. An important first step is to advance our common understanding of climate science and the regional impacts of climate change.</p><p>To support mutual learning, Singapore will share the findings from our Third National Climate Change Study (V3), the world's first high-resolution regional climate projections based on the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), with regional partners through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) and the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for the Southeast Asia Region. We will also work with partners to conduct more robust assessments of climate impacts in specific areas such as food, water and livability.</p><p>Singapore also actively participates in partnerships to advance adaptation priority areas such as food, water, and heat resilience, as well as coastal and flood protection.</p><p>By incorporating V3's regional climate projections into the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's climate risk assessment tools, regional partners can conduct climate change impact assessments on their agrifood systems.</p><p>These efforts complement our other capacity building programmes for water management and governance, such as the Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme. Similarly, for heat resilience, the National University of Singapore will host the Global Heat Health Information Network's Southeast Asia Regional Heat Health Node, to build regional capabilities in addressing extreme heat risks.</p><p>For coastal protection and flood management, Singapore has launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI). CFI Singapore forges strong connections with industry partners and international experts, to enhance capabilities and expertise in coastal and flood protection. Singapore will also continue to share our perspectives and knowledge through platforms such as the Singapore International Water Week and the International Panel on Deltas and Coastal Areas.</p><p>In line with the UN Early Warnings for All Initiative, which Singapore supported at COP27, we conduct regional capability building activities to strengthen our collective climate resilience. This includes training workshops under the ASMC Capability Building Programme in areas such as regional climate projections, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, as well as fire hotspot and haze assessments.</p><p>Global collaboration</p><p>Third, global collaboration is essential to ensure a just and inclusive transition. To accelerate implementation without leaving anyone behind, we must promote knowledge sharing and mutual learning among countries.</p><p>Singapore has been providing capacity building through our Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and its Sustainability Action Package (SAP). Close to 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations have participated in programmes covering topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance.</p><p>Multilateralism at platforms such as the UNFCCC continues to be key to ensuring a just and inclusive transition. Singapore is committed to helping forge global consensus, to achieve substantive, balanced and inclusive outcomes.</p><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu will co-facilitate the Ministerial consultations on Mitigation with Norway.</p><p>Chief Negotiator Joseph Teo will lead the Joint Contact Group for the Global Stocktake discussions as co-chairman with the UK.</p><p>As IPCC WGII's Co-Chair for the 7th Assessment Report (AR7) cycle, Associate Professor Winston Chow will help advance global assessments of climate change vulnerability and adaptation options, which will inform the second Global Stocktake in 2028. These findings will be especially valuable for fellow developing countries.</p><p>At COP28, Singapore is pleased to support the following initiatives which call for collective and inclusive climate action:</p><p>We have co-sponsored the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. Singapore's energy intensity is ranked 11th lowest, when compared to 38 OECD countries.</p><p>To demonstrate support for the COP28 Presidency's Early Coal Retirement Initiative to reduce global dependence on coal, the Singapore government is prepared to offtake transition credits if it meets our standards for high environmental integrity. This is aligned with COP28's focus on accelerating the energy transition, while ensuring sustainable socio-economic development.</p><p>As the country lead for package development under the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership, we will announce Ghana's Country Package for Forest, Nature and Climate.</p><p>To support the development of emerging technological and market solutions, we will also be signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and Implementation Agreements (IAs) on carbon credits and low-carbon solutions cooperation with countries such as Papua New Guinea.</p><p>We stand at a critical crossroads. The decisions we make, the actions we take at COP28 will shape the future of our planet and generations to come.

Both countries discussed collaboration opportunities in priority areas such as sustainable finance and FinTech and innovation, and exchanged views on recent developments in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) as well as efforts to improve cross-border payment connectivity.<br/><br/>Sustainable Finance<br/><br/>2. The UK and Singapore reaffirmed their commitment to scale financing in support of the net zero agenda.<br/><br/>a. Developments in transition planning: The UK and Singapore reaffirmed that globally comparable and sound transition plans are essential for the scaling of transition finance. The UK updated on the progress of the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT)'s disclosure framework following its publication in October 2023, and outlined plans for introducing expectations for listed companies' transition plan disclosures. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) shared its consultation on Transition Planning Guidelines in 2023, which set out supervisory expectations for financial institutions to have a sound transition planning process, as they build climate resilience and manage risks arising from the global transition to a net zero economy and the expected physical effects of global warming. The UK and Singapore also noted the importance of ongoing work at G20, Financial Stability Board (FSB), Basel Committee's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TFCR), International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in this respect.<br/><br/>b. Disclosure standards, ESG ratings and data products: The UK and Singapore re-affirmed their commitment to implement the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)'s standards to improve the consistency, comparability, and reliability of sustainability-related disclosures globally. The UK provided an update on its Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and its associated labelling regime. The UK and Singapore also discussed the voluntary codes of conduct for ESG ratings and data product providers that have been published in their respective countries, noting that both codes were aligned with IOSCO's recommendations. Both countries agreed to consider collaboration opportunities as the regulatory landscape evolves, including through IOSCO's Sustainable Finance Taskforce.<br/><br/>c. Sustainable infrastructure and investment: The UK and Singapore noted the large funding gap for Asia's green and transition finance, and agreed that there are opportunities to mobilise private capital for the net zero transition. Building on the September 2023 UK-Singapore Strategic Partnership Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore - 20230909 UK-SG Strategic Partnership (mfa.gov.sg) to accelerate regional sustainable infrastructure and investment, the UK and Singapore will collaborate to develop and finance green finance and energy transition projects in the region. MAS provided an update on Singapore's blended finance initiative, the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) Allied Climate Partners, International Finance Corporation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Temasek Establish a Green Investments Partnership in Asia , which will bring together key public, private and philanthropic sector partners to mobilise financing to de-risk and finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.<br/><br/>FinTech and Innovation<br/><br/>3. The UK and Singapore exchanged views on their respective approaches to manage risks and capture opportunities in the digital space.<br/><br/>a. Artificial intelligence (AI): The UK and Singapore discussed financial stability risks, cyber security risks, as well as supervisory considerations associated with the increased use of AI in the financial sector. Both countries agreed that international standards were key to facilitating innovation while managing risks to consumers, financial market stability and integrity, and explored areas for collaboration through international fora, such as IOSCO and FSB.<br/><br/>b. Cryptoassets: The UK provided an update on its final proposals for creating the UK's financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets, under which the government will bring a number of cryptoasset activities, such as exchange, custody, and lending activities, into the regulatory perimeter for the first time. The UK also updated on its plans to regulate certain fiat-referenced stablecoins and create the environment for stablecoin issuers and service providers to operate and grow in the UK.<br/><br/>c. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): The UK shared developments on progress following the publication of the \"digital pound\" consultation response paper on 25 January 2024, including a design phase which would be followed by a decision on whether to proceed with a retail CBDC. The UK also shared their thinking on wholesale payments, including on infrastructure supporting the settlement of tokenised transactions.<br/><br/>d. Tokenisation and distributed ledger technology (DLT): The UK and Singapore shared their respective projects and initiatives in tokenisation and DLT and agreed on the benefits of asset and fund tokenisation to the financial ecosystem, from broadened investor access to investment products to simplifying distribution and trading of such products digitally. As part of Project Guardian's policymaker group, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and MAS, together with the other policymakers MAS Partners Policymakers in Japan, Switzerland and the UK to Foster Responsible Digital Asset Innovation (mas.gov.sg) , aim to advance discussions on the regulatory treatment of digital assets. Both countries agreed to share learnings on how regulatory regimes could facilitate responsible innovation.<br/><br/>Developments in the NBFI Sector and Cross-Border Payment Connectivity<br/><br/>4. The UK provided an update on recent developments to address risks in the NBFI sector. Both countries underlined the importance of enhancing authorities' ability to monitor risks in NBFIs via better data gathering and sharing. They also agreed on the importance of finalising on-going international policy work on margining practices and NBFI leverage, and to subsequently implement agreed NBFI policies at domestic level. The UK and Singapore agreed to continue their collaboration to address vulnerabilities associated with NBFIs, including at IOSCO and the FSB.<br/><br/>5. The UK and Singapore reiterated their commitment to the G20's Roadmap to Enhancing Cross-Border Payments, including the FSB's priorities for this year as laid out in its most recent progress report. The BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre also shared the progress of Project Nexus BIS's Project Nexus prototype successfully links Eurosystem, Malaysia and Singapore payment systems; partners in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand to work towards wider payment connectivity (mas.gov.sg) , a multilateral approach to connect domestic instant payment systems to improve the speed, cost, transparency and accessibility of cross-border payments.<br/><br/>6. The UK and Singapore renewed their commitment to engagement beyond the Dialogue through a series of roadmap engagements to explore further cooperation in sustainable finance and FinTech and innovation, ahead of the next Financial Dialogue due to be held in the UK in 2025.<br/><br/>7. Two industry-led UK-Singapore business roundtables on Transition Planning and Generative AI will take place on 9 May 2024 with participation by industry participants from both countries.<br/><br/>a. The Transition Planning roundtable will examine current regulatory initiatives and next steps for Financial Institutions and their portfolio companies in their transition to net zero.<br/><br/>b. The Generative AI roundtable will discuss the challenges this technology poses for regulatory compliance and identify strategies to harness the benefits of generative AI while fostering innovation and protecting consumers.<br/><br/>8. The Dialogue was jointly chaired by Deputy Managing Director (Markets and Development) of MAS, Mr Leong Sing Chiong, and Director General (Financial Services) of HM Treasury (HMT), Ms Gwyneth Nurse. The Dialogue was attended by senior officials from MAS, HMT, Bank of England, FCA, the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore in London, and the British High Commission in Singapore.</p><p>Source: Monetary Authorityof Singapore</p><p>[Category: Banks, Non Banking Finance Company (NBFC), Banks, Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064160835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C0J-GH51-JB5M-W21R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 8, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRM9</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUVU</classCode><className>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

It put the health of millions at risk and cost Indonesia US$16.1 billion - twice the cost of reconstruction following the 2004 tsunami.</p><p> The human population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050. To meet global vegetable oil demand, land for oil palm cultivation will predictably double - from 14.6 million ha in 2019 to 31.1 million ha by 2050.</p><p> However, the current suitable oil palm climatic zones will shrink 22 per cent by 2050. This could lead to the migration of oil palm cultivation to replacement lands, triggering deforestation and biodiversity loss in newer ecosystems. Unsustainable land conversion of this scale will further deepen the climate crisis.</p><p> These predictions provide a stern warning for the industry - decarbonise now.</p><p>Discerning fact from opinion</p><p> Palm oil is among the world's most versatile raw materials - it is semi solid at room temperature and stable for long periods without going rancid. Its functional properties make it a key ingredient in everyday products - from bread and infant milk formula to toothpaste, washing-up detergent, and even cough syrup. It is almost impossible to avoid palm oil.</p><p> It is also the most efficient vegetable oil crop on the market. It meets 40 per cent of the global demand yet only occupies 6 per cent of the land used to produce vegetable oils. This makes it especially beneficial for the millions of smallholders who rely on palm oil for a steady income.</p><p> Replacement oils need between 4 and 10 times more land to produce the same yield, which only displaces and exacerbates deforestation and habitat loss.</p><p> Avoiding or replacing palm oil is not a viable solution; establishing sustainable life cycles is.</p><p>Why certified sustainable palm oil makes sense</p><p> Comprehensive and inclusive certification schemes, such as The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), mitigate environmental and social issues and ensure that demand is met sustainably. Several studies have sought to quantify the environmental impacts of palm oil certified by the RSPO.</p><p> A LifeCycle Assessment finds that RSPO certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) emits 35 per cent less GHG emissions and is associated with a 20 per cent lower impact on biodiversity compared to non-certified palm oil.</p><p>Malaysia's and Indonesia's GHG emissions from oil palm-driven land conversion alone have reached a staggering 1.4 per cent of the global aggregate, bringing it on a par with global emissions from the aviation industry. Given this reality, integrating climate resilience across palm oil supply chains is key to achieving net-zero status by 2050.</p><p> Arresting deforestation is the first step in this direction. With the industry projected to reach US$57.2 billion by 2026 - in tandem with population growth, growing affluence and bioenergy expansion - we need to find sustainable ways to meet this increasing demand.</p><p> CSPO improves the efficiency of palm oil production, reducing the need for land conversion and the risk of deforestation.</p><p> The second step is the reduction of GHG emissions. Peatlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, storing more carbon than all other vegetation types combined. This makes draining them for oil palm cultivation especially problematic. Annually, damaged peatlands release 5 per cent of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> Peatland conservation is therefore vital to our decarbonisation goal. The RSPO supports such conservation with criteria of no new planting on peat and no deforestation areas, a critical part in limiting the carbon footprint of palm oil. As my colleague and head of climate change unit at RSPO, Amir Afham, pointed out: \"Given the vital role that tropical forests and peatlands play in regulating global climate, we must continue to strengthen our standards and enforcement mechanisms, and push for sustainability over a boycott of palm oil\".</p><p> The third measure is the empowerment of local communities, improving the lives and livelihoods of millions. Malaysia is an ideal case, where palm oil has been a key contributor to reducing poverty from 50 per cent in the 1960s to just 5 per cent today; and where 40 per cent of oil palm growers are smallholder farmers.</p><p> To bring more independent smallholders into the sustainable supply chain, RSPO has sought to tailor compliance mechanisms and financial assistance to their needs. The RSPO Independent Smallholder Standard simplifies the approach to certification while the RSPO Smallholder Support Fund helps to offset the cost of audits. Together, these are essential in enabling smallholders to access international markets and command a premium for their produce.</p><p>Improving our toolkit</p><p> Palm oil supply chains are complex. While RSPO certification is not perfect, it is one of the most effective tools we have to achieve positive environmental and social change at scale.</p><p> RSPO continually improves its guidance on best practices and is committed to strengthening the assurance system's transparency and integrity. GeoRSPO, the RSPO Hotspot Hub, and building the capacity of auditors to better assess compliance with our standards are among the recent enhancements.</p><p> As we can see, palm oil per se is not the problem. If cultivated sustainably, palm oil can help combat the world's climate and biodiversity crises, and drive socio-economic development in rural communities.</p><p>Change requires collective action</p><p> A total of 93 per cent of the world's top palm oil companies have not publicly assessed climate risk, and 78 per cent of companies are yet to make public targets to reduce GHG emissions.</p><p> Life cycle assessments need more transparency. Just 16 per cent of producers report on how they are monitoring their zero-deforestation commitments, only 27 per cent report their total peatland cultivation areas, and an even fewer (15 per cent) report GHG emissions from land-use change.</p><p> Another big obstacle to progress is a lack of consumer awareness. Although RSPO certified products assure deforestation-free palm oil, the market takes up just over 50 per cent of what is grown to RSPO standards. Increasing the market share of CSPO is therefore a fundamental goal for both producers and consumers.</p><p> To deliver on climate action and shared responsibility goals, we need to garner stronger support from all stakeholders - growers, investors, governments, advocacy groups, and consumers.</p><p>The writer is global head of stakeholder engagement at The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Palm oil is among the world's most versatile raw materials - it is semi solid at room temperature and stable for long periods without going rancid.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-389066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64VD-BMT1-DYX4-019D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1241\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The guidelines aim to address the financial implications of climate change and the need for a transition to a net-zero economy. The effects of climate change, such as heatwaves, wildfires, and floods, are increasing globally, and there is an urgent need to fulfill net-zero commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p>* The proposed Guidelines on Transition Planning apply to banks, insurers, and asset managers.</p><p>* The consultation process aims to involve a broad range of stakeholders.</p><p>* The regulatory discussions internationally, such as the work by NGFS and the Basel Committees TFCR, have been beneficial.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Oct. 18 -- Monetary Authority of Singapore issued the following remarks by Ho Hern Shin, Deputy Managing Director (Financial Supervision), Monetary Authority of Singapore:</p><p>It is a pleasure to welcome everyone to the launch of a consultation on MAS' Guidelines on Transition Planning today. I am heartened to see the level of interest in this topic from across the globe and from different parts of the financial ecosystem.</p><p>The effects of climate change are clear and present. Record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires and floods are occurring with increasing frequency globally.</p><p>* There is great urgency to fulfil our collective net zero commitments.</p><p>* Linear trend extrapolation puts us at going beyond 1.5 degrees come September 2034 . That is just over a decade away, not very far away at all.</p><p>This trend, if not arrested, has significant financial implications for both companies and individuals.</p><p>* Business models that are unable to adapt to rising temperatures or meet the needs of the real economy as it seeks to transition towards net zero may become uncompetitive, or worse, unsustainable over the long term.</p><p>* Banks with exposures to real estate in low lying regions are exposed to greater flood risk as temperatures rise. This can increase losses.</p><p>* This impact to banks could be mitigated through insurance but such risks may become uninsurable.</p><p>* Since the beginning of the year, insurers representing more than half of California's US$12 billion home insurance market have either stopped or placed restrictions on issuing new policies. Regulations have prevented premium rates from rising to keep pace with ballooning costs, including those associated with the increased risks of wildfires and floods. This widened protection gap have left many with uninsured homes, and their mortgage banks carrying related risks.</p><p>Financial institutions (FIs) have the motive and means to actively support an orderly transition to net zero.</p><p>First, on motive.</p><p>* A disorderly transition will result in elevated financial risks, like sudden asset revaluations. It can also increase operational challenges, through business or supply chain interruptions brought about by more extreme weather patterns.</p><p>Second, on means to support an orderly transition.</p><p>* FIs are in a unique position of trust to engage their customers to shape corporate decisions.</p><p>- As lenders and underwriters, banks and insurers can raise customers' climate risk awareness and work with them to implement robust risk mitigation and adaptation measures as part of their due diligence and underwriting processes.</p><p>- As investors, FIs can also shape corporate behavior and climate responsiveness through engagement, proxy voting and sector collaboration.</p><p>The time to act is now.</p><p>* We cannot afford to wait till all the data is clean and the methodologies are mature. Catalysing change in the real economy takes time.</p><p>* FIs must act in unison, across jurisdictions, to avoid the perverse situation where customers seek financial solutions from FIs with lower climate ambitions, where the urgency or incentive to transition is absent. This will slow the pace of change in the real economy, thereby increasing the chances of a disorderly transition.</p><p>Encouragingly, some FIs have started to incorporate climate change considerations into their business strategies and risk management processes.</p><p>* This allows them to optimise business opportunities and build climate resilience over the longer term.</p><p>* We are defining this approach as transition planning in our proposed Guidelines.</p><p>As FIs develop and implement transition planning, supervisors can and should signpost the direction of travel and promote greater consistency in practices across FIs. Our Guidelines seek to do just this.</p><p>Amongst other things, the Guidelines clarify our expectation that transition planning must involve active customer and investee engagement on the need for them to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, including effective measures to reduce their carbon footprint. After all, customers' elevated climate related exposures will directly and negatively impact the climate resilience of an FI's balance sheet or portfolio.</p><p>We further clarify that -</p><p>* Engagement, rather than divestment, should be the key lever through which FIs steward their customers and investee companies' orderly transition to net zero . Indiscriminate withdrawal of credit, insurance coverage, or investments from customers or investee companies deemed to be more exposed to climate risks would hinder those with credible transition and adaptation plans from securing the financial support they need to make the transition.</p><p>* We also recognise in our Guidelines that supporting transitioning customers or investee companies may result in higher interim carbon emissions . From time to time, a real gap may also arise between planned and actual emission when targets are missed. These should not deter FIs from facilitating the needed transition of the real economy. Instead, FIs should provide clear disclosures and explanations to help correct market misperceptions that they have departed from their espoused risk appetites. Fis should also share the risk management steps they are taking to remediate the real variance.</p><p>* The guidance further exhorts financial institutions to keep up with the science, collect and analyse relevant data, and build improved capabilities to measure and manage climate and other related risks.</p><p>We are communicating our supervisory expectations early through the proposed Guidelines to create clarity and urgency for FIs to allocate the appropriate resources and commence this work in earnest now.</p><p>* The Guidelines on Transition Planning are proposed for all three sectors - banks, insurers, and asset managers.</p><p>* This will allow us to rally the financial industry around a common standard while taking sector differences into account - an approach which we had adopted for our earlier Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management and which the industry has found helpful.</p><p>We look forward to receiving comments on what supervisory guidance can push FIs to be proactive, deliberate and effective in their transition planning, and we look to involve as broad a range of stakeholders as possible in the consultation process.</p><p>* We have already benefited greatly from the regulatory discussions internationally, such as the work by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the current discussion on transition planning under the Basel Committee's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR).</p><p>* We hope to contribute to the ongoing discourse through this publication.</p><p>On this note, I wish you a very fruitful discussion subsequently, and hope that some of these ideas will be promulgated and bear fruit elsewhere, so as to bring us into a more sustainable, less risky future.</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp;

But now, the tides are telling a different story -- one of growing uncertainty and vulnerability in the face of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is also a story of resilience in the people's struggle to adapt to climate change and survive the disasters that it brings.</p><p> Like millions of people across Bangladesh, Mr Forhad Islam, 35, relies on agriculture to feed his family. But when he took charge of the family farm more than a decade ago, he struggled to grow crops because of the intrusion of salt water. </p><p> \"Our ancestors used to say that the land was our lifeline, but at some point, I felt like it was betraying us,\" said Mr Islam with a sigh. </p><p> He lives in the village of Katianangla in south-west Bangladesh, about 100km from the sea and near the river Pasur, a distributary of the Ganges. </p><p> Salinity is one of the natural characteristics in the rivers and groundwater in the coastal belt of Bangladesh. But as global warming leads to rising sea levels in this low-lying country, the salty seawater is moving farther inland. During high tides, ocean salt water enters rivers, and the groundwater has been getting saltier.</p><p> Because of this, the farmers in his village rely on rainwater. But rain is becoming rarer. \"Fresh water is scarce here, especially in winter and spring,\" said Mr Islam. \"Fortunately, it's been raining well this year for the last few days. It's a good sign for farmers like us. However, we also have to watch out for too much rain too, because flooding will not be ideal.\" </p><p> Mr Islam primarily grows rice. But with help from government and international non-governmental organisations, farmers like him are also growing produce that is tolerant to soil salinity, such as watermelons and coriander. </p><p> Apart from causing sea levels to rise, climate change is disrupting Bangladesh's rainfall patterns, leading to both unusual droughts and severe flooding. The once-predictable cycles of wet and dry seasons have become erratic, leaving communities vulnerable to devastating extremes.</p><p>Bangladesh is often referred to as \"ground zero for climate change\" because of its many vulnerabilities. It ranked seventh on the Long-Term Climate Risk Index of countries most affected by climate change from 2000 to 2019, according to the 2021 Global Climate Risk Index report. </p><p> Its vulnerability to climate change is rooted in its combination of geographical, demographic and socio-economic factors.</p><p> The country's low-lying deltaic terrain -- with 75 per cent of its land below sea level -- and coastal location expose it to rising sea levels and cyclones. These challenges are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure, poverty, high population density and lack of access to education, which amplify the nation's susceptibility to the impacts of a changing climate.</p><p> However, through innovation that blends traditional wisdom with modern technology, this South Asian nation of 170 million people is building resilience to the vagaries of climate change.</p><p> Combining low-tech community practices with high-tech innovations, the government and the people have devised strategies to fortify themselves against rising sea levels and more potent cyclones.</p><p>Bangladeshi farmers have brought back and updated traditional practices such as raised homesteads and floating vegetable gardens that help their families and farms stay afloat amid floods.</p><p> Sophisticated early warning systems and weather forecasting tools, combined with the old-fashioned word-of-mouth spreading of warnings to villagers without mobile phones, offer crucial lead time for people to prepare for disasters.</p><p> Being more resilient has also involved updating and strengthening some of the country's 139 polders or artificial islands below sea level that are reclaimed by building embankments, drainage canals and pumping stations.</p><p> The polders have existed in Bangladesh since the 1960s and they have protected the coastal community from flooding and tidal waves for years, said Mr Krishna Pod Das, a local engineer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. </p><p> But over time, as climate change forced the sea level to rise, coupled with other factors like gradual erosion over time due to lack of maintenance, the old mechanism of the polders became ineffective, he said.</p><p> In 2013, the board, together with the Department of Agricultural Extension, implemented a project to strengthen, rehabilitate and improve the main water infrastructure of 22 coastal polders with funding from the Netherlands.</p><p> Putting in new sluices and drainage systems and repairing old ones have ensured that water is efficiently managed. \"We can now control when to let the water in or out. We can regulate the intrusion of salt water; we can also expel excess water to prevent flooding and unnecessary water clogging,\" said Mr Das.</p><p> Re-strengthened polders proved to be a lifeline for farmers like Mr Islam, as they reduce salt-water intrusion significantly and expel water when it rains too much, to prevent crop damage.</p><p> Professor Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, a research institute based in Dhaka, said the country has made remarkable progress in adaptation. \"It's a learning-by-doing process,\" he said.</p><p> While these tweaks have succeeded in safeguarding lives and property, the fact remains that as global warming worsens, vulnerable nations will face ever more disasters and their poorest people will bear the fullest impact of these catastrophes.</p><p> \"People living in the worst places in the worst conditions will always get hit first. That is true within a country and also true globally. So poor people are the most vulnerable to climate change and they bear the biggest brunt of it,\" Prof Huq said.</p><p> For all the country's efforts, estimates suggest that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change, and up to 20 million people may have to move because of sea-level rise.</p><p> The battle to build a safety net for its people is not one that Bangladesh can fight alone. International institutions like the United Nations and World Bank play a pivotal role, said Prof Huq. </p><p> As it looks to international assistance, Bangladesh is also sharing its experience in combating climate change.</p><p> For the last 50 years, the World Bank has supported Bangladesh to build climate resilience and improve disaster risk management, noted Ms Dandan Chen, a representative of the World Bank, in a report in 2022.</p><p> \"Today, the country shares valuable experience in improving disaster preparedness and climate resilience and is an inspiration for other climate-vulnerable nations,\" she added.</p><p> Redwan Ahmed is a freelance journalist based in Bangladesh.  His work focuses on human rights violations and climate change, among other things.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mr Forhad Islam working in his padi field in the village of Katianangla.

MAS has also issued two other similar consultation papers for asset managers and insurers. </p><p> The consultation papers also proposed that financial institutions (FIs) should not view short-term increases in their portfolio's financed emissions negatively. </p><p> Instead, their investments or loans to finance the transition activities of high-emitting companies should be viewed against potential longer-term improvement in their customers or investee companies' climate risk profiles. </p><p> Higher emissionsSpeaking at the launch of the consultation papers on Wednesday, Ho Hern Shin, deputy managing director for financial supervision at MAS, said that supporting transitioning customers or investee companies may result in higher interim carbon emissions. </p><p> \"From time to time, a real gap may also arise between planned and actual emission when targets are missed. This should not deter financial institutions from facilitating the needed transition of the real economy. Instead, financial institutions should provide clear disclosures and explanations to help correct market misperceptions that they have departed from their espoused risk appetites,\" she explained. </p><p> Other proposed guidelines include how FIs can take a multi-year approach for a more comprehensive assessment of a company's climate-related risks, as well as a more integrated approach towards risk assessment, as the risk drivers of a net-zero transition are complex. </p><p> An integrated approach also means taking into account environmental risks such as the loss of nature capital and biodiversity.</p><p> To improve the transparency and credibility of their transition planning processes, FIs also should communicate how they have implemented their strategies and risk management processes to various stakeholders, whether through sustainability reports or general purpose financial reports.</p><p> In the consultation paper, MAS proposed to provide a transition period of 12 months after the guidelines are issued, so that FIs can assess and implement them where appropriate. They should also implement the final guidelines in a way that is commensurate with the size, nature and risk profile of their activities. The transition planning processes are also not set in stone, and MAS expects FIs to adapt their processes along with changes in best practices. </p><p> MAS managing director Ravi Menon said that indiscriminate divestment from carbon-intensive activities will not lead to a net-zero world. </p><p> \"Rather, financial institutions must actively support their borrowers, insured parties, and investee companies to progressively decarbonise their activities through credible transition plans,\" he noted. </p><p> \"We may have to accept short-term increases in financed, facilitated, or insurance-associated emissions arising from these plans, provided these plans support climate-positive outcomes consistent with a net-zero pathway.\"</p><p> The public consultation ends on Dec 18.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-JA4OCHN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69DX-JPJ1-DYX4-000G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

At every turn, this turbulent environment tests the resilience and adaptability of companies and countries alike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Cutting through the noise of these churns and disruptions to secure growth requires incisive and inclusive actions that not only alleviate immediate pains but also charts the Forward Singapore road map for a competitive and sustainable future. </p><p> For businesses, three key thrusts introduced by the fourth-generation leadership of Singapore are noteworthy. </p><p> Adapting to a new tax worldA new tax world has dawned upon us with the global minimum tax regulations, also known as Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 Pillar Two.</p><p> This is going live this year in major economies such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.</p><p> Finance Minister Lawrence Wong has confirmed that Singapore will implement two components of Pillar Two -- the Income Inclusion Rule and Domestic Top-up Tax -- in 2025. The Undertaxed Profits Rule will, however, be considered at a later stage.

This ranges from macroeconomic volatility, escalating geopolitical tensions and international tax upheavals, to the climate crisis and the emergence of new technologies. At every turn, this turbulent environment tests the resilience and adaptability of companies and countries alike.Cutting through the noise of these churns and disruptions to secure growth requires incisive and inclusive actions that not only alleviate immediate pains but also charts the Forward Singapore road map for a competitive and sustainable future. For businesses, three key thrusts introduced by the fourth-generation leadership of Singapore are noteworthy.Adapting to a new tax worldA new tax world has dawned upon us with the global minimum tax regulations, also known as Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 Pillar Two.This is going live this year in major economies such as Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.Finance Minister Lawrence Wong has confirmed that Singapore will implement two components of Pillar Two - the Income Inclusion Rule and Domestic Top-up Tax - in 2025. The Undertaxed Profits Rule will, however, be considered at a later stage. </p><p>With Pillar Two, Singapore's ability to use tax incentives to attract foreign direct investments is undermined. To adapt, Budget 2024 refreshes the country's incentive toolbox with new fiscal schemes such as the new Refundable Investment Credit (RIC) - a scheme of tax credits with a refundable cash feature to attract sizeable investments in key economic sectors and new growth areas. Under Pillar Two, where the refundable tax credit scheme is designed to be paid as cash or cash equivalents within four years from satisfying the qualifying conditions, they are treated as income like cash grants (instead of reduction of income taxes), thus having less downward pressure on the jurisdictional effective tax rate. For a multinational enterprise group that is already burdened with top-up tax liability, the new RIC and cash grants might therefore be a more appealing option. For a nation, extending preferential tax rate (meaning giving up taxing rights) is seen as an opportunity cost, while providing grants and subsidies constitutes a direct cash outlay. The award of the latter must therefore be measured to effectively manage the country's fiscal budget. But ultimately, the selected tax policy and incentive framework must affirm Singapore's steadfast commitment to supporting high-quality high-value investments.Bolstering business competitivenessSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) serve as a vital backbone to our business ecosystems. The Partnerships for Capability Transformation programme will be enhanced to support local enterprises in deepening their capabilities to compete on the world stage. For many SMEs, the escalating costs of doing business in Singapore persist as a central worry for business owners. To address the immediate cost concerns, businesses will be accorded a 50 per cent corporate tax rebate for year of assessment 2024 (capped at S$40,000), an enhanced enterprise financing scheme, and enhanced co-funding of wage increases. The above measures are useful but not the panacea for productivity growth. It takes an unwavering commitment to drive productivity growth - one that catalyses sustainable economic growth and leads to improved living standards and societal well-being. Embracing emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) could be a game-changing solution to enhance productivity and drive technological transformation. Underlining this potential, Singapore is strategically positioning itself as a global contender in the AI sphere. The government's pledge to invest over S$1 billion in the next five years to spur AI activities demonstrates this bold ambition. Furthermore, there are plans for vital moves including securing access to essential AI components such as graphics processing units, and forging partnerships with leading firms to establish AI centres of excellence. These initiatives aim to cultivate a vibrant culture of innovation, attract global expertise and build a resilient AI ecosystem.Additionally, Budget 2024 provides enhanced support, including a substantial top-up to SkillsFuture Credit and financial support in the form of generous training allowances for full-time courses and subsidised diploma education, for mature mid-career Singaporeans to pursue meaningful reskilling and upskilling throughout their lifetime. Safety nets will also be put in place to help those made redundant. These continual efforts to invest in our human capital are essential to ensuring Singapore's competitiveness as a regional business hub. Now, it leaves Singaporeans and businesses to garner the determination to succeed in seizing the opportunities to innovate, change and transform, or risk inertia and falling behind.Securing climate resilience A secure economic future must be a climate-resilient one - and businesses play a crucial role in contributing to the fruition of the Singapore Green Plan. Given its position as a trade node and hub, Singapore can wield significant influence on the region's green transition and lead in driving the green economy.Budgetary measures have been established to bolster the green loan scheme and enhance grant support for businesses to embark on projects aimed at energy efficiency and reducing emissions. Energy security is addressed by diversifying the sources of cleaner energy, including importation of low-carbon energy, investment in new liquefied natural gas infrastructures, and early-stage feasibility studies into the future use of hydrogen and nuclear energy. In times of unrelenting uncertainties, the courage to double down on long-term priorities and dexterity in meeting short-term demands is vital. Budget 2024 signals the commitment and conviction of the fourth-generation leadership that Singapore and its people can - and indeed, must and will - sail through the winds of change.The writers are from Ernst &amp; Young Solutions.

Singapore is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has raised its climate ambition. The country has implemented a carbon tax and plans to increase it to 25 Singapore dollars per tonne of emissions in 2024. Singapore is also focused on transitioning to cleaner energy for vehicles and has set a target for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. The country is investing in sustainable aviation fuel production and has implemented stronger emission standards for the power sector. Singapore is actively engaged in regional partnerships to unlock decarbonization potential and strengthen climate resilience. The country is also committed to global collaboration and supporting initiatives for collective and inclusive climate action. The decisions and actions taken at COP28 will have a significant impact on the future of the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p>* Singapore aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>* Singapore's carbon tax will be raised to 25 Singapore dollars per tonne of emissions in 2024 and progressively to 50-80 Singapore dollars by 2030.</p><p>* Singapore has mandated zero vehicle population growth since 2018 and aims for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Dec. 2 -- National Climate Change Secretariat, Government of Singapore issued the following remarks by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean:</p><p>Remarks by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean at Rwanda's National Carbon Markets Framework Launch at UNFCCC COP28</p><p>Her Excellency, Dr Jeanne d'Arc Mujawamariya, Minister for Environment, Republic of Rwanda</p><p>My friends from Rwanda and from Singapore, and other guests today.</p><p>Distinguished Guests</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p><p>Rwanda and Singapore are long time, steady friends and I am delighted to be here today to launch this event which marks a new phase in our good friendship. I would like to express my thanks to our friends from Rwanda for inviting me to join this occasion.</p><p>Let me start by congratulating you on this momentous first step that Rwanda is taking to participate in carbon markets aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a pernicious, global challenge. Emissions from one country affect every other country, and for this reason, international cooperation is key.</p><p>Multilateralism was the spirit in which Article 6 of the Paris Agreement was established, to allow countries to pursue voluntary cooperative approaches, and in doing so achieve greater climate ambition than they could on their own. Singapore played a small part in getting Article 6 from an Article in the agreement into the implementation phase, which will allow us to turn Article 6 into reality. We co-facilitated the discussions on implementation at the UNFCCC conferences. Carbon markets have great potential to channel investments toward additional mitigation outcomes that would not have been otherwise feasible.</p><p>Singapore and Rwanda, as fellow small states, share a close working relationship. We have cooperated in areas such as fintech and cybersecurity, and we had a very successful fintech festival in Rwanda this year. I am delighted that our countries are now deepening our cooperation through carbon market collaboration.</p><p>Singapore's approach to this emerging partnership will be underpinned by investment, interlinkages, and resilience.</p><p>First, investment.</p><p>Singapore stands ready to work with our companies to invest in Rwanda's climate future. The Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE) had earlier this year in October 2023 signed an MOU with the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, to deliver projects in areas such as carbon trading. Our companies are keen to explore carbon market projects in Rwanda.

Having made its name in basic manufacturing in the 1970s and precision components in the 1980s, Singapore is now a regional services hub, central to international flows of trade, investment, finance and talent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> To continue that success into the future, Singapore will need to evolve again -- this time to respond to the urgent and complex challenges posed by climate change. </p><p> As daunting as that sounds, this also presents an opportunity for the country to play to two of its core strengths: innovation, to design the clean technology that will help the world decarbonise, and finance, to deliver that technology at scale. </p><p>Singapore is the most innovative economy in Asia, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Global Innovation Index, published in September 2023. And the country recently entered the top 10 in a global ranking of start-up ecosystems by US research company Startup Genome, rising to eighth from 18th and overtaking Seoul, Shanghai and Tokyo in the process.</p><p>Singapore's status as a finance and capital hub has also grown in recent years. It now manages around $5 trillion of assets, with more than three-quarters coming from overseas investors.</p><p> With this combination of expertise and financial clout, Singapore is well placed to become a global centre for excellence in cleantech. As the world searches for solutions to the climate crisis, that would be an invaluable next step in the city's ongoing evolution. </p><p> Incentives to actAccelerating cleantech investment will be critical to Singapore's future in more ways than one. </p><p>Singapore is one of the lowest-lying nations in the world, with an average elevation of only 15m above sea level, so it is particularly vulnerable to flooding from rising sea levels. It faces constraints due to its small size and lack of natural resources. Labour costs are high, and access to clean energy is limited by the lack of available land for solar or wind farms. </p><p> On top of all this, Singapore needs to find new ways to create high-quality, future-proofed jobs for citizens at a time when the costs of living and property prices are rising.</p><p> Cleantech helps to solve this development conundrum. It does not require vast amounts of natural resources or low-cost labour. But it can help to position Singapore's economy for long-term growth by leveraging its strengths as a hub for talent, academic research and investment. </p><p> Developing and embracing new technologies for the energy transition -- such as those that can make construction, shipping or aviation less carbon-intensive -- creates an opportunity for Singapore's economy to evolve once again. Supporting and commercialising innovation in these fields will allow the country to maintain a leading position in high-value global supply chains as they decarbonise.</p><p> Leading from the topThe Government has recognised the importance of the green economy and has made cleantech innovation a core component of the nationwide Green Plan. It is supporting research into sustainable technologies through agencies such as the National Environment Agency and the Economic Development Board (EDB), and is promoting itself as a regional hub for new, technology-enabled business models such as carbon trading. The EDB has estimated that carbon trading services could add up to US$5.6 billion (S$7.5 billion) of value to the economy by 2050.</p><p> What's more, initiatives like the Singapore Government-backed Sustainable Development Open Innovation Challenge provide invaluable funding and mentorship to start-ups. And the city's world-class research institutions, such as the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, have centres dedicated to sustainability and cleantech. </p><p> The Government also sees technology as a tool to mobilise financial resources for green investments. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched an ESG Impact Hub in 2022 to support the building of tech solutions to address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) needs of corporates and financial institutions, such as measurement and reporting of climate and sustainability data.</p><p> MAS is also expanding its scope of tax incentives for single-family offices in Singapore to encourage them to invest in local environmental and social causes. That includes extending tax incentive coverage to blended finance structures -- a form of financing typically used to fund sustainable developments -- and recognising overseas climate-related investments.</p><p> Where innovation  and finance meetWith a supportive policy environment, more companies are using Singapore as the springboard for their cleantech ventures. The list of start-ups able to access funding in Singapore includes companies working on agri-tech, green hydrogen, battery recycling, energy efficiency software, energy storage technology and bioenergy. And a number of multinationals have chosen Singapore for major investments into sustainable aviation fuel, bio-based polymers and clean mobility, among others. </p><p> At the early stage of the investment life cycle, Singapore provides ready access to a vibrant ecosystem of 4,000 start-ups, 220 venture capital firms and over 200 accelerators -- many of which are increasingly focused on cleantech and sustainability. </p><p>Singapore-based Antler, for example, has embedded ESG metrics in a partnership that will give Antler's portfolio companies access to banking services from HSBC, including venture debt and working capital.</p><p> Some companies are already building whole business models around cleantech innovation. For others, it's about taking the first step in applying technology to reducing emissions or contributing to climate resilience.</p><p>Singapore has a lot to offer them all; its commitment to -- and vested interest in -- the success of cleantech is clear. It may soon be rivalling London, New York and even Silicon Valley as a sustainability tech hub. One thing is for sure: the city will not be standing still. </p><p> The writer is the managing director and head of commercial banking, HSBC Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-RK6VIST</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B6R-T3T1-DYX4-002B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1025\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Good morning everyone. I was just here earlier for the \"Women in Carbon\" breakfast so happy International Women's Day. To all of you, a warm welcome to Singapore. I really want to thank you for inviting me again for the second edition of Carbon Forward Asia.<br/><br/>2. At last year's Carbon Forward Asia, I spoke of the importance of moving the needle on climate change, and how Singapore can be a catalyst for carbon markets and international cooperation. Last week, at the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Committee of Supply (COS) debate, I also highlighted the need for Singapore to encourage trade flows in areas such as carbon credits. Collectively, we have made important strides both globally and regionally.<br/><br/>Strong Global Momentum on Climate Issues<br/><br/>3. On the global front, 2023 was significant for the completion of the first Global Stocktake (GST) at COP-28 and adoption of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience as part of the UAE Consensus.<br/><br/>4. Although there was little progress on the operationalisation of Article 6.4 at COP-28, Article 6.2 remains operational since the establishment of the rulebook at COP-26 in 2021. Countries are already engaging in Article 6.2 collaboration. Most recently, the world's first Article 6.2 transaction was completed between Switzerland and Thailand. This has set the stage for more Article 6.2 transactions to come, and we are confident many more high-quality projects will continue to come from Asia.<br/><br/>Carbon Market Developments in Asia<br/><br/>5. Asia has been actively developing international carbon markets. Allow me to update you on some of these developments.<br/><br/>a. Malaysia's Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) completed its first carbon credit auction in March 2023.<br/><br/>b. Indonesia launched its first carbon exchange IDX, in September last year 2023.<br/><br/>c. Vietnam has announced plans to pilot a carbon trade exchange next year with full operations expected in 2028.<br/><br/>d. Thailand submitted its Premium T-VERS (Premium Thailand Voluntary Emissions Reduction Program) for CORSIA eligibility in May last year.<br/><br/>e. Bhutan became the first country to be fully integrated with Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust) to prevent the double counting of carbon credits. It also announced the substantive conclusion of negotiations with Singapore on a legally-binding agreement for Article 6 collaboration in Dec last year.<br/><br/>f. In January this year, Cambodia launched its operations manual for the Implementation of Article 6.<br/><br/>6. Countries are also working together for progress. In September 2023, ASEAN adopted the Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to accelerate the region's transition towards carbon neutrality. One of its goals is to develop carbon markets that are interoperable with one another and with global markets. 2023 also saw the launch of the \"ASEAN Alliance on Carbon Markets\" (AACM), the first private sector led body aiming to support the growth of both voluntary and compliance markets in the region.<br/><br/>7. We firmly believe that Asia is poised to play a pivotal role for international carbon markets, and Singapore is committed to unlock its full potential.<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Carbon Markets<br/><br/>8. On the sidelines of COP-28, Singapore signed our first Implementation Agreement, or \"IA\", with Papua New Guinea on carbon credits collaboration. I am glad I can share this here, almost one year after I met with Simo Kilepa, the Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea, who was in Singapore for the inaugural Carbon Forward Asia. The IA between Singapore and Papua New Guinea sets out a legally binding framework between two countries, to enable the international transfer of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>9. There are three key principles undergirding the IAs which we are working on:<br/><br/>10. First, to enable high quality carbon credits projects to be developed to generate benefits for the host country in the form of sustainable development outcomes, including bringing investments and new jobs. Singapore published our Environmental Integrity (EI) criteria last year. Our Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has also established an International Advisory Panel for Carbon Credits (IAPCC) to advise Singapore on maintaining a robust and transparent carbon market.<br/><br/>11. Second, to enable faster time-to-market. Singapore's IAs are designed to tap on existing carbon crediting programmes and methodologies. This allows us to ramp up the operationalisation of our IAs and provides more clarity for project developers. Singapore published our List of Eligible Methodologies in December for the Papua New Guinea Agreement, which includes methodologies under Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard, American Carbon Registry and Global Carbon Council.<br/><br/>12. Third, to support climate adaptation in host countries and also overall mitigation of global emissions. Singapore's IAs support host countries by contributing a 5% share of all authorised carbon credits towards climate adaption in these countries. We will also cancel 2% of all authorised carbon credits as an additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions (OMGE).<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Green Finance/Transition<br/><br/>13. Beyond these G2G agreements, Singapore is also expending efforts to address the region's growing green and transition finance needs, which are necessary for the growth of the carbon markets.<br/><br/>14. Last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the launch of a new Transition Credits Coalition, called \"TRACTION\". This coalition of ecosystem players will help identify barriers and potential solutions to develop transition credits as a viable market solution, such as credits from the early retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs).<br/><br/>15. MAS also launched a new blended finance platform called Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or \"FAST-P\", which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk and finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.<br/><br/>Working with the Private Sector<br/><br/>16. We need to keep innovating and improving on our existing approaches to accelerate climate action. This is not something that governments can do alone.<br/><br/>17. We need businesses and ecosystem players to continue the momentum set last year. These include companies who are innovating to support the development of carbon markets. In the last few years, we have seen innovations in areas including insurance for carbon credits, such as with carbon credit insurers Kita, and ratings agencies providing independent ratings on projects such as with Sylvera and BeZero. We are glad these companies have decided to establish a presence in Singapore.<br/><br/>18. Today, we have over 120 companies in our carbon services and trading ecosystem. We welcome the incubation of more of these businesses in Singapore and are keen to be involved in the co-creation of solutions to spur on the developments of carbon markets, especially in Asia.<br/><br/>Closing<br/><br/>19. Let's work together to continue supporting a thriving and growing carbon services and trading ecosystem to capture opportunities in a low-carbon future.<br/><br/>20. I wish the organisers a successful and fruitful event.<br/><br/>21.

One year after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor (GDSC), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach have completed a comprehensive baselining study. It forecasts more green jobs, health improvements for local communities and economic benefits for participating countries, emphasising the future demand for zero and near-zero emission fuels and the benefits from decarbonising the shipping routes between the nations.</p><p>2. The study, commissioned by C40 and the ports, and conducted by the American Bureau of Shipping, analysed maritime trade flows between Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach, and provided a baseline of activities and energy demand requirements for vessels operating on the corridor through to 2050. The conclusion of the study follows the successful unveiling of the corridor's Partnership Strategy at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28/CMP18/CMA5) in December 2023, which outlined the corridor's goals, partnership structure and governance mechanism. The study estimates the quantity of near-zero and zero-emission fuels required for this traffic by modelling the adoption of zero and near-zero carbon alternative fuels by vessels operating on the corridor through to 2050, considering various parameters such as fuel production costs and fuel availability, and in view of the targets in the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships[1]. The study can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://c40.me/3xF60Yw\">https://c40.me/3xF60Yw</url>.</p><p>3. On a practical level, the study highlights the potential socio-economic impact of transitioning to zero and near-zero emission fuels and leveraging on digital solutions. Based on the study's estimates, the corridor at full implementation could create over 700 new job opportunities in zero and near-zero emission fuel production and improve local air quality. These estimates support findings by C40 and other organisations that activities undertaken through green shipping corridors can catalyse wider decarbonisation across the maritime industry and unlock health benefits for local communities and green economy opportunities for participating countries.</p><p>4. As leading global ports, Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach are vital nodes on the trans-Pacific shipping lane and are key stakeholders in the maritime sector's green and digital transition. Alongside 20 leading ports and port cities, MPA, POLA, and POLB are members of C40's Green Ports Forum, a prominent global platform for collaborative climate action that actively champions ambitious green shipping corridors, acknowledging their central role in the ports and shipping sectors' green transition.</p><p>5. The corridor partners underscore their dedication to a data-driven decision-making approach through the study, utilising its insights to guide their actions in pursuing the partnership's decarbonisation objectives and aligning with the decarbonisation goals of the shipping sector. Key findings of the study include:</p><p>* Vessels operating on the corridor represent 7% of the world's container trade, which is about 1% of Singapore's, 14.5% of Port of Long Beach's, and 20% of Port of Los Angeles' traffic.</p><p>*The projected annual energy demand of vessels on the corridor is estimated to be approximately 60,000 terajoules (TJ), equivalent to approximately two months of Singapore's national electricity generation.</p><p>*Shipping demand on the corridor is estimated to be around 850,000 tons of methanol and 160,000 tons of ammonia annually by 2030, displacing the equivalent GHG emissions from almost 320,000 cars annually.</p><p>*The transition to zero and near-zero emission fuels could potentially create approximately 700 jobs in the production and supply chain of such fuels by 2030.</p><p>6. The partnership convened the first in-person stakeholder meeting of the corridor together with industry value-chain representatives, as a prelude to onboarding stakeholders to the corridor. The meeting was held during Singapore Maritime Week (SMW) 2024 on 18 April.</p><p>7. The meeting and subsequent working groups will focus on developing green and digital solutions to address the following focus areas within the corridor:</p><p>1. Enable the supply and adoption of zero and near-zero emissions fuels (e.g. green ammonia, green methanol) at scale, including safety, emergency response, mitigation and standards-setting.</p><p>2. Develop and scale-up the adoption of energy efficiency solutions, including through digital tools (e.g. route optimisation, remote monitoring) and technologies that reduce fuel consumption (e.g. wind-assisted propulsion).</p><p>3. Develop and encourage the adoption of digital technologies to support the monitoring, reporting and verification of GHG emissions along the corridor.</p><p>8. All three ports will participate in the Accelerating Digitalisation and Decarbonisation Conference organised by MPA as part of SMW 2024 and in a moderated discussion convened by C40 on the sidelines of SMW 2024 entitled 'Navigating Collaboration: Governance of Green Shipping Corridor Partnerships', where C40 will unveil its new report and share insights into best practices for GDSC effective governance.</p><p>9. Mr Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of MPA, said: \"Shipping is a new pillar in the multi-faceted partnership with the US. The GDSC with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach highlights the importance of working with industry, researchers, government and society through innovation and capacity building. With traffic along the GDSC accounting for 7% of the world's container trade, the initiatives by GDSC partners and stakeholders will help generate growth and new opportunities for maritime professionals.\"</p><p>10. Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said: \"This study provides a sense of scale and scope to inform our implementation of the Green and Digital Shipping Corridor. Achieving the reductions of greenhouse gas emissions required will take coordination and commitment from public and private stakeholders across the maritime and goods movement industries. We're proud to be collaborating with industry partners to make this corridor a reality.\"</p><p>11. \"The Port of Long Beach and its partners have been very successful reducing emissions from cargo-handling equipment, trucks and other mobile sources moving cargo in our harbor,\" said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero. \"One of the most important parts of this partnership is it allows us to better understand and target a source of emissions that is hard for us to control as a local seaport authority - shipborne emissions. This work, vital to our net zero-emission quest, will result in economic and health benefits all along the trans-Pacific trade corridor.\"</p><p>12. C40 Executive Director, Mark Watts said: \"Accelerating efforts to decarbonise the shipping sector is urgent if we are to limit global heating to 1.5C. C40 is proud to support this first-mover initiative which has the potential not only to support the development and uptake of low- and zero-carbon fuels and vessels, but also create good green jobs and health benefits for local communities by doing so.\"</p><p>About the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)</p><p>MPA was established on 2 February 1996 with the mission to develop Singapore as a premier global hub port and international maritime centre, and to advance and safeguard Singapore's strategic maritime interests. MPA is the driving force behind Singapore's port and maritime development, taking on the roles of port authority, maritime and port regulator and planner, international maritime centre champion, national maritime representative and a champion of digitalisation and decarbonisation efforts at regional and international fora such as at the International Maritime Organization.
