Co-founder Chris Hulls, who has led the company since its founding nearly two decades ago, will transition to Executive Chairman, where he will be actively involved in shaping Life360's vision and product innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This leadership change demonstrates the company's commitment to long-term planning as it delivers on the succession plan put in motion nearly two years ago. It comes at a pivotal moment in Life360's evolution, as it expands into new product categories and global markets, and progresses toward $1 billion in revenue. With 88 million monthly active users and counting, Life360 is steadfast in advancing its mission to keep people close to the ones they love in new and meaningful ways.</p><p>Antonoff, a seasoned, strategic operator with a product-first mindset, has spent the last three decades at renowned technology companies driving growth through a relentless focus on the customer experience. Antonoff joined Life360 in 2023 as Chief Operating Officer. Over the past two years, she has upleveled the company's senior leadership team, launched the advertising business, and deeply integrated hardware experiences, all while expanding Life360's value to families worldwide. Under her leadership, Life360 delivered record-breaking growth, including a 36% year-over-year revenue increase in the most recent quarter.</p><p>Antonoff joined Life360 from GoDaddy, where she spent seven years, most recently as President of its US small business segment.

I'm energized and honored to lead the company forward, staying grounded in our mission and focused on delighting our members with products that deliver real peace of mind.\"</p><p>Hulls' impact is reflected in every aspect of Life360-from the product experience to its values-driven culture. As Executive Chairman of the Board, Hulls will continue championing the free member experience, supporting breakthrough initiatives, and partnering closely with Antonoff to shape the company's long-term vision.</p><p>\"What started as an idea in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, to help families reconnect in moments of crisis, has become a platform trusted by millions around the world. I could not have imagined how far we'd come, or how many families we'd impact,\" said Hulls. \"Lauren and I share a bold vision for Life360, and we knew early on it would require a shift in operations to support the scale and speed at which we want to move. I couldn't be more confident in Lauren's ability to lead us forward. She brings rigor, heart, and deep product insight-and we've built a foundation of trust and alignment that makes this passing of the baton seamless.\"</p><p>John Philip Coghlan, who served as Chairman of the Board for over 16 years, will continue as a Board member. \"From the very beginning, John has been a constant advisor and mentor and has been instrumental in guiding Life360 through every major milestone. We are fortunate to retain his insight and experience, and I look forward to our continued work together,\" added Hulls.</p><p>\"On behalf of the Board, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his vision and leadership in bringing Life360 to where it is today. This leadership transition reflects years of thoughtful planning, strong alignment, and growing momentum. I have every confidence that Lauren's inspirational leadership will deliver incredible value for Life360's members and shareholders alike,\" said Coghlan.</p><p>Mark Goines will assume the role of Lead Independent Director, providing independent oversight, facilitating Board operations, and supporting strong communication between the Board and leadership.</p><p>Life360 is continuing its evolution into the family super app that fosters connection and coordination by bringing together location sharing, device-based trackers, and safety services in one seamless experience.

A group of volunteers searched a wooded area for someone who had been injured and stranded, ready to provide aid. Then they practiced a river rescue, attaching a rope near the bank to help pull the victim to shore.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was Rescue HQ, a gathering in rural Tennessee last month where the founding members of several newly formed disaster response groups ran through emergency scenarios and discussed how to better coordinate in the chaotic aftermath of a storm or a flood.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Groups like this are growing in number - a new model of disaster response taking shape outside of government channels. Many volunteers are deeply religious and have military backgrounds.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They're an unequal match for what the government can do, especially when it comes to long-term rebuilding efforts after natural disasters. But with the Trump administration pulling back staffing and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency - and even pledging to eliminate it - communities may soon rely far more on volunteer help.       </p><p>\"The bigger the gap is in terms of what the government isn't doing, the more we're going to expect from nonprofits and the larger their role is going to be,\" said Daniel Sledge, a professor at the University of Oklahoma who has studied disaster relief. \"Whether nonprofits actually have the capacity or the ability to step in and fill in the gaps that, in all likelihood, we're going to be creating is a completely different question.\"       </p><p>Mr. Trump said this month that he wanted to phase out FEMA after this year's hurricane season, which ends on Nov. 30, and shift much of its responsibilities to the states. Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA as the homeland security secretary, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, are overseeing a group that will submit recommendations in the coming months about how to reshape or sharply scale back the agency.       </p><p>Ms. Noem argued recently that the changes would \"empower governors to go out and respond\" to emergencies. FEMA, she said, \"has failed thousands, if not millions, of people, and President Trump does not want to see that continue into the future.\"       </p><p>Asked what role outside groups should play in disaster relief moving forward, a spokesperson for FEMA said in an email, \"Together with federal, state, tribal, local and territorial agencies, we're strengthening and enhancing partnerships.\"       </p><p>Already, FEMA has lost at least a quarter of its full-time staff since Mr. Trump took office in January, according to a former senior official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to not jeopardize a new job. That number includes career officials who helped coordinate immediate disaster response and leaders who oversaw the most hurricane-prone regions in the country.       </p><p>And after a series of experienced emergency managers led the agency in recent years, an acting administrator with no comparable experience is now in charge.       </p><p>A flurry of new disaster response groups sprang up last fall, as residents of western North Carolina expressed deep frustrations with the government's response to Hurricane Helene's catastrophic flooding. These groups were sometimes the first to reach people in isolated parts of the region.       </p><p>\"Us private citizens, we can get in there - if we're one state over, we could hook up our trailers and get in there,\" said Austin Fryer, 23, a member of one such group, the Christian Rangers. \"FEMA - they have all this large amount of stuff that has to be organized, it has to accounted for. It can't just be handed out willy-nilly.\"       </p><p>While nonprofit volunteer groups have far less red tape to navigate than government agencies do, they face other challenges, including coordinating with local officials and not duplicating other relief efforts. There can be personality and ego clashes or competition among groups with differing priorities.       </p><p>There can also be other motives. Some extremist groups saw an opportunity to embed in communities and spread conspiracy theories after Hurricane Helene. Some organizations have learned to carefully vet potential volunteers, which can be difficult in the first chaotic days of a catastrophe.       </p><p>\"To really try to identify what gaps might be there in the absence of FEMA - that's the million-dollar question,\" said Jeff Byard, a former federal and state emergency official who is now a senior vice president with Team Rubicon, a disaster aid group that formed after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Its teams just finished annual hurricane training in Texas.       </p><p>In those first days of response, he added, \"You don't want to create a disaster on top of a disaster and you don't want to impede good will.\"       </p><p>The scale of devastation from Helene, and the difficulty navigating flooded, mountainous terrain in its aftermath, kept government aid from reaching some remote communities right away; in its absence, misinformation ran rampant. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate in the final weeks of his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, fanned the flames with some false or misleading claims about the federal response.       </p><p>The experience further weakened trust in FEMA, whose reputation took perhaps its worst hit after its botched response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.        </p><p>\"The people we took care of didn't really care if they existed or not,\" said Mike Toberer, the owner of Mountain Mule Packer Ranch in Mount Ulla, N.C., referring to FEMA. \"But I would say they do have a role if it's done correctly.\"       </p><p>Mr. Toberer did not participate in the training in Tennessee, but he loaded supplies on the backs of his mules to help residents and aid groups navigate flooded-out roads during Helene. He also helped deliver supplies last month in eastern Kentucky, after deadly tornadoes.       </p><p>\"We just want to get help to the people and that's it,\" he said.       </p><p>Newer groups need to develop detailed protocols and reliable funding streams to make sure that their work is sustainable and reputable, and that it doesn't hinder the work of local officials, said Brian Trascher, the vice president of the United Cajun Navy, which formed in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. Members of his group worked with some of the groups in Kentucky after the tornadoes.       </p><p>\"We've turned into a full-fledged logistical disaster response group,\" he said, adding that the organization's practices had been shaped over the years by lessons learned in each successive disaster. Regardless of what happens to FEMA, he said, nonprofit groups like his are better positioned to assist with on-the-ground relief because they can be more nimble.       </p><p>\"I'm trying to do my best to advise and help other groups that are trying to get out there and help folks,\" he said. \"The more boots you can summon in a hurry, the better.\"       </p><p>The training in Tennessee allowed those who took part to share experiences and build trust should they need to coordinate at a disaster site. Some had worked on disaster response in only the United States, while at least one man, Sky Barkley, works with the Free Burma Rangers, an aid organization that does work in Myanmar and other countries.       </p><p>\"Don't ever make promises you can't fulfill,\" Mr. Barkley told the circle of volunteers, as he recounted ways he worked with communities in unfamiliar regions. \"You make a promise you can't fulfill - 'Hey, yeah, I'll take care of it' - and you don't do it? They will not trust you again.\"       </p><p>They practiced navigating unfamiliar terrain with a compass and providing basic medical care. In a circle, they spoke about how to approach people in need of help without intimidating them. They also prayed; as people were arriving on the first day, one participant prayed for everyone to be able to set their egos aside and learn from one another.       </p><p>The gathering was a chance \"to get more experience and a refresher,\" said Regena Moultrie, a resident of northeastern Georgia and a member of Operation Outreach America, a new organization that responded to Helene in North Carolina.       </p><p>Some of what they learned at the training came in handy weeks later, when a few members headed to Kentucky after tornadoes barreled through. They coordinated in a group chat, and then introduced themselves to a local church and local officials before driving around the most devastated neighborhoods, looking for people in need of help.       </p><p>\"It gives you a little boost as far as that there's still good people that are willing to help out - it just, it really lifts you up in ways people could never imagine,\" said Tressa Calhoun, who choked back tears as three volunteers with the Christian Rangers got to work securing the tarp on her roof that had already begun to leak. \"It'slike a renewal of faith<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.\"</emphasis></p><p>Lisa Friedman contributed reporting from Washington.

In front of him was a labyrinth of targets and corridors he'd have to maneuver through as part of the firearms training course he hoped would add something to his life beyond the mundane day-to-day. He shifted his weight. An instructor, trying to provide direction, asked his question again:       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Who in this scenario are you fighting to rescue? Your wife? Girlfriend?       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Hay, 37, had spent his adult life wrestling with some version of that question: Who, or what, in his life was worth risking it all for?       </p><p>After nearly a decade working in occupational therapy, a divorce, cross-country moves and hobbies that offered only fleeting escapes from his day job, Mr. Hay was reckoning with how to define himself as he approached middle age. That's how he found himself, carbine in hand, racking his brain to think of a human he would be desperate to save in this fictional scenario.       </p><p>Quiet, with an easygoing gait and a mop of brown hair tucked under a ball cap, Mr. Hay stood just inside the entrance of a shoot house, a live-fire range modeled after a home. The exercise would train participants on what to do in case they confronted an armed intruder - an existential worry on the minds of those who had signed up. It was the final day of a rifle course at Thunder Ranch, a firearms skills training outfit in eastern Oregon. The sun was out and snow melted on the surrounding hills. Spotted clouds touched the horizon.       </p><p>Thunder Ranch is where you go to understand close combat with a rifle. But after three days and close to 1,000 spent rounds of ammunition, it was clear that for Mr. Hay, shooting was less of an educational opportunity and more of a realization that he still needed something more.       </p><p>\"In the last year that feeling has been creeping in,\" he said. \"I'm realizing it ain't the setting, it ain't the state. It's just me.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Confronting the Reality of Violence</emphasis></p><p>Set at the edge of the Fremont National Forest among plateaus and sagebrush, not quite halfway between Portland and Reno, Thunder Ranch occupies a special place in the pantheon of firearms education in American gun culture. Clint Smith, the ranch's founder, has reached a level of celebrity in the gun community through popular YouTube videos, a book and more than a half-century of expertise that sets Thunder Ranch apart from traditional shooting courses. It has been called \"Disneyland for men.\"       </p><p>Mr. Smith, a gruff-talking Marine CorpsVietnam War veteran and a former police officer, opened Thunder Ranch in 1993, before YouTube and bargain-bin training DVDs showed civilians how to shoot. He went out of his way to illustrate the reality of violence, especially when it came to self-defense.       </p><p>It was that kind of no-nonsense message that brought Mr. Hay more than three hours from his home in western Oregon with his Subaru and camping gear to take Thunder Ranch's flagship class: Urban Rifle 1. For those seeking a sense of direction, learning how to defend yourself and your loved ones, if you have some, can satisfy something deep within the basal ganglia even when everything else feels adrift.       </p><p>After settling in at his camp ground on the outskirts of Lakeview, a lumber town with a modest population of around 2,500 people, Mr. Hay inspected his gear: tan combat boots, small first aid kit, magazine belt and the main tool of Urban Rifle 1 - his AR-15.       </p><p>\"I'm not going to say I'm a doomsday prepper,\" he said. \"But I think it's important as American citizens to know how to implement these skills.\"       </p><p>Thunder Ranch, with 877 acres of shooting ranges and rolling hills of pine, is off a state highway marked by an inconspicuous mailbox 10 minutes outside of town. After passing under a covered bridge and turning onto a dirt road toward the range, you're greeted with a white and black sign: Welcome to Thunder Ranch This is Not a Gun Free Zone.       </p><p>On the first day of the course, around 9 a.m., the dozen or so students of Urban Rifle 1 introduced themselves. The group congregated around a modest conference table wearing name tags, sunscreen and varying degrees of tactical apparel. Mostly they came from across the American West. In addition to transportation and lodging, the course costs around $2,000, less if you bring your own ammo.       </p><p>Many shooting classes in the United States tend to focus on core firearms skills like gun safety and the basics of marksmanship. But they can also act as a Rorschach test of sorts as students like Mr. Hay try to gain insight into their own lives. At Thunder Ranch, participants leave behind their professional identities to live in a reality where violence is an important part of their personal puzzle. How they respond to it can give them a sense of what they're made of, who they are.       </p><p>Alongside Mr. Hay were a father and son from Houston who worked together in finance and had nearly matching AR-15 rifles. A distributor of windows and cabinets from the Seattle area had a \"Punisher\" skull on his rifle, a problematic image given the symbol's association with extremism in some cases. This man shouted expletives at the cardboard targets after he shot them (he was quickly corrected by the instructors for both the yelling and the skull motif).       </p><p>One of the two women in the course, a retired administrator for a firearms company, said that she had a choice of a week in Cancun, Mexico, with her husband, or three days at Thunder Ranch. She chose cardboard targets over Mayan ruins.       </p><p>When the students were asked if there were any veterans in the class, Mr. Hay, who had enlisted in the Marines in 2007 when he was 19, remained quiet.       </p><p>Mr. Hay graduated boot camp and completed his training as a radio operator, only to arrive at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and break his right ankle three weeks later. He spent months in rehabilitation and surgery in South Carolina and voluntarily left the service soon after because of his injury.       </p><p>\"It is one of my regrets,\" he said of spending less than a year in the Marines. \"It felt like I had failed at something.\"       </p><p>His decision to leave the military - opting out of what he saw as a life of adventure and growth - gnawed at Mr. Hay. He graduated from college with an associate degree and started a career in occupational therapy, following the path his parents took. After he broke his ankle in the Marines, the work seemed admirable: His therapists at Naval Hospital Beaufort were inspiring.       </p><p>But in 2023, after a divorce and burning out in various occupational therapy roles, including home care, he moved to western Oregon.       </p><p>\"It was my first restart, like a hard reset,\" he said. \"Just got rid of everything and I packed my car up and came out here.\"       </p><p>On the first day, the class instructor and director of training, a former career police officer named Jack Daniel, went through a three-page handout detailing the course. In a nod to the fierce pace and the proficiency the students were expected to demonstrate with their rifles, Mr. Daniel, flanked by American flags and AR-15s, assured them that by the end of the three days, they'd be \"running around with our hair on fire.\"       </p><p>Afterward, Mr. Hay and his classmates trudged with their rifles up a hill bracketed by pine trees and enveloped by the smell of sap. The shooting range was covered in gravel, with cardboard and steel targets at one end and the cement shoot house known as \"The Terminator\" at the other. Mr. Hay faced cardboard silhouette No. 7, and for the next few days and countless drills, he would fire hundreds of rounds of ammunition into the man-shaped cutout.       </p><p>The three instructors, Mr. Daniel, Colton Miller and Brandon Amaya, were experienced shooters. Mr. Daniel and Mr. Amaya were law enforcement officers. Their tone was professional (\"We don't do politics here\"). They took turns in front of the students, preaching lessons from their time in the field and on the range.       </p><p>To Mr. Hay, the instructors embodied the type of drive or commitment that he might have gained from time in the Marines if he had stayed in, or if he had picked a career outside of occupational therapy.       </p><p>\"I envy their lifestyle,\" Mr. Hay said of the instructors. \"I envy it because you can tell that those guys get true passion in what they're doing, it means something to them. I'm jealous of that. I've never found something like that in my life.\"       </p><p>Mr. Hay bought his first guns - a Colt AR-15 and a 12-gauge shotgun - when he was in his early 20s. After he left the military, shooting guns for fun became \"a self development\" exercise, he said, and an important pursuit outside of work. He watched as occupational therapy became less about helping people and more about the \"vicious billing cycles\" grinding away at his patients, he said. Shooting was time spent in nature, away from people, where he could hone his skills, much as he did when lifting weights at the gym or practicing martial arts.       </p><p>\"It's very helpful at the moment, but I would not say it addresses the overall issue in my life,\" he said, referring to his listlessness and lack of satisfaction during this chapter. He said he was close to \"the point of no return,\" where he no longer felt like a young man and dreams he once had would soon be out of reach.       </p><p>Self-defense, a key line of instruction at Thunder Ranch, had also become important to him. Mr. Hay grew up in New Orleans and experienced the lawlessness that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and turned his hometown into a \"free fire zone,\" he said.       </p><p>\"In my younger life, I didn't feel confident in my own abilities to defend or take care of myself,\" he said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'There Has to Be Something Better'</emphasis></p><p>On the last day of class, Mr. Hay sat at the counter of Tall Town Cafe &amp; Bakery in Lakeview, a tidy breakfast spot with posters of the actors John Wayne and Clint Eastwood on the walls. He was pensive, parsing through the last two days of shooting, the coming long drive home and, of course, whatever the future might hold.       </p><p>His hobbies, whether shooting or spending time outdoors, weren't enough to balance the frustrations of his profession, and he grappled with a growing feeling of futility. Perched on a stool after ordering a breakfast burrito, he said that if he didn't pull himself out of this funk in the next few months, he would try to join the U.S. Navy as an officer or the French Foreign Legion, a military unit famous as a haven for wayward men.       </p><p>\"I think I'm done trying to find fulfillment on nights and weekends,\" Mr. Hay said of his litany of hobbies and failed relationships.       </p><p>\"There has to be something better than waking up every goddamn day and feeling like you're doing nothing,\" he said.       </p><p>As Mr. Hay lamented, a pinup of Mr. Eastwood as the fictional dirt farmer turned outlaw Josey Wales stared at his back. The 1976 film set during the American Civil War saw Mr. Eastwood's character on a search for redemption with two revolvers pinned on his chest.       </p><p>A few hours later, Mr. Hay was standing at the mouth of the shoot house for the final exercise, his carbine in hand. Soon he would push forward, slowly maneuvering through wooden doorways and around tables. Finally he would turn a corner and shoulder his weapon - and blast a paper target full of enough holes that it fell to the floor. Yet he found no answers in the report of the gun.       </p><p>\"Who's your person?\" Mr. Amaya, the instructor, asked. \"You got a wife? You got kids?\"       </p><p>Mr. Hay paused.       </p><p>\"It's just me,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000010219428</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH4-9N13-RT03-046N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 16, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX002104</classCode><className>OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp;

Yet it's also become a showcase for lesser-known talent: local schoolchildren.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gospel choirs from area high schools took the stage Friday at the festival\u2019s famed Gospel Tent, continuing a decades-long tradition for Louisiana students.</p><p>First up to perform was the Eleanor McMain choir, jolting the audience with a blast of musical joy, from the rollicking call-and-response of \u201cMelodies From Heaven\u201d to an a cappella rendition of the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d</p><p>Choir member Chloe Bailey, 18, said the performance is about pride.</p><p>\u201cNot only do I get to make myself proud, my parents proud, I get to make the whole world proud and have a look of how beautiful it is to see Black people and Black children thriving and going up higher, because we don\u2019t get a lot of opportunities like this,\u201d she said.</p><p>In a city with a rich music heritage, the festival is a prized opportunity to celebrate arts that teachers say do not receive the attention they once did in schools.</p><p>Music education suffered in New Orleans in the 1990s due to funding cuts, said Matthew Sakakeeny, a professor of music at Tulane University. Up until then, majority Black schools typically had at least one full-time music teacher, even when schools were segregated, but dozens of teachers lost their jobs and offerings were \u201cdrastically cut back,\u201d he said.</p><p>Hurricane Katrina was another blow, leading to the city's traditional public schools being replaced with charter schools. Sakakeeny said there\u2019s enormous pressure to focus on core academics, rather than arts, as they\u2019ll get shut down if their test scores are not good enough.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just ironic that we\u2019re the birthplace of jazz, yet middle school students, elementary school students might not even go to a music class,\u201d said Emeka Dibia, the choir director McDonogh 35, the first public high school established for Black students in New Orleans.</p><p>Gospel has been an integral part of Jazz Fest since it began in 1970, headlined by gospel legend Mahalia Jackson. Students from McDonogh 35 started performing in the 1970s, and more schools followed, Dibia said. It\u2019s now tradition for Jazz Fest to have a day featuring student gospel choirs.</p><p>Even the artist featured on this year\u2019s official Jazz Fest poster, Tarriona \u201cTank\u201d Ball of Tank and the Bangas, performed in the Gospel Tent when she was in ninth grade.</p><p>Choirs from another historic Black public high school, L.B. Landry, as well as two local Christian schools performed Friday, while McDonogh 35 will perform next week.</p><p>McMain soloist Tyree Arso, 18, said it\u2019s amazing to think about performing at the same festival as artists like Lil Wayne.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me recognize the people who have come before me, and it reminds me to try to do my best to honor them,\u201d said Arso, who will attend the Boston Conservatory at Berklee next year.</p><p>Gospel choir is an extracurricular activity at schools like McMain, where choir director Clyde Lawrence has been mentoring young singers for decades. He said religious music is allowed in a public school setting because there\u2019s educational value to learning about a variety of musical styles.</p><p>\u201cI want to expose them to our heritage, to gospels, to hymns,\u201d he said.</p><p>Choirs are paid to perform at Jazz Fest, which provides funding for arts education. But the opportunity matters for other reasons to students like Leah Hawkins, a sophomore at McDonogh 35.</p><p>Leah says she\u2019s been surrounded by gospel her whole life, but in front of an audience she\u2019d shake with stage fright. Her mom told her to join choir anyway: \u201cYou\u2019re going to sing.\u201d</p><p>Since then, Leah, 16, said her confidence has blossomed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t care about what people think. If you have a voice then use it, it doesn\u2019t matter what it\u2019s for,\u201d said Leah.</p><p>Her choirmate Wesley Whitsett, 17, said he also needed an adult to push him to get over his nerves. Both students sang with a student choir at the opening of this year's Super Bowl, performing \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d with Ledisi.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I could do that. I thank God that he gave me the opportunity to sing,\u201d said Wesley.</p><p>Yet even for kids who have performed at the Superdome, there's something about the Gospel Tent stage. There may have been millions of people watching the Super Bowl, but Jazz Fest represents New Orleans\u2019 soul.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what kind of feeling it is,\u201d said Leah. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big feeling, I can say that.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20250426studentgospelsingerstakestageatneworleansfestivalknownforcelebrityactsutmsourcelexisnexisutmcaignfeedscultureutmmediumreferral</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRICN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FND-TV33-RRV5-4005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">478671</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><timeReceived>12:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euronews SA  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Africanews (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 26, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>TULANE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas, Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Louisiana</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001753</classCode><className>ARTS FESTIVALS &amp;

They found that 84 percent of hurricanes during that period were significantly strengthened by human-caused ocean warming.</p><p>While their two studies focused on the Atlantic Basin, the researchers said that their methods could be applied to tropical cyclones globally.</p><p>Climatologist Friederike Otto of Imperial College London, who leads World Weather Attribution, praised the team's methodology for advancing beyond previous research that primarily linked climate change to hurricane-related rainfall.</p><p>Otto warned that these climate supercharged storms are occurring with the world at just 1.3C (2.3F) above pre-industrial temperatures, and that the impacts are likely to worsen as temperatures rise beyond 1.5C (2.7F).</p><p>\"The hurricane scale is capped at Category Five -- but we might need to think about, should that continue to be the case just so that people are aware that something is going to hit them that is different from everything else they've experienced before,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFY-TFP1-F19C-X0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

From war zones to natural disasters, the role of animals in humanitarian crises has long been overlooked, he said.</p><p><br/><br/>While emergency response teams mobilise to save human lives, companion animals, livestock, and wildlife often remain an afterthought, leading to severe consequences for both humans and animals.<br/><br/>At a recent high-level event, 'From Resilience to Recovery: The Role of Animals in Humanitarian Crises', in Brussels, experts, policymakers, and NGOs gathered to discuss the need for integrating animal welfare into disaster response frameworks. \"We hope to revitalise the dialogue to improve things - for animals and for people,\" Tombrock remarked.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy void in EU disaster response</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/>\"During the recent floods in Central Europe, the Polish government advised people to evacuate with their animals,\" Tombrock said. \"However, the fire brigade responsible for most evacuations stated that their transport methods were not equipped to evacuate animals.\"<br/><br/>Similarly, during the 2021 floods in Belgium and Germany, animal protection organisations were not permitted to enter disaster areas because they were not listed in emergency protocols. Refugees fleeing Ukraine with pets faced a different challenge: inconsistent entry and quarantine rules across EU member states.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human-animal bond in crises</emphasis><br/><br/>The exclusion of animals from disaster planning has significant consequences beyond logistics. It also affects human mental health.<br/><br/>Tombrock stressed the psychological toll of forced separation from pets: \"Mental health is big on the agenda. The separation of people from their pets could really be harmful. Studies show that losing a pet in a crisis can lead to significant emotional distress, compounding the trauma of displacement,\" he told Euractiv.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Separation anxiety</emphasis><br/><br/>A 2024 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927936.2023.2287315?_ga=2.134455605.512767309.1739954948-936875533.1739954948&amp;_gl=1*1grpdsj*_gcl_au*MTYxNDE0NDYyNS4xNzM5OTU0OTQ5*_ga*OTM2ODc1NTMzLjE3Mzk5NTQ5NDg.*_ga_0HYE8YG0M6*MTczOTk1NDk0OS4xLjAuMTczOTk1NDk1My41Ni4wLjA.\">study</url> titled 'A Scoping Review of Forced Separation Between People and Their Companion Animals' by Jasmine Montgomery and colleagues at James Cook University reviewed 27 years of research on the human-animal bond in crises. The study found that forced separation between humans and their animals during crises can have profound mental health consequences.<br/><br/>\"One of the most excruciating situations is forced separation when people are compelled to leave their pets behind,\" said Tetiana Yeskova, Head of the Project Management Office at the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. \"Many people refuse to leave their homes and pets behind. This bond provides emotional stability in times of crisis.\"<br/><br/>This dilemma often forces individuals to stay in dangerous situations rather than abandon their animals.<br/><br/>Research from Hurricane Katrina in 2008 found that the loss of a companion animal during a disaster was linked to increased anxiety, acute stress, and long-term mental health issues.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ukraine: a case study in animal welfare at war</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/>The war in Ukraine has underscored the urgency of including animals in disaster response frameworks. \"This has been the biggest war conflict in Europe since the Second World War,\" said Lithuanian MEP Petras Austrevicius of Renew Europe and Vice President of the Intergroup of the Welfare and Conservation of Animals.<br/><br/>\"It has not only shattered cities and displaced civilians but also left deep scars on the lives of ordinary people and the animals who shared their homes.\"<br/><br/>Millions of animals have been abandoned, and bombed-out shelters, farms, and zoos paint a grim picture of war's impact beyond human casualties. \"Many of those fleeing from Russian attacks refused to leave their pets behind,\" Austrevicius added, \"Animals don't abandon people - sometimes, people abandon animals.\"<br/><br/>Humane World Europe and its partners have worked to mitigate this crisis. \"With the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, we launched the VETS for Ukrainian Pets programme, which enabled refugees in 38 European countries to request reimbursement for veterinary expenses,\" said Tombrock.<br/><br/>Yeskova highlighted another crucial initiative of the Ukrainian Red Cross: \"Our National Pet Care Programme was launched to ensure people fleeing war could care for their pets without additional burden. We provided over 500,000 kilogrammes of pet food, distributed 100,000 kilogrammes of litter, 10,000 litter boxes, 10,000 pet carriers, and 16,000 pet supplements. This essential aid enabled us to support over 55,000 pet owners and around 120,000 pets.\"<br/><br/>She further noted the emotional impact of forced separation: \"For many Ukrainians, pets are more than animals; they are family. Having to leave them behind adds immense emotional distress on top of an already traumatic experience.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy gaps and the need for EU action</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>While NGOs play a critical role, policy changes are needed to integrate animal welfare into humanitarian response frameworks. Paolo Dalla Villa, Technical Officer for Disaster Management at the World Organisation for Animal Health, highlighted the shortcomings in disaster preparedness.<br/><br/>\"Historically, humanitarian efforts primarily focus on saving human life. However, experience has shown that support and assistance of communities in these situations is more effective if disaster management and risk reduction plans are in place for animals too.\"<br/><br/>Dalla Villa called for stronger legislative recognition at the EU level. \"Disaster management operational frameworks must pre-exist and cannot be improvised,\" he said.<br/><br/>\"NGOs, the private sector, and civil society should be actively engaged by creating a memorandum of understanding and agreements, developing and maintaining a roster of accredited volunteers fully embedded in any disaster management system.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A stronger push for change</emphasis><br/><br/>Jeff Flocken, Chief International Officer of Humane World for Animals, emphasised that action must move beyond awareness.<br/><br/>\"We've had incredible successes, like the bans on fur farming in Romania and Italy, and we helped push for a fur-free Europe,\" he stated. \"But the next step is ensuring that policymakers see disaster planning for animals not as a luxury, but as a necessity.\"<br/><br/>He pointed to the broader impact on human welfare: \"We know that leaving animals out of emergency plans leads to mental health issues, delayed evacuations, and additional trauma for those affected. The EU has the tools to change this - it just needs the political will.\"<br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionhealthconsumersnewsdisasterpreparednessforanimalstimeforeutoactsaysnonprofitgroup</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6D-WM53-RTY0-2022-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

From war zones to natural disasters, the role of animals in humanitarian crises has long been overlooked, he said.</p><p><br/><br/>While emergency response teams mobilise to save human lives, companion animals, livestock, and wildlife often remain an afterthought, leading to severe consequences for both humans and animals.<br/><br/>At a recent high-level event, 'From Resilience to Recovery: The Role of Animals in Humanitarian Crises', in Brussels, experts, policymakers, and NGOs gathered to discuss the need for integrating animal welfare into disaster response frameworks. \"We hope to revitalise the dialogue to improve things - for animals and for people,\" Tombrock remarked.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy void in EU disaster response</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/>\"During the recent floods in Central Europe, the Polish government advised people to evacuate with their animals,\" Tombrock said. \"However, the fire brigade responsible for most evacuations stated that their transport methods were not equipped to evacuate animals.\"<br/><br/>Similarly, during the 2021 floods in Belgium and Germany, animal protection organisations were not permitted to enter disaster areas because they were not listed in emergency protocols. Refugees fleeing Ukraine with pets faced a different challenge: inconsistent entry and quarantine rules across EU member states.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human-animal bond in crises</emphasis><br/><br/>The exclusion of animals from disaster planning has significant consequences beyond logistics. It also affects human mental health.<br/><br/>Tombrock stressed the psychological toll of forced separation from pets: \"Mental health is big on the agenda. The separation of people from their pets could really be harmful. Studies show that losing a pet in a crisis can lead to significant emotional distress, compounding the trauma of displacement,\" he told Euractiv.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Separation anxiety</emphasis><br/><br/>A 2024 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927936.2023.2287315?_ga=2.134455605.512767309.1739954948-936875533.1739954948&amp;_gl=1*1grpdsj*_gcl_au*MTYxNDE0NDYyNS4xNzM5OTU0OTQ5*_ga*OTM2ODc1NTMzLjE3Mzk5NTQ5NDg.*_ga_0HYE8YG0M6*MTczOTk1NDk0OS4xLjAuMTczOTk1NDk1My41Ni4wLjA.\">study</url> titled 'A Scoping Review of Forced Separation Between People and Their Companion Animals' by Jasmine Montgomery and colleagues at James Cook University reviewed 27 years of research on the human-animal bond in crises. The study found that forced separation between humans and their animals during crises can have profound mental health consequences.<br/><br/>\"One of the most excruciating situations is forced separation when people are compelled to leave their pets behind,\" said Tetiana Yeskova, Head of the Project Management Office at the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. \"Many people refuse to leave their homes and pets behind. This bond provides emotional stability in times of crisis.\"<br/><br/>This dilemma often forces individuals to stay in dangerous situations rather than abandon their animals.<br/><br/>Research from Hurricane Katrina in 2008 found that the loss of a companion animal during a disaster was linked to increased anxiety, acute stress, and long-term mental health issues.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ukraine: a case study in animal welfare at war</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><br/><br/>The war in Ukraine has underscored the urgency of including animals in disaster response frameworks. \"This has been the biggest war conflict in Europe since the Second World War,\" said Lithuanian MEP Petras Austrevicius of Renew Europe and Vice President of the Intergroup of the Welfare and Conservation of Animals.<br/><br/>\"It has not only shattered cities and displaced civilians but also left deep scars on the lives of ordinary people and the animals who shared their homes.\"<br/><br/>Millions of animals have been abandoned, and bombed-out shelters, farms, and zoos paint a grim picture of war's impact beyond human casualties. \"Many of those fleeing from Russian attacks refused to leave their pets behind,\" Austrevicius added, \"Animals don't abandon people - sometimes, people abandon animals.\"<br/><br/>Humane World Europe and its partners have worked to mitigate this crisis. \"With the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, we launched the VETS for Ukrainian Pets programme, which enabled refugees in 38 European countries to request reimbursement for veterinary expenses,\" said Tombrock.<br/><br/>Yeskova highlighted another crucial initiative of the Ukrainian Red Cross: \"Our National Pet Care Programme was launched to ensure people fleeing war could care for their pets without additional burden. We provided over 500,000 kilogrammes of pet food, distributed 100,000 kilogrammes of litter, 10,000 litter boxes, 10,000 pet carriers, and 16,000 pet supplements. This essential aid enabled us to support over 55,000 pet owners and around 120,000 pets.\"<br/><br/>She further noted the emotional impact of forced separation: \"For many Ukrainians, pets are more than animals; they are family. Having to leave them behind adds immense emotional distress on top of an already traumatic experience.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy gaps and the need for EU action</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>While NGOs play a critical role, policy changes are needed to integrate animal welfare into humanitarian response frameworks. Paolo Dalla Villa, Technical Officer for Disaster Management at the World Organisation for Animal Health, highlighted the shortcomings in disaster preparedness.<br/><br/>\"Historically, humanitarian efforts primarily focus on saving human life. However, experience has shown that support and assistance of communities in these situations is more effective if disaster management and risk reduction plans are in place for animals too.\"<br/><br/>Dalla Villa called for stronger legislative recognition at the EU level. \"Disaster management operational frameworks must pre-exist and cannot be improvised,\" he said.<br/><br/>\"NGOs, the private sector, and civil society should be actively engaged by creating a memorandum of understanding and agreements, developing and maintaining a roster of accredited volunteers fully embedded in any disaster management system.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A stronger push for change</emphasis><br/><br/>Jeff Flocken, President of Humane World Europe, emphasised that action must move beyond awareness.<br/><br/>\"We've had incredible successes, like the bans on fur farming in Romania and Italy, and we helped push for a fur-free Europe,\" he stated. \"But the next step is ensuring that policymakers see disaster planning for animals not as a luxury, but as a necessity.\"<br/><br/>He pointed to the broader impact on human welfare: \"We know that leaving animals out of emergency plans leads to mental health issues, delayed evacuations, and additional trauma for those affected. The EU has the tools to change this - it just needs the political will.\"<br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionhealthconsumersnewsdisasterpreparednessforanimalstimeforeutoactsayshumanitariangroup</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5R-C713-S5NX-3420-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Nowhere is safe.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But some places are less safe than others. Atop the list of unsafe places is New Orleans. But unlike the other major cities that appear on such lists (Phoenix; Norfolk, Va.; Tampa Bay, Fla; New York), New Orleans has a striking competitive advantage. It knows that every hurricane season poses an existential threat.       </p><p>I've never met a New Orleanian who feels safe from climate change. Living here, rather, engenders hurricane expertise - and hurricane fatalism. You become your own disaster planner, insurance adjuster, land surveyor and roofer. You know how many feet your neighborhood is above or below sea level, which storm drain on the block must be cleared by hand before the rain starts, which door sill needs to be bolstered with a rolled-up towel and where water is most likely to pool, with what appalling consequences.       </p><p>The National Hurricane Center advises those in the path of a storm to have an evacuation plan. Most New Orleanians I know have three plans: one if the storm lands to the east, one if to the west and a third if the evacuation lasts longer than a week. We don't wait for a tropical storm to form. We track every depression and cyclone advisory with grim scrutiny. There are storm shutters on every window, a hammer in the attic, candles and matches and gallons of bottled water in the pantry. Local news organizations track how many of the city's drainage pumps, steam and combustion turbine generators and frequency changers are operational at any given time. We are as prepared as anyone can be with the certain knowledge that one day a storm will come for which no preparations will be sufficient.       </p><p>Saul Bellow wrote that \"no one made sober decent terms with death.\" But cities can. New Orleans has. What does it mean, for a city, to make sober decent terms with death? It means living in reality. It means doing whatever it can to postpone the inevitable. It means settling for the best of bad options. But it does not mean blindly submitting to fate.       </p><p>The shrewdest product of this line of thinking is the Coastal Master Plan, Louisiana's grand unified theory of coastal restoration, land creation and retreat, developed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The most impressive aspect of the master plan is not its advertised $50 billion cost (likely a gross underestimate), nor its relentlessly forward-looking framework: It renews every five years, rendering it a 50-year plan in perpetuity. Nor is it the plan's Genesis-like ambition to make dry land appear out of the gathering waters, harnessing the force of the Mississippi River to build tens of thousands of acres of land to buffer against future storms.       </p><p>No, the most impressive part of the plan is its honesty. For the authors of the plan freely acknowledge that, even in the best-case scenario, the plan will fail.       </p><p>It will fail, that is, to stop the coast from receding. It will fail to create enough land to offset the acres that continue to slough into the sea. And it will fail to guarantee New Orleans's long-term survival. The genius of the master plan is that, by building and restoring marshland, levees and barrier islands, it will fail more slowly- much more slowly than the second-best plan, which is to hope for the best, while the storm-pummeled coast, undermined by saltwater intrusion and shipping pipelines and oil wells, continues to atrophy. The grace period bought by the plan is intended to be the difference between a deliberate, gradual retreat over generations and a sudden one marked by chaos and excessive suffering.       </p><p>The same stringent honesty underlies the $14.5 billion post-Katrina flood protection system. A marvel of modern engineering, if not as ambitious as the system Louisianans pushed for after Hurricane Katrina, it claims to reduce risk from 100-year storms. This may sound reassuring until you realize that risk reduction means something very different from risk prevention, and that, by the end of the century, New Orleans can expect to experience a 100-year flood as frequently as once every five years. Like the master plan, the fortress defending greater New Orleans is not a solution. It is the last line of defense.       </p><p>The Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan, another enlightened water management strategy that has been broadly endorsed by the city's leadership, aims not to banish water from the city, but to cohabitate with it more peacefully; the plan is called \"Living With Water.\" New Orleans's own office for emergency preparedness acknowledges that its pumping system is overmatched by even modest storms. \"The annual probability that New Orleans will experience flooding,\" the city declares, \"is 100 percent.\"       </p><p>New Orleans is not only living with water - it is living with huge tropical storms, with floods, with power outages. It is living, in other words, with eyes wide open. Nobody in New Orleans assumes the city and its residents are too rich to become a \"gradual Atlantis\"; the high rate of poverty (23 percent) prevents many people who might leave from doing so. Our flood maps largely correlate to our property values. (If Miami property owners took climate change into full account, Coral Gables would be priced like Hialeah.) Nor do we fantasize, as Phoenix boosters recently have, that the state government will easily solve our problems through wise resource management.       </p><p>A few years ago, when a Tulane University study found that the disintegration of the coastal marsh had already crossed an irreversible tipping point, and its lead author predicted that New Orleans, in the best-case scenario, would one day be an island in the Gulf of Mexico, some 30 miles off the coast, the headline in The Times-Picayune read, \"We're Screwed.\" Other major American cities don't talk like this. Other cities don't live like this. But one morning, not very long from now, they will. On that morning, everyone will be a New Orleanian.       </p><p>The expert quoted by the newspaper was Torbjorn Tornqvist, a geology professor at Tulane and a leading authority on the Louisiana coast. When I asked him at the time whether, as a resident of New Orleans, he was terrified by his own findings, his answer surprised me. New Orleans was not in immediate existential peril, he said. The worst of what he foresaw would not occur within his lifetime, though decisions made now would dictate the region's future. He was optimistic about the master plan. He even mentioned that he was busy renovating his house.       </p><p>Quoting Ben Strauss, the chief executive of Climate Central, Mr. Tornqvist said another thing I'll never forget: \"People find it very hard to accept that a city like New Orleans at some point will not exist anymore. But why don't we think of the life of a city the way that we think about the life of a human being? Just because our lives are finite, doesn't mean that they're worthless.\"       </p><p>The knowledge of our own mortality does not condemn us to fatalism or nihilism. It does not mean that we give up on self-improvement, on reversing injustice, on re-examining our history, on celebrating our culture, on behaving with moral purpose, on setting a positive example for our children. If anything, we love best what we most fear losing. We cherish what we have because we know it won't last forever. It might not even last beyond the next hurricane season.

Experts worry that similar scenarios are happening with much more frequency because of climate change.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tens of thousands of children across the Southeast remain out of their classrooms one week after Helene, the deadliest hurricane to strike the mainland United States since Katrina. They are cut off from academics, friends and stabilizing routines.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hurricane Helene ravaged school buildings, demolished football fields and killed young children and their educators. Dozens of schools are closed for the foreseeable future.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even when they reopen, students in the hardest hit regions, like western North Carolina, could face long-lasting academic and emotional setbacks, according to youth development experts.        </p><p>In North Carolina, where more than 20 public school districts and several charter schools \"face significant damage and interruptions,\" according to Eric C. Davis, the chair of the state board of education, students and their families are facing \"tremendous trauma and hardships.\"       </p><p>Helene's toll is extreme - more than 230 people have died - but such tragedies are increasingly on repeat.       </p><p>As the climate changes and storms grow bigger and more frequent, they are disrupting the rhythm of school districts and threatening children's academics, physical health and mental well-being.       </p><p>Millions of students have lost crucial instruction time in recent years after hurricanes poured floodwater into schools or tore apart buildings. Schools have had to shutter more frequently during dangerous heat waves because old buildings lack air conditioning. In California, wildfires forced more than 220 schools to temporarily close between September and the first three days of October alone, according to the state's Education Department.       </p><p>These disasters can upend students' lives in and out the classroom, researchers say. Perhaps the starkest example is that of Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in August 2005. An estimated 50,000 students did not return to their classrooms for the entire school year.       </p><p>Young children process death and destruction in different ways. While many may bounce back quickly, for others, \"it could take years to get over,\" said Cassandra R. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studied the effects of Hurricanes Matthew and Florence in the 2010s on children.       </p><p>Her research found that some students in early grades fell behind academically for over a year. Others showed signs of long-lasting trauma, becoming emotional or anxious during rainy seasons - even months after a storm.       </p><p>The recovery is often starkly uneven between rich and poor districts, widening inequality between schools. Low-income communities may receive less assistance to help children after a disaster, and families often have less means to flee harm's way in the first place.       </p><p>\"Even when things may appear to be back to normal, they're really not,\" Dr. Davis said. \"Even if cars are on the road and the Waffle House is open, the storm is still heavily within that student.\"       </p><p>In Asheville, N.C., where Helene caused disastrous flooding, it remains unclear when the local district's 4,000 students might return to their classrooms.       </p><p>Several teachers are mourning family members who died in the storm, said the district's superintendent, Maggie Fehrman. Some lost their homes. None of the district's eight public schools have running water after the local infrastructure sustained \"critical damage.\" Half lack electricity.       </p><p>But Dr. Fehrman said the pandemic laid bare \"the critical role that schools play in child development,\" so the district plans to put on some football or softball games to help students gather until the buildings can fully reopen.       </p><p>\"Kids need normalcy,\" she said in an interview. \"They need structure. They need time to come together.\"       </p><p>Near Asheville, one campus at FernLeaf Community Charter School was devastated in the storm. Buildings were ripped off their foundations and flooded. Teachers lost all of their books and classroom materials. \"Everything was absolutely ruined and destroyed beyond recovery,\" said the executive director, Michael Luplow.       </p><p>\"It's heartbreaking,\" he said.       </p><p>Douglas N. Harris, a Tulane University professor who has lived in western North Carolina and studied the impact of Hurricane Katrina on students, said it all \"has to be pretty disheartening\" for educators. \"They had to go through Covid. Then they had to try to catch students up,\" he said.       </p><p>\"And now it's like, 'We have to do this all over again,'\" Mr. Harris said.       </p><p>He added that disasters like Helene can be especially damaging because some children might not receive any form of an education for weeks.       </p><p>\"This isn't Covid remote learning. This is nothing,\" he said.       </p><p>In Buncombe County Schools, the largest district in western North Carolina, with more than 22,000 students, virtual classes are not possible because internet access and cellphone service remain spotty. Dozens of schools still lack electricity, and many have doubled as shelters for paramedics and power crews.       </p><p>\"I wish we could use remote learning. But we just can't,\" the superintendent, Rob Jackson, said at a Thursday news conference. He adding, \"We know our children need to be in school.\"       </p><p>Many students in southern Appalachia have no idea when they will rejoin classmates. Some are already growing restless.       </p><p>\"I want to go back to school!\" Kingston Lee, 12, said outside an Asheville middle school on Thursday.       </p><p>The school's campus now serves as an impromptu distribution center for residents in need, with water and portable phone charging stations. A nearby high school football field had become a makeshift helicopter landing pad.       </p><p>Kingston's mother, Raven Echols, 37, said all four of her school-age children were growing fidgety without their classes, friends and sports. Kingston's 9-year-old brother, Lorenzo, nodded alongside him when asked if they missed their regular routine.        </p><p>If the district does not reopen soon, Ms. Echols said she may send her children to live with relatives in Washington, Ga., a town about 100 miles east of Atlanta with school buildings that fared better.       </p><p>\"I don't want them to fall behind,\" Ms. Echols said.       </p><p>Betty Lai, an associate professor at Boston College who studies the effects of the climate crisis, said \"the hallmark symptom\" for children after disasters is evidence of post-traumatic stress. One study she conducted found that eight months after Hurricane Ike in 2008, more than 40 percent of children reported continued sleep problems.       </p><p>Research shows that about 10 percent could suffer from \"chronic distress\" that lasts for a year after a disaster, or even longer, Dr. Lai said.       </p><p>Still, the vast majority of young people could ultimately recover in short time, she noted.       </p><p>Kristen Ozuna, 36, said she hoped to get her 5-year-old daughter, Amaya, back into kindergarten as soon as possible to take her mind off the storm. She has made several trips to a local park \"to keep her busy\" with arts and crafts.       </p><p>A single mother, Ms. Ozuna might not return to her job until schools reopen because she lacks other options for child care and the popcorn store she works at suffered flood damage. Still, Ms. Ozuna said that she believed children who were born in the pandemic are more accustomed to an uncertain world.       </p><p>\"These kids have been through so much already,\" Ms. Ozuna said, while watching Amaya play on a school front lawn. \"She is very resilient.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009739464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D4T-CH11-DYR7-C18C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 9, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001SUT</classCode><className>WAFFLE HOUSE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS722511 FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC5812 EATING PLACES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Charter Schools</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjUxODk2QjVGRjVFNENEMkIxMEI1Qjc1OUUwMEIzMjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Boards of Education</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkZDNzZBMzEzM0JDNDJERTk2QkNGMDg3N0U3RjY4OTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjM5NDM0MDA1M0Y0NDY0RTgxMEQ5OEQ3QzJBQzhENzk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

They also risked throwing the global economy and Trump's political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into his second term.</p><p>Trump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump's order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates charged by the US against retaliation by the other countries, raising the specter of an even more severe economic disruption.</p><p>\"The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,\" Canadian Prime Minister <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.france24.com/en/tag/justin-trudeau/\">Justin Trudeau</url> said in a somber tone as he announced Saturday that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in US imports, including alcohol and fruit.</p><p>He channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>\"We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,\" he said.</p><p>Mexico's president also ordered retaliatory tariffs. China did not immediately respond to Trump's action.</p><p>\"We categorically reject the White House's slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,\" Mexican President <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.france24.com/en/tag/claudia-sheinbaum/\">Claudia Sheinbaum</url> wrote in a post on X while saying she had instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico's interests.</p><p>\"If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don't do and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population.\"</p><p>The premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia, David Eby, specifically called on residents to stop buying liquor from US \"red\" states and said it was removing American alcohol brands from government store shelves as a response to the tariffs.</p><p>The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, setting up a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the US economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen \u2013 and the situation could be even worse with retaliation from other countries.</p><p>Democrats were quick to warn that any inflation going forward was the result of Trump's actions.</p><p>\"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs,\" Senate Democratic leader <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.france24.com/en/tag/chuck-schumer/\">Chuck Schumer</url> of New York wrote in a series of posts on X. \"You're worried about tomato prices.

Wait till Trump's Canada tariffs raise your car prices,\" read another.</p><p>A senior US administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize disruptive increases on the price of gasoline or utilities. That's a sign White House officials understand the gamble they're taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.france24.com/en/tag/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</url> led to voter frustration that helped return Trump to the White House.</p><p>The order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries.</p><p>The official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addiction.</p><p>The order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties.</p><p>\"It doesn't make much economic sense,'' said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former US trade official. \"Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive ... Now, what's he talking about? He's talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don't get the economics of it.''</p><p>With the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics.</p><p>The president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.france24.com/en/tag/european-union/\">European Union</url> \u2013 moves that could essentially pit the US against much of the global economy.</p><p>Trudeau warned of economic pain as the tariffs take effect and encouraged Canadians to \"choose Canadian products and services rather than American ones.\" But he also voiced optimism in the enduring relationship between the two countries.</p><p>\"It is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border. We don't want to be here.

Gavin Newsom faces what may be his greatest political test and leadership challenge. He planned to greet President Trump upon his arrival in Southern California on Friday.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gov. Gavin Newsom came into office in 2018 confronting one of the deadliest and most destructive fires in the state's history: the Camp fire. Even before he was sworn in, Mr. Newsom accompanied Donald Trump, then the president, and Jerry Brown, then the governor, in inspecting a blaze that killed 85 people and consumed over 153,000 acres around the Butte County town of Paradise.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, more than six years later, Mr. Newsom will once again greet Mr. Trump as the president comes to Los Angeles to view the aftermath of the latest devastating wildfires that have swept California.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These new fires - in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles and in Altadena - serve as a reminder that Mr. Newsom's tenure as governor has been defined by catastrophe and crisis, whether natural or man-made: fires, mudslides, atmospheric rivers, the Covid pandemic, the at-times violent protests against police brutality after the murder of George Floyd.       </p><p>\"It's mind-boggling the number of natural disasters and otherwise he has to deal with,\" said Anthony Rendon, who served as speaker of the California Assembly from 2016 to 2023. \"It is something that has bracketed - and maybe even defined - his time in office as governor.\"       </p><p>But the challenge of the Palisades and Eaton fires, both in extinguishing them and in overseeing the rebuilding of entire neighborhoods in the most populous county in the nation, may be his greatest test yet.       </p><p>And it has long-term implications for any political career Mr. Newsom might pursue when his term ends in 2026 (he is barred by law from seeking a third term). He has made no secret of his interest in potentially running for president in 2028, and Democrats say his successes and failures in the months ahead will be central to how he presents himself - and how opponents assail him - should he run.       </p><p>Already it has put him in the position of battling with Mr. Trump, who, as in the aftermath of the Camp fire, has levied inaccurate claims about California policies. (Mr. Newsom sought to push back on some of the false information, creating a page on his campaign website providing \"California Fire Facts.\")       </p><p>In an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on Wednesday, Mr. Trump assailed Mr. Newsom and California for water and forest management policies that he claimed were responsible for the fires, but which state officials and fire experts said had no relevance to the Los Angeles disaster. On Friday, Mr. Trump said one of the things he wanted to secure on his trip to California was \"to see the water be released and come down to Los Angeles and throughout the state.\" And he said there was another thing he wanted to secure: \"Voter ID so that people have a chance to vote.\"       </p><p>Democrats have long resisted such laws, arguing that voter ID requirements can suppress turn out among Black and Hispanic voters, as well as impoverished voters.       </p><p>Adam Mendelsohn, who was a senior adviser to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor who dealt with his own share of catastrophes, said the spotlight will be on Mr. Newsom's handling of the wildfire recovery for years.       </p><p>\"If I were working for him, I would see this as an opportunity of a lifetime,\" Mr. Mendelsohn said. \"These are the events that define leaders.\"       </p><p>The fires have posed new questions for Los Angeles and its leaders as they prepare for what was already going to be a high-profile run of events here, including the World Cup in 2026 and the Super Bowl in 2027. The latest catastrophe has stirred particular concern over whether Los Angeles can manage the twin tasks of rebuilding while hosting the Olympics in 2028.       </p><p>\"The economics of this, the timing with the Olympics, the issues of the new president coming in,\" has created a difficult dynamic for Mr. Newsom, said Robert Hertzberg, a former state senator and former Assembly speaker.       </p><p>Mr. Hertzberg ran down a list of recent governors of the state. \"Arnold had a zillion fires,\" he said of Mr. Schwarzenegger. \"Pete Wilson had a bunch of fires. Gray Davis. But nothing like this.\"       </p><p>The fires over these past two weeks illustrate the extent to which California, hotter and drier than ever, is at the leading edge of states that are grappling with climate change. As Mr. Hertzberg noted, when Edmund G. Brown, Jerry Brown's father, was governor from 1959 to 1967, California was a whole different state, with a whole different tempo of emergencies. \"The day he was inaugurated, he went off and played golf,\" Mr. Hertzberg said of the elder Mr. Brown.       </p><p>Mr. Newsom has been a high-profile presence since the fires first broke out, making regular and often unannounced visits to the sites of both the Palisades fire, which was in the city of Los Angeles, and the Eaton fire, which was in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County. He has signed executive orders intended to help fight the fire and begin the rebuilding. And he has largely escaped the kind of widespread criticism that another official, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, has faced over her handling of the fires. Ms. Bass has had to withstand widespread attacks and scrutiny for being overseas when the fires broke out.       </p><p>On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Newsom was in Pasadena, signing two bills to provide $2.5 billion in state money to support response and recovery efforts in Los Angeles.       </p><p>\"I just got back from the Hughes fire,\" Mr. Newsom said, referring to a new brush fire that broke out on Wednesday. He stepped to a lectern wearing jeans and a black parka, standing in front of elected officials who had assembled at a Pasadena school that opened on Thursday for the first time since the fires broke out.       </p><p>Mr. Newsom finds himself in a politically complicated situation as Mr. Trump comes to California: At once a leader among Democrats pushing back on the policies of the new president, while at the same time saying that he and Mr. Trump - who regularly denigrates Mr. Newsom by referring to him as Gavin Newscum - would work \"cooperatively and collaboratively\" to address the crisis here.       </p><p>He said that he thought the Republican-controlled Congress and Mr. Trump would reimburse California for the $2.5 billion that he had just authorized. But at the same time, he assailed Mr. Trump for his \"assault on the 14th Amendment,\" referring to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship, and defended efforts by California to finance legal actions against various Trump policies.       </p><p>\"None of this is personal in any way or shape or form,\" Mr. Newsom told reporters. \"Some people want to politicize things. That's not our approach. I have all the expectations and beliefs that we will be reimbursed for those dollars.\" He added, \"I am here for the long haul to support the president where we can, to defend our values where we must.\"       </p><p>Mr. Newsom said at the news conference that he did not know whether he would be invited to accompany Mr. Trump as he visited parts of the state, but he said that he was going to the airport to greet him upon his arrival. The governor said he had not spoken to Mr. Trump since he left the White House in 2020. He said he had called Mr. Trump after his victory, and again as the fires began, but had not heard back from the president.       </p><p>These past few decades have been filled with instances in which political leaders' reputations have risen or fell based on how they responded to catastrophes.       </p><p>In New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani became known as America's mayor for how he led his city after the attacks of Sept. 11. Andrew M. Cuomo won national praise, at least initially, as the governor of New York for his daily briefings on the Covid pandemic.       </p><p>By contrast, George W. Bush faced derision for his tentative response after Hurricane Katrina flooded large swaths of New Orleans in 2005. And Mr. Newsom himself was ridiculed in the midst of the Covid pandemic, after he advised residents to stay home and wear masks but was photographed mask-less attending a crowded birthday dinner for a political adviser at the French Laundry, one of the country's most expensive restaurants.       </p><p>For Mr. Newsom and other elected officials in California, the months ahead promise to be fraught and filled with obstacles, at a time when Mr. Newsom is already under attack by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans.       </p><p>Longtime opponents of Mr. Newsom who are critical of how the state prepared for and responded to the fire have already started yet another recall effort against him; there have been at least a half-dozen such efforts since he was elected, only one of which made the ballot. That recall attempt, in 2021 in the aftermath of the French Laundry episode, failed, and over 60 percent of Californians voted to keep him in office.       </p><p>Gray Davis, the former governor and lieutenant governor, said he thought Mr. Newsom had raised his standing in Los Angeles because of the way he responded to the fire. But he added that the ultimate verdict on how Mr. Newsom has fared in this crisis will come years from now, when the shape of the project ahead - rebuilding Los Angeles - becomes clear.       </p><p>Mr. Davis said in all his years in Los Angeles, he could not recall anything like these past two weeks.       </p><p>\"We have flooding, we have fires, we have mudslides,\" said Mr. Davis, who was governor from 1999 to 2003. \"But I don't think there's anything worse than a wildfire shooting embers. I don't think there's anything more terrifying than the fires that have been experienced in the last weeks in Los Angeles.\"       </p><p>Shawn Hubler and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shawn Hubler and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009945434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F08-B9V3-RRH6-X0R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 27, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS516120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Supercharged hurricanes are no longer outliers, freak disasters or storms of the century. Fossil fuel pollution has made them a fixture of life around the world, and they are going to get worse - with millions of people in their cross hairs.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many Americans refuse to believe that a major hurricane could hit them. The United States government isn't much better. Flood insurance remains optional for many coastal residents. Homes continue to be built - and rebuilt - in low-lying flood zones. State governments often lack the funds and staffing to manage recovery. Some loans from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild are contingent on good credit. But if we are going to withstand this new era of extreme weather, we need to be honest about what has become the most expensive and deadliest kind of natural disaster in the country.       </p><p>I spent the past three years sailing through storms and visiting research labs around the world to learn about the recent increase in extreme cyclones. I spoke to captains who logged changes in the Gulf Stream, the jet stream, trade winds and storm seasons. I interviewed scientists who studied amplifying typhoons in the Pacific, whose barometric pressure could drop so low that they triggered a spider web of earthquakes. I studied major cyclones that hit parts of the Middle East for the first time and some of the first hurricane landfalls to strike Europe. Experts consistently tied storm intensity, range and destruction to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - and said that if we reduced it, storm intensity would diminish in lock step.       </p><p>Here is a glimpse of where we are headed. The heat accumulating in the ocean from global warming will make tropical cyclones last longer than they once did and occasionally move slower, making damage many times worse. Rapid intensification - in which storm winds increase by 35 miles per hour or more in 24 hours - will continue to rise, especially in coastal waters.       </p><p>A 2021 study by Yale University researchers shows that warmer waters in the north and south will soon draw extreme storms toward the poles, threatening to inundate densely populated and especially unprepared cities like Washington, New York and Boston. A northwestward migration from the region where most Atlantic tropical cyclones originate could result in an uptick in landfalls along the East Coast this century.       </p><p>The compounding forces of climate change are worsening the effects, too. Storms now carry vastly more precipitation - and can dump more than 40 inches of rain in just a few days, as Hurricane Harvey did in Houston in 2017. Storm surge rides on an elevated sea level, flooding coastlines with walls of water up to 25 feet high, as Hurricane Katrina did in New Orleans in 2005. If Superstorm Sandy had occurred in 1912 instead of 2012, it probably would not have flooded Lower Manhattan because the sea level was so much lower then, among other reasons, according to Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at M.I.T.       </p><p>By the end of this century, the number of major hurricanes is expected to increase by 20 percent. And hurricanes of all sizes could set the country back over $100 billion annually by then.       </p><p>If you are reading this in the Midwest, Northeast or even Southwest, consider that this meteorological nightmare might come for you. A recent study by the First Street Foundation, a research firm that studies climate threats to housing, showed that hurricanes will penetrate farther inland in decades to come, affecting states with tropical storm conditions as far west as Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin. In North Carolina, the damage from Hurricane Helene nearly 500 miles from the coast far outweighed that of the landfall site in Florida.       </p><p>When the hurricane season ends this year, the media, the government and America at large will move on from these storms and their victims, and our collective amnesia will set in. Towns in Appalachia will be left to fend for themselves; homeowners who didn't add or couldn't afford flood insurance will have to find a way to rebuild or relocate, and neighbors in Central Florida may have to rely on one another to finish the work that the federal government starts.       </p><p>As long as hurricanes continue to be treated like one-off disasters, recovery efforts will play from behind. This head-in-the-sand approach empties the coffers and ranks of FEMA year after year, often leaving victims to fend for themselves. Less than two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene, which left more than 230 dead and had damage estimates running as high as $250 billion, was one of the deadliest and costliest storms to hit the United States in the past 50 years. But in lieu of investing in dikes, levees, updated building codes, evacuation corridors and other storm preparation, the U.S. government is often overwhelmed simply trying to clean up.       </p><p>In the Tampa Bay area, the state is trying to accelerate the cleanup from Hurricane Helene. But Hurricane Milton is following it too closely, and millions of cubic yards of storm debris from Helene could soon become projectiles. This compound event, as emergency officials call it, will probably be considered a one-in-a-million coincidence. Until, of course, it happens again.       </p><p>Porter Fox is the author of \"Category Five: Superstorms and the Warming Oceans That Feed Them.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Three of his uncles were Hollywood film composers. One received 45 Oscar nominations and won nine times.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Newman's own father wanted to be a composer. His parents, sensing the family needed to diversify its portfolio, dissuaded him. He became a physician with a celebrity-studded clientele. Those celebrities included Pat Boone, the bland pop singer, who tried to get young Randy signed to the publishing arm of his label.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Randy didn't need Boone - or anyone else. He was writing songs professionally while still in his teens and by his early 20s was recognized as an uncommon sort of genius. His first four records, released between 1968 and 1974, floored those who knew the real thing when they heard it. His songs were literate, mocking and dense with the ghosts of American history.       </p><p>His greatness did not go unsung. Rolling Stone named Newman Rock Star of the Year for 1971, the same year Marvin Gaye released \"What's Going On,\" Joni Mitchell released \"Blue\" and the Rolling Stones released \"Sticky Fingers.\"       </p><p>He broke through to the rest of America six years later, when his song \"Short People\" began blasting from car radios. Here was an anchovy amid pop radio's peaches. Many can remember where they were when they first heard it. No one could recall a hit like it. It was a novelty song with a poison tip.       </p><p>\"Short People\" was hilarious (\"you got to pick 'em up just to say hello\") and, oh, it was cruel (\"short people got no reason to live\"). It divided people; some highly cheesed-off little people began to picket his concerts.       </p><p>Newman wrote songs with unreliable narrators, so many listeners gave him the benefit of the doubt about \"Short People.\" When interviewers asked, \"The song's all about prejudice, isn't it?\" he would reply, \"Yeah.\" He later commented: \"But it wasn't at the beginning. I just thought it was funny and it was. I wrote it because we needed an up song.\"       </p><p>Newman made more critically admired albums, but he wouldn't have another major hit until he entered the family business: film music. He wrote and sang \"You've Got a Friend in Me,\" the theme song for the Pixar movie \"Toy Story,\" one of the highest grossing films of 1995. He went on to write songs and scores for many other movies.       </p><p>The Pixar work brought him new fans but baffled old ones. It was like learning that Ambrose Bierce or Lenny Bruce had written a picture book about a bunny. For Newman - to co-opt a line from his mighty song \"Louisiana 1927,\" which has been a beloved standard in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 - the money rolled all day, the money rolled all night.       </p><p>Newman, 80, is a serious, complicated man who deserves a serious, complicated biography. Robert Hilburn's new book, \"A Few Words in Defense of Our Country: The Biography of Randy Newman,\" is not that book. It's a toothless hagiography packed with obvious filler, notably extended quotations from song lyrics and panegyrics from admirers.       </p><p>Hilburn, who was a longtime pop critic for The Los Angeles Times, has written well-received biographies of Johnny Cash and Paul Simon, but his talents are not in evidence here. This book demonstrates little feel for Newman's music. I wanted it to contain memorable ideas and sentences, but it does not.       </p><p>Newman's mother had family in New Orleans, and he spent a lot of time in that city as a child. This helped give his music a Delta vibe and his voice its laconic drawl that reminded people of Fats Domino and Ray Charles. Still, his lifelong friend, the music industry titan Lenny Waronker, referred to him as \"the King of Suburban Blues Singers.\"       </p><p>Newman attended high school in Los Angeles and dropped out of U.C.L.A. He was writing songs the entire time. One early song was \"Mama Told Me Not to Come,\" which became a hit for Three Dog Night in 1970. It's about feeling uncomfortable at a party.       </p><p>If this book has a theme, it's Newman's lack of comfort in his own body and in America writ large. He was born a bit cross-eyed and was bullied. His shyness blended, as it often will, with misanthropy. He liked to stay inside, reading books and watching television. He was in several car crashes when young, and had health problems throughout his life.        </p><p>He felt like an outsider because of his Jewishness. One of his songs, \"Dixie Flyer,\" describes what it felt like to arrive in New Orleans with his mother early on, and trying to fit in.  Asked about assimilation in an interview, he gave an answer that still resonates:       </p><p>That's never been done. There have been thousands of Jewish songwriters, and they have never done it. To be Jewish in America is different. No one wants to be an American more than a Jew. Irving Berlin was more American than John Wayne. But there's a lack of comfort here for Jews, somehow. Is this really our country? And I think sometimes, maybe not.       </p><p>Newman is not presented as an angel. He had a drug period. He left his wife of 16 years  for a 21-year-old Cal State student in 1983. But any grit is relentlessly sanded down.       </p><p>Newman's best songs carry you through six or seven emotions in a few stanzas, and they disturb the sediment at the bottom of the American experiment. \"Sail Away\" is related in the voice of a slave trader; \"Rednecks\" refuses to let the North off the hook for its racism; \"Political Science\" provides sardonic encouragement to \"drop the big one now.\"       </p><p>There is a lot of knockabout humanity, and sympathy for the underdog, in his work. He's been a consummate and contrary user of the English language. A better-reported and more critical biography will probably have to wait until Newman, and others central to his story, are no longer with us.       </p><p>In the early 1970s Newman wrote a subversive song for Frank Sinatra about celebrity. Sinatra didn't get the joke, so Newman recorded it himself. Something about the song captured Newman's own ambivalent and awkward embrace of fame:       </p><p>Listen, all you fools out thereGo on and love me - I don't careOh, it's lonely at the top.              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A FEW WORDS IN DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Biography of Randy Newman</emphasis> | By Robert Hilburn | Hachette | 513 pp. | $34 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009747004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D7C-1PN1-DYR7-C1WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1079\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 21, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000281E</classCode><className>NEWMAN'S OWN INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000181</classCode><className>PROFILES &amp;

Trump at a rally in Tampa, her hometown.       </p><p>Her first choice, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, had recently dropped out. Senator Marco Rubio, another Floridian, remained in the race, though just barely. Few big-name Republicans in the state, and none as high-ranking as Ms. Bondi, had yet backed Mr. Trump.       </p><p>\"I kept my word to Jeb and the day Jeb got out of the race, I committed to Donald Trump,\" she said in a statement.       </p><p>In him, Ms. Bondi saw a bit of herself: an outsider with no experience in elective office. She first won the state attorney general's race in 2010, during the Tea Party wave that catapulted novice Republican candidates like her into power.       </p><p>By 2016, she was part of the state's political establishment. But the party, she saw, was on the cusp of another pivotal moment - and her foresight then is responsible now for Mr. Trump's decision to pick her to lead the Justice Department, as U.S. attorney general.       </p><p>\"Something that you don't forget is when someone comes and gets behind you early in a situation when it's not popular,\" said Adam Goodman, a Tampa political consultant who has advised Ms. Bondi since recruiting her to run in 2010.       </p><p>Over the last eight years, as Florida became Mr. Trump's home, a cradle of right-wing politics and a solidly Republican state, Ms. Bondi went from being a traditional Republican to a Trump loyalist. Acting as confidante, impeachment lawyer and adviser, she ascended in the president-elect's inner circle thanks to the combination of charm, savvy and a light touch that characterized her career as a telegenic prosecutor and a politician.       </p><p>Florida is home to every brand of Trump Republican, including flamethrowers like Matt Gaetz, the former congressman who was forced to withdraw as Mr. Trump's first choice for attorney general because of scandal. But perhaps no one better reflects the political evolution of the state and its once-establishment leaders than Ms. Bondi, 59, whose small risk in endorsing Mr. Trump early in 2016 paid off in a big way, making her the relatively safe pick after Mr. Gaetz's selection collapsed.       </p><p>Dave Aronberg, the Democratic state attorney in Palm Beach County, who previously worked under Ms. Bondi for two years as her drug czar in the attorney general's office, said that while their politics differ, he felt relieved that Mr. Trump had picked her.       </p><p>\"She is very loyal to him,\" he said. \"I don't believe, however, that she would intentionally violate the law to carry out any policy.\"       </p><p>\"She's a 20-year prosecutor whose arguments are always tethered to the law,\" he added. \"She's not going to walk Anthony Fauci in an orange jumpsuit just to make headlines.\"       </p><p>Mr. Trump's critics, however, are worried that her record of fealty to Mr. Trump - she worked on the defense team for his impeachment trial and supported his claims of election fraud in 2020 - signals that the Justice Department's independence would be compromised.       </p><p>Ms. Bondi's detractors have also accused her of being soft on her political donors, including Mr. Trump. Her office decided in 2013 not to formally investigate fraud claims involving Trump University shortly after Mr. Trump's family foundation contributed $25,000 to a political action committee associated with Ms. Bondi. A state ethics panel concluded that there was no probable cause that Ms. Bondi had violated any state laws.       </p><p>A spokesman for the Trump transition team repeated a statement calling the Trump University incident \"old, discredited news\" and did not respond to other questions about Ms. Bondi's life and career. He declined to make her available for an interview.       </p><p>Early in Ms. Bondi's tenure, her office forced out two investigators who had built a case against a company that helped lenders fraudulently foreclose on homeowners. The company under investigation had contributed to Ms. Bondi's 2010 campaign. An inspector general's report concluded that no one in the state attorney general's office had violated any laws or rules. The ousted investigators declined to comment.       </p><p>The controversies did little to slow Ms. Bondi's rise. She won re-election by 13 percentage points in 2014, and after leaving office in 2019, she joined Ballard Partners, a powerhouse lobbying firm where she worked with Amazon, Uber and the Qatari government. Even some of her former Democratic opponents describe her as so amiable that they remain in touch.       </p><p>\"Something my dad taught me: Never burn bridges,\" Ms. Bondi said in 2013 at a commencement address at her alma mater, Stetson University College of Law in Gulfport, Fla.</p><p>Ms. Bondi, a fourth-generation Floridian, was born in 1965 and is the oldest of three children to Patsy and Joseph C. Bondi Jr. Her father was an educator and served in the mid-70s as mayor of Temple Terrace, Fla., a suburb of Tampa where Ms. Bondi grew up.       </p><p>She graduated from the University of Florida before heading to Stetson, a small, private law school whose alumni include numerous Florida jurists and politicians. From Stetson, she joined the state attorney's office in Tampa's Hillsborough County, in what would become an 18-year career as a local prosecutor that included trying capital murder cases.       </p><p>Ms. Bondi was known as an effective prosecutor. \"Juries loved her,\" said Nicholas B. Cox, who was Ms. Bondi's boss for five or six years as they tried homicide cases, adding that her affable personality helped win over jurors. (When Ms. Bondi became attorney general, she hired Mr. Cox as statewide prosecutor, a position he still holds.)       </p><p>Billy Howard, a lawyer who dated Ms. Bondi two decades ago, said she was such a force in the courtroom that he nicknamed her the \"Paminator.\"       </p><p>Though she never ran for Hillsborough's top prosecutor job of state attorney, she became the face of the office, frequently appearing on CNN and Fox News as a legal analyst. In Tampa's social circles, where Ms. Bondi was well known, some speculated that she might jump full-time to cable television.       </p><p>Instead, Ms. Bondi ran for state attorney general in 2010, winning a Republican primary against the lieutenant governor and a state lawmaker by campaigning as an outsider with real-world experience.       </p><p>In the general election, Ms. Bondi defeated Dan Gelber, then a Democratic state senator, by 13 points. Mr. Gelber remained on good terms with Ms. Bondi and said he would occasionally hear from her when he was mayor of Miami Beach.       </p><p>\"She would text me whenever she saw me on Fox News, telling me to get off her channel,\" he said.       </p><p>As Florida's first female attorney general, Ms. Bondi opposed same-sex marriage and the legalization of medical marijuana. She was part of a lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which gave her a national platform within the Republican Party. Perhaps most notably, she led the effort to shut down clinics known as pill mills that illegally sold prescription drugs.       </p><p>In 2014, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who worked closely with Ms. Bondi, rescheduled an execution at Ms. Bondi's request. Unbeknownst to Mr. Scott, she had sought the delay to hold a re-election campaign fund-raiser. Ms. Bondi later said doing so had been a mistake.       </p><p>During her 2010 campaign, the news media extensively covered a 16-month custody fight over a St. Bernard dog that she had adopted from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Ms. Bondi tried to keep the dog after its original owners, Dorreen and Steven Couture, surfaced and said they wanted him back. The two sides settled before trial, and Ms. Bondi returned the dog.       </p><p>Reached by phone this week, Mr. Couture declined to comment on the custody battle, simply saying, \"you can't hold grudges for 20 years,\" he said.       </p><p>Among state attorneys general, Ms. Bondi was considered close to local police departments and easy to work with, said Luther Strange, the former Republican attorney general of Alabama. She was friendly with Beau Biden, President Biden's son who was then the Democratic attorney general of Delaware, Mr. Strange said.       </p><p>\"She was very well liked and had a very cordial way of working with folks,\" Mr. Strange said. That ability to collaborate, and her background as a prosecutor, would serve her well as U.S. attorney general, he added.       </p><p>\"You have to understand the tremendous power that prosecutors hold,\" he said, \"and you want someone in that role who respects that. And I think she does.\"       </p><p>Kitty Bennett contributed research.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kitty Bennett contributed research. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009849599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNR-H363-S0GT-D499-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 18, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Composition</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM4NkI4M0M2OUEzNDY3M0E1RjhFMDM5RUNBODAxMkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIwQjUyMTIwMkE5NDc3Qjk5ODQyMUI1OThGMzk2OTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

Tens of millions of schoolchildren were still learning virtually, and office workers were hunkered down at home, experiencing the world through their smartphones and laptops.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was no real sense for when the coronavirus pandemic would end or how it would alter people's lives.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four years later, the country regards the event as being long over. There is barely any discussion of Covid from the presidential candidates. But as a divided America approaches its last day of voting, the toll of that period of national and personal crisis is still unfolding.       </p><p>\"Underneath it all, so much of the rage and angst and animosity, I believe, is unprocessed grief,\" said the Rev. Amy Greene, who was the director of spiritual care for the Cleveland Clinic health system during the pandemic.       </p><p>America is particularly \"grief-phobic,\" she said. \"Anger is a lot easier because it makes you feel powerful even if you are not. It overwhelms fear and sadness,\" she said. \"I think that is why we see so much rage on both sides.\"       </p><p>The pandemic brought immense grief, over the death of loved ones, friends' funerals and missed celebrations. There were enormous economic and social consequences, for everyone.       </p><p>For young people, there are no do-overs for the years in high school or college wrecked by the crisis. Those who became parents faced isolation at home with their babies, without the support and love of a community.       </p><p>Grief is scary, and it is hard, Ms. Greene said. \"Grief for some people is scarier than anger, because anger makes us feel on the defensive, like we're doing something, and grief is just vulnerability like nobody's business,\" she said. \"And America's not a big fan of vulnerability, on either side of the equation.\"       </p><p>Trust in institutions - in government, scientists and business leaders - has fallen since 2020, according to the Pew Research Center. By the end of 2022, the highest percentage of Americans in two decades described their mental health as \"only fair\" or \"poor,\" based on a Gallup poll.       </p><p>\"We have lost ground with regard to resilience and optimism, and frankly we've lost engagement with one another,\" said Schroeder Stribling, the president and chief executive of Mental Health America, a national nonprofit.       </p><p>\"There's an epidemic of loneliness,\" she said. \"There's been so much isolation and the pandemic hugely contributed to that. We've seen directly how isolation affects us: It sickens us.\"       </p><p>Kylie James, 20, an English major at the College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas, said the pandemic helped to expose a dispiriting level of callousness, by both the government and its people.       </p><p>Mx. James, who uses they/them pronouns, said the government did not adequately support people who were trying to cope with the loss of work. They also said they were disheartened by a resistance to safety measures in the name of personal freedom.       </p><p>\"I lost a lot of faith in humanity for a while, but I just had to learn that I can only control myself and I can try to educate people, but I want my mental health and my peace,\" they said.       </p><p>Shannon Lee Dawdy, a professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, studies what happens to people after traumatic events, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005.       </p><p>Reactions varied wildly at the time, even within families, she said. Some wanted to throw everything away, move and start over, while others wanted to salvage or replicate every lost household item and return life to how it was before.       </p><p>She sees parallels to the pandemic. For everyone in the United States, if in different degrees, 2020 brought traumatic experiences.       </p><p>Ms. Dawdy wondered about the many Americans who now appear to want to repeat the chaos of the 2020 election, motivated in large part by former President Donald J. Trump. \"But I think that's not what it is,\" she said. \"I think what they're trying to do, some of them, is to reset the clock to 2016, before Covid.\"       </p><p>For some families, the experience of the pandemic and school closures changed the trajectory of their lives and shaped their politics.       </p><p>In 2020, Kevin Gemeroy, 43, was living with his family in Seattle, running a small technology company.       </p><p>Schools were closed that spring, as they were across the nation. When Mr. Gemeroy learned that virtual learning would be extended into the next academic year, he and his wife decided to relocate to Arizona with their two boys.       </p><p>They settled in Scottsdale, an upscale suburb of Phoenix where the weather was warm, and the schools were more likely to be open because of weaker teachers' unions and Republican governance in the state.       </p><p>The following year, they considered moving back to Seattle. The family stayed put when they learned that their son, who was diagnosed with dyslexia, would have to work with private reading tutors in Seattle over Zoom.       </p><p>In Arizona, Mr. Gemeroy's two sons benefited from vouchers that helped pay for their private-school tuition.       </p><p>\"We have so many more choices here in terms of how and where we can educate our kids,\" he said.       </p><p>Mr. Gemeroy considers himself a political independent but plans to vote for Mr. Trump. He said he developed a deep distrust of Democratic leaders in part because of how their Covid policies affected schools. \"Sadly, I do believe Trump is the less bad option this cycle,\" he said.       </p><p>Young voters see the pandemic as an inflection point in their formative years, ruining proms and graduations and introductions to college - the sort of memorable experiences that have been rites of passage for each generation. The loss of such milestones colored their political upbringing and, for some, sparked their civic engagement.       </p><p>Ryan Klein was a junior in high school in Reading, Pa., with an eye toward becoming a teacher when classes went remote. Social distancing the next year meant that a marquee dance-a-thon for children with cancer barely raised $12,000, a fraction of what it normally generated.       </p><p>\"Cancer isn't stopping because of the pandemic,\" Mr. Klein, 21, said he told school administrators. \"The money that we're not raising because we're following arbitrary guidelines is a real shame.\"       </p><p>At the same time, Mr. Klein saw his mother's dream of running her own business crumble. A massage therapist, she was forced to shut down when the governor at the time, Tom Wolf, ordered all \"non-life-sustaining businesses\" to close.       </p><p>Mr. Klein is now studying political science at Pennsylvania State University and is the president of the school's College Republicans organization. He is considering a career in politics.       </p><p>For some, the pandemic whittled away the facade that the larger world could take on anything together.       </p><p>\"Like when all anybody had to do was not get toilet paper in excess and then everybody bought it in excess, those little things were disappointing,\" said Alex Grupp, a 34-year-old software salesman who lives in Milwaukee.\"You used to trust in the fact that things are going to work out, and that became less of a given,\" he said.       </p><p>For most of his life, Mr. Grupp had voted Republican. During the pandemic, however, he was taken aback by Mr. Trump, who he felt was dismissing scientific evidence. Mr. Grupp says he now leans left but has no aversion to those who do not, including his own parents.       </p><p>Mr. Grupp, who began seeing a therapist for the first time during the pandemic, said he felt that \"everybody is just stressed now.\"       </p><p>\"Those on the right think if Harris wins, the world will end and vice versa,\" he said. \"It's high stakes on both sides.\"       </p><p>But others see a country that has found some measure of joy on the other side of tragedy.       </p><p>Lee Herrick, the California poet laureate who is 53 and lives in Fresno, Calif., said that he had detected anxiety, yes, but also \"an equal amount of hope and optimism.\"       </p><p>Mr. Herrick has seen his family coming out more in the last year or two, and people back in libraries, museums and schools.       </p><p>\"I think everyone remembers what we've been through, and of course we lost far too many people,\" he said. \"But to have made it through, to be able to be with loved ones in person, it's deeply joyful. It sort of magnifies the present for me. It elevates our relationships, those we care for, those we ought to care for. These are all sources of joy.\"       </p><p>Jamie McGee contributed reporting from Nashville, Robert Chiarito from Milwaukee and Troy Closson from New York.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jamie McGee contributed reporting from Nashville, Robert Chiarito from Milwaukee and Troy Closson from New York. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009797403</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DBS-R791-DYR7-C0H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1479\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 6, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Officials from several shellshocked communities convened to talk about the extensive damage and ongoing search-and-rescue efforts.        </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But within hours, a conspiracy theory took hold. The meeting, social media posts claimed, was a secret discussion about bulldozing, confiscating or even selling land for profit or to mine lithium.        </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The only lithium for sale in Rutherford County is at the local Lowes stores in a 9-volt battery,\" said Bryan King, the chairman of the county commission, who was at the meeting. The power of the conspiracy theory, he added, \"is just disheartening.\"       </p><p>As thousands across the Southeast grieve the deaths and damage left by the Category 4 hurricane that made landfall on Sept. 26, a torrent of conspiracy theories, rumors and lies threatens to undermine efforts to provide accurate information and crucial resources. Disinformation has been particularly rampant in Georgia and North Carolina, and the sheer number of falsehoods has alarmed officials and experts.        </p><p>\"I have been doing disaster work for nearly 20 years, and I cannot think of another acute disaster where there has been this much misinformation,\" said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.        </p><p>While the hurricane decimated communities and killed more than 230 people across the Southeast, the epicenter of the damage runs through western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Over a week after Helene passed through, small mountain communities like Chimney Rock and Lake Lure in Rutherford County remain isolated in some way: left without water, electricity or reliable cell service, or stranded among collapsed roads.       </p><p>Aaron Ellenburg, Rutherford County's sheriff, has spent days refuting baseless claims about lithium sales or communities being bulldozed to cover up bodies left behind by the storm. \"I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. \"I'm sick and tired of this crap.\"       </p><p>Climate-related disinformation tends to surge after natural disasters, as it did last year after a string of heat waves, flooding and wildfires. False claims attribute such events to globalist hoaxes, arson and so-called energy weapons. They are often fueled by A.I.-generated or outdated footage, or distorted reasoning from the oil-and-gas lobby, politicians and even foreign influence operatives.       </p><p>The conspiracy theories and rumors on X after Helene tore through the Southeast have also been circulated and elevated by high-profile figures, including Elon Musk, who has pulled back on content moderation and repeatedly amplified disinformation to his millions of followers since he bought the social media platform. Representatives for X were not immediately available to comment.       </p><p>Former President Donald J. Trump has also falsely claimed that disaster-relief funds were being diverted to house undocumented migrants and suggested without evidence that Democrats were not eager to help conservative residents. (Some Republican governors have actually praised the Biden administration for its response.)        </p><p>When asked about Mr. Trump's role in spreading false claims, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, reiterated the falsehood.        </p><p>\"Misinformation is a grave threat in the aftermath of a storm like Helene,\" Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said in a statement, warning that it could be \"deadly.\"       </p><p>The falsehoods have prompted pushback from lawmakers and officials from across the country. Mayor Glenn Jacobs of Knox County, Tenn., said to his followers, \"if everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great.\" And Kevin Corbin, a Republican state representative in North Carolina, pleaded on Facebook, \"PLEASE help stop this junk.\"        </p><p>Much of the misinformation has been aimed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticized during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 for its leaders' failures in emergency response.        </p><p>Since then, the agency has brought on more experienced emergency managers, including its current administrator, Deanne Criswell, who used to lead New York City's emergency management department. But its efforts to address racial disparities in aid programs and overhaul its disaster assistance programs have made FEMA a larger target for disinformation.       </p><p>In recent days, FEMA has been forced to contend with claims that it is stealing donations, diverting disaster aid to Ukraine or refusing help from others, a falsehood Mr. Musk has spread.       </p><p>But by Sunday, in North Carolina alone, there were more than 700 FEMA employees and over 1,000 National Guard personnel, FEMA had approved $30 million in housing and other assistance, and nearly 1,700 people were housed in hotels through a FEMA program, according to officials.        </p><p>President Biden also announced on Sunday that he was deploying 500 additional troops to western North Carolina. \"My administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin their road to rebuilding,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement.       </p><p>In an interview with ABC on Sunday, Ms. Criswell called the disinformation \"just plain false\" and \"truly dangerous.\" She said it was \"a shame that people are sitting home on their comfortable couches while we have thousands of people here on the ground that have left their own families to be able to help those in need.\"        </p><p>Ms. Criswell added that such rhetoric has created \"fear in our own employees.\" There have been calls for residents to form militias to defend against FEMA staff members, as well as antisemitic and misogynistic threats against them.        </p><p>\"Folks who just are begging for attention on their own or who want to sow seeds of chaos are, I don't know how else to say it - they are the worst of us right now,\" said Mayor Tim Futrelle of Boone, N.C.</p><p>The scope of misinformation has filtered down to local governments, a worrying trend that appeared during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Local officials said it was dismaying not only to see resources diverted away from the emergency response to combat the falsehoods, but also to face contempt and mistrust in such small communities.        </p><p>Many officials and volunteers say it has been painful to see their efforts discredited or questioned, often by people who may not have a direct connection to the area.        </p><p>\"It's a challenging thing to read and see those social media posts,\" said Aaron Aguirre, a Black Hawk pilot in the Tennessee National Guard. On Friday alone, he helped distribute about 4,500 pounds of supplies over eastern Tennessee.        </p><p>\"Everyone's here because they want to be, not because they have to be,\" he added. \"We are fully in this. We really want to be here.\"       </p><p>Some noted that the communications blackout from the storm, where residents went days without connecting to family, friends or the news, helped widen the void of information early in the recovery process. With many officials still managing rescue efforts, information can also quickly become outdated.        </p><p>\"The collective grief and disorientation of the aftermath is very real for everyone,\" said Hannah Minick, 36, a therapist who on Saturday sat under an embroidered tent with a hand-drawn \"here to listen\" sign in Swannanoa, N.C.</p><p>On the streets of Swannanoa, dozens of dusty and mud-covered vehicles carted cases of supplies. Helicopters were landing in the field next to a Harley-Davidson store. And multiple people said they knew help was coming from not only their neighbors and church groups, but also from agencies and people across the country.        </p><p>\"It feels good to know that people across the country are connected to us and are getting news about us,\" said Nancy Benedict, 77, holding a giant baked pretzel steps from a line of food tents.        </p><p>But, she and other residents said, the misinformation was a frustrating undercurrent to the stream of important information.         </p><p>\"It makes you really angry,\" said Sherry Griffith, 71, a retired special education teacher. When she and her husband went to visit a friend who was isolated by the floods, she quickly shut down the friend's worries that there was little aid trickling in, saying there was an abundance of support.        </p><p>\"I mean, look at this,\" Ms. Griffith added, gesturing to the nearby workers setting up hoses to deliver fresh water to people. \"Constantly.\"       </p><p>Audra D.

But the reality of a changing climate is slow-motion tragedy, broken bureaucracy and lingering tedium.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody goes to Hollywood movies, much less disaster movies, seeking realism. The catastrophes in summer blockbusters - superstorms, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis - can seem downright thrilling, especially when you factor in the personal dramas and simmering romances that are woven into the mayhem. There is no such thrill in real-life disasters - where the true horror story lies in just how poorly prepared we are for these increasingly common events, and how quickly a spectacular crisis transitions to a crushing procession of tedious setbacks and every day frustrations.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I first saw the trailer for \"Twisters\" - which opens in theaters on Friday - in May at a movie theater in Houston, where I live. I'd just returned from a trip to find my hometown had been slammed by a derecho, which, I soon learned, is a particularly nasty breed of windstorm. My power was out, and it was hot (as Houston in the spring generally is), so I decided to hit the nearest multiplex that had electricity. Before the main feature started, up popped the pretty faces of a cocky cowboy \"tornado wrangler,\" played by Glen Powell, and the more science-minded meteorologist, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, with whom he exchanges quips. \"You don't face your fears,\" the wrangler tells the scientist. \"You ride 'em.\"       </p><p>Yee-haw, I thought in the theater, as I wondered if my air-conditioning at home was back on.       </p><p>Last week, another powerful storm battered Houston, as Hurricane Beryl had a brief but eventful landfall on the South Texas coast. Record-high ocean temperatures had given Beryl a big boost, making it the most powerful hurricane on record this early in the Atlantic hurricane season. It killed 22 people (as of the latest tally), flooded roads and left more than two million people without power; last I checked, around 200,000 were still without electricity. A blockbuster romp like \"Twisters\" is a safe and sanitized way to experience a natural disaster: as a fantasy. But we can't let an escapist version of the climate crisis blind us to how woefully unready we are for the effects of the real thing.       </p><p>If Hollywood wanted to make a more accurate disaster movie, the plot might look something like this: After yet another unprecedented storm, the hero wakes up day after day sweaty and irritable. He tries in vain to reach a human being who can provide information on when the power might be back on. The food in the fridge is quickly rotting, so it gets tossed. The Wi-Fi is down as well, making work difficult, if not impossible. There's a two-hour wait at the few gas stations still open.       </p><p>In these post-catastrophe conditions life becomes a simmering boil - and I do mean boil - of aggravation interrupted by long bouts of tedium. \"It's very hot, and it's very boring,\" as a 12-year-old quoted in The Texas Tribune put it in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. \"There's nothing to do, you just have to sit there.\" Or, to paraphrase \"Twisters,\" you just have to ride it.       </p><p>Hollywood has long tried to capture nature's fickleness in the most dramatic terms possible. The 1970s brought us \"Earthquake\" (a seismic apocalypse in Los Angeles) and \"The Andromeda Strain\" (deadly pathogen threatens mankind), as well as deadly insect movies like \"The Swarm\" (killer bees), \"Empire of the Ants\" (gigantic ants) and \"The Giant Spider Invasion\" - all reflections of a newly heightened awareness, probably stoked by best sellers like Rachel Carson's 1962 expos\u00e9 \"Silent Spring,\" that Mother Nature was getting a little peeved. But anxiety over climate catastrophe was funneled into cool-looking effects and larger-than-life monsters, like giant spiders, which were way more fun to watch onscreen than a bunch of people complaining about smog.       </p><p>As a summer tent-pole movie, \"Twisters\" delivers the requisite spectacle, as trucks fly and storm chasers race. (In a nice meta-moment, the screen of a crowded movie theater is sucked into the gusty abyss.) But for all its swirling chaos, \"Twisters\" doesn't even pay lip service to climate change - and that's no surprise. Outside of occasional exceptions like \"Wall-E\" or the TV series \"Extrapolations,\" climate change isn't sexy or exciting enough for Hollywood entertainment.       </p><p>The depiction of disaster in \"Twisters\" belies the true nature of modern catastrophes, which linger for days, weeks and months as the victims deal with the on-the-ground realities of our refusal to adjust to, let alone forestall, this unfolding crisis. We may cheer the big-screen storm wrangler as he leads his heroic crew in his geared-up pickup truck to shoot fireworks into the tornado's funnel. But we never see him or his crew cleaning up the wreckage in the ensuing weeks, filling out insurance forms or praying for the return of air-conditioning in sweltering heat.       </p><p>From Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans to Superstorm Sandy in New York, we've seen time and again how the full scope of a climate disaster isn't contained in the moment the levees break or the oceans surge. Even as we thrill to escapist fare like \"Twisters,\" insurance companies are pulling back on policies in flood- and fire-prone areas, which is like an ominous movie trailer for the disasters yet to come.       </p><p>There is one element of \"Twisters\" that rings true emotionally in my experience as a storm-battered Houstonian. In several scenes, storm chasers halt their pursuit of the tornado to aid the residents of a shattered, battered town - even as rapacious speculators swoop in to buy ravaged land at a discount. Natural disasters don't bring out the best in everyone but they do tend to remind us of our shared humanity.       </p><p>In Houston, I've heard many stories over the last two weeks of people who were lucky enough not to lose power offering strangers beds, or freezer space, or air-conditioned rooms for simply hanging out. One friend even camped out in his buddy's bookstore, hunkering down in the science fiction section. None of those moments would add a thrill factor to a summer blockbuster. Yet they show us what kind of heroism that survival in a climate crisis requires of all of us.       </p><p>Chris Vognar is a cultural critic.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Clad in black-and-white skeleton suits and ornamented papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks, they wake the city to the sound of drums and bells summoning the ancestors.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their ritual carries deep significance, even lessons for the whole planet, said the artist and activist Imani Jacqueline Brown, who filmed the procession this year. \"They're breaching the divide between the world of the spirits and the world of the living,\" she said. \"They are singing to us that we've got to live today because tomorrow we might die.\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brown, 36, grew up in New Orleans; she now lives in London, a member of the research and visual investigations group Forensic Architecture. An exhibition at Storefront for Art and Architecture in Manhattan through Aug. 31 combines her research chops with the poetry and spirituality that she sees in the grass-roots culture in her hometown.       </p><p>The show, titled \"Gulf,\" is written with a strike-through and pronounced \"Strike Gulf.\" Its central focus is the impact of the oil and gas industry on South Louisiana. But the more sources Brown mines - including core samples of deep-sea drilling by geologists in the Gulf of Mexico and archives of oil boycott campaigns in the 1970s and 1980s, along with her own footage from New Orleans - the broader the scope of her project becomes. It reaches back into geological time while linking to the climate emergency today.       </p><p>The resulting works bring some welcome lyricism to the field of \"research art.\" The exhibition includes a video installation in which the Skull and Bone Gang procession, bathed in bluish light, is overlaid on footage she made at the city's aquarium, where sharks and rays float around a model of an offshore rig in a display about the Gulf of Mexico that is sponsored by oil corporations.       </p><p>\"I wanted to demystify oil and gas production,\" Brown said in an interview after the show's opening. \"The voice you need to adopt in order to communicate this information needs to be clear, but without losing the sense of poetry.\"       </p><p>Storefront, a nonprofit gallery, is known for projects that imagine alternative ways to organize and share public space. Brown's exhibition is part of a yearlong program titled \"Swamplands,\" that explores the \"material politics of water\" around the Gulf of Mexico, said Guillermo Ruiz de Teresa, the organization's deputy director and curator.       </p><p>Facing climate change, planners often default to \"solutionism, or engineering ourselves out of catastrophe,\" Ruiz said, adding, \"we're hoping to open up different ways to engage.\"       </p><p>To face down disaster is something of a New Orleans specialty. The city was once the largest slave market in North America, and its culture has been shaped by the long effects of colonization and enslavement. Oil extraction has transformed the region's land and waterways; petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River form what is known as \"cancer alley.\" Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010 and the ravages of the pandemic continue the litany of challenges.       </p><p>Brown was a teenager when Katrina's floodwaters overwhelmed the family's house in the Mid-City area. She finished high school on the East Coast then attended Columbia University, studying anthropology with an art minor. After college she took part in Occupy Wall Street, and in 2012, in Occupy Sandy, the activist-led relief effort following Hurricane Sandy.       </p><p>The echoes of Katrina rang like a summons home. \"Watching disaster capitalism swoop in, in the aftermath of the storm,\" she said, using Naomi Klein's term for the phenomenon in which corporations and speculators take advantage of calamities, \"I realized that I needed to go back to New Orleans.\"       </p><p>She invested herself in projects that blended art and organizing. She helped found Blights Out, a project that sought to purchase a blighted property fairly from its owners, not the predatory auction system that took hold after Katrina, and put it to community use. In 2018, working at the arts group Antenna, she organized a \"Fossil Free Festival\" to challenge the industry's local power.       </p><p>Since moving to London, Brown said, she has expanded her analytic range, first as a graduate student and then with Forensic Architecture, known for investigating state and corporate violence worldwide. \"I was bumping up against the complexity and layered nature of our ecological crisis,\" she said.       </p><p>At Forensic Architecture, she has steered a collaboration with RISE St. James, a grass-roots advocacy group. It uses remote-sensing data and historical maps to hone in on evidence, such as stands of trees, that may suggest burial grounds of enslaved people on the plantation lands that are now occupied by petrochemical plants.       </p><p>Brown's work in her Storefront exhibition likewise draws on archival research, data processing algorithms and mapping software. But \"Gulf\" is also an artistic project that bridges various disciplines.       </p><p>One theme is infrastructure. Covering one wall of the gallery is a hand-painted diagram that maps South Louisiana's oil and gas wells, dredging canals and pipelines. The source is a state database that Brown said has not been publicly accessible since she last used it in 2021. She used the same data to generate an online platform titled \"Follow the Oil.\"       </p><p>Another theme is multinational corporate power. A wall-scale collage features pamphlets and news articles pertaining to oil extraction in Louisiana and Angola from 1950 to 1975, when Angola gained independence from Portugal, after a long war of liberation. Gulf Oil, now defunct, was active in both places and the target of an international boycott campaign. The collage forms two nested spirals that evoke a hurricane.       </p><p>Elsewhere in the exhibition, printed on light boxes, are photographs of thin earth sections extracted in a 1968 drilling expedition in the Gulf. Brown also produced a video animation that takes us deep into the earth's core using drilling data from 2005; as it plays, we hear a soundtrack that the technology artist Mark Mushiva designed using an algorithm that converts the geological patterns to musical notes.       </p><p>More than just bridge disciplines, Brown aims to connect them with ancestral knowledge andcosmologies. Indigenous people, she noted, called the region Bulbancha, \"the land of many languages\" for its fertility and biodiversity - \"an ecological multicultural crossroads,\" as she puts it in a broadsheet that accompanies the exhibition.       </p><p>In our interview, she pointed out that the Kongo people, who helped shape New Orleans as one of the groups enslaved in the Middle Passage, depict the cycles of human existence through a circular cosmogram that inspired her collages and video animations. Its horizontal axis, known as the Kalunga line, indicates the boundary between the spirits and the living. That conception, she noted, persists to this day in rituals like the Skull and Bone Gang procession.       </p><p>\"The idea is that one is constantly moving across and between the above and below,\" Brown said. \"What knowledge we acquire in life, and how we ensure that we are not repeating the same mistakes generation after generation, is an overarching theme of the exhibition.\"       </p><p>Eyal Weizman, the founder and director of Forensic Architecture, said that Brown skillfully navigates between technical and poetic registers. \"She can be an expert witness in court, and at the same time she can take these data points and build something sensuous and appealing,\" he said. \"She understands the value of the world as it is in order to be transformed into something else.\"       </p><p>Driving Brown's art and research alike is her conviction that the world's ecological crises aren't intractable. \"We humans are able to look back across these great leaps of time and recognize the catastrophe that we are producing, and that we can also organize against,\" she said. \"And maybe we should choose to do that.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009614489</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CRX-W7K1-JC85-N002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 19, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Oil &amp;

This is something we must do for the good of the local church... I have prayed about this a great deal and have spoken with many trusted advisors and truly believe the Holy Spirit is leading us for the good of the people of God in the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://nolacatholic.org\">Archbishop Gregory Aymond said in a message</url> the October 29 letter that was read at every Mass at all parishes in the archdiocese last weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe final decisions are unique to each parish situation. It was incredibly important to us, and to me personally, that each parish knows their recommendations and desires for their future were not only heard, but considered,\u201d said the archbishop.</p><p>The consolidation plan, the fruits of a\u00a0\u00a0parish pastoral planning process that began over a year ago because of declining numbers natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes, the COVID-19 pandemic and skyrocketing property insurance rates, will be effective beginning July 1, 2024.</p><p>\u201cWhen we announced this process, we indicated that there were parishes with significant challenges that would begin an intense period of discernment to evaluate their future needs\u2026 using real data on the sacramental, pastoral programming, and temporal realities of each parish\u2019s unique situation, pastors, lay parish leadership, and parishioners were invited into dialogue to determine how to address the challenges facing them,\u201d the archbishop pointed out.\u00a0</p><p>This consolidation plan will close 10% of the archdiocese\u2019s 111 parishes. There are four instances where two parishes are merging into one, and one instance where three parishes are merging into one. In all, the changes will affect 16 parishes, 11 of which will merge with others to form five new ones. This is the archdiocese\u2019s largest restructuring plan since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. At that time, the archdiocese merged 40 parishes and closed 27 of its churches.</p><p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans, which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2020 because of the clergy abuse scandal, faces 500 sex abuse claims that could cost the archdiocese more than US$100 million. The archdiocese is already in the process of selling off some of the real estate it owns or controls, assets that have been estimated in insurance documents at more than $2.2 billion. Closing churches and selling off church properties would help produce money to pay settlement claims.</p><p>The archdiocese has denied that the 2020 bankruptcy filing anything to do with the \u201cParish Pastoral Planning\u201d changes announced last Sunday and that the changes had been under discussion since 2016. \u201cThe impact of the Chapter 11 reorganization on Parish Pastoral Planning is limited to the fact that the administrative offices of the archdiocese, because of its own financial situation and its need to maintain a balanced budget, can no longer supplement parishes and ministries that are struggling financially,\u201d the statement said. \"For decades the Archdiocese has simply paid bills that could not be paid or forgiven debts that could not be met at the parish or ministry level. The administration as well as all parishes and ministries of the Archdiocese of New Orleans must strive for vitality - being fully alive in Christ - including financial responsibility,\" it added.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/uploads/news/2023/11/united-states-archdiocese-of-new-orleans-to-shut-merge-parishes-18626-12.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LCRXIN-18626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LCRXIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69J3-9XW1-F105-V17T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Bayard-Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>La Croix International</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/news/religion/united-states-archdiocese-of-new-orleans-to-shut-merge-parishes/18626\">https://international.la-croix.com/news/religion/united-states-archdiocese-of-new-orleans-to-shut-merge-parishes/18626</url><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 2, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Bankruptcy Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJGRTFGMTM4NkMwNDhEMEE5NUU0QUZCN0QyMjlEREY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFEMzQyRUFEQzlENDA4MUE3RUUyOEI4NjhFRTFGRjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EzRUQ4NDQ0QjhDNDc2QzgwQkY3OUQyQzkzNDZGNEI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000309</classCode><className>CLERGY &amp;

Whilst full membership remains contingent on having national oil management strategies, the group is increasingly driving global understanding of what it calls \"clean technologies\" so as not to alienate nuclear power.</p><p>But there is more in stock for the experienced public officials at the agency.</p><p>\"If we want to deserve our name, International Energy Agency, we have to work very closely with and embrace the countries from the emerging world,\" said Birol.</p><p>One region stands out: Asia, where 500 GW of coal power plants are in the pipeline, according to US climate envoy John Kerry, who similarly attended the celebration. </p><p>In a region where additional energy capacity to be built in the coming 25 years exceeds the EU's current sum total, according to the Singaporean minister of industry, Tan See Leng, the IEA must be present - so the approach goes.</p><p>The organisation is opening its first-ever branch office in Singapore. \"This is another step to show that we want to work much closer with the emerging world,\" he explained.</p><p>Simultaneously, the organisation is also considering bringing India into the fold - New Delhi sent a letter in 2023 asking to join. Macron stressed that \"the launch of negotiations with India to join the IEA as a full member\" had his full support.</p><p>India is in the process of a massive grid build-out and is trying to integrate new coal power plants and rapidly increasing volumes of solar power simultaneously.\u00a0</p><p>The IEA has been supporting with \"analysis, expertise, capacity building both on the conventional energy sources, but also in helping us develop the renewables market, which is not exactly very easy,\" explained ambassador to France, Jawed Ashraf.</p><h>Expanded priorities</h><p>Agency chief Fatih Birol says the IEA should have three priorities: oil, critical minerals and the climate. They'd keep their eyes \"on the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz.\" On minerals, he announced a new initiative.</p><p>A \"Critical Minerals Security Program\" to address that \"currently we are not able to keep up with the demand\" for minerals like copper, cobalt and lithium, Birol explained. And \"the ability of manufacturing these critical minerals is concentrated in one single country or two,\" he stressed.</p><p>To stabilise oil prices and ensure sufficient supply, the IEA can coordinate a release of oil stocks of member countries to calm the market. The group had to take such drastic measures five times in its history: ahead of the Gulf War, Hurricane Katrina, the Libyan Civil War, and twice following Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p><p>A mechanism for critical minerals could be expected to work similarly. It would \"provide a safety net,\" according to the IEA chief.</p><p>On the climate, he stressed that \"achieving net zero while ensuring affordability and security is a clear mission for the International Energy Agency\" and that the IEA would \"do everything we can to help the world to achieve net zero by mid-century.\"\u00a0</p><h>A 'special friendship'</h><p>\"This is the celebration of an extraordinary friendship,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who'd flown in for the occasion.\u00a0</p><p>\"Since I took office as president of the European Commission, you have been the most trusted of partners,\" von der Leyen said about Fatih Birol, the IEA's president. She credits him with the bloc's key initiative at COP28: tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency improvement - which was ultimately endorsed.</p><p>\"You have changed the entire capacity of all of us to meet this challenge. Why? Because you've established facts. Because you have provided accountability where it didn't exist,\" said US climate envoy John Kerry.</p><p>Other leaders, too, showed appreciation for the IEA's global activities - aside from some 30 member countries, five are in the process of joining up, while heavyweights like Brazil, India and China are among the 13 associated members.\u00a0</p><p>Ireland's Taoiseach Leo Varadkar noted, \"with energy and security and climate change now immediate global realities, your work has never been more important.\"\u00a0</p><p>No high-level German representatives attended in person, and Chancellor Scholz will display a video message on Wednesday.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Alice Taylor]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentnewseuropesarmedwingoftheenergytransitionpivotstoasia</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BB6-W231-F03F-K53V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

A charity had donated furnishings, so as soon as the construction was finished, they stepped inside and it felt like home.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But another aspect felt even more important: The $550 he owed every month was not rent but a mortgage payment. The house would truly be his, something he could hand down to his daughters. \"Building generational blessings,\" as he put it.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than a decade later, though, the pistachio-green house with the shutters and big front porch that Mr. Hargrave believed would be his legacy is now in serious danger of being taken away. A blizzard of letters remind him of what he already knows: He is behind enough in his payments to be eligible for foreclosure.       </p><p>The cost of the property insurance that his mortgage agreement with Habitat requires has soared in the past couple of years. That, in turn, has pumped up his payments significantly - to $1,735 a month. He can't afford that, he said, no matter how many extra shifts he picks up at the warehouse where he works.       </p><p>\"I shouldn't be having to do this,\" Mr. Hargrove, 55, said of the juggling act his finances have become as he asks for extensions for some bills and does not pay the full amount for others. \"What more do I need to do?\"       </p><p>The situation has been held up as a dire warning for other homeowners across the state: Insurance premiums will most likely keep rising as a changing climate threatens more frequent and intense natural disasters in Louisiana, which is particularly vulnerable, and many other states.       </p><p>Of all the anxieties stirred by hurricane season - particularly this year's, which forecasters say could break records - the possibility of higher insurance costs has become one of the most pervasive. Beyond the premiums, homeowners have been daunted by the high deductibles they have to pay for repairs before their coverage kicks in.       </p><p>More than 120 owners of homes built by Habitat for Humanity in New Orleans are in the same bind as Mr. Hargrove, behind on payments and facing an imminent threat of foreclosure, officials with the nonprofit said.        </p><p>On Thursday, the New Orleans City Council provided a temporary fix, routing $2 million in federal pandemic funds to Habitat for Humanity to help stave off foreclosures for now. But it does not solve the broader dilemma, especially as more and more families fall behind.       </p><p>The promise of Habitat for Humanity has long been its ability to offer homeownership to low-income families who almost certainly could not attain it otherwise. The application process can be lengthy. The financial review is thorough, and instead of a down payment, a home requires 250 hours of \"sweat equity,\" or volunteering for the organization.       </p><p>Yet as Habitat saw it, families who met such standards showed that they were ready to take on the responsibility. At one point, Habitat's leaders said it was one of the busiest homebuilders in the city, having constructed hundreds of homes in the New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina ravaged much of the affordable housing stock in 2005.       </p><p>Now, what seemed a dream outcome for many of the homeowners has been upended, becoming yet another casualty of Louisiana's property insurance crisis. Habitat has already started foreclosure proceedings against 15 homeowners over the past year.       </p><p>The turbulence started after a series of natural disasters, including destructive hurricanes in 2020 and 2021. Facing a sea of costly claims, many property insurance providers either went bankrupt or fled the state. The companies that remained started charging much more.       </p><p>Some lower-income homeowners have abandoned coverage entirely. But for those who are required to have property insurance as a condition of their mortgage, it has turned homes that inspired pride and relief into sources of frustration and terrifying uncertainty.       </p><p>\"They're making very difficult choices and hoping against hope that insurance rates will go down,\" said Marguerite Oestreicher, the executive director of Habitat for Humanity in New Orleans, an affiliate of the global organization. \"If we get a big hurricane this year, all bets are off.\"       </p><p>In New Orleans, rising insurance prices have been only one piece of a patchwork of troubles related to housing in the city, residents said. Rents have been skyrocketing, too, and affordable housing has been scarce.       </p><p>Skeptics had expressed reservations about the city providing emergency financial support to Habitat for Humanity, singling out one group to help when so many residents are facing some version of the same predicament. Even supporters of the plan acknowledged that it is a stopgap measure, and that far more needs to be done to find a lasting solution.       </p><p>Some believe that one answer could be a housing trust fund. A ballot initiative to create one will go before New Orleans voters this fall. If passed, at least 2 percent of the city's yearly general operations budget would be diverted to the fund, which could help struggling homeowners and affordable housing development. The proposal could provide up to $20 million a year without adding new taxes, supporters said. (In 2024, the city's operating budget was more than $1.5 billion.)       </p><p>\"I think it's one of the best things we can do for right now,\" said Lesli Harris, a city councilwoman and leading proponent of the trust fund. \"I don't think this is the last we're going to see of people being in crisis because of insurance costs,.\"       </p><p>Yolanda Penny, a Habitat homeowner, fears that foreclosure would take her home and fling her into the unforgiving wildness that the New Orleans rental market can be.       </p><p>Some days, Ms. Penny, a hotel housekeeping manager, and a co-worker with the same housing plight can talk only about how concerned they are, which can send Ms. Penny into a spiral. Several times recently, her blood pressure jumped so much that she became dizzy and needed to go to the hospital.       </p><p>\"I love my home,\" she said. \"I was just saying, 'This is mine.' I was overwhelmed.\"       </p><p>The concept behind Habitat for Humanity is often misconstrued as giving volunteer-built homes to needy families, Ms. Oestreicher said. In reality, she said, \"It's a hand up, not a handout.\"       </p><p>The houses - which now cost about $180,000 for a three-bedroom, two bath - are typically built from a standard plan (most are about 1,100 square feet), but families can make some choices, like the colors of the siding and trim, the countertops in the kitchen and bathroom, and the flooring.       </p><p>The homeowners make a monthly payment to Habitat that includes the principal on an interest-free loan, real estate taxes, property insurance and termite extermination, but the single biggest driver of the increased payments has been insurance, nonprofit officials said.       </p><p>Ms. Penny, who moved into her home in 2011, heard about the possibility when Habitat for Humanity gave a presentation at her workplace. She was approved and was able to move into a newly built four-bedroom house with her three daughters and son. The monthly payment then was about $585. \"I couldn't beat that,\" she said.       </p><p>After Hurricane Ida in 2021, her insurance company left the state and she wound up with Louisiana Citizens, the so-called insurer of last resort, which is backed by the state and charges a significantly higher rate in order to encourage homeowners to use other providers if at all possible.       </p><p>Her monthly payment shot up from $661 to $1,282. She said she tried to pay what she could, about $900 a month, hoping it is enough to delay foreclosure. It has not helped that her supervisor position at the hotel was cut during the pandemic, which left her in a reduced role with fewer hours.       </p><p>\"I'm just trying to catch up,\" Ms. Penny, 59, said. \"It's going to take years and years to catch up. I don't want to lose my house. It's killing me.\"       </p><p>Shelley Preston, 69, understands that pressure. She remembers moving into her Habitat for Humanity home 15 years ago after living in government-supported housing and being a renter. \"It's fresh and it's clean,\" she said. \"Everything's working.\"       </p><p>The house is a realization of a dream. Holding onto it matters more than anything.       </p><p>Her monthly payments have climbed from about $650 to more than $900. She pays $800, which is still far more than she can realistically afford.       </p><p>She lost her job as a paraprofessional for a charter school two years ago and now works as a substitute teacher, her income varying depending on how often she is called in. In the summer, Ms. Preston, whose husband died in 1990, gets by on widow benefits, which amount to about $1,150 a month.       </p><p>\"If I was working, no problem,\" she said of her increased monthly payment. \"It's just so much.\"       </p><p>She cannot conjure the thought of having to go somewhere else.       </p><p>\"I'm just going to keep on,\" she said on a recent afternoon as she sat in her living room, torrential rain battering the house. She described the plans for remodeling that she has been sketching out in her mind. She would rip out the carpet and install vinyl plank flooring that looks like wood. She would have the house painted and finally get her porch fixed. In this vision, the mortgage would be paid off.       </p><p>Then, she opened an envelope from the bank that had just arrived in the mail with another warning. \"Oh, Lord,\" she said. Everything was a blur except for one word: \"Foreclosure.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009590398</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPN-2911-JC85-N00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 13, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624229MM</classCode><className>VOLUNTEER HOUSE BUILDING &amp;

In Gallup polling, his approval ratings are lower than those of any president embarking on a re-election campaign, from Dwight Eisenhower to Donald Trump.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet an air of mystery hangs around his lousy polling numbers. As The Washington Free Beacon's Joe Simonson noted recently, just surfing around most American media and pop culture, you probably wouldn't realize that Biden's job approval ratings are quite <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">so</emphasis> historically terrible, worse by far than Trump's at the same point in his first term.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apart from anxiety about his age, there isn't a chattering-class consensus or common shorthand for why his presidency is such a political flop. Which is why, perhaps, there was a rush to declare his State of the Union address a rip-roaring success, as though all Biden needs to do to right things is to talk loudly through more than an hour of prepared remarks.       </p><p>When things went south for other recent chief executives, there was usually a clearer theory of what was happening. Trump's unpopularity was understood to reflect his chaos and craziness and authoritarian forays. The story of George W. Bush's descending polls was all about Iraq and Hurricane Katrina. When Barack Obama was at his polling nadir, most observers blamed the unemployment rate and the Obamacare backlash, and when Bill Clinton struggled through his first two years, there was a clear media narrative about his lack of discipline and White House scandals.       </p><p>With Biden, it has been different. Attempts to reduce his struggles to the inflation rate are usually met with vehement rebuttals, there's a strong market for \"bad vibes\" explanations of his troubles, a lot of blame gets placed on partisan polarization even though Biden won a clear popular majority not so long ago, and even the age issue has taken center stage only in the past few months.       </p><p>Some of this mystification reflects liberal media bias accentuated by contemporary conditions - an unwillingness to look closely at issues like immigration and the border, a hesitation to speak ill of a president who's the only bulwark against Trumpism.       </p><p>But I experience some mystification myself. I think that Biden's record has big problems and that the economy isn't as golden as some of his defenders claim. But even I look at his numbers and think, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">really, that bad?</emphasis></p><p>I also think, though, that this kind of media mystification is what you'd expect given the political realignment we're experiencing, where right and left are sorting increasingly by class and education, and where anti-institutionalism has migrated more to the political right.       </p><p>This transformation means that the Republican voters whose support Biden never had are often more culturally distant from liberal tastemakers than were the Republicans of the Clinton or Obama years. But it also means that many of the voters Biden is losing now, the swing voters driving his approval ratings down and down, are likewise fairly alien to the cultural and media establishment.       </p><p>Some of them are the sort of disillusioned and infrequent voters whose grievances tend to be harder to pin down. But many are politically moderate minority voters, especially lower-middle-class Hispanics and African Americans, who already tended somewhat rightward in 2016 and 2020 but now seem to be abandoning Biden in larger numbers. In a recent Substack post, Ruy Teixeira described the realignment since 2012: \"In that election, Obama carried nonwhite working-class (noncollege) voters by a massive 67 points, while <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">losing</emphasis> white college graduates by seven points.\" Whereas today, \"Biden is actually doing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">worse</emphasis> among the nonwhite working class, carrying them by a mere six points, than among white college graduates, where he enjoys a 15 point advantage over Trump.\"       </p><p>In theory, the recent push for racial representation in elite America should have made the establishment more attuned to the concerns of nonwhite voters. But in practice, this push tended to treat representation and progressive politics as a package deal, making nonwhites with moderate-to-conservative views more exotic, not less - as mystifying, in a way, as any MAGA-hat-wearing white guy in a rural diner.       </p><p>Again, I'm part of that establishment, and I don't want to pretend that I have my finger fully on the pulse of, say, blue-collar Hispanics who went for Biden in 2020 but now lean toward Trump.       </p><p>But if you take that kind of constituency as a starting place, you may be able to reason your way to a clearer understanding of Biden's troubles: by thinking about ways in which high borrowing costs for homes and cars seem especially punishing to voters trying to move up the economic ladder, for instance, or how the hold of cultural progressivism over Democratic politics might be pushing more culturally conservative minorities to the right even if wokeness has peaked in some elite settings.       </p><p>These are theories; maybe there's a better one. But the first step to saving Biden's re-election effort is to acknowledge the need for such an explanation - because unpopularity that you can't fathom can still throw you out of office.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

A potter's field burial site on Hart Island was receiving 24 bodies each day, as many as the city typically used to bury there in a week.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month in Karachi, Pakistan, temperatures approached 120 degrees Fahrenheit and hospitals reportedly treated thousands for heatstroke. A nonprofit operating four mortuaries registered 128 deaths in a single day, mostly of people on the margins of society. The next day it registered 135. There are no reliable citywide death totals, but over a five-day period the Edhi Foundation, which handles about 40 daily deaths in more normal times, says it took in 568 bodies.       </p><p>Last weekend, the heat came home for Americans. In June, more than one-third of the country's population was under extreme heat advisories, but immediately after Independence Day things intensified. In Palm Springs, Calif., temperatures reached a record 124 degrees, Las Vegas broke its own previous record by three degrees and in Death Valley, Calif., temperatures reached 129, within one degree of the all-time, anywhere-in-the-world modern record. Across the West, temperatures routinely registered 15 to 30 degrees above average, and in California, at the beginning of a \"historic\" heat wave made five times more likely by climate change, scientists predicted a statewide death toll of about 100 each day.       </p><p>In his vivid book \"The Heat Will Kill You First,\" Jeff Goodell describes one worst-case scenario as \"the Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat,\" echoing the words of the researcher Mikhail Chester: a dayslong blackout in metropolitan Phoenix coinciding with a now-routine heat wave and half of the city requiring medical attention. This is, admittedly, an unlikely set of circumstances - the whole city going fully dark for a few days, then taking a few more to get power up and running again. But suspected heat deaths in Phoenix have nearly doubled since last year, when temperatures reached 110 or more for 31 straight days and the city's burn centers were filling up with people who had fainted or fallen and been scalded by asphalt. Fourteen people died from those contact burns; this year, so far, four have.       </p><p>It has been a remarkable year globally, with 12 straight months now registering global average temperatures more than 1.5 degrees above the preindustrial average. More than 60 percent of the global population - almost five billion people - faced extreme heat between June 16 and June 24, according to analysis by Climate Central, including about 600 million each in both China and India.       </p><p>In Delhi, India, June highs averaged 107 degrees and May highs averaged over 106. By the middle of June, the city recorded its hottest night in over five decades, and the Safdarjung hospital there reported nearly 10 times as many deaths as had been observed earlier in the month, when temperatures were already extremely high, as Anumeha Yadav reported for the The Migration Story in a harrowing dispatch from the hospital's \"heat ward.\" One of the patients, a young migrant in his 20s who worked the pizza oven for a delivery service, arrived with a temperature over 105 degrees and a heart rate of 170 beats per minute. He was registered with only a first name. \"A tall security guard, in a black and red uniform, stepped out of the hospital's new emergency block and called out,\" Yadav wrote. \"Who is with Rohit? Who is with Rohit?\" There was no response.       </p><p>In Japan, one city's all-time heat record was broken by 11 degrees Celsius a month before the country's hottest time of year. In Greece last month, so many tourists died or went missing, got disoriented and then collapsed, that the country issued a special advisory warning visitors of the dangers - then did it again this month, when another heat wave drove \"insane\" temperatures. Earlier in the spring, a heat wave made 35 times more likely by climate change killed more than 100 people in Mexico - though the true count is almost certainly higher - and a heat wave that would have been impossible without climate change swept across Mali, in Africa's Sahel region, where the Gabriel Tour\u00e9 hospital in Bamako registered almost as many deaths over four days as it typically sees in a month.       </p><p>But the most harrowing event of the summer so far took place during the annual hajj to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, where temperatures hit 125 degrees Fahrenheit and at least 1,300 performing the pilgrimage died in the heat. That official count may well be far less than the real death toll, says Fahad Saeed, a Pakistani climate scientist who has studied the risks of extreme heat for the pilgrimage. On each of the five days of the hajj, he said, the combination of temperature and humidity in Mecca crossed into what he calls the \"fatal zone.\"       </p><p>This has all been predicted; indeed, the harsh future of the hajj could be called its own little climate-science subdiscipline. But as with nearly all climate projections, it is an open question whether those warnings did more to inspire adaptive response or to anesthetize us to the punishing impacts once they came. In a 2021 paper, Saeed and his colleagues projected that at 1.5 degrees of warming, the risk of heat stroke on the hajj would increase five times compared to a world without warming. At two degrees of warming the risk would double - ten times higher.       </p><p>In a few years the shifting lunar calendar will move the hajj into Saudi Arabia's winter, but by the late 2040s it will return to September, the calendar's most punishing month. By then, current rates of warming suggest the world may reach the two-degree-Celsius threshold, increasing the probability of fatal risks 13-fold compared to present levels, according to estimates by Saeed and his colleagues. At current rates of warming, the world may hit that threshold in that same decade. \"And adaptation options have limits,\" Saeed says. \"There were big claims from the Saudi government about all they would do to protect people. But we saw before our eyes that those options failed.\"       </p><p>This year 1.8 million Muslims performed the hajj, almost half of them over the age of 55 - many of them having spent decades saving money for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, and now dramatically more vulnerable to heat stress than they might have been a few decades earlier. By 2030 Saudi Arabia, which makes tens of billions of dollars each year from pilgrimages and roughly $100 billion to $150 billion each year in oil profits, is hoping to increase the number of pilgrims to five million.       </p><p>Since the 2020 publication of Kim Stanley Robinson's \"The Ministry for the Future,\" that novel's opening has offered perhaps the most talked-about depiction of the risks of extreme heat - 20 million Indians dying suddenly from exposure to extreme temperatures. Many experts have cautioned that this apocalyptic vision is vanishingly unlikely, at least anytime soon, with others emphasizing that conventional algorithms for determining the survivability of heat, on which many future projections for \"inhabitability\" are built, suffer from several simplifications and shortcomings: that the thresholds were calculated in experiments conducted in cooler countries, with participants unacclimated to extreme heat; that adaptations from cooling centers to widespread air-conditioning and shifting social practices from clothing to diet to daily schedules can significantly mitigate the risks; that simple knowledge of those risks, particularly when clearly communicated, can meaningfully lessen harms; and that though many people are likely to die, over time those in northern latitudes may become more resilient in the face of extreme temperatures.       </p><p>But sometimes in dismissing apocalyptic scenarios - or even just in establishing context for them - we seem to diminish subapocalyptic ones, as well. Among the most remarkable things about this newsletter is that I could've written it, or some close approximation of it, in any of the last few years. In 2021, a lethal one-in-10,000-year heat wave hit the Pacific Northwest. In 2022, approximately 62,000 deaths in Europe were attributed to summertime temperatures there. Last year, at least 240 people died on the hajj. We may be nowhere near a 20-million-scale event, and deaths from cold may remain the larger public health problem, but 500,000 excess global deaths are already attributed annually to extreme heat. It is only 2024, and there are many decades of warming to come.              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further Reading</emphasis></p><p>\"No one knows exactly how many people are dying from extreme heat\": Bloomberg's Zahra Hirji and Preeti Soni on the epistemological challenge of heat death.       </p><p>\"These results indicate that a significant portion of the world's population will experience - for the first time in human history - prolonged exposures to uncompensable extreme moist heat\": a comprehensive survey of the risk of future temperatures on human health published last year in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</emphasis></p><p>\"Can we air condition our way out of extreme heat?\" asks Andrew Dessler at the Climate Brink. (And previous posts by Dessler about how heat kills and comparing deaths from extreme cold to those from extreme heat.)       </p><p>Jeff Goodell on \"the heat wave scenario that keeps climate scientists up at night.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009564248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CFV-07B1-JC85-N00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 12, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

The country is administered by two rival governments, complicating rescue and aid efforts, and despite its vast oil resources, its infrastructure had been poorly maintained after more than a decade of political chaos.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the city of Derna alone, at least 5,200 people died, said Tarek al-Kharraz, a spokesman for the interior ministry of the government that oversees eastern Libya, according to the Libyan television station al-Masar. But the floodwaters also swept through other eastern settlements, including Shahhat, Al-Bayda and Marj, and at least 20,000 people were displaced.       </p><p>Thousands more were missing and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days. The flooding left bodies scattered in the streets while buckling buildings, sinking vehicles and blocking roads, impeding access to the most stricken areas.       </p><p>\"We still cannot comprehend the magnitude of what has happened,\" said Jawhar Ali, 28, a Derna native who lives in Turkey and spent two sleepless nights seeking news from his family back home, where communications were cut off by the disaster. \"The shock we are experiencing is terrible.\"       </p><p>Analysts said the country's woes - political division, economic instability, corruption, environmental degradation and dilapidated infrastructure - seemed to coalesce in one catastrophe when the dams south of the city collapsed. The flooding came days after an earthquake in Morocco, another North African nation, killed more than 2,900 people.       </p><p>But to Anas El Gomati, director of the Sadeq Institute, a Libyan policy research center, the two events felt profoundly different, given the unpredictable timing of the earth's tremors compared with a storm like Daniel, which can be forecast hours or days ahead.       </p><p>Even after the storm displayed its destructive power last week in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, killing more than a dozen people, Libyan authorities seemed to have no serious plan to monitor the dams, warn residents or evacuate them, Mr. El Gomati said.       </p><p>\"We say Mother Nature, but this is the act of man - it's the incompetence of Libya's political elites,\" Mr. El Gomati said. \"There's no words you can find to describe the biblical level of suffering those people have to endure.\"       </p><p>The dams unleashed water that poured through Derna, a city of roughly 100,000 people, Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for the Libyan National Army, the dominant political force in the area, said in a televised news conference on Monday.       </p><p>\"It's the first time we've been exposed to this type of weather,\" Mr. al-Mismari said, calling the scenario \"completely unexpected.\" Conditions were making it difficult to orchestrate rescue and aid operations, with all roads to the most affected areas either cut off or nearly cut off, he said.       </p><p>Citizens who escaped Derna left the city \"as if they were born today, with nothing,\" he said.       </p><p>The flooding recalled the effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the storm struck Louisiana and became a calamity after levees in New Orleans ruptured, inundating vast parts of the city.       </p><p>It also underscored how climate change can combine with political conflicts and economic failure to magnify the scale of disasters.       </p><p>Libya is divided between the internationally recognized government based in Tripoli, the capital, and a separately administered region in the east, including Derna - where the main power broker is the Libyan National Army and its commander, Khalifa Hifter, a longtime militia leader.       </p><p>\"Libya for the past 10 years has gone through one war to another, one political crisis to another,\" said Claudia Gazzini, a senior Libya analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"Essentially this has meant that, for the past 10 years, there hasn't really been much investment in the country's infrastructure.\"       </p><p>The country is also especially vulnerable to climate change and severe storms. Warming causes the waters of the Mediterranean to expand and its sea levels to rise, eroding shorelines and contributing to flooding, with low-lying coastal areas of Libya at particular risk, according to the United Nations.       </p><p>On average, hurricane-like storms form once or twice a year over the Mediterranean Sea, usually in autumn, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases warm the planet, rainstorms of many kinds generally deliver heavier loads of precipitation for a simple reason: Hotter air can hold more moisture.       </p><p>Most of Libya's population lives in coastal areas, and intense storm surges could wreak widespread infrastructural damage, warned a 2021 brief from the Climate Security Expert Network, a group advising on climate-related security risks.       </p><p>On Tuesday, a local official speaking to al-Masar said that another dam in the eastern region was filled with water and on the brink of collapse. The Jaza dam - located between Derna and the city of Benghazi - needed maintenance to prevent another disaster, the mayor of the municipality of Tocra, Mahmoud Al Sharaima, said.       </p><p>\"The recent Daniel storm has brought to light the fact that Libya is ill-prepared to handle the effects of climate change and extreme weather events,\" said Malak Altaeb, a Libyan consultant and researcher on environmental policy in the Middle East and North Africa. \"The need for urgent action to address these pressing issues can no longer be overstated.\"       </p><p>Derna, which is on Libya's northeastern coast, was built on the ruins of an ancient Greek colony. Mr. El Gomati, the policy research center director, described it as a beautiful seaside town, once known for its culture, poetry and theater.       </p><p>\"Local residents used to claim that it was a piece of heaven that dropped from the sky,\" he said.       </p><p>Ms. Gazzini, the analyst, recalled visiting a few months ago and crossing the valley that flooded this weekend. \"I never saw any water, and I was always thinking, Why is there such a big valley in this empty space here?\" she said.       </p><p>But the dry riverbeds that dot the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa can flood rapidly when it rains heavily, as the parched earth struggles to absorb the downpour.       </p><p>\"What happened in Derna was beyond imaginable - you would never think of such torrential rain in a desert country that hasn't seen this type of flooding,\" Ms. Gazzini said.        </p><p>Political instability can also worsen environmental degradation through deforestation and illegal construction, said Ms. Altaeb, the consultant, reducing the ability of the land to absorb rain, increasing surface runoff and heightening the risk of flooding.       </p><p>Libya endured 42 years of autocratic rule under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi before he was overthrown in a revolt in 2011, during the Arab Spring.       </p><p>Over the next decade, the country was fractured by a civil war that drew in multiple foreign players, including the United States. At one point, Turkey backed a provisional government in Tripoli while Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt supported Mr. Hifter, a former Libyan general.       </p><p>Today, the country is governed by the western administration based in Tripoli, led by Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeiba, and an eastern-based authority led by Osama Hamad. Dozens of armed groups remain influential, a point reinforced by deadly clashes last month in Tripoli. Despite possessing the largest oil and gas reserves on the African continent, the country was ill-equipped to deal with disaster.       </p><p>The different authorities in Libya appeared to be working together to some extent to coordinate the search and rescue efforts, as medical teams began converging on the region to treat survivors and search for the missing. They included rescue workers sent by the government in Tripoli as well as others sent by Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, who arrived in the eastern city of Benghazi on Tuesday.

Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light, but there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure.       </p><p>But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. \"The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat,\" is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people.       </p><p>Most people who died in Louisiana during Katrina died from drownings, injuries or heart conditions. But Dr. Chester was using Katrina as a metaphor for what can happen to a city unprepared for an extreme climate catastrophe. In New Orleans, the levee system was overwhelmed by torrential rains; eventually, 80 percent of the city was underwater.       </p><p>What if, instead, the electricity goes out for several days during a blistering summer heat wave in a city that depends on air-conditioning in those months?       </p><p>In Dr. Chester's scenario, a compounding crisis of extreme heat and a power failure in a major city like Houston could lead to a series of cascading failures, exposing vulnerabilities in the region's infrastructure that are difficult to foresee and could result in thousands, or even tens of thousands, of deaths from heat exposure in a matter of days. The risk to people in cities would be higher because all the concrete and asphalt amplifies the heat, pushing temperatures as much as 15 degrees to 20 degrees in the midafternoon above surrounding vegetated areas.       </p><p>The derecho that hit Houston was a warning of just how quickly risks are multiplying in our rapidly warming world. As if to prove this point, some 10 days after the Houston blackout, another windstorm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in and around Dallas.       </p><p>One of the most dangerous illusions of the climate crisis is that the technology of modern life makes us invincible. Humans are smart. We have tools. Yeah, it will cost money. But we can adapt to whatever comes our way. As for the coral reefs that bleach in the hot oceans and the howler monkeys that fell dead out of trees during a recent heat wave in Mexico, well, that's sad but life goes on.       </p><p>This is, of course, an extremely privileged point of view. For one thing, more than 750 million people on the planet don't have access to electricity, much less air-conditioning. (In India, New Delhi experienced temperatures as high as 120 degrees last week, leading to an increase in heatstroke, fears of blackouts and the possibility of water rationing.) But it is also a na\u00efve point of view, if only because our bubble of invincibility is far more fragile than we know. So what can we expect in a heat Katrina?       </p><p>Last year, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Arizona State University and the University of Michigan published a study looking at the consequences of a major blackout during an extreme heat wave in three cities: Phoenix, Detroit and Atlanta. In the study, the cause of the blackout was unspecified.       </p><p>\"It doesn't really matter if the blackout is the result of a cyberattack or a hurricane,\" Brian Stone, the director of the Urban Climate Lab at Georgia Tech and the lead author on the study, told me. \"For the purposes of our research, the effect is the same.\" Whatever the cause, the study noted that the number of major blackouts in the United States more than doubled between 2015-16 and 2020-21.       </p><p>Dr. Stone and his colleagues focused on those three American cities because they have different demographics, climates and dependence on air-conditioning. In Detroit, 53 percent of buildings have central air-conditioning; in Atlanta, 94 percent; in Phoenix, 99 percent. The researchers modeled the health consequences for residents in a two-day, citywide blackout during a heat wave, with electricity gradually restored over the next three days.       </p><p>The results were shocking: in Phoenix, about 800,000 people - roughly half the population - would need emergency medical treatment for heat stroke and other illnesses. The flood of people seeking care would overwhelm the city's hospitals. More than 13,000 people would die.       </p><p>Under the same scenario in Atlanta, researchers found there would be 12,540 visits to emergency rooms. Six people would die. In Detroit, which has a higher percentage of older residents and a higher poverty rate than those other cities, 221 people would die.       </p><p>Perhaps we should not be surprised by these numbers. Researchers estimate 61,672 people died in Europe from heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, the hottest season on record on the continent at the time. In June of 2021, a heat wave resulted in nearly 900 excess deaths in the Pacific Northwest. And in 2010, an estimated 56,000 Russians died during a record summer heat wave.       </p><p>The hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heat stroke and other heat illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet. Last year was the warmest year on record, and the 10 hottest years have all occurred in the last decade.       </p><p>In the study simulating a heat wave in those three cities, researchers found that the much larger death toll in Phoenix was explained by two factors. First, the temperatures modeled during a heat wave in Phoenix (90 to 113 degrees) were much higher than the temperatures in Atlanta (77 to 97 degrees) or Detroit (72 to 95 degrees). And second, the greater availability of air-conditioning in Phoenix means the risks from a power failure during a heat wave are much higher.       </p><p>A lot can be done to reduce these risks. Building cities with less concrete and asphalt and more parks and trees and access to rivers and lakes would help. So would a more sophisticated nationally standardized heat wave warning system. Major cities also need to identify the most vulnerable residents and develop targeted emergency response plans and long-term heat management plans.       </p><p>Making the grid itself more resilient is equally important. Better digital firewalls at grid operation centers thwart hacker intrusions. Burying transmission lines protects them from storms. Batteries to store electricity for emergencies are increasingly inexpensive.       </p><p>But the hotter it gets, the more vulnerable the grid becomes, even as demand for electricity spikes because customers are running their air-conditioning full throttle. Transmission lines sag, transformers explode, power plants fail. One 2016 study found the potential for cascading grid failures across Arizona to increase 30-fold in response to a 1.8 degree rise in summer temperatures.       </p><p>\"Most of the problems with the grid on hot days come from breakdowns at power plants or on the grid caused by the heat itself, or from the difficulty of meeting high demand for cooling,\" Doug Lewin, a grid expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power newsletter, told me. The best way to fix that, Mr. Lewin argued, is to encourage people to reduce power demand in their homes with high efficiency heat pumps, better insulation and smart thermostats, and to generate their own power with solar panels and battery storage.       </p><p>The looming threat of a heat Katrina is a reminder of how technological progress creates new risks even as it solves old ones. On a brutally hot day during a recent trip to Jaipur, India, I visited an 18th century building that had an indoor fountain, thick walls, and a ventilation system designed to channel the wind through each room. There was no air-conditioning, but the building was as cool and comfortable as a new office tower in Houston.       </p><p>Air-conditioning may indeed be a modern necessity that many of us who live in hot parts of the world can't survive without. But it is also a technology of forgetting. Once upon a time, people understood the dangers of extreme heat and designed ways to live with it. And now, as temperatures rise as a result of our hellbent consumption of fossil fuels, tens of thousands of lives may depend on remembering how that was done. Or finding better ways to do it.       </p><p>Jeff Goodell is the author of \"The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

The investment philosophy rests on transparency, risk management and diversification while the robustness of the investment approach was tested, and confirmed, in 2022.</p><p>SCOR Investment Partners thus confirms its position as a leading player in the ILS segment, bringing ILS assets under management to almost USD 3.2 billion. SCOR Investment Partners' ILS platform, led by Sidney Rostan, manages a second flagship fund alongside Atropos, the SCOR ILS Fund - Atropos Catbond Fund, which invests solely in catastrophe bonds and has over USD 790 million in assets under management.</p><p>Conditions in the ILS market continue to be buoyant both in the catastrophe bond and private reinsurance transaction segments at the start of the year. Indeed, the primary market has been very active, and continues to be driven by a persistent demand for protection. With yields at historically attractive levels, such conditions combine to create favourable conditions for strengthening performance and reducing portfolio risks.</p><p>Fabrice Rossary, CEO of SCOR Investment Partners, comments: \" To reach this milestone after a year marked by Hurricane Ian the second most expensive insured natural event in history, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, confirms our clients' confidence in our approach.\"</p><p>- End -</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For more information</emphasis>, please contact Louis Bourrousse, Head of Business Development, +33 1 58 44 78 62,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NAM8OCVqyQlaD41IeLv34Lqq4GJzM2-YIfj5IVwPTUyDOXJYkwj1HDTd7yNTJBOqy3Q31l3ZpaYtI-UDpzvBIj6XudbltNS-2zcBFzCvBIE=\">lbourrousse@scor.com</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About SCOR Investment Partners</emphasis></p><p>Financing the sustainable development of societies, together.</p><p>SCOR Investment Partners is the asset management company of the SCOR Group.

The South has its gas stations.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When you stop for motor oil in Mississippi, you can also grab fried chicken on a stick. In North Carolina, you can buy a steamy bowl of pozole along with batteries and a five-pound bag of White Lily flour.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There might be shawarma next to the shotgun shells, or wedges of mild hoop cheese and packets of saltines for sale at the counter along with lottery tickets and pecan pie that the owner's sister made.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Documenting these independent Southern temples of commerce and community has become a singular focus for the photojournalist Kate Medley, who, like most kids raised in Mississippi, grew up eating at rural gas stations.       </p><p>Now living in Durham, N.C., Ms. Medley, 42, has spent more than a decade collecting images for her book of photographs, \"Thank You Please Come Again,\" which the digital magazine The Bitter Southerner published in December. The book began with a journalist's curiosity, but ended up as a way for a daughter of the Deep South to make sense of the beautiful, brutal, complicated place she came from.       </p><p>\"These places hold great mystery,\" she said. \"You're rolling down the road and they catch your visual attention. Then you wonder what's behind that glass door when you hear that little bell ring. Is it the MAGA South? The welcoming South? Who's at the cash register? Who's at the grill?\"       </p><p>A dozen years ago, Ms. Medley discovered a Citgo in Durham that had become a Nicaraguan place called the Latin America Food Restaurant. She developed a theory.       </p><p>\"I thought I could chart the emerging immigrant foodways of the South by way of what was happening in the backs of these gas stations,\" she said.       </p><p>Some independent gas stations are fading in the fluorescent light of chains like QuikTrip and RaceTrac, with their cheap gasoline, hot-dog rollers and endless banks of soda machines. Some station owners let the gas pumps run dry or remove them altogether because the local economy is too depressed. Other gas stations have become churches or nightclubs, or have been abandoned altogether.       </p><p>The book opens with an essay by the Southern writer Kiese Laymon, who grew up in a very different part of Jackson, Miss., than Ms. Medley. She didn't know him when she reached out, but he understood her project immediately.       </p><p>\"I'd never thought about the fact that my favorite restaurants, as a child, as a teenager, as an adult returning to Mississippi, nearly all served gas,\" he writes. \"And I never, ever, thought of them as gas stations that served food.\"       </p><p>He tells the story of childhood trips to Jr. Food Mart in Forest, Miss., on Friday nights. His grandmother's boyfriend, Ofa D, would slip in a Tina Turner tape and drive them in his pickup. They'd order a box of dark-meat chicken, a foam container of fried fish and a brown paper sack filled with the fried potato wedges everyone in Mississippi knows as potato logs.       </p><p>It dawned on Ms. Medley that you could study a region by way of its food in 2005, when she landed at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where she began a master's program in Southern studies.       </p><p>Hurricane Katrina hit the day after she started. She spent the next several months traveling the state to cover the devastation for The New York Times, her journeys fueled by rural gas stations.       </p><p>They often run on a Southern \"get 'er done\" attitude. If customers want cakes, someone will start baking. A cashier in North Carolina figured out that she could make a little extra money buying some Bojangles sausage biscuits on her way to work, marking them up and selling them to the breakfast crowd.       </p><p>\"It's just this ingenuity and resourcefulness you don't find other places,\" Ms. Medley said.       </p><p>That's particularly true for some gas stations run by immigrants. Ms. Medley shot images of Nina Patel and her samosas  at Tasty Tikka, inside a Shell station in Irmo, S.C., and Gina Nguyen holding a garlic butter shrimp banh mi at Banh Mi Boys, which opened in a family-owned Texaco in Metairie, La.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Ms. Medley took me to a place in the middle of Mississippi Delta farmland that also sprang from an immigrant story.       </p><p>Mark Fratesi's father opened Fratesi Grocery and Service Center in 1941 in Leland. It's a wonderland of homemade pork rinds, pantry staples and bait, with a freezer full of frozen steaks and bags of unshelled pecans. It runs on the honor system. You tell the cashier what you had for lunch. If you're local, you can put your groceries or gas on a tab.       </p><p>The restaurant takes up about half the building, and the family's Italian immigration roots are all over the menu. There are grits and burgers, but also a rigatoni plate lunch and a po' boy (their own invention) made with deep-fried balls of chopped black olives, shredded mozzarella and seasoned breadcrumbs bound together with a little mayonnaise and ranch dressing. Canvas-wrapped logs of seasoned, salted pork loin called lonza cure in the beer cooler.       </p><p>Mr. Fratesi, 68, doesn't think the place will last much past his retirement. Already, a chain gas station down the road has undercut his gasoline prices by a dime. And no one in the family's next generation is interested in taking over.       </p><p>\"You have to be married to it,\" he said.       </p><p>About 15 miles away in Indianola, the future is brighter.       </p><p>Betty Campbell, 69, and her husband opened Betty's Place in a former gas station, about 20 years ago. The restaurant is about two blocks from the BB King Museum. Like her mother, Ms. Campbell was a regular cook for the bluesman and his crew, turning out a playlist of reliable Southern standards like sweet potatoes, baked chicken and caramel cake.       </p><p>The restaurant walls are covered in the signatures of tourists from around the world who have come to learn about the blues. The family recently covered up the old garage bays, and are expanding the dining room to make room for the growing busloads of tourists.       </p><p>Her younger brother, Otha, who is essentially the ma\u00eetre d' at Betty's, said they like to disavow travelers' preconceived notions about racism in the South.       </p><p>\"Not only do Black travelers see Betty's as a safe place to stop for lunch,\" he told Ms. Medley for her book, \"white travelers see it as safe place, too.\"       </p><p>Small Southern towns remain informally segregated, but not at the gas stations that sell food - or the restaurants that sell gas.       </p><p>\"There's something about the accessibility and this coming together in a space the whole community shares almost out of necessity or at least convenience,\" Ms. Medley said. \"All are welcome every time, no matter what.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TikTok</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009280251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BC4-B8K1-JC85-N0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 19, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001325</classCode><className>PHOTOJOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000887</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001242</classCode><className>OIL &amp;

Cows whose hides are spotted with burns. A baby goat, just two weeks old, orphaned by the blaze.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are the scenes that emergency veterinarians and volunteers are finding as they traverse the wide-open fields of the Texas Panhandle, trying to save what animals they can and ease the suffering of many others. Their cases in recent days show the devastating effects that the state's largest-ever fire - still burning - has wrought on a region where a person's wealth can often be measured in herd size and acreage.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Lots of burns,\" said Dr. Laurie Shelton, a veterinarian who is part of Texas A&amp;M's Veterinary Emergency Team and among those who sprang into action after the Smokehouse Creek fire ignited last week. \"It's just tough. It's a rough deal.\"       </p><p>The Smokehouse Creek blaze is one of several major wildfires burning across the Texas Panhandle that were still difficult to contain over the weekend as dry, windy weather led to warnings of increased fire risk across the region.       </p><p>Much of the town of Sanford, population 132, was urged to evacuate Sunday evening when yet another new fire burned about 300 acres and threatened homes before being brought under control.       </p><p>For Dr. Shelton and the other veterinarians who have tended to the cattle and other farm animals struggling to survive the fast-moving flames, the days start early and end late. They wake up before sunrise on cots at a command center in Canadian, Texas, divide into teams, load up trucks, and begin seeing patients of all sizes, shapes and colors. In recent days, they tended to a burn on a stud horse's eye, treated a herd of 20 cattle, and found a donkey that was lost in the fire and had injuries so severe that it had to be put down.       </p><p>\"Fire doesn't discriminate between houses, barns or trailers,\" said Dr. Shelton, 47, a longtime horse veterinarian whose day job is now as a firefighter and emergency medical technician in Dripping Springs, outside of Austin. Despite the distressing caseload, she said, many injured animals had been saved from far worse: \"There is a herculean effort on the part of ranch owners to get their animals to safety.\"       </p><p>The Texas A&amp;M team first arrived last week with a narrow mission of aiding the search dogs that were sent with the university-sponsored search and rescue team to look for people injured or stranded by the fires. They bandaged the dogs' feet with special wraps that kept them from getting burned but would still allow them to feel the ground for balance. But the next day, state officials called and asked for any veterinarians still available to help treat the large numbers of struggling livestock across the region.       </p><p>Dr. Deb Zoran, who leads the team, grew up on a farm in Kansas and spent a large portion of her career focused on cat and dog nutrition. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she said, she and others at A&amp;M began considering how veterinarians could better prepare for large-scale disasters.       </p><p>Wearing dark black sunglasses against the Texas sun, Dr. Zoran moved swiftly on Sunday, consulting on injured cattle one moment and checking in on the search dog teams the next. During missions, she sleeps on a cot in her makeshift office, a trailer cluttered with gloves, radios, snacks and other supplies.       </p><p>Elsewhere on the grounds, beyond the shower trailers, veterinarians were using a quieter moment to bathe the search and rescue dogs and wipe adhesive off their feet that the protective wraps had left behind.       </p><p>Dr. Zoran's team, which for this fire has had roughly two dozen people deployed at any one time, has treated about 180 animals, mostly cattle, since the fire began last week. And ranchers and cowboys are still finding injured animals on their vast properties.       </p><p>State officials have estimated that thousands of livestock were killed by the fire, which began on Monday and has also killed two people. Some landowners have said a downed electric pole started the fire, though state officials have not made any conclusions.       </p><p>\"There's been so much devastation and the ranches are so big, there's no possible way for any group, anywhere to cover this entire territory,\" Dr. Zoran said.       </p><p>Unlike forest fires, when flames can envelop animals, the fire in Texas burned quickly across grassland, meaning many of the initial injuries were burns on the legs and bellies of cattle and horses, and sometimes on cows' udders. Some cattle were also injured running through fences as they sought to avoid the flames.       </p><p>Now, a week since the fire began, the veterinarians are seeing different kinds of wounds: respiratory problems from inhaling large amounts of smoke, and damaged hooves.       </p><p>\"There was the initial fire burn - horrible things - and then there's the short little window when, OK, they're alive, now what?\" Dr. Zoran said. \"And now we're starting that second phase.\"       </p><p>One major concern with hoofed animals like cattle and horses is the possibility that the part underneath their hoof gets so inflamed that the hoof comes off altogether, which can happen a week after the fire. That makes it impossible to stand and may lead to a decision to put the animal down.       </p><p>And respiratory issues can be fatal, particularly if animals are not given medicine to stave off infections.       </p><p>Some residents have taken it upon themselves to offer what treatment they can and to shelter dogs and cats who are lost or whose owners' homes were destroyed.       </p><p>Marni Prater, who lives outside of Fritch, Texas, has been selling T-shirts during the day to support victims of the fire and volunteering to treat animals for smoke inhalation and burns in the evenings. She has provided albuterol, an asthma medication, to horses, cats and 400-pound pigs, and recently treated a flock of sheep whose backs and feet were singed by flames.       </p><p>All of that came after she and her husband and their two sons, one age 4, one 5 months old, had to flee - taking several of their horses with them - when the flames rapidly approached the home they had just moved into two weeks ago.       </p><p>\"You could just see flames rolling down the road,\" she said. They thought they would have time to get all of the eight horses off the property but were forced to leave several behind. Luckily, they all survived.       </p><p>This weekend, Ms. Prater was dealing with an even fuller house than normal. There was a baby goat, Coco, whose mother was killed by the fire. There were several dogs. And outside, Ms. Prater was trying to help several horses breathe better, using a nebulizer connected to a mask large enough to fit over a horse's muzzle.       </p><p>As she walked toward the pasture where her horses graze, her 4-year-old son, Ryder, ran out after her with a stethoscope and bag of candy and helped guide the horses through a gate. Ms. Prater said her phone had been buzzing almost constantly with messages from people seeking help for their animals.       </p><p>\"It's exhausting,\" she said, still with a smile. \"I've never had to charge my phone as much as I have the last few days.\"       </p><p>Another volunteer, Loretta Tebeest, who founded a rescue shelter in Amarillo, drove into Fritch last week to help after a fire tore through the area. She fed dogs, cats, chickens and turkeys and found three dogs who were on the loose, keeping them safe until she could return them to their owners; one is still with them.       </p><p>\"We put our stuff to the side and jumped to help them, because they needed the help,\" Ms. Tebeest said. \"It hit closer to home. We felt like we had to help.\"       </p><p>Lucinda Holt contributed reporting.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lucinda Holt contributed reporting. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009340908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGR-VNH1-DYR7-C17Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 7, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFDI</classCode><className>HORSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

But, according to a new study, these events are also a source of increased violence against girls, women and people from the LGBTQIA+ community.</p><p>How can hurricanes or forest fires contribute to an increase in sexist and homophobic violence? According to researchers from the University of Cambridge, who conducted a study published in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health, the driving factors are linked to economic shock, social instability and other factors that contribute to stress in populations.</p><p>\"Extreme events don't themselves cause gender-based violence, but rather they exacerbate the drivers of violence or create environments that enable this type of behavior,\" said Kim van Daalen, of the University of Cambridge's Department of Public Health and Primary Care.\u00a0Extreme events can both increase new violence and increase reporting, unmasking existing violence, the study says.</p><p>The research is a meta-analysis that reviewed around 40 studies on several types of extreme events, such as storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires, as well as gender-based violence, such as sexual harassment, physical violence and forced marriage.</p><p>One of the concrete examples cited is Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to an increase in violence against women, particularly domestic violence. This climatic disaster also had homophobic repercussions. Blamed for the hurricane (which some called \"God's punishment\"), the gay community in New Orleans was discriminated against by being prevented from accessing aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Transgender people were threatened in shelters or prohibited access, and LGBTQI people experienced physical harm and violence in post-disaster shelters.\ufffd</p><p>The researchers also found that in Bangladesh, spikes in forced marriages coincided with heavy flooding between 1998 and 2004 in the South Asian country. Less expensive due to flood-related impoverishment lowering expectations, these marriages are also perceived as a way to reduce family costs, often to the detriment of young girls who are forced to marry a man, often well before they reach legal adulthood.\u00a0</p><p>\"Disaster management needs to focus on preventing, mitigating and adapting to drivers of gender-based violence. It's crucial that it's informed by the women, girls, and sexual and gender minority populations affected and takes into account local sexual and gender cultures and local norms, traditions and social attitudes,\" says Kim van Daalen.\u00a0</p><p>Examples of on-the-ground interventions cited by the researchers include providing restricted-access shelters and relief services to women and sexual and gender minorities, educating young girls about their rights, and implementing emergency response teams specifically trained in the prevention of gender-based violence.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65RW-BMW1-F19C-X42X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

But Ms. Cantrell, dogged by personal scandals as well as her city's considerable problems, is still facing skepticism, even among people who opposed recalling her.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Orleans's struggles are similar, on some level, to those facing other American cities where the coronavirus pandemic has given way to an unease over crime and quality-of-life issues.       </p><p>But in New Orleans, the recent turbulence has been compounded by an exhausting history of inefficient bureaucracies, deep-seated political corruption, entrenched poverty and a water system so decrepit that city officials regularly issue boil-water orders. Then there are larger existential factors, including an economy increasingly dependent on tourism and the threats posed by climate change to a city that is largely below sea level on an eroding coast.       </p><p>To some residents, the challenges seem too complex to blame on the mayor, or for them to feel anything but resignation about the city's future. P. Town Moe, a local rapper, celebrated the end of the recall effort last month by performing a song called \"The Recall Is Ovaaa\" live on Instagram - not because he supported Ms. Cantrell, he said, but because removing her would do little to change the course of things.       </p><p>\"It doesn't matter to me who's in office\u200b,\" he said. \"Because we always get the same outcome.\"       </p><p>Ms. Cantrell, the first Black woman to be elected mayor of the majority Black city, took charge of New Orleans in 2018 with a reputation for being brusque to those in power but solicitous toward average residents, particularly those who felt their neighborhoods had been neglected. Her popularity soared with her steely response to the pandemic after Mardi Gras in 2020 became an early superspreader event.       </p><p>But after easily winning re-election in 2021, Ms. Cantrell was besieged by new crises, most notably Hurricane Ida - after which trash pickup collapsed and has yet to fully recover - and a crime rate that continued rising through 2022. The number of murders last year, while falling far short of the peak in the early 1990s, was the highest since Hurricane Katrina. Fears over carjackings, in particular, grew as thieves roved the city.  Exasperation mounted with crater-pocked roads and error-ridden, runaway utility bills.       </p><p>Critics argued that Ms. Cantrell, a Democrat, had become distracted and defensive. They needled her for taking economic development trips to Switzerland, and to the French Riviera at a cost of $43,000 over four days. They criticized her for spending much of her time in a city-owned apartment in the French Quarter typically reserved for official business.       </p><p>\"Her attitude was the rules didn't apply to her,\" said Virginia Baldwin, a resident of the city's Uptown area, who voted for Ms. Cantrell in her first election but supported the recall effort.       </p><p>A local television station, WVUE, aired surveillance footage last fall showing Ms. Cantrell spending hours at a time in the apartment with a city police officer assigned to her security detail. The officer's wife had filed for divorce, claiming infidelity on his part with someone referred to as \"L.C.\" in court documents obtained by local journalists.       </p><p>The City Council voted unanimously last week to bar city employees from using any city-owned property as a residence.       </p><p>Ms. Cantrell, whose spokesman said her schedule was too busy to accommodate an interview for this article, pushed back, telling a reporter for The Times-Picayune in a text message, \"By the time I complete my tenure as mayor, I would have slept with half of the city of New Orleans based on false accusations that come my way sometimes daily.\" She added: \"If I were a MAN, you would NOT be texting me\" about the claim, which she dismissed with a crude term.       </p><p>The debate over Ms. Cantrell's performance has been knotted with questions of race and class. A review of a sample of recall petition signatures by The Times-Picayune found that white residents in more affluent neighborhoods were far more inclined to support the recall. Nearly 76 percent of the signers in the sample reviewed by the news outlet were white, and 15 percent were Black; overall, a little more than a third of the city's voters are white and a little more than half are Black.       </p><p>The findings prompted the recall's detractors to argue that those promoting it were more worried about property crimes in their relatively safe neighborhoods than the persistent bloodshed from gun violence in poorer, predominantly Black ones. There were also concerns that Ms. Cantrell was being judged more harshly because of her gender and particularly her race.       </p><p>Uncomfortable with the idea of ousting a mayor whose election had broken barriers, Nia Weeks opposed the recall effort, even though she was well versed in the city's problems.       </p><p>\"No one that I knew really agreed with the idea of her being recalled - they didn't like the optics or the way it felt,\" said Ms. Weeks, a co-founder of Detangled, a group focused on boosting Black civic participation. \"At the same time, people are disappointed in how things are doing in our city. So they are straddling this weird fence.\"       </p><p>Eileen Carter, who is Black and was a lead organizer of the recall, rejected the idea that it was driven by sexism or racism. She believed that Ms. Cantrell had become disengaged at a time when the city sorely needed a strong leader. \"It seemed like she didn't want to do her job,\" Ms. Carter said.       </p><p>The mayor is still occasionally viewed as a political outsider, having grown up in Los Angeles and moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana. She married into a prominent judicial family and led the Broadmoor Improvement Association, a nonprofit in her Uptown neighborhood, overseeing the neighborhood's redevelopment after Hurricane Katrina. She was elected to the City Council in 2012.       </p><p>Ms. Carter worked as Ms. Cantrell's social media director early in her tenure and witnessed her swift responses to resident requests for services, like repairing specific streetlights or filling potholes. \"She taught us that quality-of-life issues mattered,\" Ms. Carter recalled.       </p><p>But after Ms. Cantrell started her second term last year, as crime worsened and controversies engulfed her, her combative approach alienated many residents who had appreciated those qualities as she battled the pandemic.       </p><p>During Mardi Gras in February, when someone riding a float apparently flashed a middle finger at her while passing the City Hall viewing stand, Ms. Cantrell responded in kind.       </p><p>Last fall, when the City Council threatened to dock her pay because she had used city funds to pay for first-class and business-class upgrades on flights to Europe, she described the expenses as a \"matter of safety, not of luxury.\"       </p><p>\"Anyone who wants to question how I protect myself just doesn't understand the world Black women walk in,\" she said in a statement at the time. She ultimately agreed to pay back about $30,000 to the city.       </p><p>The recall effort began in August - led by Ms. Carter and Belden Batiste, a longtime Black activist whose own mayoral bid foundered in 2021 - with a handwritten, single-page petition to the Louisiana secretary of state. The reason they listed: \"Failure to put New Orleans first and execute the responsibilities of the position.\"       </p><p>But a few months in, the campaign gained steam as Rick Farrell, a conservative white businessman, poured more than $590,000 into it and strung banners in front of his Uptown mansion encouraging residents to sign on.       </p><p>In March, local election officials determined that the drive had fallen short - by roughly 18,000 of the nearly 45,000 signatures needed to put a recall question on the November ballot. Since then, Ms. Cantrell's office has posted near-daily videos of the mayor meeting with city departments and overseeing infrastructure repairs.       </p><p>\"No matter the barriers that are thrown in our way, we continue to deliver,\" Ms. Cantrell said at a news conference this month.       </p><p>She had good news to report: Homicides, carjackings and armed robberies were down in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period last year. More guns were being seized. More officers would soon be patrolling the streets.       </p><p>Even so, unnerving episodes persist. On Friday night at Mandina's Restaurant, a popular Creole Italian spot in the Mid-City neighborhood, a server was shot and killed and a tourist visiting for the city's popular jazz festival was wounded as other patrons ducked for cover.       </p><p>The police said the server, who was outside the restaurant, had been targeted by the assailants, and that the tourist, who was inside and struck by a bullet that penetrated a wall, had not.       </p><p>Ms. Baldwin said that as frustrated as she was with crime - her car was stolen in December - she did not fault Ms. Cantrell for it entirely.       </p><p>\"I blame her for not tending to the Police Department and seeing what they need, and I don't even know if that's fair,\" she said. \"I don't know what she can do.\"       </p><p>On a recent evening, regulars walked and biked over to the Friendly Bar, a corner hangout in the Marigny neighborhood, where William Leon was boiling crawfish, sausage, potatoes and corn for $20 a tray. \"It's like no other city,\" he said, though he added that his catering van and his other vehicle had both been broken into twice recently.       </p><p>Jodie Flowers, an artist, said the evening captured all that she loved about New Orleans: the easygoing vibe, the sense of community. Still, one of her roommates had his bicycle stolen multiple times - and that, she said, was partly why she signed the recall petition.       </p><p>But beyond her lack of confidence in Ms. Cantrell is a lack of confidence in the city's ability to flourish no matter who is in charge.       </p><p>\"It's time for someone new,\" Ms. Flowers said, before adding with barely a pause, \"but the next one isn't going to be able to do anything.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008845640</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:685G-KRF1-DYR7-C118-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 6, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

Ron DeSantis signed a law to discourage unauthorized immigrants from living and working in the state. The law, which he has described as the country's most aggressive crackdown, rejects out-of-state driver's licenses issued to undocumented immigrants, makes it a felony to transport such immigrants into Florida and punishes companies that hire them.       </p><p>\"There's a lot of work, but we can't risk being deported,\" said Maria, a Honduran immigrant in Louisiana who worked in Florida after Hurricane Ian last year but said she would forgo traveling there to help with storm cleanup from now on. \"We're staying put.\"       </p><p>Like other undocumented people interviewed for this article, she asked to be identified only by her first name out of concern for her family's safety.       </p><p>After the Florida Legislature passed the measure, but even before it took effect on July 1, Maria and other immigrants said they had been harassed by police officers and sheriff's deputies in the state. Now, they expressed fear that law enforcement would arrest them and turn them over to federal authorities for detention and deportation. The office of Mr. DeSantis did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about questions over law enforcement or on the impact of immigrants' decisions on hurricane recovery.       </p><p>Carlos, an undocumented worker who lives in Texas and drives with a license from Maryland, said he usually assembles a crew that clears debris in Florida after hurricanes and then does repairs, installing doors, windows and flooring.       </p><p>They worked nonstop for seven months in Fort Myers after Hurricane Ian, he said, as one satisfied client after another recommended his crew to friends. But when the Legislature passed the immigration law, he said, they left Florida as quickly as possible.       </p><p>Although Idalia flooded hundreds of homes and businesses from the Tampa Bay area through Florida's Big Bend region, \"we absolutely will not go\" help with recovery, Carlos said from Houston, where he has lived for 13 of his 20 years in the United States.       </p><p>\"Imagine being arrested and deported doing work that really helps people,\" he said, adding, \"We have families.''       </p><p>Though it is impossible to know for certain how many undocumented immigrants are staying away, more than half of 1,000 who were informally polled this summer by Resilience Force, a nonprofit group that organizes disaster recovery workers and offers them safety training, said they did not plan to return to Florida this hurricane season because of the law.       </p><p>\"Floridians will need thousands of skilled disaster recovery workers to rebuild their homes after Idalia, but they may not get them,\" said Saket Soni, executive director of Resilience Force.       </p><p>\"These workers are overwhelmingly immigrants,\" he said.       </p><p>Hurricane Idalia came ashore last Wednesday on Florida's Gulf Coast, packing winds of 125 miles per hour that ripped roofs off houses, downed power lines and toppled trees. Surging storm water and torrential rain flooded low-lying places like Crystal River, about 80 miles north of Tampa.       </p><p>The sheer amount of water overwhelmed the city's sewer system. The pressure was such that, in the Burnett home, water shot out of a toilet like a geyser, puncturing the ceiling and flooding every room. Mr. Burnett, 43, and the family dog, Layla, were trapped inside, the putrid water six-feet high by the time firefighters with an airboat rescued them.       </p><p>When Kelly Burnett, 37, returned to the house with her children, 3 and 7, the family's belongings had been reduced to a \"sopping wet mess of crap,\" she recalled.       </p><p>\"It was overwhelming,\" she said. \"We were literally at a loss.\"       </p><p>Mr. Burnett has eczema that is exacerbated by prolonged exposure to bacteria. The couples' elderly parents could not help.       </p><p>During a visit to Home Depot to buy supplies, he spotted some Latino men holding up a sign that read, \"Demolition, restoration and hauling.\"       </p><p>Mr. Burnett enlisted their help, and before he was even back home, the men had pulled up at his turquoise house. The workers picked through heaps of toys, clothes and other items, as well as through soggy, crumbling boxes for four days, making a total of $500 per day.       </p><p>\"If they found something in the pile that they thought was sentimental, they brought it to us,\" said Ms. Burnett - like a photograph of her as a little girl.       </p><p>Mr. Burnett, who gave the men an extra $500 on their last day working for him, said, \"If these people are willing to do this, making a little bit of money helping people they don't know, they should have the world.\"       </p><p>The leader of the group, a man from Honduras named Rogelio who has worked on storm cleanup since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said they had decided to risk travel to Florida, \"trusting in God to protect us.\"        </p><p>\"There are many homeowners asking for help,\" he said, \"but the workers just aren't here.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009072660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695D-SPM1-JC85-N3T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 14, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001946</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION, CITIZENSHIP &amp;

No matter how this mess is resolved - and many there seem to be coping - the common belief that civilization is but a veneer that will fall apart when authority disappears is not only false; the false belief itself is harmful.       </p><p>Rutger Bregman, who wrote a book called \"Humankind: A Hopeful History,\" read \"Lord of the Flies\" as a teenager like many and didn't doubt its terrible implication about human nature. However, Bregman got curious about whether there were any real-life cases of boys of that age getting stranded on an island.       </p><p>Bregman learned of one that played out very differently,       </p><p>In 1965, six boys from 13 to 16, bored in their school in Tonga, in Polynesia, impulsively stole a boat and sailed out but became helplessly adrift after their sail and rudder broke. They were stranded on an island for more than a year. Instead of descending into cruel anarchy, though, they stayed alive through cooperation. When one of them broke his leg, the others took care of him.       </p><p>Some of the most memorable weeks of my life were spent helping out with rescues and aid in the aftermath of the 1999 earthquake in Turkey that killed thousands of people. The epicenter was my childhood hometown, so I was very familiar with the place, and I rushed to help, unsure of what I would find. Instead of the chaos and looting that was rumored, the people had been mostly sharing everything with one another. Intrigued, I dived into the sociology of disasters and found that this was the common trajectory after similar misfortune.       </p><p>Rebecca Solnit's book \"A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster\" documents many such experiences - people altruistically cooperating in the aftermath of earthquakes, hurricanes and other catastrophes - and how the authorities often assume the opposite and go in to restore law and order but end up doing real harm.       </p><p>One of the most egregious recent examples of this involved rumors of conditions after Hurricane Katrina in the Superdome in New Orleans - where tens of thousands of people unable to evacuate earlier had gathered. The police chief told Oprah Winfrey that babies were being raped. The mayor said, \"They have people standing out there, have been in that frickin' Superdome for five days watching dead bodies, watching hooligans killing people, raping people.\" There were reports that rescue helicopters were being shot at.       </p><p>The reality was that even as the situation deteriorated in the Superdome, as Rebecca Solnit's book documents, many people kept one another alive, especially taking care of the elderly and the frail under very stressful conditions.        </p><p>But the demonization of the overwhelmingly Black population of New Orleans fueled true ugliness: Some aid was delayed and resources diverted to prevent \"looting,\" and refugees from the city trying to escape on foot were shot at by residents in the mostly white suburbs.       </p><p>What about the terrible side of humanity - the wars, the genocides? And what about survival of the fittest?       </p><p>In his book \"Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society,\" Nicholas Christakis, a sociologist as well as a physician, explains that people are cooperative and social animals, not lone wolves. Humans have survived not because they were the animals with the sharpest claws and strongest muscles but because they had smarts and they had one another.       </p><p>Christakis looked at shipwrecks from 1500 to 1900 and found that survivors often managed by cooperation and that violence and ugliness were far from the norm.       </p><p>This is not a rosy-eyed view that ignores the terrible aspects of human behavior. Groups can also be organized politically and socially against one another. That's the basis of wars and genocides. But far from being elements of true human nature that are revealed once the thin veneer of civilization is worn off, such atrocities are organized through the institutions of civilization: through politics and culture and militaries and sustained political campaigns of dehumanization.       </p><p>The institutions of civilization can also be enlisted to resist this dehumanization. The European Union may not be perfect, but it has helped to largely suppress the sorts of conflicts that racked the continent for centuries.       </p><p>I would venture that many of the thousands trapped in the Nevada mud are mostly banding together, sharing shelter, food and water.       </p><p>If tech luminaries and rich folks are among those suffering in the mire, instead of gloating about their travail, let's hope this experience reinforces for them the importance of pulling together as a society.       </p><p>We can help them along by passing laws that make tax havens illegal, create a more equitable tax structure and a strong international framework for stopping the laundering of gains of corruption, force technology and other companies to deal with the harms of their inventions and overcome the current situation where profits are private but the fallout can be societal.       </p><p>Human nature isn't an obstacle to a good society, but it needs help from laws and institutions, not thick mud, to let the better angels have a chance.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

She sees her profession as a field \"that has the skill set to take ecology, to take culture, to take people and tap into something bigger.\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her conviction that shaping land can illuminate, rather than merely beautify, places and their stories lies at the heart of Studio Zewde, the landscape and urban design firm she founded in Harlem in 2018. Since then she has taught at Harvard University and is writing a book about her profession's founding father, Frederick Law Olmsted, linking his vision of urban parks as critical to the future of democracy with his earlier travels through the antebellum South as a journalist and abolitionist.       </p><p>\"It doesn't matter what project we're doing, if it's a parking lot or a museum landscape - there's an opportunity to mobilize and provoke,\" said Zewde (pronounced ZO-dee), who at 37 is one of a very small number of Black women in the field and is paving the way for others.       </p><p>Zewde doesn't arrive with a singular aesthetic, and that isn't always a good fit for those impatient to know what a project will look like. \"We often don't work well with those clients,\" she said wryly in a video interview from Brazil. But her layered process was the selling point for the leadership at Dia Beacon. Situated in the sprawling former Nabisco box printing factory on 32 acres in the Hudson Valley, adjacent to the river and part of its historic flood plain, the museum houses the Dia Art Foundation's collection of monumental works by conceptual, minimalist and land artists.       </p><p>\"We were really looking to optimize an outdoor experience as well as the indoor one, but we weren't quite sure what this could be,\" said Jessica Morgan, Dia's director. Since opening in 2003, the museum has suffered with a vast, soggy landscape to the south of the building that has been inaccessible and uninviting to the public - a source of particular frustration to Morgan, especially when the galleries were closed early in the pandemic.       </p><p>Zewde and her team took a deep dive into Dia's archives and the history of the site and region, holding discussions with museum staff at every level, with community and Indigenous organizations around Beacon and with the artist Robert Irwin before his death last October. Irwin designed the original landscape framing the arrival to the museum. Studio Zewde's plan for the other side of the building acknowledges the past - and prepares for the future.       </p><p>Currently, Dia Beacon's backyard is a huge, flat lawn flanked by two north-south running grass berms - one, the site of former train tracks that connected the Nabisco factory with the High Line in Manhattan (parallel to the active Metro-North Railroad tracks between Dia and the river), the other a swale.       </p><p>\"The topography of the site is this kind of bathtub, a function of its chapter as a brickyard and then the Nabisco building,\" Zewde said. Her design scheme introduces several rising curvilinear earthworks angled across the lawn that gesture to Dia Beacon's preindustrial and Indigenous history: The property, at one of the narrowest points of the Hudson River, was once an important crossing point for the Lenape people.       </p><p>\"This series of sculptural landforms east to west is a way to talk about that movement across the river historically, but also to serve as basins that protect against storm events with the Hudson River backflow,\" Zewde said. She worked with Sherwood Design Engineers to pipe water away from the building and retain it in these basins during sea level rise. (Dia's basement took on a small amount of water during Hurricane Sandy, but no artworks were damaged.)       </p><p>She also collaborated with Larry Weaner Landscape Associates to craft meadowlands and wetlands with a seasonal palette of colors and textures, intermixed with the rolling topography that will include pathways leading visitors through the varied terrain. A woodland mixing more than 130 new evergreen and deciduous trees will \"hold the space and create a snow globe effect as you look out into the landscape,\" Zewde said.       </p><p>Morgan hopes the new design encourages visitors to spend hours in the landscape - walking, sitting and picnicking. \"It will be a huge shift for us in terms of what that experience of coming to Beacon will be,\" she said. Morgan is leading a $50 million capital campaign marking the Dia foundation's 50th anniversary this year, with 80 percent of it earmarked for endowment and a portion of the remaining $10 million to fund the landscape project.       </p><p>\"Landscaping around museums tends to be a somewhat limited affair,\" she added. \"This will actually be something that you could come to experience in and of itself.\"       </p><p>Studio Zewde's organic attitude toward the land is a striking pivot from the work of land art by Irwin to the north, commissioned for the opening of Dia Beacon. Working with its founding director, Michael Govan, Irwin, the acclaimed light and space artist, landscaped the parking lot with Hawthorn trees and grasses, rhythmically dividing each bay and framing the entrance. A path to the right provides a beautiful vista through towering hedges of manicured boxwood trees.       </p><p>Zewde consulted with Irwin to determine the placement of a new path leading from the parking lot along the western edge of the museum to the southern landscape. There, new Hawthorn trees and a mosaic of grass species planted in a \"connector\" meadow will salute the Irwin landscape.       </p><p>Dia's board chair, Nathalie de Gunzburg, likes that people enter Dia Beacon through the imposed geometry of Irwin's precise artwork and will be able to move more fluidly through the meadows and berms to the south. \"It's very complementary,\" she said. \"Those two landscapes are not in competition.\"       </p><p>But for Zewde, the dialogue with Irwin's landscape, considered an artwork in Dia's collection, is inherently one of critique, probing the museum's legacy of stewarding works of land art largely by white men, including Robert Smithson's \"Spiral Jetty\" in Utah and Walter De Maria's \"Lightning Field\" in New Mexico. She challenged the idea that there could be an \"author\" to the land; in her conversations with Lenape representatives, they told her that \"in the Indigenous tradition, we name people after landscapes, we don't name landscapes after people,\" said Zewde, who does not consider her design an \"artwork.\" \"We're all just passing through.\"       </p><p>Gary Hilderbrand, the chair of landscape architecture at Harvard's graduate school of design, views Dia's choice of Zewde for the project as a conscious shift. \"It is a reflection that their values as an institution simply must be updated around sustainability in every dimension and the urgency of environmental crises,\" he said, \"putting that on par if not exceeding\" a singular artist's imprint on the land.       </p><p>Zewde, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Ethiopia, was born in Houston and grew up in Louisiana. In 2005, she watched Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast from her dorm room TV at Boston University. It clarified her future professional trajectory.       </p><p>\"A lot of well-meaning architects were talking about New Orleans post-Katrina, but I could see the gap in what they were bringing to the table,\" she said, compared with what Black people said was important to them. Zewde studied sociology and statistics as an undergraduate, and went on to get her first master's degree in city planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.       </p><p>While pursuing her second master's degree at Harvard, she wrote her thesis on Valongo Wharf in Rio de Janeiro, the landing spot and marketplace for approximately 900,000 enslaved Africans. Zewde's historical analysis of the importance of the site helped it gain a UNESCO World Heritage designation in 2017. She continues to work with that city, and last month convened community members from the area around the wharf, known as Pequena \u00c1frica (or Little Africa), to collectively envision an urban plan commemorating the neighborhood's history and daily life. The civic desire for shade and vegetation was part of every proposal.       </p><p>\"I'll be working on it for the rest of my life,\" she said about Pequena \u00c1frica.       </p><p>As a student, she struggled to see herself in the field of landscape architecture. Black people make up 13.6 percent of the U.S. population, but only 0.8 percent of licensed landscape architects in the country, with Black women composing 0.3 percent.       </p><p>\"There was not a single Black person referenced in a syllabus\" when she was at Harvard, she said - including her former boss and mentor, Walter Hood, who was recognized with a MacArthur award in 2019 and whose celebrated work includes the landscape for the new International African American Museum, at a former slave port in Charleston, S.C.</p><p>\"We're talking about land in America - Black people don't exist in that history?\" she said incredulously.        </p><p>Today, Studio Zewde employs 15 people working on a variety of projects, including Graffiti Pier in Philadelphia and parks in Tulsa and Pittsburgh. Dia Beacon may bring a new level of visibility to Zewde's practice.       </p><p>\"I've had a lot of very respected people in my profession along the way tell me that I'm too much of an activist to be taken seriously as a skilled designer,\" she said. \"I hope that projects like Dia Beacon demonstrate the two aren't mutually exclusive.\"       </p><p>Earth moving and planting is to begin this summer and the new landscape will be open to the public, free of charge. At Dia Chelsea, on March 27, Zewde will join the architect Frida Escobedo, who is designing the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new modern and contemporary wing, for a conversation on projects transforming art institutions.       </p><p>To Maria Nicanor, the director of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, Zewde's Dia Beacon project takes a \"holistic approach, looking at people, looking at an institutional legacy, looking at climate change, all of those things together,\" Nicanor said. \"Sara's trying to demystify this idea that landscape architecture is planting pretty flowers.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009332390</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BH5-SYR1-DYR7-C35M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 9, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;

No, thanks! When it comes to vacations, fans of so-called dark tourism would rather head to places that have witnessed some of history's darkest hours, or check out natural disaster zones, treading a fine line between voyeurism and remembrance.</p><p>If you've got a taste for the macabre, the disturbing and the darkest corners of history, then dark tourism could be just the ticket. This travel trend was spotted by two American researchers, Malcolm Foley and John Lennon, in the '90s. In their book \"Dark Tourism: The Attraction of Death and Disaster,\" the authors defined the concept as travelling to sites associated with death and suffering. Nothing very cheerful, in short.</p><p>But dark tourism now has something of a following. So much so that it now has its own set of top must-see destinations. Leading the way are sites of nuclear disasters. These include Fukushima in Japan, of course, but also the lesser-known Pripyat in Ukraine -- a ghost town next to Chernobyl -- or Semey (formerly Semipalatinsk) in Kazakhstan, a former site for Soviet nuclear testing. Note, however, that tourists venturing into these areas potentially put their health at risk, as, for their part at least, the effects of radioactivity are still bound by the borders between pleasure tourism and dark tourism. Other travelers have a passion for visiting prisons, such as Alcatraz off the coast of San Francisco or the Tuol Sleng prison in Cambodia, where the detainees of the Khmer Rouge police were imprisoned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From genocide to drug lords</emphasis></p><p>While some have no qualms about visiting disaster zones like New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- just for fun -- others are tempted by tours of questionable taste. In Medell\u00edn, Colombia, for example, tourists can visit the city \"in the footsteps of Pablo Escobar.\" In Rwanda, unscrupulous tourism companies offer tours taking in the great apes as well as the Tutsi genocide. Finally, some people are ready to pay good money for a chance to stumble across a corpse in the Aokigahara forest, better known in Japan as the \"suicide forest.\"</p><p>So while curiosity and remembrance are an integral part of tourism, travelers can decide for themselves just how dark they're prepared to go...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:631S-NBN1-F19C-X3TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>TOURISM</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 30, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Uncollected waste after natural disasters can lead to illnesses, experts said.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Below the shattered windows of the high-rise hotels in downtown Acapulco, people walk alongside towering hills of garbage bags filled with rotting food and debris, from mattresses to Christmas decorations. Volunteer firefighters from distant states clear the waste, wiping away swarms of cockroaches from their arms.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Miles from the coastal beachside resorts, Elizabeth Del Valle, 43, listened as her teenage daughter Constanza Sotelo described the \"mountains of trash\" still blocking many streets surrounding their home.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have no way to find face masks to keep ourselves healthy,\" said Ms. Del Valle. \"We expect that we're going to get an infection from the smell, from the garbage.\"       </p><p>Weeks after Hurricane Otis shocked forecasters and government officials by intensifying rapidly into the strongest storm to hit Mexico's Pacific Coast and devastate much of Acapulco, residents say they now face an unfolding public health disaster.       </p><p>Many locals, public health officials and emergency responders say they believe that the uncollected garbage is linked to stomach infections, diarrhea and skin rashes and other ailments that people have complained about since the storm.       </p><p>Local business groups this past week called on federal and state officials to declare a sanitary emergency citing \"the accumulation of garbage, construction material, lack of potable water and the presence of insects and harmful fauna,\" including human remains.       </p><p>As thousands of troops descended on Acapulco after Otis made landfall, authorities first prioritized clearing debris and restoring power to the tourist resort areas, according to city officials, local business leaders and residents. Some hotels in that area have since reopened.       </p><p>But people who live outside the city's beachfront tourist neighborhoods say they must navigate so many piles of trash and debris that in some places it is hard to reach hospitals and health centers.       </p><p>Even as the authorities respond to Acapulco's many needs - providing water to residents, restoring power and finding missing people - federal and local officials are sounding alarms over the hurricane's longer-term health consequences and say that clearing trash needs to be priority.       </p><p>The city's mayor estimates that 666,000 tons of garbage are piled across Acapulco. Under normal conditions, local officials said, 700 to 800 tons of waste are picked up every day.       </p><p>Mexico's president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has promised a quick recovery, saying that families in Acapulco will be \"content by Christmas.\"       </p><p>The mayor, Abelina L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, believes the timeline will be far longer. \"To say that in one month or five months we will rebuild Acapulco would be a lie,\" she said.       </p><p>The president's support is vital, Ms. L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez said, \"because garbage does not forgive.\" The situation could soon become \"a health crisis,\" she added.       </p><p>Since Otis ravaged Acapulco - killing at least 50 people and leaving 30 missing - health brigades made up of federal workers have cleaned and disinfected a little more than one-third of the city's 507 neighborhoods, disposing of hundreds of pounds of rotting food, Mexican officials said.       </p><p>Natural disasters can often result in an outbreak of infectious diseases, public health experts said. Piles of garbage left outside can attract mosquitoes and rats, which can then spread infectious diseases. A lack of power can also lead to contaminated food, raising the risk of stomach infections and illnesses.       </p><p>After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported skin lesions, diarrhea and pneumonia among evacuees.       </p><p>Health problems linked to uncollected trash are \"more common than we anticipate,\" said Amber Mehmood, an associate professor of public health at the University of South Florida who focuses on global health and disaster management. Debris and waste, she said, can become a \"breeding ground for mosquitoes that can carry malaria and Zika virus.\"       </p><p>\"There are plenty of reasons to be worried,\" Ms. Mehmood added.       </p><p>Leslye Soli\u0301s Mireles, 31, a firefighter and paramedic leading a team of more than 50 firefighters from another Mexican state, said her crew in Acapulco had helped treat people with various illnesses that she believes stem from the accumulating garbage.       </p><p>\"It is literally a source of infection,\" she said, adding that she and many of her own firefighters were now suffering stomach infections and skin rashes.       </p><p>Ms. L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez said her government would have to expand the city's landfill and find more equipment to get rid of the enormous amount of garbage. Acapulco needs 500 trucks to clear the debris; as of now the city has roughly 150 available, she said.       </p><p>So far, more than 211,000 tons of garbage has been collected, according to the Guerrero state government.       </p><p>Otis also destroyed 12,500 utility poles in the city, the mayor said, though the electricity commission said on Friday that 89 percent of users in Acapulco have had power restored. But thousands who had their homes severely damaged still lacked electricity, most of them in poor or outer rural neighborhoods, city officials said.       </p><p>Ms. L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez is pleading for patience among her frustrated constituents. By the end of the year, she is focused \"on having at least our streets clean, our houses clean, to having the water and electricity systems up and running.\"       </p><p>\"I appeal to understanding, because a natural phenomenon of such magnitude exceeds any effort that is quick,\" Ms. L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez added. \"I don't want to say that it can't be done, but it can't be done from one day to the next.\"       </p><p>W. Craig Fugate, an administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Barack Obama, said that clearing debris from the streets was also vital to allow access to vehicles carrying supplies.       </p><p>Beyond the health threat, Acapulco also needs to ensure that it is ready to welcome tourists, he said. \"The last thing I want if I'm able to get anything open,\" Mr. Fugate said, \"is the smell of rotten garbage in my street. It's a nuisance, potentially a public health risk, but it's also an eyesore.\"       </p><p>But some residents in rural areas of Acapulco say they have waited long enough.       </p><p>On a recent afternoon, Maricruz Balboa rushed down from her hillside neighborhood when she heard that businessmen from another state were giving away supplies from a box truck parked on the side of the street. A crowd of desperate residents reached for soap, hand sanitizer, food and sneakers.       </p><p>\"We've had almost no help here so far,\" said Ms. Balboa, 48, showing the treasured items she had been given: a couple of water bottles, fruit, vegetables, shampoo and sanitary pads.       </p><p>Ms. Del Valle made sure to get hand sanitizer from the same truck when it parked near her neighborhood. She said it was the first time someone had come to deliver food and supplies to her community.       </p><p>\"The government is giving as much as it can,\" she said. \"But it's not enough.\"       </p><p>There are some signs of a comeback. Various businesses - al pastor restaurants, barber shops and fruit stands - have reopened.       </p><p>Residents have on their own cleaned debris outside their homes. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, children played with a kite in one area of a grassy field otherwise filled with trash.       </p><p>\"Whether you are a government official or not, whether you have money or not, there is support,\" Octaviano Roque Ruiz, 75, a retired teacher, said as he walked out of a tent where government officials were handing out stipends to older people to help them recover from the storm.       </p><p>Already diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes before the storm, Mr. Ruiz said he now had intestinal pain and what appeared to be conjunctivitis. He had tried to go to the hospital recently but was told that it was beyond capacity and to return another day.       </p><p>Other residents said conditions in Acapulco had made it impossible to live there for now.       </p><p>Nicol\u00e1s Linares, 59, left Acapulco briefly after Otis made landfall to join his brother in Zihuatanejo, a coastal resort about 150 miles north, but returned this month after hearing rumors that services had been restored.       </p><p>\"And I arrive and it's not true,\" he said, adding that the room he rents in the city had no electricity or water.       </p><p>Mr. Linares tried to return to Zihuatanejo on a recent afternoon, but no more tickets were available at the bus station. He said he would return the next day.       </p><p>\"Now I have to go back to my neighborhood,\" he said. \"I have no other choice.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009185400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RD-S3H1-JC85-N00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 28, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Public Health &amp;

A couple of days later, at Axios, the climate reporter Andrew Freedman echoed that warning: \"America is staring down a summer of disasters.\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The season is now only half over, and the worst months for California fires, which typically provide the most harrowing images of the summer, still lie ahead. But the calendar has already been stuffed with climate disruption, so much so that one disaster often seemed layered over the last, with newspaper front pages almost identical across the Northern Hemisphere. In July, Carbon Brief's Simon Evans began compiling them on Twitter, running out of steam when he got past 100. Climate segments of newscasts cut quickly from one part of the world to another, telling almost identical stories, day after day.       </p><p>And yet the mood of those newscasts - in which warming is shown clearly to be blanketing the world, country by country - has mixed horror with a reluctant acceptance. Climate change is here, you think, your mind perhaps drifting past what can be done to limit future warming and toward what can be done to manage living in that future. The disruptions are large already, and arriving as prophesied - indeed, often earlier than predicted. They've also been normalized enough that, alongside the shock, they raise practical questions.       </p><p>The term for this is \"adaptation,\" and the wallpaper texture of the climate news cycle this summer - with once-horrifying impacts now seeming commonplace - suggests that efforts to acclimate to new realities are following quite quickly on the footsteps of alarm.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Each summer now </emphasis>is also a prelude. This year on Planet Earth, more than 100 million Americans were under extreme heat advisories that seemed almost unexceptional given the punishing temperatures across Europe, where multiple distinct heat waves have each set records, and in China, where residents found protective shade in underground fallout shelters and demand for air-conditioning threatened the electricity grid nationwide.       </p><p>One year after temperatures so extreme that climate scientists worried about the calibrations of their models, a heat dome settled over the Pacific Northwest again, with Seattle recording six straight days above 90 degrees for the first time and Portland, Oregon, experiencing seven above 95, also for the first time.       </p><p>This year's most conspicuous heat episode began in the late spring, when more than a billion people in South Asia endured several months of almost uninterrupted temperatures above 100 degrees. Then came the monsoon rains, and the floods with them, affecting, as Inside Climate News tabulated, \"more than 7.2 million people in Bangladesh, submerged over 2,000 villages in India and caused more than 300 deaths in Pakistan.\" In a single province of Pakistan, Balochistan, 9,000 homes were washed away. The survivors navigated the floodwaters by rope.       </p><p>There has been lethal flooding in Uganda. In Iran, floods and landslides have left dozens dead and dozens more missing. In Spain and Portugal, where fires tore through the peninsula in July, the recent heat killed nearly 2,000 people. In Britain, where off-the-charts temperatures shattered records kept nearly as far back as William Shakespeare's time, perhaps 1,000 people died, and so many fires broke out in London that firefighters had their busiest day since World War II.       </p><p>Britain also offered two of the most memorable media moments of the summer. In the first, a buoyant television presenter pushed a meteorologist to look on the bright side of the deadly heat. In the second, real weather seemed to match a worst-case climate scenario for 2050 put together just a couple of years before. But what was perhaps most remarkable about the contrast of those forecasts - the warning, set for 2050, and the real one, this year - was that the same thing had happened a few weeks earlier in France, when a separate heat wave matched forecasts climate scientists had mocked up just a few years before, as a sort of worst-case future for France in 2050. This year, in the midst of an energy crisis, France was forced to power down nuclear power plants, a carbon-free energy source, because the local rivers got too warm to use to cool the reactors. Water was poured on the pavement just ahead of bikers in the Tour de France to ensure the asphalt didn't melt. The bikers themselves soldiered on.       </p><p>In the United States, the most memorable images of weather disaster so far this summer have probably come from heartland flooding events. In the Midwest, where extreme precipitation events have grown by 42 percent, some neighborhoods were flooded last week by seven feet of water and firefighters had to rescue children from their homes. In St. Louis, which got two months' worth of rain in the space of six hours, families swam to safety out their front doors. The same weather system delivered another deluge, considerably more deadly, to eastern Kentucky. Both were considered once-in-a-thousand-year events; overnight into Wednesday, another thousand-year storm hit Illinois.       </p><p>The death toll in Kentucky was officially 37 as of Tuesday, though state officials expect the total will grow. The youngest identified victim was just two. With officials still boating through floodwaters trawling for victims, the region now faces a wave of extreme heat and the possibility of power outages.       </p><p>\"I wish I could tell you why we keep getting hit here in Kentucky,\" Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said. \"I wish I could tell you why areas where people may not have much continue to get hit and lose everything,\" he went on. \"I can't give you the why, but I know what we do in response to it. And the answer is everything we can.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It used to be,</emphasis> when the scariest climate impacts were more common in models than on television screens, that climate advocates sometimes found themselves wondering what scale of disaster might shake the world from its basic complacency.       </p><p>Then, when large disasters did strike - Hurricane Katrina, for instance, or Hurricane Sandy, or the Camp Fire - without much altering the shape of public concern, they sometimes wondered if it would take a string of disasters.       </p><p>The intervals between such events are now shorter than ever. The world is finally moving to decarbonize, but haltingly, and too slowly to offer real protection from warming. \"Some 35 million homes, almost one-third of the nation's housing stock, are at high risk for disasters,\" The Times recently reported. And of course climate vulnerability is greatest in the poorest parts of the world, where residents are least responsible for the perturbation of the climate and least equipped to protect themselves from the ravages of warming.       </p><p>\"Done right, adaptation efforts can soften the blow to billions of lives,\" E. Lisa F. Schipper, an environmental social science research fellow at Oxford, wrote recently. \"Done wrong, they can lead to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">maladaptation</emphasis>, wasting time and money while leaving people just as vulnerable as before, or even more so.\" She cites a handful of cautionary tales: a sea wall in Kiribati that merely redirected erosion, for instance, and levees in Bangladesh that perversely encouraged more development in vulnerable areas and led ultimately to more death along the Jamuna River floodplain.       </p><p>Over the very long term, the story of adaptation to natural disasters is an optimistic, even heroic one - a fraction as many people today die from such events as did a century or two ago. Most of that history did not include meaningful climate change, however, and those trends have been much flatter over recent decades, as the impacts of warming have come into play. We have only in the last decade passed beyond the range of temperatures that encloses all of human history and begun a new kind of experiment, testing our global capacity not just to lessen the impacts of perennial disasters but of disruptions of a much larger scale.       </p><p>Even as policymakers have made great progress with some interventions and early warning systems, mistakes and miscalculations are not at all unusual. The $14 billion levees built in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, for instance, were not even designed to withstand a Category 5 storm, and may not offer \"adequate\" protection as soon as next year. Last October, the journal Nature published an article assessing global adaptation efforts. Its top-line finding? \"Documented adaptations were largely fragmented, local and incremental, with limited evidence of transformational adaptation and negligible evidence of risk reduction outcomes.\"       </p><p>In moving as slowly on decarbonization as we are, globally, the bet we are making is that adaptation can catch up - and keep up, as the risks mount. We may tell ourselves that adaptation is what we will do to fill in the gap between the pace of transition that is necessary and the pace that is possible. But adaptation, though critical, is not a cure-all - at least as we're doing it so far.       </p><p>David Wallace-Wells (@dwallacewells), a writer for Opinion and a columnist for The New York Times Magazine, is the author of \"The Uninhabitable Earth.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008473079</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:663X-G791-JC85-N25D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 9, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

The industry loss estimates\u00a0also reflect an adjustment to account for increased\u00a0material and\u00a0other repair costs in the current construction market.\u00a0Hurricane precipitation-induced flood losses are not included in AIR estimates at this time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ida\u00a0traveled over very warm Gulf waters, including a thick layer of warm water in the Loop Current,\u00a0and intensified to\u00a0make two landfalls\u00a0in Louisiana, both at Category 4 strength, on August 29.\u00a0The storm's\u00a0first landfall\u00a0was\u00a0near Port Fourchon about 60 miles south of New Orleans, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 150 mph;\u00a0its second landfall\u00a0was southwest of Galliano, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 145 mph. Around the time of landfall, the storm was undergoing an eyewall replacement. In practical terms, New Orleans experienced strong winds on\u00a0the order of 90\u00a0to\u00a0100 mph\u00a0due to the large\u00a0windfield\u00a0and a slow decay of the storm.</p><p>The storm surge\u00a0Ida produced\u00a0was along expected lines and\u00a0generally\u00a0not as severe as Hurricane Katrina's-particularly in Mississippi and New Orleans (the latter of which was\u00a0fully\u00a0protected by the city's levee system)-but some areas of southeastern Louisiana with insufficient protection experienced\u00a0severe\u00a0storm surge during Ida.\u00a0</p><p>According to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hurricane-ida-causes-historic-us-crude-supply-chain-disruption/\">analysis by Wood Mackenzie</url>, a sister company in the Verisk family, Hurricane Ida has had a significant impact on Louisiana refinery operations and Gulf of Mexico production, causing a historic U.S. crude supply chain disruption. Utility disruptions caused by lack of power, mobile data services, and water,\u00a0could\u00a0lead to Ida becoming\u00a0a long-tailed event when it comes to claims reporting, payouts,\u00a0etc.\u00a0</p><p>While New Orleans' levees\u00a0held, the\u00a0city was not spared Ida's wind impacts.\u00a0Damage was variable given the nature of building inventory in the metro New Orleans area. Areas close to where Ida made landfall such as\u00a0LaFourche\u00a0Parish, where Port Fourchon is located, was particularly hard\u00a0hit\u00a0with widespread destruction.\u00a0Grand Isle Parish, a barrier island, has been declared uninhabitable.\u00a0Even in towns\u00a0just inland\u00a0from where Ida came ashore, such as Galliano and Houma,\u00a0wind damage was severe to catastrophic.\u00a0</p><p>In terms of storm surge, most levees held up well, with a few localized failures that have created flooding beyond that from storm surge.\u00a0Communities to the north,\u00a0west, south, and east\u00a0of the hurricane protection system that surrounds\u00a0New Orleans were inundated.\u00a0Ida's storm surge inundated far into the bayous and inhabited areas of\u00a0southeastern\u00a0Louisiana, as well as areas near Lake Pontchartrain.\u00a0Minor near-coastal inundation\u00a0also\u00a0occurred in Mississippi\u00a0and Alabama.\u00a0Key areas flooded by storm surge in Louisiana include\u00a0Port Fourchon, Grand Isle, Delacroix, Alliance, Lafitte, Jean Lafitte, Barataria, Laplace, Mandeville, Braithwaite, Shell Beach, Galliano, Golden Meadow,\u00a0and\u00a0Venetian Isles.\u00a0Surge inundation depth exceeded\u00a010 feet in some places, but\u00a0several tide gauges near maximum storm surge broke,\u00a0leading to uncertainty in Ida's maximum storm surge water level.\u00a0Louisiana has a statewide adoption of the Louisiana State Uniform Construction Code. These codes were adopted and have been effective since early 2018. According to these standards, buildings are required to be designed\u00a0to a prescribed wind speed that varies\u00a0spatially with higher design wind speeds along the coast and the values decreasing as we move inland.\u00a0For Port Fourchon and Grand Isle, the design 3-second\u00a0gust wind\u00a0speeds for typical residential and commercial structures\u00a0is\u00a0between 160 and 170 mph. For towns such as Golden Meadow, Galliano, Dulac,\u00a0and the southern portions of Houma, design requirements are between 150\u00a0and\u00a0160 mph\u00a0on 3-second\u00a0gust basis. New Orleans, Lockport, and towns along\u00a0Route 90 require buildings to be designed to winds of 140\u00a0to\u00a0150 mph\u00a03-second\u00a0gust.\u00a0</p><p>Commercial buildings\u00a0with higher human occupancy requirements and those serving essential functions such as hospitals\u00a0are typically subject to more stringent requirements per the IBC, given the risk category in which individual commercial buildings fall.\u00a0Generally, Hurricane Ida was below the design standards for structures built under these standards. Widespread catastrophic structural failure was therefore not expected.\u00a0Buildings that are older and predate the adoption of some of these standards can be expected to perform worse\u00a0and sometimes\u00a0become debris sources that can impact adjacent newer buildings. While adoption of building codes is one aspect, an equally important aspect is their enforcement. While enforcement is good for coastal counties, the same is not true for inland counties. Therefore, as\u00a0Ida trekked through the state and continued to produce damaging winds, damage can be expected to buildings across the entire state.\u00a0</p><p>According to AIR and\u00a0Xactware<sup>\u00ae</sup>, a sister company within Verisk, materials costs have gone up significantly in the past year from supply chain disruption in the construction market. Although these costs\u00a0have moderated\u00a0since\u00a0their peak in July\u00a0when they were 80% higher than September of last year, they remain\u00a0about\u00a030% higher.\u00a0Repair costs\u00a0are still\u00a0up significantly.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Reconstruction costs are more expensive today than they were a year ago. The increase in the total reconstruction cost index means that costs are higher on average nationally; this affects the low- as well as the high-severity events. The difference in magnitude of the impact will come from the mix of construction materials used. For example, minor wind losses are less likely to require repairs that use more expensive inputs such as structural lumber; however, dwellings that are a total loss would require a broader mix of inputs that reflect the higher increases indicated by the total reconstruction index. Therefore,\u00a0companies should bear these increases in mind and should expect the average claim to be higher\u202fbefore\u202fconsidering demand surge.\u00a0</p><p>An additional\u00a0source of uncertainty\u00a0related to materials cost demand surge\u00a0is the cost of diesel fuel, which has been impacted by the shutdown of refineries during Ida; this fuel would be used to transport materials.\u00a0While some of these facilities were undamaged, the\u00a0uncertainty around the timing of the restoration of the power grid and\u00a0lack of electricity\u00a0in the meantime\u00a0is going to keep some of them from coming back online and\u00a0contributing to the\u00a0diesel fuel supply.\u00a0</p><p>One other important aspect\u00a0of demand surge\u00a0to note is that after Hurricane Katrina, about half of the population of New Orleans\u00a0moved away\u00a0and\u00a0the city\u00a0never returned to pre Katrina\u00a0population\u00a0levels.\u00a0This\u00a0mass migration\u00a0probably mitigated\u00a0economic\u00a0demand surge, which was not as great as it might have been\u00a0after that storm.\u00a0</p><p>About AIR WorldwideAIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.

Tran explores assimilation, rebellion and the power of ancestry, as seen through the history of one Vietnamese family.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAUGHTERS OF THE NEW YEAR,</emphasis> by E.M. Tran              </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How does one write a generational narrative when the lineage of so many has been subjugated and erased? E.M. Tran tackles this question in her daring debut, \"Daughters of the New Year.\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At first blush, the novel appears to be a typical family story. It's set in 2016 New Orleans and centers on the three adult Trung sisters, Trac, Nhi and Trieu, second-generation immigrants who are balancing fitting into American life with living up to the hopes of their mother, Xuan, a former beauty queen who escaped the fall of Saigon.       </p><p>Each sister faces her own challenges: Trac is a successful corporate lawyer but she's still hiding her sexuality; Nhi is a struggling actress who ends up as the only Asian American woman on a reality dating show; and Trieu is an aspiring writer who longs for connection to her familial past. Meanwhile, Xuan spends her time obsessing over her American daughters' fates under the Vietnamese zodiac.       </p><p>But as the book unfolds, it becomes clear that this is no conventional narrative. Leaving the modern family, the novel sharply pivots to the Trungs' ancestors, a lineage of women who fought imperialism and patriarchy.       </p><p>The narrative travels backward from 2016 - to the Vietnam War, to French colonial rule and ultimately back to Vietnam's early struggles against foreign domination in A.D. 40, introducing readers to women warriors at each step. In the first century, we meet another set of Trung sisters (the namesakes for Trac and Nhi), the famed heroines who successfully rebelled against the first Chinese occupation of Vietnam. The Han army later returned and defeated the sisters, who, according to Vietnamese chronicles, jumped into the Hat Giang River, choosing suicide over surrender.       </p><p>That drowning reverberates as an ancestral force, echoing into the modern day. Trac sees a vision of her mother being submerged in the Mississippi River during Hurricane Katrina. Nhi, in Vietnam for TV filming, follows a little girl who twice leads her to the Saigon River, where the girl disappears. And Trieu dives into a pool to save a kitten that fell in, \"buffeted up\" to the surface with \"the force of a thousand hands lifting her through the water.\"       </p><p>These events recall the defiant deaths of the past Trung sisters, but they also allude to the founding of the Vietnamese zodiac, which, as the myth goes, was determined by a race between animals competing to be immortalized. The last hurdle in the race was the Mighty River, which the animals were required to cross to enter heaven.       </p><p>The novel's magical realism contrasts poignantly with its depiction of the too-real pressures of assimilation, which the modern Trung sisters face. In spare prose, Tran paints the sacrifice, guilt and culture clash of immigrant families. Precise details point to these larger dynamics: the \"blistering rage\" Trieu feels at the sound of Xuan's \"grating accent,\" the \"uncertainty and small fear\" in their father's voice when Trac rejects a house he buys for her. The family is, like the river, bound between two worlds.       </p><p>By connecting these contemporary challenges with the Trungs' warrior lineage, Tran shows us that modern resistance to assimilation is a continuation of a historical fight against imperialism. When a boy in school racially taunts Trac, an ancestor appears by her side, telling Trac, \"You will not disappear\" - a reminder that she will resist obliteration just like all the women before her.       </p><p>And while I wished to follow each act of defiance longer, wished there were clearer resolutions for the modern Trungs and more details given about each of their ancestors, I also wondered whether this was exactly Tran's point: that acts of resistance cannot stand alone. They form a continuous fabric through time, weaving a tapestry through the ages. As the first century Trung sisters assert: \"Each memory is a room that I can visit. Each memory happens at the same time. Who says time must move forward? I am always riding the elephant into a horde of men, I am always holding my sister's hand, I am always crossing the river, I am always burning. I am, always.\"              </p><p>Qian Julie Wang is the author of \"Beautiful Country\" and the managing partner of Gottlieb &amp; Wang, an education rights law firm.              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAUGHTERS OF THE NEW YEAR</emphasis> | By E.M.

And that career was looking good: she was wrapping up a fellowship at the Lark, starting a residency at the Public Theater, and working on a play inspired by the Flint water crisis.       </p><p>The Public scheduled a staging of that play - her first professional production - for the summer of 2020.       </p><p>You can imagine what happened next.       </p><p>The coronavirus pandemic shuttered theaters across America, and with it, scuttled her debut. But now the play, \"cullud wattah,\" is being recognized with the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, a respected annual award honoring work by women and nonbinary playwrights. The prize is a distinctive one - $25,000 for the winner, plus a Willem de Kooning print - and many of its recipients have gone on to great acclaim (among them, the Pulitzer winners Annie Baker, Jackie Sibblies Drury, Marsha Norman, Lynn Nottage, Wendy Wasserstein and Paula Vogel).       </p><p>Dickerson-Despenza, a 29-year-old Chicago native, is thrilled. \"It's a really affirming moment,\" she said, \"not only for me as an emerging playwright, but also for the way that I am doing my work as a queer Black woman who has intentionally decided to write about Black women and girls.\"       </p><p>Her career, like so many others, has been upended by the pandemic. \"cullud wattah\" is on hold, but a spokeswoman for the Public said the theater still hopes to produce it once it resumes presenting in-person productions.       </p><p>In the meantime, she has been working on a 10-play cycle about the effects of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. The second play in the cycle, \"[hieroglyph],\" was staged (without a live audience), filmed and streamed earlier this year by San Francisco Playhouse and Lorraine Hansberry Theater. And next week the Public Theater will introduce an audio production of \"shadow/land,\" the first installment of her Katrina cycle.       </p><p>\"I am interested in what we learn, and do not learn, and what history has to teach us,\" she said.       </p><p>She said she had been following the news out of Flint for some time before deciding to write \"cullud wattah\"; for a while, she said, she just made notes about the crisis and posted them on her wall. The play imagines the effect of the water crisis on three generations of women.       </p><p>\"I had a wall full of Flint, and I didn't know what to do with it,\" she said. \"The play is not so much about Flint, as it is about how an apocalypse makes everything else bubble to the surface.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007690669</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62F1-DH81-JC85-N1SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 13, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UM7</classCode><className>DRAMA LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UGQ</classCode><className>THEATER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001715</classCode><className>THEATER &amp;

It is 1,500, not 5,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dining and bar scene, so central to the city's identity, emerged strong from Hurricane Katrina. But the coronavirus crisis is different.</p><p>NEW ORLEANS - Tommy Tommaseo is not nostalgic for Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>Rocky and Carlo's, his family's Creole-Italian restaurant in St. Bernard Parish, just outside New Orleans, took on four feet of water when that disaster hit in 2005. There were fish swimming in the first floor of Mr. Tommaseo's house. His father, Rocky, then 91, escaped floodwaters on the back of a Jet Ski.</p><p>\"But this is worse,\" Mr. Tommaseo said Tuesday, as Louisiana emerged as a new hotbed of the coronavirus pandemic, with the world's steepest increase in new cases, according to one study. \"At least we know what to do for hurricanes down here.\"</p><p>The virus that has upended lives across the country is triggering memories of past disasters in the New Orleans area, which has had its share, from plagues to floods to oil spills. But Katrina looms largest in the city's collective memory.</p><p>Fifteen years on, marks of the hurricane are still evident in the scars and swagger of the residents who survived it. It's also there in the way veteran chefs and restaurateurs talk about the latest crisis.</p><p>\"I just texted members of our family, and I told them, 'This reminds me of Katrina,' \" said Stella Reese Chase, who manages her family's restaurant, Dooky Chase's, which was inundated by the storm's floodwaters.</p><p>Restaurant owners and employees haven't forgotten the toll taken by Katrina and its long aftermath. The hurricane brought floods that covered 80 percent of New Orleans and caused more than 1,800 deaths. At the same time, the calamity underscored how central restaurants are to the city's identity, economy and mental well-being - just as the widespread closings are doing now.</p><p>\"Without a robust culinary scene, we lose more than just dollars. We lose our essence,\" said Michael Hecht, president and chief executive of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional economic development organization.</p><p>Susan Spicer, a well-known chef and co-owner of the restaurants Bayona and Rosedale, said that after Katrina, \"people realized that restaurants were more than just places to go eat. They are culture bearers and community gathering places.\"</p><p>That realization helped fuel the slow rebuilding of a dining and drinking scene that became more diverse, with a greater variety of restaurants performing at a high level. The city attracted new residents, with different tastes, and ambitious chefs to cater to them.</p><p>But the impulse of the restaurant community to lean into adversity has been complicated by the realization that not all the lessons learned in past emergencies apply to the current one. That has been undeniable since at least March 16, when Gov. John Bel Edwards ordered all Louisiana restaurants to stop dine-in service. Mass closings and layoffs followed.</p><p>Donald Link, an award-winning chef, operates six New Orleans restaurants including P\u00eache Seafood Grill and Herbsaint. Soon after the order to close, he laid off 360 of his roughly 450 employees, leaving just one restaurant, Cochon Butcher, open for takeout with a menu of favorites drawn from all of his restaurants.</p><p>Mr. Link and his remaining staff have been preparing free meals for unemployed former colleagues and their families. \"We're no stranger to doing thousands of meals a day,\" he said. He is looking for ways to do more, \"but we can't get too big, because I can't put too many people in the kitchen. There are these new paradoxes.\"</p><p>The imperative of social distancing is particularly challenging in a city familiar with shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. Local officials increasingly believe that the virus incubated during Mardi Gras festivities, which ended Feb. 25.</p><p>It's also not uncommon for people in the restaurant business here to physically embrace customers. \"It was really hard to get people to elbow instead of hug,\" said JoAnn Clevenger, who has closed her restaurant, Upperline.</p><p>That can be hard for the staff, too, said Mr. Tommaseo, who is still serving a full menu for takeout at Rocky and Carlo's. \"It gets a little awkward, because you want to keep your distance, but you also want to be able to say hello,\" he said.</p><p>Food businesses are adapting as best they can, sometimes with good humor. Haydel's Bakery briefly sold almond cakes in the shape of toilet-paper rolls - edible jokes about hoarding.</p><p>\"I can't get any wipes, so I've got a bottle of 90 percent alcohol in the car, to wipe things down,\" Ms. Spicer said, \"and to take a little swig every once in a while.\"</p><p>Rosalita's Backyard Tacos, a takeout restaurant down an alley in the Bywater neighborhood, set up a system that minimizes physical contact: Customers text orders in advance, and pay using Venmo.</p><p>Mindful of sanitation concerns, Hao Gong stopped offering sushi for takeout at Luvi, his two-year-old Japanese-Chinese restaurant. \"We're selling a lot of dumplings,\" he said. \"But we're not even 10 percent of our usual business.\"</p><p>Mr. Gong, who worked at one of the first restaurants to open after Hurricane Katrina, longs to provide a sense of community that only a full-service restaurant can. He feels fortunate, though, particularly when talking with his family members in Shanghai. \"My dad quarantined 70 days already,\" he said.</p><p>Two weeks after the mandatory shutdown of restaurant dining rooms, a mirror image of the Katrina dynamic has come into focus. Instead of restaurants rising out of the muck to comfort storm-weary New Orleanians, citizens are scrambling to help the restaurants and their employees survive the crisis.</p><p>\"I worry that when these restaurants close, the restaurants might be thinking, 'OK, we'll just close for a week,' \" said Devin De Wulf, a local artist. \"But what if that week turns into forever?\"</p><p>Mr. De Wulf addressed his anxiety by creating a charity that, in less than two weeks, has raised about $80,000 to buy food from New Orleans restaurants to deliver to area hospitals. The charity, #feedthefrontline, is an offshoot of the Krewe of Red Beans, a Mardi Gras club that Mr. De Wulf founded to honor of his favorite local dish. (Donations can made at GoFundMe.)</p><p>The charity's goal is threefold: to provide business to restaurants, a morale boost for health workers and extra cash to out-of-work musicians, whom Mr. De Wulf hired to deliver the food.</p><p>Mr. De Wulf said #feedthefrontline is already being copied in other cities, including Baton Rouge, La., and Houston. In New Orleans, he estimates he is now spending $10,000 a day to deliver breakfast, lunch and dinner from over 30 restaurants to a dozen hospitals.</p><p>\"This is a win, win, win,\" said Jeffery Heard, the chef and owner of Heard Dat Kitchen, a small restaurant with a few sidewalk tables that is open for takeout in the Central City neighborhood.</p><p>On Tuesday, he and his daughter, Tia'Nesha Heard-Dorset, loaded pans of fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, peas and potato salad into the truck of Benji Bohannon, a jazz drummer. \"This is my main support, as far as making up for the tourists,\" said Mr. Heard, whose food was headed to the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital New Orleans.</p><p>Larger fund-raising efforts are underway to cushion the blow to unemployed hospitality workers. New Orleans has one of the country's highest poverty rates, and most people working in restaurants don't earn enough to build up savings. According to the Data Center, an independent local research firm, 93 percent of the full-service restaurant employees in New Orleans are in low-wage jobs where most workers make less than $15 an hour.</p><p>Halting tourism and closing restaurants \"affects the hotel worker, it affects the bartender, it affects the Uber driver, it affects the tour guide, it affects the whole economy,\" said Andy Kopplin, the president and chief executive of the Greater New Orleans Foundation. \"Because of our economic base, we're particularly vulnerable.\"</p><p>On Monday, the foundation started the Louisiana Service and Hospitality Family Assistance Program at the urging of Gayle Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints and Pelicans, who contributed $500,000, with another $100,000 from the McIlhenny Company, the Louisiana-based maker of Tabasco.</p><p>The fund is intended to benefit the neediest hospitality workers first, Mr. Kopplin said.</p><p>\"There are tens of thousands of people in New Orleans who are out of work,\" he said. \"Every single one of them needs help. The lower-wage workers who were raising kids or taking care of parents before the pandemic, those are the folks who need it the most.\"</p><p>A provision of the federal stimulus package that President Trump signed into law on Friday provides forgivable loans to businesses that use the money to retain employees and keep the doors open. \"It's a way of making sure you don't make a decision today that you regret tomorrow,\" said Mr. Hecht of the Greater New Orleans Foundation, a former restaurateur himself. \"I would encourage people to pay attention to it.\"</p><p>While they wait for help to arrive, restaurant owners are turning their attention to caring for recently laid-off employees.</p><p>\"I'm trying to manage navigating the storm,\" said Marv Ammari, the chief executive of Creole Cuisine Restaurant Concepts, which operates 21 restaurants and 10 bars and banquet spaces in the area. After laying off 1,300 people last week, Mr. Ammari said Creole Cuisine's remaining staff, mostly managers, is preparing 1,500 meals a day from Broussard's, a French Quarter restaurant that recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.</p><p>\"We're committed to feed the employed and unemployed members and their families,\" he said. \"We're going to continue to do it until we run out of food or until the authorities shut us down.\"</p><p>Hieu Than, the chef and owner of Kin, has refocused his menu away from scratch-made noodle soups to less labor-intensive items like sandwiches and rice bowls. He is determined to make his takeout business work in a declining economy, but he worries about the lasting impact of the downturn.</p><p>\"You can be the last restaurant standing, but if there's no market of people to come to you, what's the point?\" he said. \"We sustain each other in many ways.\"</p><p>Brad Hollingsworth, the owner of Clancy's, a French-Creole restaurant in Uptown New Orleans, laid off 40 employees. He is especially worried about one, Daniel Walters, his longtime ma\u00eetre d'. Mr. Walters tested positive for Covid-19, and has been in a hospital on a ventilator, in a medically induced coma. A fund has been set up to help pay Mr. Walters's bills and to provide meals for his caregivers.</p><p>\"He knew just about everybody in Uptown, and their name,\" Mr. Hollingsworth said. \"We're all praying for him.\"</p><p>Mr. Hollingsworth also hopes that when the pandemic ends, the recovery will resemble the months at Clancy's just after Katrina hit. \"In 45 years in the restaurant business, I'd never seen anything like it,\" he said. \"People just loved being here, seeing their friends again, getting out, getting back home.\"</p><p>\"All we can hope is we experience the same thing after this is all over. All this stuff we're talking about can be cured with full dining rooms.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Food on Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007058014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJH-PTJ1-DYR7-C0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Personal Watercraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFBMjczQ0I1NDNENDdDRDgwOUVCM0UwRUMwOTlDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002058</classCode><className>DISEASE AGENTS &amp;

He is Jon duSaint, not John. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The homebuilding industry has been slow to adopt changes that can better protect against extreme weather. Some architects are showing what's possible.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jon duSaint, a retired software engineer, recently bought property near Bishop, Calif., in a rugged valley east of the Sierra Nevada. The area is at risk for wildfires, severe daytime heat and high winds - and also heavy winter snowfall.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Mr. duSaint isn't worried. He's planning to live in a dome.       </p><p>The 29-foot structure will be coated with aluminum shingles that reflect heat, and are also fire-resistant. Because the dome has less surface area than a rectangular house, it's easier to insulate against heat or cold. And it can withstand high winds and heavy snowpack.       </p><p>\"The dome shell itself is basically impervious,\" Mr. duSaint said.       </p><p>As weather grows more extreme, geodesic domes and other resilient home designs are gaining new attention from more climate-conscious home buyers, and the architects and builders who cater to them.       </p><p>The trend could begin to dislodge the inertia that underlies America's struggle to adapt to climate change: Technologies exist to protect homes against severe weather - but those innovations have been slow to seep into mainstream homebuilding, leaving most Americans increasingly exposed to climate shocks, experts say.       </p><p>The result isn't just greater risk of death or injury, but also financial calamity, as homeowners struggle with declining property values, an inability to get insurance,  or the loss of what is often their most valuable asset. And the emotional and social toll of losing homes to disasters is only beginning to be understood.       </p><p>Weather-related disasters pushed more than 3.3 million American adults out of their homes in 2022, census data shows. Of those, at least 1.2 million people were out of their homes for a month or longer; more than half a million of them never returned, fueling a growing diaspora of domestic climate refugees.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Riding out the storm</emphasis></p><p>In the atrium of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, students from the Catholic University of America recently finished reassembling \"Weatherbreak,\" a geodesic dome built more than 70 years ago and briefly used as a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was avant-garde at the time: roughly a thousand aluminum struts bolted together into a hemisphere, 25 feet high and 50 feet wide, evoking an oversize metal igloo.       </p><p>The structure, designed by Jeffrey Lindsay and inspired by the work of Buckminster Fuller, has gained new relevance as the Earth warms.       </p><p>\"We started thinking about how our museum can respond to climate change,\" Abeer Saha, the curator who oversaw the dome's reconstruction, said. \"Geodesic domes popped out as a way that the past can offer a solution for our housing crisis, in a way that hasn't really been given enough attention.\"       </p><p>Domes are just one example of the innovation underway. Houses made from steel and concrete can be more resilient to heat, wildfire and storms. Even traditional wood-framed homes can be constructed in ways that greatly reduce the odds of severe damage from hurricanes or flooding.       </p><p>But the costs of added resiliency can be about 10 percent higher than conventional construction. That premium, which often pays for itself through reduced repair costs after a disaster, nonetheless poses a problem: Most home buyers don't know enough about construction to demand tougher standards. Builders, in turn, are reluctant to add resilience, for fear that consumers won't be willing to pay extra for features they don't understand.       </p><p>One way to bridge that gap would be to tighten building codes, which are set at the state and local level. But most places don't use the latest code, if they have any mandatory building standards at all.       </p><p>Some architects and designers are responding on their own to growing concerns about disasters.       </p><p>On a piece of land that juts out in the Wareham River, near Cape Cod, Mass., Dana Levy is watching his new fortress of a house go up. The structure will be built with insulated concrete forms, or ICF, creating walls that can withstand high winds and flying debris, and also maintain stable temperatures if the power goes out - which is unlikely to happen, thanks to the solar panels, backup batteries and emergency generator. The roof, windows, and doors will be hurricane-resistant.       </p><p>The whole point, according to Mr. Levy, a 60-year-old retiree who worked in renewable energy, is to ensure he and his wife won't have to leave the next time a big storm hits.       </p><p>\"There's going to be a lot of people spilling out into the street seeking sparse government resources,\" Mr. Levy said. His goal is to ride out the storm, \"and in fact invite my neighbors over.\"       </p><p>Mr. Levy's new home was designed by Illya Azaroff, a New York architect who specializes in resilient designs, with projects in Hawaii, Florida and the Bahamas. Mr. Azaroff said using that type of concrete frame adds 10 to 12 percent to the cost of a home. To offset that extra cost, some of his clients, including Mr. Levy, opt to make their new home smaller than planned - sacrificing an extra bedroom, say, for a greater chance of surviving a disaster.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building with steel</emphasis></p><p>Where wildfire risk is great, some architects are turning to steel. In Boulder, Colo., Ren\u00e9e del Gaudio designed a house that uses a steel structure and siding for what she calls an ignition-resistant shell. The decks are made from ironwood, a fire-resistant lumber. Beneath the decks and surrounding the house is a weed barrier topped by crushed rock, to prevent the growth of plants that could fuel a fire. A 2,500-gallon cistern could supply water for hoses in case a fire gets too close.       </p><p>Those features increased the construction costs as much as 10 percent, according to Ms. del Gaudio. That premium could be cut in half by using cheaper materials, like stucco, which would provide a similar degree of protection, she said.       </p><p>Ms. del Gaudio had reason to use the best materials. She designed the house for her father.       </p><p>But perhaps no type of resilient home design inspires devotion quite like geodesic domes. In 2005, Hurricane Rita devastated Pecan Island, a small community in southwest Louisiana, destroying most of the area's few hundred houses.       </p><p>Joel Veazey's 2,300-square-foot dome was not one of them. He only lost a few shingles.       </p><p>\"People came to my house and apologized to me and said: 'We made fun of you because of the way your house looks. We should never have done that. This place is still here, when our homes are gone,'\" Mr. Veazey, a retired oil worker, said.       </p><p>Dr. Max B\u00e9gu\u00e9 lost his house near New Orleans to Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, he built and moved into a dome on the same property, which has survived every storm since, including Hurricane Ida.       </p><p>Two features give domes their ability to withstand wind. First, the domes are composed of many small triangles, which can carry more load than other shapes. Second, the shape of the dome channels wind around it, depriving that wind of a flat surface to exert force on.       </p><p>\"It doesn't blink in the wind,\" Dr. B\u00e9gu\u00e9, a racehorse veterinarian, said. \"It sways a little bit - more than I want it to.

He said he expected to sell 30 or 40 domes this year, up from 20 last year, and has had to double his staff.       </p><p>The typical dome is about 10 to 20 percent less expensive to build than a standard wood-frame house, Mr. Johnson said, with total construction costs in the range of $350,000 to $450,000 in rural areas, and about 50 percent higher in and around cities.       </p><p>Most customers aren't particularly wealthy, Mr. Johnson said, but have two things in common: an awareness of climate threats, and an adventurous streak.       </p><p>\"They want something that's going to last,\" he said. \"But they are looking for something different.\"       </p><p>One of Mr. Johnson's newer clients is Katelyn Horowitz, a 34-year-old accounting consultant who is building a dome in Como, Colo.

The god's vengeful machinations, along with Ulysses' own guilt, have deterred him from getting back to his wife, Nella P. (D. Woods), and son, Malachai (Marcus Gladney, Jr.). The god-in-chief, Deus (James T. Alfred), and his daughter, Athena, or Aunt Tee (Harriett D. Foy), an ancestor of Ulysses who becomes human to support Nella and Malachai while the hero is away, try to help Ulysses despite Paw Sidin's obstacles. Ultimately, though, Ulysses discovers that the only way he can absolve himself and return home is by finding his history.       </p><p>Presented by the Classic Stage Company, \"black odyssey\" opens with a chorus's invocation: \"Let's begin at the beginning so we may end at the end.\" This cheeky, faux-cryptic line introduces Gardley's work, directed by Stevie Walker-Webb, as not just inspired by the plot and characters of the Odyssey but also by the formal structure of the epic poem, which begins with the same circularity and foreshadowing. The dialogue snaps with playful alliteration, repetition and puns, even rhymes that punch up lines rather than overpower them. (\"God knows you could use a hot bath, hot comb, and a hot oil treatment,\" Aunt Tee says indelicately to Nella, inviting herself into her home.)       </p><p>And the script demonstrates Gardley's appreciation for and understanding of Homeric storytelling: As in the Odyssey, where so little of the main action takes place in real time but instead comes to life in hearsay and recollections, so too does \"black odyssey\" manipulate time and place, memory and fantasy, in the simple act of telling a story. (Gardley's film adaptation of \"The Color Purple\" is forthcoming.)       </p><p>The cast is a delight, especially when Walker-Webb's direction allows them to let loose with the comedy. Foy is uproarious as the wise and wisecracking Aunt Tee. Adrienne C. Moore, as the enchantress Circe, provocatively stalks across the stage, sticks out her bottom at Ulysses and stretches out horizontally in front of him, all the while describing a sensual menu of Southern comfort food (\"Neck them neck bones ... dump my dumplings,\" she begs Ulysses in some culinary-themed foreplay). Cole's Paw Sidin is wily and despicable, though as cool as his long, blue buttoned jacket.       </p><p>The heroes themselves are less interesting, though to be fair their roles give them less room for such play, given that they must carry the show's drama. But Ulysses jittering around with desire as he's seduced by Circe, Nella going angry-Black-mother on Malachai, and Malachai giving woke Gen Z-style speeches to his elders are all, in their comedy, more compelling than in their moments of sorrow and joy.       </p><p>In general, when the play leans to parody, offering sirens styled as Dream Girls and the blind prophet Tiresias as a funky, supa-dupa-fly afro-wearing bus driver (Alfred, clowning around wholesomely), it becomes a whole different production - entertaining, though from left field.       </p><p>Because otherwise, the work's copious name-dropping, and its conflation of characters and events from Black history, transforms it into a game of Black bingo: Check references to the Scottsboro Boys, the Birmingham church bombing, the Middle Passage, Hurricane Katrina and the spirituals (though beautifully performed, particularly by Woods and Gladney) for the winning card.       </p><p>And \"black odyssey\" has a lot of fun with naming, in the same spirit as its source text (in the Odyssey, Odysseus says he is \"Nobody\" or \"No one\") - but between Malachai Malcolm Little Lincoln and Circe Tubman Sojourner Rosa Ida B. Nzinga, among others, even that touch of humor becomes little more than an overdone declaration of the play's Blackness.       </p><p>Formal and informal classicists who've attended the College of Homer and the University of Bulfinch and Edith Hamilton may also have some follow-up questions about this Harlem odyssey's modus operandi. For example, the play represents the gods exercising their power in the human world as Deus and Paw Sidin playing a chess game. But the metaphor is overused and raises more questions: Do these gods have laws and limitations to follow? Deus says they've been playing since 1619, so does that mean they are to blame for the state of Black Americans? Are they only gods of Black people; are they the same gods from Homer?       </p><p>More generally \"black odyssey\" sometimes struggles to strike the right balance of working from the original text and departing from it; the tension is most apparent when the play blatantly explains itself, by, for example, naming a character Benevolence Nausicca Calypso Sabine (a transformative Tem\u00eddayo Amay) to make clear that she's an amalgamation of several young female characters Odysseus encountered in his travels.       </p><p>David Goldstein's set beautifully transforms the thrust stage at the Lynn F. Angelson Theater with an elevated platform that appears to ripple and reflect like the actual sea. Two ends of a sailboat, painted with a city skyline and used to represent a home, a rooftop or, of course, a sailing vessel, go a long way, but the production could use a few other pieces or props to make its different settings clear. Adam Honor\u00e9's lighting is appropriately august, when Deus stands with a trail of warm yellow light behind him, opposite the chilly dark blue of Paw Sidin's lighting, and aquamarine blues and greens reflect off the sea-stage, submerging the whole theater in an oceanic underworld. Similarly on point is Kindall Houston Almond's costume design, which showcases such a variety of fashions from different periods and aesthetics: bright, flowing robes, a black baseball cap with a Basquiat-style crown, huaraches, a.k.a., the unofficial shoes of every Caribbean man of a certain age.       </p><p>This classic-meets-modern, Greek-meets-Black production traverses a lot of ground in its two-and-a-half-hour running time, making the journey feel tiresome by the end. Still, \"black odyssey\" offers a set of heroes - and villains - and a grand spectacle of Blackness to make the trip worthwhile.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Black Odyssey</emphasis>Through March 26 at Classic Stage Company, Manhattan; classicstage.org.

Toward the end of the book was a photograph of a flaming gas well rising from turbulent Gulf waters at twilight. To a Northern boy, seeing that photo felt like looking at some faraway, exotic land; in the upstate New York winter chill, I felt warmed by the twilight colors, the haze.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since moving to Louisiana in the early 2000s, I've documented the landscape of the Mississippi River's last miles, in Plaquemines Parish, from Fort Jackson and Buras, all the way down to Port Eads, the last outpost on the river delta, where the muddy Mississippi meets the blue water of the Gulf of Mexico.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">State Highway 23 terminates at the community of Venice, seven miles above Head of Passes, where the river technically ends and splits off into three passes that drain into the Gulf. Getting there isn't easy. Any place downriver from Venice is accessible only by boat, requiring a knowledgeable guide who can gauge the rapidly changing weather and marine conditions.       </p><p>There's peace and quietude in Plaquemines Parish, among the citrus groves, oil refineries and the salty breeze. Communities continue to rebuild here despite a seemingly never-ending series of storms and floods, amid a landscape that's constantly changing.       </p><p>On an unusually warm winter day in January 2005, I made it to Pilottown, one nautical mile above Head of Passes. For nearly 100 years, and for most of the 20th century, Pilottown served as the home of the river pilots who board cargo ships and guide them to and from the mouth of the Mississippi River.       </p><p>In its heyday, Pilottown was a thriving community of guides, trappers and fishermen. By the time I first made it there, only three permanent residents remained.       </p><p>In August of that year, Hurricane Katrina sent a 15-foot storm surge into Pilottown, destroying nearly every structure in the settlement. The Associated Branch Pilots, an association whose pilots guide ships from the Gulf to Pilottown, chose to rebuild upriver in Venice. The Crescent Port Pilots, whose pilots guide ships from Pilottown to New Orleans, stayed in Pilottown, with no permanent residents returning. Only a few fishing camps have been built there since the storm.       </p><p>Port Eads, sitting at the end of South Pass, 12 miles below Pilottown, was a bustling resort in the late 1800s, and the main commercial entrance into the river, made possible by jetties built at the mouth of the pass by James Buchanan Eads. The jetties sped up the water flow through the pass, causing it to dig its own deep channel. By the time I first photographed Port Eads, it was a crude, weather-beaten, last-chance marina, dotted with a few fishing camps. Its infrastructure seemed to be held together with duct tape and rope.       </p><p>Many of places in the river delta that I've revisited over the years have since disappeared, either because of their remoteness or as a result of storms. Often the only traces are a few pilings sticking out of the water, or the decaying frame of a home long ago abandoned. Ghost towns such as Olga, Oysterville and Burwood all have their own vanishing stories. Collectively they make up the fading history of Plaquemines Parish.       </p><p>I was living full-time with my family in a camp in the Lake Catherine area of Orleans Parish when Hurricane Katrina hit. I remember thinking we'd be gone maybe three days, and would come home to the camp after New Orleans survived another near miss from a major storm. Instead, Katrina took the camp and everything in it, including all my darkroom gear and a small box of negatives from early in this project.       </p><p>Afterward, it was hard to avoid the endless ruin that lingered all around me. But I was determined not to convert my work into an ode to hurricane destruction. I remember being incensed at all the cheap volumes of post-hurricane photographs that suddenly appeared up on bookstore shelves and intruded on the privacy of particular people's losses, images of ruined interiors and portraits of storm survivors sitting outside their gutted homes. When shooting for this project, I tended instead to seek out beautiful things that were still there in spite of the storm.       </p><p>I visualized several of the images in this collection many years before I saw the actual places. The view up South Pass from atop the Port Eads lighthouse was one I had carried in my mind's eye for more than 10 years; I knew from maps that a lighthouse was there, and if I could somehow get to it and climb it, I would capture the view I wanted. I finally got my chance on a late April afternoon in 2008. Standing atop the lighthouse, I was elated and hypnotized by the view, and half-certain I was dreaming.       </p><p>In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, I was fortunate to get a series of assignments for a coalition of conservation organizations called the Gulf Restoration Network, flying to the river's mouth and Chandeleur Islands to look for evidence of the spill, which produced a number of aerial photos. Aerial photography can be difficult to pull off: the thick summer haze requires a polarized filter, and any exposure under 1/800 results in blur on the ground. I asked the pilots to fly certain routes matching views I had imagined years before, looking at maps in my hometown library. For technical pointers, I consulted the afterword of David King Gleason's \"Over New Orleans.\"       </p><p>At the end of 2012, I learned that two delta structures I'd photographed over the years - the Associated Branch Pilot headquarters at Pilottown and the \"Happy Ending\" camp at Port Eads - had vanished. The pilot house had been torn down and hauled away after the pilots decided to relocate upriver in Venice, marking the end of an era of pilotage. The Port Eads camp disappeared for unknown reasons, destroyed by Hurricane Isaac in 2012 or simply torn down to make way for some other building.       </p><p>Every time I visit the last miles of the river and the bird-foot delta, I find myself quietly astonished by the stark, minimalist beauty; humbled by the history of the families who made their living at the \"end of the world,\" as it is sometimes called; and soothed by the constant, soft hiss of wind in the tall roseau cane. Being there is like being in a dream I have carried with me since I was a teenager.       </p><p>Much has been written about the slow disappearance of Louisiana's coastal zone, but my own experience has shown it to be a place of constant change. Where some older communities have vanished, other clusters of fishing and hunting camps have sprung up in new locations, only to change again when another storm passes through. There's a sense of serenity at the end of the river - along with a rich and fascinating history, which has kept me returning, again and again, for nearly 20 years.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Matthew D.

Co-hosted by veteran journalist Michelle Kosinski, the series interviews world leaders and those whose choices had an international impact. The podcast explores the reasons and often personal risks involved in the most consequential decisions they had to make. Guests on the first season include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyaw Moe Tun</emphasis>, Ambassador of Myanmar to the United Nations on his decision to risk his life-and go rogue.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alyssa Farah</emphasis>, former Director of Communications in the Trump White House, faced an ethical decision after the strike against Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Baroness Cathy Ashton</emphasis>, former High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on taking on a novel diplomatic approach in an effort to move past a bitter war and prevent another one.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert Gallucci</emphasis>, former Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs on what it's like trying to get North Korea to agree to anything.\u00a0\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Pound,</emphasis>former vice-president of the International Olympic Committee, on the decision to hold the next Games in China.</p><p>Many of the stories they share have never before been shared in public. Many of Sir Richard's insights and candid assessments have never before been heard. This is a podcast that takes listeners farther and deeper than they ever thought possible without a top secret clearance. Yet, by focusing on just one decision, the conversations avoid getting overly complicated and confusing. This is foreign policy brought out from behind the ambiguities of protocol, pretension, and pundits. It's real and really fascinating.</p><p>The podcast is being produced by the Global Situation Room, Inc, which developed the critically acclaimed Pod is a Women, that featured guests including Dr. Jill Biden, Natalie Portman, and Eva Longoria.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>All episodes from season one of One Decision are available for download today: podfollow.com/onedecision</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Michelle Kosinski:</emphasis>Michelle Kosinksi is an Emmy award-winning American journalist, writer, and show host.\u00a0</p><p>She served as Senior Diplomatic Correspondent at CNN, covering the State Department; and prior, was White House Correspondent.

She wrote and hosted the top-rated news and tech podcast, The Perfect Scam, with Frank Abagnale, the real-life inspiration for the film \"Catch Me If You Can.\"</p><p>Michelle has reported from more than 60 countries, including Afghanistan during the US war, Pakistan after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, and Haiti following the earthquake in 2010. She has covered countless world events such as the Arab Spring, terrorist attacks in Europe, economic crises in Spain and Greece, the death of Nelson Mandela, Hurricane Katrina, and mass shootings in the United States.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Sir Richard Dearlove:</emphasis>Sir Richard Billing Dearlove KCMG, OBE served as Chief (known as 'C') of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), also known as MI6, from August 1999 until his retirement in July 2004.\u00a0 He was a spy master for thirty-eight years and served in Nairobi, Prague, Paris, Geneva and Washington as well as in a number of key London-based posts.</p><p>Sir Richard was elected the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 2004.

It's part of a broader trend of companies pulling back from dangerous areas.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The climate crisis is becoming a financial crisis.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This month, the largest homeowner insurance company in California, State Farm, announced that it would stop selling coverage to homeowners. That's not just in wildfire zones, but everywhere in the state.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Insurance companies, tired of losing money, are raising rates, restricting coverage or pulling out of some areas altogether - making it more expensive for people to live in their homes.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Risk has a price,\" said Roy Wright, the former official in charge of insurance at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and now head of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, a research group. \"We're just now seeing it.\"       </p><p>In parts of eastern Kentucky ravaged by storms last summer, the price of flood insurance is set to quadruple. In Louisiana, the top insurance official says the market is in crisis, and is offering millions of dollars in subsidies to try to draw insurers to the state.       </p><p>And in much of Florida, homeowners are increasingly struggling to buy storm coverage. Most big insurers have pulled out of the state already, sending homeowners to smaller private companies that are straining to stay in business - a possible glimpse into California's future if more big insurers leave.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing 'catastrophe exposure'</emphasis></p><p>State Farm, which insures more homeowners in California than any other company, said it would stop accepting applications for most types of new insurance policies in the state because of \"rapidly growing catastrophe exposure.\"       </p><p>The company said that while it recognized the work of California officials to reduce losses from wildfires, it had to stop writing new policies \"to improve the company's financial strength.\" A State Farm spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.       </p><p>Insurance rates in California jumped after wildfires became more devastating than anyone had anticipated. A series of fires that broke out in 2017, many ignited by sparks from failing utility equipment, exploded in size with the effects of climate change. Some homeowners lost their insurance entirely because insurers refused to cover homes in vulnerable areas.       </p><p>Michael Soller, a spokesman for the California Department of Insurance, said the agency was working to address the underlying factors that have caused disruption in the insurance industry across the country and around the world, including the biggest one: climate change.       </p><p>He highlighted the department's Safer From Wildfires initiative, a fire resilience program, and noted that state lawmakers are also working to control development in the areas at highest risk of burning.       </p><p>But Tom Corringham, a research economist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego who has studied the costs of natural disasters, said that allowing people to live in homes that are becoming uninsurable, or prohibitively expensive to insure, was unsustainable.       </p><p>He said that policymakers must seriously consider buying properties that are at greatest risk, or otherwise moving residents out of the most dangerous communities.       </p><p>\"If we let the market sort it out, we have insurers refusing to write new policies in certain areas,\" Dr. Corringham said. \"We're not sure how that's in anyone's best interest other than insurers.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A broken model</emphasis></p><p>California's woes resemble a slow-motion version of what Florida experienced after Hurricane Andrew devastated Miami in 1992. The losses bankrupted some insurers and caused most national carriers to pull out of the state.       </p><p>In response, Florida established a complicated system: a market based on small insurance companies, backed up by Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, a state-mandated company that would provide windstorm coverage for homeowners who couldn't find private insurance.       </p><p>For a while, it mostly worked. Then came Hurricane Irma.       </p><p>The 2017 hurricane, which made landfall in the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm before moving up the coast, didn't cause a particularly great amount of damage. But it was the first in a series of storms, culminating in Hurricane Ian last October, that broke the model insurers had relied on: One bad year of claims, followed by a few quiet years to build back their reserves.       </p><p>Since Irma, almost every year has been bad.       </p><p>Private insurers began to struggle to pay their claims; some went out of business. Those that survived increased their rates significantly.       </p><p>More people have left the private market for Citizens, which recently became the state's largest insurance provider, according to Michael Peltier, a spokesman. But Citizens won't cover homes with a replacement cost of more than $700,000, or $1 million in Miami-Dade County and the Florida Keys.       </p><p>That leaves those homeowners with no choice but private coverage - and in parts of the state, that coverage is getting harder to find, Mr. Peltier said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Just not enough wealth'</emphasis></p><p>Florida, despite its challenges, has an important advantage: A steady influx of residents who remain, for now, willing and able to pay the rising cost of living there. In Louisiana, the rising cost of insurance has become, for some communities, a threat to their existence.       </p><p>Like Florida after Andrew, Louisiana's insurance market started to buckle after insurers began leaving following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Then, starting with Hurricane Laura in 2020, a series of storms pummeled the state. Nine insurance companies failed; people began rushing into the state's own version of Florida's Citizens plan.       </p><p>The state's insurance market \"is in crisis,\" Louisiana's insurance commissioner, James J. Donelon, said in an interview.       </p><p>In December, Louisiana had to increase premiums for coverage provided by its Citizens plan by 63 percent, to an average of $4,700 a year. In March, it borrowed $500 million from the bond market to pay the claims of homeowners who had been abandoned when their private insurers failed, Mr. Donelon said. The state recently agreed to new subsidies for private insurers, essentially paying them to do business in the state.       </p><p>Mr. Donelon said he hoped that the subsidies would stabilize the market. But Jesse Keenan, a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans and an expert in climate adaptation and finance, said the state's insurance market would be hard to turn around. The high cost of insurance has begun to affect home prices, he said.       </p><p>In the past, it would have been possible for some communities - those where homes are passed down from generation to generation, with no mortgages required and no banks demanding insurance - to go without insurance altogether. But as climate change makes storms more intense, that's no longer an option.       </p><p>\"There's just not enough wealth in those low-income communities to continue to rebuild, storm after storm,\" Dr. Keenan said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A shift to risk-based pricing</emphasis></p><p>Even as homeowners in coastal states face rising costs for wind coverage, they're being squeezed from yet another direction: Flood insurance.       </p><p>In 1968, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program, which offered taxpayer-backed coverage to homeowners. As with wildfires in California and hurricanes in Florida, the flood program arose from what economists call a market failure: Private insurers wouldn't provide coverage for flooding, leaving homeowners with no options.       </p><p>The program achieved its main goal, of making flood insurance widely available at a price that homeowners could afford. But as storms became more severe, the program faced growing losses.       </p><p>In 2021, FEMA, which runs the program, began setting rates equal to the actual flood risk facing homeowners - an effort to better communicate the true danger facing different properties, and also to stanch the losses for the government.       </p><p>Those increases, which are being phased in over years, in some cases amount to enormous jumps in price. The current cost of flood insurance for single-family homes nationwide is $888 a year, according to FEMA. Under the new, risk-based pricing, that average cost would be $1,808.       </p><p>And by the time current policyholders actually have to pay premiums that reflect that full risk, the impacts of climate change could make them much higher.       </p><p>\"Properties located in high-risk areas should plan and expect to pay for that risk,\" David Maurstad, head of the flood insurance program, said in a statement.       </p><p>The best way for policymakers to help keep insurance affordable is to reduce the risk people face, said Carolyn Kousky, associate vice president for economics and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. For example, officials could impose tougher building standards in vulnerable areas.       </p><p>Government-mandated programs, like the flood insurance plan, or Citizens in Florida and Louisiana, were meant to be a backstop to the private market. But as climate shocks get worse, she said, \"we're now at the point where that's starting to crack.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008929523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C7-TRM1-DYR7-C2TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 2, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001PWI</classCode><className>STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

The media was filled with encomiums, which was understandable even for those who opposed much of what he stood for.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not just that he was a war hero, or that he reminds us of an era in which the two parties were willing to work together in the national interest. His life story also reminds us of a time when public figures were supposed to show some sense of responsibility - to possess basic decency, to admit to mistakes when they made them, even to put their lives on the line in time of war. Human nature being what it is, many people who pretended to have these virtues were hypocrites. But at least that was the ideal, and being an obvious crook, liar or coward was politically disqualifying.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not anymore.       </p><p>As it happens, Dole's death came just a few days after we learned what Donald Trump did after he tested positive for the coronavirus last year. He not only concealed the result but also proceeded to put hundreds of people at risk by continuing his normal activities while refusing to wear a mask or practice social distancing. And when he came down with a life-threatening case of Covid, he suggested that he might have caught it from Gold Star families he had met with after his positive test - that is, he blamed people he himself had callously endangered.       </p><p>At some level, nobody is surprised; we knew that Trump was malignant to a degree never before seen in high office. But what does it say about the state of modern America that nobody expects him to pay any price for this revelation? The loyalty of his base won't be shaken; he's still the favorite for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.       </p><p>Nor has he paid any price for other character defects that would once have been considered damning. A generation or two ago, could a national political figure have gotten away with being constantly self-pitying, complaining about how badly he's being treated? Could he have paid no penalty for always refusing to admit error, even if the cover-up required altering weather maps with what appears to have been a Sharpie?       </p><p>And Trump seems to have set the standard for many of his devotees. Many of the rioters who tried to overturn the election on Jan. 6 seem to be very sorry - for themselves. Kyle Rittenhouse wept on the witness stand, not because he felt remorse over killing people but over the pain of being put on trial. The Crumbleys, who gave their son the gun with which he shot up his Michigan school and killed four students, also seemed very upset - over having been arrested.       </p><p>All this from a movement obsessed with the idea of masculinity. Weren't real men traditionally supposed to be strong, silent types who took responsibility for their actions and accepted burdens without complaining? Of course, these are human virtues, not specifically masculine; still, they used to be qualities we expected and admired.       </p><p>It didn't start with Trump. We've been heading this way for a long time. Back in 2006, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq on false pretenses and the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, I wrote about the \"mensch gap\" - the unwillingness of the people then running the country to accept responsibility for their own failures, their eagerness to blame others when things went wrong. Later, during the Obama era, it was striking how many critics on the right refused to acknowledge error when their predictions of runaway inflation or the abject failure of Obamacare failed to come true.       </p><p>But now the transformation of American conservatism - the same movement that complains about liberal \"snowflakes\" - into a collection of malignant whiners seems to have reached apotheosis. Yes, there are self-pitying hypocrites on the left too, but they don't dominate the way Trump and Trump-like figures dominate the right.       </p><p>I'm not entirely sure why this has happened; the degradation probably began decades ago, maybe as early as the Vietnam years. But there's no question that it has happened. At this point there are no grown-ups left on one side of the political aisle.              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quick Hits</emphasis></p><p>Remember the inflation truthers?       </p><p>Also the unemployment rate truthers.       </p><p>And Covid truthers.       </p><p>Billionaire victims.              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facing the Music</emphasis></p><p>[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]       </p><p>But that was then and this is now. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008109947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6489-VT51-DYR7-C2DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 10, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TA3</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

They are all resilient cities. And as lockdown measures return to cities worldwide due to the covid-19 pandemic, the concept -- which originated in the early 21st century -- seems more relevant than ever.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A variety of dramatic events have seen populations worldwide follow similar patterns: healing their wounds before getting up and carrying on with life. With 20,000 buildings flooded and some 150,000 people affected, the 1910 Great Flood of Paris was a major natural disaster. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was one of the world's deadliest hurricanes, as well as proving the costliest natural disaster in history for the USA. Since then, Typhoon Haiyan has wreaked havoc in the Philippines, and Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Irma and more have caused destruction elsewhere. Then there's the 2005 London bombings, the 2015 Paris terror attacks, and the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic in late 2019 in China. Faced with all manner of shocks, cities the world over are committing to rethinking their urban environments to better face the realities of a changing world. Welcome to resilient cities.\u00a0</p><p>According to the OECD, resilient cities \"have the ability to absorb, recover and prepare for future shocks (economic, environmental, social &amp; institutional),\" while also promoting sustainable development, wellbeing and inclusive growth. And the need for resilience is pressing, especially considering that some 70% of the world's population will be living in cities by 2050. But why do cities, in particular, have a role to play? The answer is because they are simultaneously the victims of environmental, social and economic shocks, while also being guilty of contributing to such events. Who is responsible for the majority of CO2 emissions, yet who sees scenes of total devastation when the Earth unleashes its power?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taking action</emphasis></p><p>Since the early 2000s, a host of cities have been working on establishing strategies of resilience to prevent and manage such risks. In 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation launched a network of \"100 Resilient Cities\" -- including Paris, France; Melbourne, Australia; Durban, South Africa; and Barcelona, Spain -- to better manage the consequences of major shocks such as natural disasters, pandemics, mass unemployment, sprawling slums etc. This notably involves financial and logistical support to help cities recruit a Chief Resilience Officer, like\u00a0S\u00e9bastien Maire in Paris.</p><p>In the French capital, this strategy for resilience has given rise to an action plan that aims to encourage residents to help make the city more inclusive, while also rethinking urban spaces. This includes measures such as supporting the creation of new, local jobs, studying basements and cellars to reduce the risks of structural collapse or flooding, developing the circular economy, promoting local manufacturing and non-monetary exchanges, the implementation of a first-aid training initiative, and turning schoolyards into cool zones with gardens and vegetable plots, for example.</p><p>Initiatives are multiplying all over the world. While an increasing number of municipal authorities are looking to appoint Chief Resilience Officers, covid-19 has prompted the establishment of food programs, in New Orleans, for example, where partner restaurants prepare meals that are distributed twice a day to those in need. That concerns some 12,000 residents. And this plan of action seems to be here to stay. Across the Atlantic, the city of Edinburgh is focusing on a digital strategy to help solve social and environmental problems.
