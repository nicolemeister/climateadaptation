To unlock the full potential of this solution, comprehensive policy interventions are needed to address institutional, economic, and perceptual challenges.</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>European forest policy is complex, as forest legislation is largely determined by national contexts. While stakeholders recognise the need for increased funding and clearer policies, inconsistencies in implementation hinder progress.<br/><br/><br/>In a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://optforeu.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/OptFor-EU-Policy-brief-1-1.pdf\">policy brief</url>, the OptFor-EU research project examines challenges and opportunities through expert surveys and stakeholder workshops in alignment with the EU's Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the European Green Deal.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>It lists financial constraints, information gaps, competing social priorities, fragmented governance, and differing perspectives based on gender and experience as the main threats in achieving forest-based carbon removal.<br/><br/><br/>However, the policy brief suggests there are opportunities to enhance forest resilience through improved data sharing, policy coordination, and innovative tools such as decision support systems and digital monitoring technologies.<br/><br/><br/>Moving forward, it recommends stakeholders to reinforce strategic priorities, adopt climate-smart forestry practices, and strengthen financial sustainability to support long-term climate resilience.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon removal through agroforestry</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>A recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2025.2478286\">publication</url>, taking the Upper Rhine region (Germany, Switzerland, and France) as a case study, examines the potential of agroforestry systems (AFS) for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), climate adaptation, and providing environmental and social co-benefits.<br/><br/><br/>However, their expansion is hindered by structural resistance, conflicting perceptions, and restrictive institutional frameworks. While there is broad conceptual support for AFS, their adoption is limited due to economic concerns, legal contradictions, and mistrust in farmers' capacities.<br/><br/><br/>In Germany, AFS are often seen as economically nonviable and incompatible with modern agriculture, whereas Switzerland and France show stronger cultural and economic valuation of trees and hedgerows, offering alternative pathways for scaling up.<br/><br/><br/>The study uses the 3I framework (institutions, interests, and ideas) to analyse the political dynamics affecting AFS adoption. Institutional barriers, such as complex legal processes and insufficient financial support, are significant obstacles.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unlocking the full potential</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Farmers face high administrative burdens and financial risks, with compensation mechanisms often inadequate. Additionally, conflicting interests between conservation and production, as well as societal expectations, create further challenges.<br/><br/><br/>Farmers value AFS for resilience and ecosystem services but feel overburdened by demands to address climate change and biodiversity without fair compensation. Policy interventions must prioritise climate adaptation, enhance farmer engagement, and create enabling conditions for experimentation.<br/><br/><br/>According to the study, simplifying legal processes, providing upfront finance, and fostering collaboration are essential. Trust-building and aligning incentives with farmers' realities are crucial for integrating AFS into mainstream agriculture.<br/><br/><br/>Ultimately, a shift in mindset, from viewing trees as obstacles to recognising them as essential components of resilient and sustainable agricultural systems, is crucial for unlocking the full potential of agroforestry in achieving climate and biodiversity goals.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CDR funding</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>To achieve its climate neutrality by 2050, the EU <url normalizedValue=\"https://carbongap.org/eu-carbon-removal-funding/\">must</url> rapidly scale up a diverse range of CDR, an effort that also presents substantial economic opportunities. By 2050, the sector could generate (EURO)220 billion annually, create 670,000 jobs, and position Europe as a leader in the green economy.<br/><br/><br/>However, the lack of research, funding gaps, and limited policy support, threaten the large-scale deployment of this solution. Despite being a global research leader, the EU's financial support for CDR has been insufficient and fragmented, with only (EURO)657 million allocated between 2020 and 2023.<br/><br/><br/>Current funding mechanisms fail to distinguish CDR from carbon capture and storage (CCS), limiting opportunities for targeted innovation. To bridge the funding gap, the EU must invest (EURO)2.88 to (EURO)5.85 billion over the next 15-20 years to accelerate technical development and ensure deployment readiness.<br/><br/><br/>A clear roadmap is essential for addressing research and financial gaps. Expanding the research, development, and innovation funding beyond EU level is also crucial, requiring collaboration between the Commission, member states, and the private sector.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrating CDR into ETS</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The EU climate advisory board recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/eu-advisors-push-for-integrating-co2-removal-into-eu-carbon-trading/\">recommended</url> integrating carbon removals into the emissions trading scheme (ETS) to accelerate technology deployment while maintaining strict sustainability criteria.<br/><br/><br/>While some fear removals could delay immediate climate action, the Commission sees them as crucial for the 2050 net-zero goal. The proposal includes separate targets for permanent and temporary removals and a gradual ETS link to generate credits and reduce reliance on public funding.<br/><br/><br/>Experts increasingly support the idea, though concerns persist about weakening ETS effectiveness. Politically, the centre-right EPP backs integration, while left-leaning politicians remain cautious.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewsagroforestryneedsfairerclearerpoliciesandmorefundingwarnfarmers</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCR-V663-RRP7-2558-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

We are working to ensure that no cocoa is unfairly denied access to the European market.\"</p><p>The EU postponed enforcement of the EUDR from 1 January 2025 to 1 January 2026 after appeals from producing countries like Cameroon.</p><p>The delay is seen as critical: the EU is Cameroon's main export destination, receiving 78 percent of its cocoa and 87 percent of its coffee, according to official data.</p><p>As the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer, Cameroon's compliance with the EUDR is essential. The regulation requires adherence to seven key principles, including land rights, environmental protection, respect for labour and human rights, and obtaining free, prior, and informed consent from indigenous communities. It also demands compliance with rules on taxation, anti-corruption, trade, and customs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20230421-european-union-adopts-law-to-ban-products-driving-deforestation\">European Union adopts law to ban products driving deforestation</url></p><p>Structural and policy obstacles</p><p>Despite significant progress, officials admit that major challenges remain. Chief among them is institutional fragmentation, with overlapping responsibilities and poor coordination between the ministries of agriculture, forestry, environment, and land Tenure. This lack of clarity creates loopholes and delays.</p><p>Moreover, many smallholder farmers lack formal land titles, making it difficult to invest in long-term sustainable practices. This also leaves them vulnerable to land grabs and evictions by speculators.</p><p>Cameroon also supports cocoa agroforestry\u2014a practice that combines cocoa cultivation with forest conservation\u2014as a sustainable model. However, the EU has yet to fully recognise agroforestry within its definition of deforestation-free agriculture.</p><p>\"We strongly advocate for agroforestry, which we see as sustainable and beneficial,\" Maledy said. \"Unfortunately, the current EU regulation does not recognise its value. We intend to actively participate in upcoming review processes to ensure this approach is properly acknowledged.\"</p><p>In the meantime, the CICC has intensified its efforts to raise awareness among farmers.

Palm-oil-producing countries have made significant efforts to reduce indirect land use change from its cultivation. But will it be enough to satisfy the new law?</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Last week, the European Commission published a legal act ahead of the start of the world's first anti-deforestation law, which will take effect in the EU at the end of this year. The act benchmarks countries based on the risk of deforestation caused by their exports.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Four countries were given the designation as being at \"high risk\" of fuelling deforestation: North Korea, Russia, Belarus and Myanmar.<br/><br/><br/>Major forest nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia were assigned the category of \"standard risk\". Compliance checks will be required for 9% of exports from high-risk countries, while 3% will be required for those from standard-risk.<br/><br/><br/>The categorisation has caused controversy, with some accusing the Commission of making the designations for political reasons rather than scientific ones.<br/><br/><br/>Others have said the Commission is trying to lessen the impact of the rules after countries and companies complained that the bureaucratic burden would be too much, something which already caused the delay of the start of the legislation from the original date of December 2024.<br/><br/><br/>But the standard risk countries say that the designation reflects the significant progress they have made in tackling deforestation over the past decade.<br/><br/><br/>This has been especially true for palm-oil-producing countries, which were the subject of intense scrutiny ten years ago amid concern that EU biofuel targets for transport were driving an increase in palm oil production, which was in turn driving deforestation. Since then, both Indonesia and Malaysia have made efforts to get a handle on the situation.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Abrupt EU policy shift</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The EU's biofuel targets, first adopted in 2003, were intended to reduce the use of fossil fuels in transport, to combat climate change. So, the possibility that the policy could be increasing climate change by driving Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) when forests are cleared to grow the crops became alarming to policymakers starting in 2010.<br/><br/><br/>In 2014, the amount of first-generation biofuels that can be used to meet the renewable fuel targets was capped, and palm oil can no longer be used to meet the target.<br/><br/><br/>Forests act as a natural carbonk sink to suck emissions out of the atmosphere, and forest fires are the second-largest contributor to global warming, accounting for 19% of global carbon emissions between 1959 and 2019, according to a study by Oxford University.<br/><br/><br/>Governments, therefore, also have an interest in stopping deforestation, and significant efforts have been made in that direction.<br/><br/><br/>Concerted conservation efforts, commitments towards climate neutrality under the Paris Agreement, and targeted wildlife protection projects have already begun to influence the trajectory of forest preservation and sustainable palm oil production.<br/><br/><br/>Both Indonesia and Malaysia have established a network of protected areas, including national parks and conservation corridors, designed to safeguard remaining primary forests and endangered species habitats. Legislative reforms have been introduced in both countries to improve land-use planning, enforce anti-encroachment measures, and monitor illegal logging activities.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significant progress</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The results of these changes have already been seen.<br/><br/><br/>In 2018-2020, deforestation for palm oil was 45,285 hectares per year, 18% of its peak in 2008-2012, according to research by the deforestation NGO Trase. And that drop came during a period of continued expansion of palm oil production. Some of the drop can be attributed to a drop in the market value of crude palm oil following the legislative changes ten years ago. But there has been a recent spike in palm oil prices since then, which has not been accompanied by a boom in palm-driven deforestation, according to Trase.<br/><br/><br/>\"Palm oil presents a positive example of decoupling commodity production from deforestation,\" says Anita Neville, Chief Sustainability and Communications Officer at the Singapore-based palm oil company Golden Agri-Resources. \"This hasn't been achieved through policy and pledges alone, but by sustained, collaborative efforts between government as well as the public and private sectors.\"<br/><br/><br/>She points to Initiatives such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which her company is a member of, as an example of ways that industry commitments on implementing No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) can be measured and verified. \"What that data demonstrates is that a long-term commitment of time and investment to engage and upskill farmers can improve practices and is effective in tackling deforestation.\"<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net-zero emissions</emphasis><br/><br/>The commitments by Indonesia and Malaysia to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement have also played a pivotal role in reorienting policies and industry practices.<br/><br/><br/>These commitments have prompted governments to integrate climate objectives with forest conservation, fostering initiatives aimed at restoring degraded lands and promoting agroforestry practices. As a result, some palm oil producers have begun to shift towards more sustainable land use, such as intensification on existing plantations and dedicating land to conservation, thereby reducing pressure to clear new forests.<br/><br/><br/>The international financial sector and consumers' increasing demand for sustainable products have also incentivised companies to invest in environmentally responsible practices.<br/><br/><br/>Aside from saving forests, these efforts have also focused on protecting wildlife and biodiversity.<br/><br/><br/>Several projects have targeted iconic species, including orangutans, Sumatran rhinos, and elephants. For instance, wildlife corridors have been established in Indonesia to facilitate movement and genetic exchange among populations, reducing fragmentation caused by plantations.<br/><br/><br/>Community-based conservation projects have been established, engaging local communities in safeguarding habitats and promoting alternative livelihoods.<br/><br/><br/>Other initiatives include rescue and rehabilitation centres for critically endangered species, research on habitat connectivity, and anti-poaching efforts supported by international collaboration. These efforts aim to address the root causes of wildlife decline caused by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal poaching.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Compliant with EU law?</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Despite these advances, significant hurdles remain.<br/><br/><br/>Deforestation continues in certain regions due to weak enforcement, land tenure ambiguities, and economic incentives favouring land conversion. 2.4 million hectares of intact forest remain\u00a0within Indonesia's oil palm concessions, according to Trase, which presents a risk for backtracking on progress made so far.<br/><br/><br/>\"This large area of forest designated for palm oil production underscores both an opportunity for conservation, as well as the potential risk that further oil palm expansion may pose to Indonesia's rainforest,\" Trase has concluded in an analysis. \"A fundamental challenge over the coming decade will be to meet continued growth in demand for products derived from palm oil, while ensuring that deforestation continues to decline.\"<br/><br/><br/>To address this, comprehensive supply chain transparency, strengthened enforcement of zero-deforestation commitments, and the adoption of satellite monitoring and AI-based land-use tracking are essential. Additionally, supporting smallholder farmers in adopting sustainable practices and ensuring equitable land rights can reduce incentives to clear forests.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Enough progress?</emphasis><br/><br/>The big question is whether the progress made in Indonesia and Malaysia on palm oil will be enough to satisfy the new EU deforestation law requirements.<br/><br/><br/>Campaigners say they still believe the law is the best tool to stop global deforestation, even if there are concerns about the low number of countries designated as high risk. \"The benchmarking system unfortunately falls short of what the science requires... but in practice, this shouldn't undermine the power of this law to save forests,\" said Giulia Bondi, senior EU campaigner at Global Witness, following the publication of the implementing act last week.<br/><br/><br/>\"Even when trading in products produced in a 'low' or 'standard-risk' country, companies will still have to prove their supply chains are free from deforestation and human rights abuses,\" she added.<br/><br/><br/>But many companies, and governments both within and outside the EU, say the law risks being too prescriptive and could hinder deforestation efforts - concerns which have already resulted in the law's delay.<br/><br/><br/>\"The EU's continued uncertainty about EUDR implementation diverts attention from valid concerns that the measure is all stick and no carrot,\" says Neville. \"Without support and incentives to transition to more sustainable practices, the risk is that smallholder farmers - farming families that don't have the means or capacity to comply yet - will be shut out of global markets.\"<br/><br/><br/>Neville says that regardless of what happens with the EU deforestation law, the industry's progress will continue, noting that, \"Growers, customers and industry bodies will continue our collaboration to tackle the root causes of this problem, hoping to promote resilient, sustainable incomes for farmers that produce responsibly.\"<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewsindonesiaandmalaysiatacklingdeforestationasneweurestrictionsloom</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX9-57N3-RYRR-R4KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Once the roots and other parts decompose, microbes convert them into soil carbon. Therefore, plant matter and CO2 are stored in the soil as organic matter, particularly humus.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage, </emphasis></p><p>Recent studies indicate that carbon capture and storage (CCS) are crucial for achieving the temperature targets set by the Paris Agreement; however, its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02104-0\">implementation</url> remains insufficient. They noted that carbon sequestration techniques on agricultural land <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01039-1\">have significant potential</url> to mitigate global warming.</p><p>So, what exactly is it? Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves capturing, transporting, and storing carbon dioxide directly from the source of emissions before it enters the atmosphere which may, be reused. Carbon sequestration, by contrast, focuses on the long-term storage of the captured carbon without reusing it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon farming techniques</emphasis></p><p>When it comes to carbon farming, several practices, such as cover cropping and reduced tillage, are already part of the organic and regenerative agricultural <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenerationinternational.org/2024/12/08/scaling-up-best-practices-regenerative-agriculture-to-regenerate-our-climate-by-maximizing-photosynthesis/\">toolbox</url>.</p><p>Preserving\u00a0permanent <url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-11-degraded-grasslands-benefit-climate-mitigation.html\">grasslands</url>\u00a0or converting cropland to fallow or permanent pastures are among the most promising soil carbon\u00a0storage\u00a0techniques, as they store higher amounts of carbon than tilled fields.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/651982/EPRS_BRI(2020)651982_EN.pdf\">Agroforestry</url> systems\u00a0- land use systems in which woody plants such as trees or shrubs are combined with crops and/or animal husbandry in a single area - store equivalent amounts of carbon as in permanent systems grasslands.</p><p>Other techniques garnering attention include biochar technology and enhanced rock weathering.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://regenerationinternational.org/2018/05/16/what-is-biochar/\">Biochar,</url> for example, is a charcoal-like substance created by burning organic material from agricultural and forestry waste in a controlled pyrolysis process.

Exposure to precipitation initiates chemical reactions that 'draw down' CO2\u00a0from the atmosphere, transforming it into carbonates.</p><p>These carbonates then mix with and filter through soils until they are washed into rivers and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rog.20004/abstract\">eventually oceans,</url> where they are stored for thousands of years.</p><p>Proponents describe the ERW process as one that can store atmospheric CO2 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-enhanced-weathering-could-slow-climate-change-and-boost-crop-yields/\">while helping</url> farmers enrich their lands.

Under the new CAP regulations, which came into effect in 2021, member states must allocate at least 25% of their direct payments budget to eco-schemes designed to incentivise sustainable farming practices, including carbon sequestration measures.</p><p>According to projections from the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/horizontal-topics/farm-fork-strategy_en\">European Environment Agency</url>, If the widespread adoption of carbon farming techniques is achieved, it could result in the additional sequestration of 225 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030, significantly contributing to the EU's climate objectives.</p><p>The Carbon Farming CE project is a key Interreg Central Europe program initiative <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.interreg-central.eu/news/carbon-farming-ce-recognized-by-the-european-commission/\">endorsed</url> by the European Commission. The initiative actively fosters and extends carbon farming pilot projects throughout Central Europe.</p><p>The program brings together 11 partners from nine countries to develop guidelines, business models, and monitoring systems for carbon farming. The initiative also explores various carbon farming methods and devises strategies to promote their adoption in the region.</p><p>The Carbon Farming CE project aligns with the new Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en#:~:text=The%20CRCF%20Regulation%20mandates%20third,for%20small%20farmers%20and%20foresters.\">regulation</url>, establishing the first voluntary framework across the EU for certifying carbon removals, carbon farming efforts, and carbon storage in European products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costly and complex?</emphasis></p><p>The enthusiasm behind carbon farming techniques is understandable, but the techniques are not without challenges.</p><p>While the basic premise of enhanced rock weathering is sound, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/mining-and-metals\">mining</url>, grinding and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/freight-transportation\">transporting</url>\u00a0rock use a lot of energy. Enhanced weathering needs to remove more CO2 than it creates. It is also unclear how well large-scale enhanced weathering will work in practice. Additionally, enhanced rock weathering is an expensive process.</p><p>One consideration regarding biochar is that it is neither a cheap product nor a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>It can be produced from various plant materials and pyrolysed at different temperatures, resulting in different outcomes. A type of biochar that benefits a specific soil or crop may offer little advantage to another.</p><p>Moreover, carbon farming can be easily reversed. Once a soil's carbon content increases over several years, it can be released if carbon farming measures are halted, errors occur when managing a plot, or farming techniques are altered. If not consistently maintained, carbon farming is not a\u00a0permanent solution for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.</p><p>Another fundamental challenge underlying carbon farming is measurement and standardisation. Assessing the carbon content of the soil is complex, with various methods designed to determine carbon levels over time, which\u00a0also depend\u00a0on the soil type.</p><p>To accurately measure the development of soil carbon content, samples must be precisely located and taken at the appropriate depth and time to ensure comparability. Variability, uncertainty, and potential errors stem from the distribution of\u00a0soil carbon content, which can vary even within the same field or plot.</p><p>As the science of soil carbon sequestration progresses, we now understand its potential. While no single solution can tackle our global climate system, it is universally accepted that many solutions are required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon farming encompasses a diverse portfolio of techniques that can be tailored to specific regions and crop types.

However, they are increasingly vulnerable to rapid and severe extreme weather events, which are disrupting their lives and livelihoods, Viorel Gutu writes.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Viorel Gutu is FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative in Europe and Central Asia</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>While the impacts of climate change intensify, sustainable food systems and agricultural practices offer a solution.<br/></p><p><br/>Agroforestry, sustainable and resilient fisheries and aquaculture, restoration of soils, land and ecosystem can help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance soil health, and improve water use efficiency. By investing in research and development, we can develop climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds that are better adapted to changing conditions.<br/></p><p><br/>Realising the full potential of sustainable agriculture requires significant investment. Specifically, global climate finance flows to the sector must increase by a factor of 40. More specifically, global agrifood systems are estimated to require $1.1 trillion ((EURO)1.05 trillion) annually until 2030 to achieve emissions reduction\u00a0and climate resilience targets under the Paris Agreement.<br/></p><p><br/>However, despite the urgent need for climate action in the agrifood sector, global climate finance flows to this sector remain insufficient. In 2022, only 23% of total climate finance was allocated to agriculture, a decline from 37% in the previous decade. This disparity is particularly alarming given the sector's significant contribution to and mitigation of climate change.<br/></p><p><br/>To bridge this funding gap, the international community must significantly scale up climate finance for the agrifood sector. Governments, multilateral development banks, and private sector companies must increase their investments to support the needed transformation of agrifood systems, prioritising investments in adaptation and mitigation measures in agriculture, especially for vulnerable groups like smallholder farmers, women, and youth.<br/></p><p><br/>This investment is critical to support the development of drought-resistant crops, improvement of irrigation systems and early warning systems. It is also essential to finance mitigation efforts, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, and promote sustainable land and water use practices.<br/></p><p><br/>Policymakers and regulators must play a crucial role in designing sector-specific investment plans that integrate both public and private financing. By integrating a climate lens into existing financial flows, we can redirect investments towards low-emission, climate-resilient activities.<br/></p><p><br/>Innovative financing instruments, such as blended finance and impact investing, can also help to unlock additional funding from the private sector.<br/></p><p><br/>It is also essential to outline priorities for public investment in and through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Increasing domestic finance targets within NDCs demonstrates a commitment to climate goals and builds investor confidence.<br/></p><p><br/>NDCs offer a powerful tool to identify priorities to address the climate crisis and its impact on our food systems. However, agrifood systems currently account for only 15% of total funding needs reported in NDCs. To fully leverage NDCs, we need to collect more comprehensive and consistent finance data and develop rigorous, transparent, and standardised methods to cost climate finance needs.<br/></p><p><br/>Empowering local communities, particularly women and youth, to participate in decision-making processes and implement climate-resilient strategies is crucial. Strengthening monitoring, reporting and evaluation systems to track the effectiveness of climate finance and ensure accountability is also essential.<br/></p><p><br/>With the recent UNFCCC COP29 agreement to triple climate finance for developing countries to USD 300 billion annually by 2035, the urgency of addressing climate change and its impact on agriculture is undeniable.<br/></p><p><br/>This increased financial commitment offers a unique opportunity to transform our food systems. But the time to act is now.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodopiniontransformativefinancingadvancingsustainableagrifoodsystemsforresilientfuture</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DH0-WFS1-JCMC-W0WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Experts are calling for the creation of a carbon removal budget to encourage enhanced storage as a sustainable practice to combat climate change.</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Given that forests cover 40 per cent of Europe and nearly half are privately owned, a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://efi.int/sites/default/files/files/publication-bank/2024/efi_fstp17_2024.pdf\">report</url> by the European Forest Institute (EFI) advocates for incentivising forest owners to adopt sustainable practices, such as temporal carbon credits.<br/><br/><br/>These credits provide annual financial rewards based on measurable carbon storage, fostering trust in carbon markets while discouraging environmentally degrading activities like logging and land clearing.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>The report emphasises that afforestation - replanting and regenerating forests - is the most effective way to store carbon long-term, alongside measures such as diversifying tree species, agroforestry, and wetland management.<br/><br/><br/>It also calls for improved geospatial monitoring and third-party verification to ensure the credibility of carbon farming initiatives and that they deliver genuine climate benefits, helping enhance forest resilience.<br/><br/><br/>Scientists stress the critical role of forests in removing CO2, preserving biodiversity, and improving air quality, noting the increasing threats of wildfires, droughts, and storms, with 2024 on track to be the <url normalizedValue=\"https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-2024-update-cop29\">warmest year</url> on record.<br/><br/><br/>To achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the report urges policymakers to align national and EU-level strategies, balancing the promotion of wood use with measures to reduce harvests and enhance forest resilience.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Certification for carbon farming</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>EU forests <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/forests-and-forestry\">absorb</url> around 10 per cent of the total EU emissions, playing an important role both in climate change <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-mitigation-reducing-emissions\">mitigation</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation\">adaptation</url>. Their innate ability to regenerate and adapt makes forests a great ally in facing the damaging effects of climate change.<br/><br/><br/>However, they are facing increasingly dramatic changes. While the north has seen changes in rainfall, the south experiences more frequent heatwaves and lower rainfall, making them susceptible to droughts and forest fires.<br/><br/><br/>In November, the European Council approved a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/11/19/council-greenlights-eu-certification-framework-for-permanent-carbon-removals-carbon-farming-and-carbon-storage-in-products/\">regulation</url> establishing the EU's first certification framework for carbon removals, carbon farming, and carbon storage in products, advancing the goal of climate neutrality by 2050.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Categorising carbon removal</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The regulation includes three main categories of activities: permanent carbon removals that store carbon for centuries, carbon storage in long-lasting products for at least 35 years, and carbon farming practices that enhance carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in soils over a minimum of five years.<br/><br/><br/>To qualify for certification, activities must demonstrate measurable net carbon or soil emission reductions, provide additional benefits beyond existing requirements, ensure long-term carbon storage, and avoid significant environmental harm while contributing to sustainability goals.<br/><br/><br/>All certified activities will undergo independent verification by third-party bodies and adhere to strict monitoring, reporting, and liability standards. An EU-wide electronic registry will be launched four years after the regulation takes effect to ensure transparency and traceability of certified carbon units.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon removal budget</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Achieving net-zero carbon emissions is critical to stabilising carbon levels, but this requires both drastically reducing emissions and addressing residual emissions through carbon removal.<br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en\">Carbon removal</url>, a critical yet complex aspect of climate action, encompasses a range of methods, from nature-based solutions like planting trees to technological innovations that capture and store carbon underground.<br/><br/><br/>Durable carbon removal, though essential, is scarce and expensive, costing approximately 100 times more than traditional carbon credits focused on emission avoidance. Overreliance on land-based removal methods also risks undermining food security and human rights.<br/><br/><br/>To address these challenges, experts at the World Economic Forum (WEF) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/why-the-world-needs-a-carbon-removal-budget-not-just-a-carbon-budget/\">propose</url> establishing a global carbon removal budget analogous to a carbon emissions budget.<br/><br/><br/>The framework would quantify removal capacity, set its value, and guide its equitable allocation across countries, companies, and financial institutions.<br/><br/><br/>Such a budget could help ensure the responsible use of finite removal resources, prioritising them for emissions that are hardest to eliminate.<br/><br/><br/>Experts argue that integrating carbon removal budgets into climate strategies would support informed decision-making, equitable resource distribution, and investments in expanding removal capacities.<br/><br/><br/>By embedding this concept into global climate negotiations and net-zero planning, nations and organisations can ensure carbon removal fulfils its essential role in combating climate change.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/put-forest-resilience-at-heart-of-carbon-storage-incentives-budget-say-experts/\">Put forest resilience at heart of carbon storage incentives budget, say experts</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com\">Euractiv</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewsputforestresilienceatheartofcarbonstorageincentivesbudgetsayexperts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMJ-DJJ1-JCMC-W0FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Not only is it a living entity, but it is also one of the planet's most complex ecosystems.

But what does regenerative agriculture entail?<br/><br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture is a <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenerationinternational.org/2023/12/22/the-definition-of-regenerative-agriculture/\">set of methods</url> for improving the health of soil degraded by intensive farming. Some\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.577723/full?&amp;utm_source=Em\">definitions</url>\u00a0focus more on the processes used, such as using cover crops and integrating livestock. In contrast, others emphasise outcomes, such as restoring the soil's carbon content.<br/><br/><br/>Despite the current enthusiasm for the term, regenerative agriculture is not a modern idea. It is an ancient concept that originated with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/insights/the-indigenous-roots-of-regenerative-agriculture/\">Indigenous peoples</url> worldwide centuries ago.<br/><br/><br/>In many Indigenous worldviews, humans and nature are not separate forces but parts of a whole that need each other to thrive.\u00a0\u00a0Researchers at the Rodale Institute in the US<url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0030727021998063\">started using</url> the terms 'regenerative agriculture' and 'regenerative farming'\u00a0in the early 1980s. The terms then fell out of use until about 2015.<br/><br/><br/>In 2017,\u00a0Regeneration International <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenerationinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Regen-Ag-Definition-2.23.17-1.pdf\">defined</url> 'Regenerative Agriculture' as \"farming and grazing practices that, among other benefits, reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity - resulting in both carbon drawdown and improving the water cycle.\"<br/><br/><br/>The definition goes on to detail other practices: minimum-till / no-till; the use of cover crops, crop rotations, compost, and animal manures to support soil fertility; supporting biological ecosystem biodiversity; and grazing practices \"to stimulate improved plant growth, increased soil carbon deposits, and overall pasture and grazing land productivity while greatly increasing soil fertility, insect and plant biodiversity, and soil carbon sequestration\".<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regenerative agricultural examples</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>There are several techniques that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbf.org/issues/agriculture/regenerative-agriculture.html\">regenerative farms</url>\u00a0could adopt to benefit the soil that sustains their crops.<br/><br/><br/>No-till farming <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenerationinternational.org/2018/06/24/no-till-farming/\">involves</url> farmers leaving dead plant matter to decompose in the soil following harvest. This approach revitalises the soil ecosystem by providing organic material, creating a healthier foundation for future plants, and encouraging thicker topsoil layers, which increases resilience in drought conditions. Additionally, it reduces the need for fertilisers.<br/><br/><br/>Another example of regenerative agriculture is\u00a0multi-strata <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/causes-campaigns/agroforestry/what-is-agroforestry/\">agroforestry</url>. Farmers integrate large trees, such as macadamia or coconut, with a lower layer of crops, including corn and peas. This variety in production fosters ecological diversity and enables farmers to better navigate fluctuations in the food market.<br/><br/><br/>Planned <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/rotational-grazing\">rotational grazing</url> is also an effective way to improve soil health through livestock farming. In this method, cows or sheep are confined to designated paddocks within a more extensive pasture. After grazing on one patch of grass for a set period, they are moved to another nearby section.<br/><br/><br/>This method has several benefits, starting with healthier soils and lush grasses. The movement of the livestock ensures thorough fertilisation, and when the grazing periods are timed correctly, grasses can be left to regrow, drastically increasing growth rates.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it working?</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The benefits of regenerative farming are increasingly being documented. According to a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iucn.org/news/nature-based-solutions/202110/regenerative-agriculture-works-new-research-and-african-businesses-show-how\">\u00a0Regenerative Farming in Africa</url>\u00a0report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the UN, if regenerative farming was implemented in Africa, crop yields could rise 13% by 2040 and up to 40% in the future.<br/><br/><br/>The World Economic Forum estimates that if a fifth of farmers in the European Union adopted regenerative farming techniques, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture could be 6% lower a year by 2030.<br/><br/><br/>The Forum's 2022 report,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/transforming-food-systems-with-farmers-a-pathway-for-the-eu\">\u00a0Transforming Food Systems with Farmers: A Pathway for the EU</url>, also finds that improving soil health over an area equivalent to 14% of agricultural land across the 27-country grouping would improve farmers' incomes by between (EURO)1.9 and (EURO)9.3 billion annually.<br/><br/><br/>Nevertheless, switching to regenerative farming is more complicated than it sounds. As one analyst <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/06/transition-regenerative-agriculture-farming-practices/\">put</url> it, \"For growers in conventional farming communities, the transition is an obstacle course\".<br/><br/><br/>If a farmer chooses to cultivate cover crops, they will likely have many questions. What type of cover crop is best suited for their soil? What equipment is necessary? When and how should it be removed-should you spray it with pesticides, till it, or allow it to grow and then harvest it? How should you adjust fertiliser application for the primary crop? Will any of these factors affect their yields?<br/><br/><br/>There are also downsides to no-till farming that must be considered. First, the equipment required to maintain a no-till agricultural operation can be prohibitively expensive.<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, it takes years to reap the rewards of enhanced soil, such as greater crop yields. Most farmers might not have the luxury of being patient, especially given today's financial and yield pressures.<br/><br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture networks are growing globally.<br/><br/><br/>Regeneration International lists partners in Asia, Latin America, the United States, Canada, Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Still, despite this gain in momentum, the switch <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/06/transition-regenerative-agriculture-farming-practices/\">is not happening</url> as fast as needed, and conventional row-crop agriculture continues to dominate most of the world.<br/><br/><br/>Policies and incentives <url normalizedValue=\"https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Policy-report-EU-and-UK-AgriCaptureCO2-.pdf\">can</url> effectively guide the agriculture sector toward regenerative practices. Farmers transitioning to regenerative farming should receive financial support and a conducive environment. However, knowledge sharing is essential for the success of regenerative agriculture.<br/><br/><br/>Tom Pyfferoen <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/06/transition-regenerative-agriculture-farming-practices/\">has</url> been farming for five decades in Pine Island, Minnesota, and manages 1,200 acres. He was inspired by a regenerative agriculture farmer nearby and believes that a neighbour is best positioned to advise and convince surrounding farmers. He sometimes hosts field days to share insights, which attracts about 60 to 70 curious growers to his home.<br/><br/><br/>In 2022, Pyfferoen planted cover crops on as much of his land as possible, reducing tillage to about 5% of fields. He said he was not getting paid by any crop buyers to implement these practices but saw a clear value: \"I used to run about 166 pounds of nitrogen per acre. This year, I only needed 107 pounds. Yields continue to come up,\" he said.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/regenerative-agriculture-unleashing-soil-superpowers-reducing-ghgs-boosting-farm-revenue/\">Regenerative agriculture, unleashing soil superpowers, reducing GHGs, boosting farm revenue</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com\">Euractiv</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodnewsregenerativeagricultureunleashingsoilsuperpowersreducingghgsboostingfarmrevenue</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DM2-8MD1-JCMC-W306-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

As a result, farmers can practice agroforestry voluntarily but they do not receive any CAP subsidies for it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consequently, it has not been lucrative for farmers and foresters to rely on this combination form of land use.</p><p>However, the CAP reform currently under discussion will allow member states a certain degree of flexibility to make full direct payments on fields containing agroforestry.</p><p>According to the proposal, member states will have the leeway to ensure agricultural area under agroforestry is fully eligible when justified based on the local specificities (e.g. density/species/size of the trees and pedo-climatic conditions).</p><p>On Wednesday (13 January), a debate and a vote on a number of motions could make the formal recognition of agroforestry a reality in the German legal system, making it eligible for EU funding in the new reformed CAP framework.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/special_report/new-terminologies-in-sustainable-food-systems/\">New terminologies in sustainable food systems</url></h><p>The recent drive for sustainability has seen the emergence of a number of new terminologies, including agroecology, agroforestry and urban farming.</p><p>The adoption of these new notions into the sustainability discourse has been rapid and has sometimes made new concepts difficult ...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Incidental' climate protection</emphasis></p><p>\"There would be advantages to planting trees and other woods on agricultural land as well,\" said Christian B\u00f6hm, the chair of Soil Conservation and Recultivation at Brandenburg Technical University Cottbus-Senftenberg (BTU).</p><p>\"A great deal of CO2 can be stored in the above-ground and underground wood biomass.\"</p><p>Accordingly, agricultural land could more than ever also function as carbon sinks, and farms would have the opportunity to compensate for their emissions independently.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://agroforst-info.de/ergebnisse/\">study</url> by B\u00f6hm shows this potential. If half of Germany's arable land is used for agroforestry and, in turn, 10% of this area is used for the cultivation of agroforestry woody plants, the binding potential of the wood mass achieves a one-time emission binding of ten million tonnes of CO2 including its equivalents.</p><p>This corresponds to around 14% of annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (as of 2014).</p><p>However, the B\u00f6hm emphasised to EURACTIV Germany that the climate protection effects of agroforestry are almost \"incidental,\" because it offers numerous other advantages.</p><p>In addition to increased biodiversity and better soil and water protection, planting trees could also pay off economically. \"Agroforestry systems can make a very significant contribution to climate adaptation for sustainable agriculture.

It is no use, he says, if agroforestry systems are eligible for support on paper, but the framework conditions are so unfavourable that in practice no farm implements such measures.</p><p>Yet the demand for agroforestry systems has increased significantly as a result of the past three dry years: \"Many farms have livelihood problems and are now considering what they can do to better bridge future drought years.

Markets such as the EU are demanding more climate-related trade regulations, such as traceability and green certification, which many African farmers cannot provide, says Louis van Ravesteyn, head of agribusiness at Standard Bank in South Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The regulatory push, he says, 'will result in a new holistic approach to African agriculture.' The focus of financial institutions, he says, needs to be food security, which can be improved by encouraging practices such as crop diversification, inter-cropping, agroforestry and precision agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shorter-term weather patterns highlight the vulnerability of key food-growing areas on the continent. The World Meteorological Organization has said there is a 60% chance of La Ni\u00f1a conditions emerging towards the end of this year. La Ni\u00f1a involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures in parts of the Pacific Ocean and has a global impact on weather including an increased chance of drought in East Africa.</p><p>Madagascar needs '$20bn for climate adaptation and mitigation alone' says finance minister</p><p>The Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF) says that there is an increased likelihood of below-average rains in the fourth quarter across all of Somalia, eastern Kenya, and southern and southeastern Ethiopia, partly due to La Ni\u00f1a.</p><p>The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that 1.7 million people in arid and semi-arid Kenyan areas will face crises or worse levels of food insecurity between October 2024 and January 2025, compared to 1.5 million a year earlier.</p><p>Crop ceiling with heat absorption</p><p>Greenhouse technology is key to improving food security in countries vulnerable to climate change, says John Keppler, executive chairman of Iyris. The company's SecondSky cover, which is placed above crops, absorbs heat while letting light through. The result is an extension of the growing season and a reduction in energy and water consumption of around 30%.</p><p>The company was set up in 2018 at Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and in 2023 partnered with the Saudi Downtown Company, an urban development project owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.</p><p>Iyris, previously known as Red Sea, this year divested its farming activities in Saudi Arabia. That will allow the company to focus on its core business, Keppler says. The target is farm operations with low-to-medium levels of technology globally, with India and Brazil among the target markets. Iyris in September partnered with Egypt's Hyma Plastic as its manufacturing and distribution partner in the country.</p><p>Three African green-tech startups to watch</p><p>The technology doesn't require farmers to alter their existing planting behaviour or adopt new supply chains. Farmers need to 'touch and feel' innovations before they are convinced, Keppler says. 'Agriculture is a 'show me' story.'</p><p>The company is also present in Morocco and South Africa, and aims to expand its presence on the continent. Current growth is financed by working capital, but the company is likely to be in the market for larger fundraising over the next year, Keppler says. 'We have an asset-light expansion strategy.'</p><p>The solution provides a financial return within one crop cycle, with yields increasing by 20% to 30% after adoption, Keppler says, with strawberries, raspberries and tomatoes among the best performers. The aim is to give farmers 'all the tools to mitigate heat and reduce the resource intensity of agriculture'.</p><p>Flooded fields and methane</p><p>Israel-based companies are playing a leading part in developing precision agriculture solutions. An example is Netafim, which started in 1965 as a kibbutz, a communally organised agricultural settlement, in Israel's Negev desert. Netafim is now part of Orbia, which trades on the Mexican stock exchange.</p><p>Netafim CEO Gaby Miodownik estimates that about 75% of the irrigated fields in the world are flooded. Climate change, he argues, has rendered the practice obsolete. The method uses too much water, he says, and growing crops in flooded fields produces methane. Flooded-field rice cultivation alone accounts for about 10% of global methane emissions.</p><p>Opinon: Empowering agripreneurs is next stage in Africa's agribusiness revolution</p><p>Netafim's 'drip irrigation' system supplies water only to a crop's root areas, and can also be used for precision irrigation supply. The company said in a July submission to the US Department of Agriculture that drip irrigation has the highest water and nutrient use efficiency of all irrigation systems.</p><p>The use of herbicides and pesticides, the company says, are also reduced as water and nutrients are supplied directly to the root zone, giving weeds less chance to grow. Miodownik says that average water savings versus flooded cultivation are about 50%, with crop yields improved by 30% or more, and methane emissions eliminated. 'It's about growing more with less.'</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel from castor seeds</p><p>Africa has the opportunity to supply an answer to the world's need for sustainable aviation fuel, says Ofer Haviv, CEO of Nasdaq-listed Evogene. The Israel-based biotech focuses on agriculture and plant genomics. The company's Casterra business supplies castor seeds for uses such as biofuels and biopolymers.</p><p>Castor's status as a 'niche' crop historically meant a lack of scientific research interest, largely grown by small farmers with low yield performance, Haviv says. That castor can be used as aviation fuel, and can be grown in marginal and semi-arid soils, creates an opportunity for large-scale African cultivation, Haviv says. 'You won't compete with the food chain,' Haviv says. 'This is the direction the world should go in.'</p><p>Kenya oil refinery eyes biofuel production to revive KPRL</p><p>The EU in 2022 banned palm oil and soybean as a biofuel or biodiesel feedstock. Castor oil is renewable, biodegradable, has a low sulphur content and is considered by the EU as a green fuel. In October, Casterra announced the delivery of over 100 tonnes of castor seeds to an African customer. The seeds were cultivated in Kenya and processed at a production facility near Naivasha, which opened in August.</p><p>Haviv aims to develop more new castor plant varieties adapted to local conditions. He wants to expand Casterra's existing partnership with Italian oil major Eni SpA to grow castor for grain, which would then be crushed for oil. Eni is betting on biofuels as part of its strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>Gates doubles down on GMOs to fix African agriculture during Nigeria trip</p><p>Kenya and Brazil, Haviv says, are being evaluated as possible sites for the project. That would remove the need to ship the castor oil, and would open the door to cosmetic and medical applications as well as aviation fuel, he says.</p><p>A longer-term aim is for the company to become a supplier of castor-based oil, rather than just grain, with its own crushing factory. The main bottleneck, Haviv says, is growing enough castor. 'It's a huge opportunity for Africa.'</p><p>There's no other solution besides castor oil for the 'holy grail' of decarbonising aviation fuel, says Casterra CEO Yoash Zohar. Africa could also use castor oil to supply lubricants and varnishers. 'The demand is huge and will grow.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT0911202400002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCM-74X1-JCH9-G1D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 9, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It is the latest collection of seeds from the Africa that will safeguard against food insecurity, says the Crop Trust, an international non-profit dedicated to helping farmers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last century, more than 75% of crop diversity has been lost; a third of today's diversity could be gone by 2050, when the global population is estimated to reach nearly 10 billion people. Of the 30 deadliest weather events ever recorded in Africa, five occurred in 2022-2023, highlighting the need to conserve and use the seeds found in the world's gene banks, or seed storage facilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Climate change and conflict threaten infrastructure and impact food security for over 700 million people in more than 75 countries worldwide' says Stefan Schmitz, executive director of the Crop Trust.</p><p>That population growth is creating huge pressure on natural resources - creating a familiar tension between firewood and conservation on the continent.</p><p>Fruit trees are especially vulnerable says Alice Muchugi, team leader at the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry in Kenya. She recently went to Zimbabwe to check on a group of Obakakokeana trees, a premium fruit species that is sweet and tart, that the Center had been researching for two decades until it lost the funding to continue.</p><p>The trees had gone. With noone to protect them, they had been chopped down for firewood. 'The town has expanded, the demand for firewood is so much, and those were the only trees remaining in the neighbourhood ... 21 years of observation and evaluation, gone. Like that.'</p><p>Cold storage</p><p>It is hard to hold on to species when farmers are others are going through times of hardship, which is why seed banks and cold-storage units are vital. In Kenya, scientists and technicians are working together on a national level. At KALRO seed cold-storage facility and genetic research institute in Muguga South, 28km from Nairobi, in Kiambu County, work on seeds is being carried out in four departments: exploration and cultivation, seed technology, regermination, and information management and documentation.</p><p>The cold storage follows strict international guidelines, including ensuring the seeds have no moisture and are completely dry, weighing the seeds to ensure the seed packs are all of uniform weight, and hermetically sealing them into foil packs before they are labelled and stored.</p><p>'We have 2,000 plant species here, while Kenya has some 7,500 plant species, so we've covered only a third of what's out there,' says Peter Mbogo, who heads conservation and seed technology.</p><p>Smallholder farmers send in their seeds for storage and exchange. They are logged into and new and improved database that shows which seeds come from what farm. Technicians test the seeds and indicate the best ones for exchange, but most of the samples are put into the cold storage until needed.</p><p>The Crop Trust is providing financial and technical support to these and other countries to help them take the necessary steps to preserve their collections in the long-term, with support from Norway as part of the 'Biodiversity for Opportunities, Livelihoods, and Development' (BOLD) project.</p><p>Kenya 'battered' by climate change</p><p>There is an urgency in Kenya to speed up this process. A heating climate has created a series of devastating droughts and floods in the country, with loss of life and crops. While national-level seed conservation helps map out a path to long-term sustainability, there is also the urgency of meeting today's needs - working directly with farmers.</p><p>'We are realising we require diversity to impact production resilience in farming systems,' says Desterio Nyalongo, director of GeRRI (Genetic Resources Research Institute) for Kenya.</p><p>Instead of just sticking to maize and potatoes, farmers are being encouraged to grow drought-resistant crops like sorghum, pigeon peas, and finger millet, which has a high nutrient content.</p><p>GeRRI is now 'interacting with research cells and farmers directly, and farmers on their own beginning to select which seeds they think have the preferred attributes,' says Nyalongo, adding: 'We need to assist farmers and respond to that challenge.'</p><p>In Gilgil, 120km north of Nairobi, Seed Savers Network connects crop scientists with farmers, too. The group not only promotes smallholder farmers' rights, but also trains them to farm better, as well as instructing them in the storage and exchange of seeds.</p><p>There is a disconnect between what vegetables people will buy and eat and what crop varieties can be improved. Consumers, for example in Kenya, are discerning and want millet of a certain colour.</p><p>Farmers on the ground work with people like Wambui Wakahiu, programme officer for Seed Savers, which has some 86,000 farmers throughout the country in its network, translating into about 405,000 beneficiaries.</p><p>When The Africa Report visited the Seed Savers training centre in Gilgil, workers were loading a truck with seed for farmers in northern Turkana County, who had their whole season wiped out after major floods. The indigenous seeds they had saved were ruined, too.</p><p>'We asked the farmers what they would like to grow, after doing an assessment on what was needed and what does well in their soil, and are sending them seeds from our seed bank that they want and need,' says Wakahiu.</p><p>At the lush green Seed Savers compound, a group of farmers walk with their Seed Savers trainer around the compound, learning about the benefits of growing a variety of vegetables in innovative ways.</p><p>One of the more popular ways to grow vegetables is in a vertical garden, where smallholder farmers make circular tiers that reduce in size as the tower is created. With a combination of composted soil and porous material, such as twigs, farmers can grow twice as many vegetables in a smaller plot.</p><p>Grassroots seed savers</p><p>In rural Gilgil, people live among very rocky soil. Until recently, they thought that small-scale farming was impossible. But, as Beatrice Wangui proudly shows off her garden, where she has been growing vegetables and managing the local seed bank for the past eight years, she proves it is possible, even in the worst soil.</p><p>Eight years ago, she was despairing about the future for herself and her children, until she was shown how to grow vegetables with the help of Seed Savers.</p><p>'Before, we had nothing, because we believed we couldn't do anything with rocky land. But after being trained, I am the one who is selling vegetables. Nowadays, I have my own money,' Wangui tells The Africa Report.</p><p>There are other advantages, too, she says.</p><p>'It avoids conflict. When families have nothing, we have conflicts in the families and the communities. We don't have big shambas (farms), but we have more product. We do crop rotation, and we do indigenous vegetables, but also others that fall under market demand, which is why I'm planting spinach, spider plants, and nightshade,' she says, noting three major cash crops that she sells at market.</p><p>She also learned how to save seeds, and now she has a group of 27 female farmers who save seeds, which are stored in their community seed bank in her back yard.</p><p>They save seeds and they also save money, because the farmers can exchange seeds for free and do not have to buy imputs from farming shops.</p><p>'Those seeds (from shops) are mixed with stones and soil, and sometimes you get seeds that are dried with electricity, so they don't germinate well,' says Wangui.</p><p>'Seed banks are not museums. We'll take care of them for the future generation. And they'll take care of them for the next generation. If we don't do our part, it is us who will be broken,' she warns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT15112024000015002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DF2-DD81-F00C-62JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 15, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

EURACTIV France reports.</p><p>Lawson stressed that a key barrier for farmers is that they lack guarantees that planting trees on their land will not jeopardise direct payments from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), either now or in the future.</p><p>\"This is a real concern for farmers\" he emphasised, explaining that this stems from a limitation of tree density to 100 trees per hectare in the current CAP. This limit has has made farmers wary of establishing, promoting and using agroforestry practices.\u00a0</p><p>The limit was originally designed to guarantee agricultural production but it does not account for the fact that significant agricultural production can be obtained under and between trees.</p><p>However, Lawson explained that, according to a European Council <url normalizedValue=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0JkRsU2Mm9JvkpN1DWX2JZ-Cq79K6hO/view?userstoinvite=%22%22\">working paper</url>, in the new CAP, member states will have complete flexibility to make full direct payments on fields containing agroforestry, but that this flexibility has been poorly communicated with farmers.\u00a0</p><p>\"In the future, according to the proposal, member states would have the leeway to ensure agricultural area under agroforestry is fully eligible when justified based on the local specificities (e.g. density/species/size of the trees and pedo-climatic conditions) and the value added of the presence of trees to ensure sustainable agricultural use of the land,\" the paper reads.\u00a0</p><p>But this is something that has not yet been made explicit to farmers, according to Lawson.</p><p>\"This flexibility must be made clear to farmers and reassurance must be offered that planting trees on their land means farmers won't be financially penalised if you want to encourage farmers to engage in agroforestry,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Lawson also stressed that there were issues when it comes to proper monitoring of agroforestry in the EU.</p><p>Speaking of the Commission's <url normalizedValue=\"https://fastplatform.eu/\">farm sustainability tool</url> (FaST) that is currently in development, he highlighted that work must be done to ensure that the mapping tool includes the impact of farm-trees on nutrients and greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0</p><p>FaST is designed to become a world-leading platform to support sustainable and competitive agriculture based on space data.</p><p>\"None of the Horizon 2020 projects for FaST include trees in their work, which means that there is a huge research gap,\" Lawson said, adding that more work must be done to liaise with the EU research project to ensure that the benefits of agroforestry are properly accounted for.\u00a0</p><h><url

The fertile volcanic soils on the slopes of Mount Kenya provide an ideal environment. Most of Kenya's macadamia trees grow around this peak, which stands at 5,199 meters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pamoja, headquartered in Geneva, sources its nuts from this region, about 150 kilometers from Nairobi. 'We buy from around 7,000 small farmers, 5,000 of whom are certified organic,' says CEO Guillaume Maillard. Once harvested, the nuts are taken to the TenSenses factory in the outskirts of Nairobi.</p><p>Kenya, third-largest macadamia producer</p><p>In the factory, located in one of Kenya's export processing zones, about 50 employees work patiently. The nuts are washed and dried first, a process that takes 10 to 15 days, explains Hillary Rotich, the factory's quality director. The drying process, though energy-intensive, is necessary to avoid manual drying times that could take months.</p><p>The nuts are then shelled and sorted by quality and size. 'Some are damaged by insects, others are moldy or unripe,' Rotich says. 'We help farmers improve nut quality, advising them on using organic pesticides.' Currently, about 30% of the production is discarded.</p><p>At the end of the process, the nuts are vacuum-packed in 11.34-kilo bags, ready for export. 'We export about two-thirds of our production to the US and one-third to Europe,' Maillard says. Depending on the harvest quality, TenSenses exports between 400 and 500 tons of organic macadamia nuts annually. Kenya has become the third-largest producer of this expensive nut in the past decade, after South Africa and Australia.</p><p>'In those two countries, production is intensive and relies on pesticides, unlike Kenya, where macadamia is one of several crops grown by farmers, who often also cultivate maize or mangoes.'</p><p>With the global market estimated at pound 1.5bn in 2024 and expected to reach pound 2.5bn by the decade's end, Kenya now has 200,000 farms producing 30,000 to 40,000 tons of raw macadamia nuts annually, about 15 to 20% of global production.</p><p>How Pamoja came to be</p><p>In Kenya, the sector is led by the giant Kenya Nut, which also sells cashews, peanuts, beef, and wine under brands like Out of Africa and Nutfields. 'But we're not really competitors; we're in the niche market of organic macadamia,' says Maillard.</p><p>Limbua leads this segment. Founded in 2009 by German Matti Spiecker and Kenyan Peter Wangara, Limbua operates three factories and has diversified into avocado oil and dried mangoes.</p><p>Pamoja, meaning 'together' in Kiswahili, was established in 2019. The company began from a meeting between a finance expert in mergers and acquisitions and an English farmer. Maillard, who had worked with Lazard, Arthur Andersen, and Edmond de Rothschild, helped set it up.</p><p>They then led Moringa, a pound 100m investment fund focused on agroforestry in Latin America and Africa. During a mission in Tanzania, he met James Powell, a coffee and macadamia nut farmer near Kilimanjaro. Together, they founded Pamoja, initially in Tanzania through the Macjaro subsidiary.</p><p>New factory in Tanzania</p><p>Maillard uses his experience from Moringa to grow Pamoja. 'I didn't have to look far for development concepts,' he says. 'We often rely on well-managed farms to aggregate farmers and their production. This aggregation allows us to access the market. Our role is to connect with clients and ensure product quality through certifications.'</p><p>In 2022, Pamoja acquired TenSenses in Kenya. 'We are still in external and internal growth phases,' says Maillard, aiming for a pound 5m turnover this year. In February, Pamoja raised $8.5m in debt from Mirova. The goal is to plant over 700 hectares of coffee and macadamia in the coming years.</p><p>'Around Mount Kilimanjaro, we want to develop a model similar to TenSenses at Mount Kenya, buying from thousands of small farmers,' Maillard details. 'We also want to diversify beyond macadamia. Eventually, we will build a processing factory in Tanzania.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT2406202400010007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBB-61Y1-F00C-60XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 24, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

While healthtech was already attracting interest, climate tech and edtech have now joined the list. In this selection, we can see the new missions of the major funders who supply venture capitalists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These financial institutions are now committed to preparing the continent to withstand or cope with the consequences of ongoing climate change.</p><p>Waspito, bringing hospitals closer to patients (Cameroon)</p><p>This young Cameroonian startup, which connects patients and doctors wherever they are, is the star of African healthtech fundraising. Since 2022, Waspito has raised $5m to finance its expansion on the continent. Waspito won a prize at the 2023 AfricaTech Awards, an initiative of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) - the World Bank's private sector arm.</p><p>The company has operations in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and soon Senegal. Launched in 2020, Jean Lobe Lobe's start-up includes - in addition to the IFC - the investment fund Launch Africa Ventures and Orange Ventures.</p><p>A former employee of British American Tobacco, Jean Lobe Lobe is no amateur, having launched Heptic Holdings in 2016, which closes its doors in January 2020. Waspito, which already counts more than 1,000 doctors among its users, now hopes to break into the North African market.</p><p>In 2023, Jean Lobe Lobe told us that he was in contact with the Egyptian health ministry to discuss the deployment of his healthtech.</p><p>Sand To Green, bringing soil back to life (Morocco)</p><p>Benjamin Rombaut, Gautier de Carcou\u00ebt and Wissal Ben Moussa are committed to transforming the desert into plant-covered plains with fruit trees and aromatic herbs. Graduates of the I\u00e9seg management school, Sciences Po Lille, the Hassan II agronomic and veterinary institute and AgroParisTech, these young entrepreneurs have come together around an ambitious project: Sand to Green.</p><p>The startup wants to convert the arid lands of the Sahara into abundant orchards in order to combat deforestation and desertification. To achieve this, the Franco-Moroccan startup is using cutting-edge technologies and drawing inspiration from oasis agroforestry techniques to implement regenerative agriculture, making lifeless soils fertile and creating new carbon sinks.</p><p>After a few years' trial on a five-hectare area in southern Morocco and raising $1m in funds, the team, which uses solar energy to desalinate seawater and irrigate the land, is preparing to extend the project across the kingdom before exporting to Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, and Egypt. The goal? Green 10,000 hectares of desert by 2030 through sustainable agriculture.</p><p>Zuri Health, medical appointments in 19 countries (Kenya)</p><p>Kenyan e-health startup Zuri Health is gearing up for an aggressive expansion that should see it double its market reach to 19 countries by 2024. 'According to our financial statement for last year, we have more or less broken even,' Ikechukwu Anoke tells The Africa Report.</p><p>The startup's CEO and founder says that a revenue base of more than $4m has been generated since the company was founded in 2020. 'This year, we plan to consolidate our revenues to make them more stable and predictable. We hope to double our profitability margin by the end of 2025,' he says.</p><p>Founded in 2021, the startup provides affordable healthcare through mobile SMS, WhatsApp and a dedicated app, Zuri. It currently has more than one million SMS subscribers, around 400 doctors and 3,000 patients in the continuing care programme designed for people with chronic diseases.</p><p>In 2022, the company raised $1.3m in pre-seed funding to expand its market reach and product portfolio. The proposed product is ZuriCare, a digital ambulatory service designed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which has already attracted 80 companies.</p><p>Already present in nine African countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Senegal, Burundi, and Zambia, Zuri Health is now targeting C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Mozambique and Angola. To achieve this, the company will be seeking to raise new capital before the end of the year, says its founder.</p><p>Foondamate, engaging with students to help them succeed (South Africa)</p><p>FoondaMate, an education technology company founded in South Africa in August 2020, has become the go-to learning platform for many students in the country and in Nigeria, where it launched in October 2022.</p><p>It was born out of the determination of two South Africans, Dacod Magagula and Tao Boyle, to give students easy access to previous course assignments. They have created a conversational robot powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning that helps students access study material quickly, easily and securely via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p><p>The number of users on their platform has grown from 40,000 in September 2020 to over 3 million today, according to its website.</p><p>The company closed a $2m seed round in May 2022, attracting eight investors including Nigerian LoftyInc Capital and, in a personal capacity, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, ex-founder of Flutterwave and Andela.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT17052024000010002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C27-95G1-JCH9-G3CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 17, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The correction experienced by the global tech market since the start of 2021 and in the African market since the fourth quarter of that year has dampened transactions, and scared off international investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But this also had the bonus of deflating a potential speculative bubble before it could burst in the faces of the continent's venture capitalists and project developers.</p><p>So it's not all bad news. This has allowed African startups and their investors to return to more realistic prospects: seeking profitability while maintaining healthy, if no longer exponential, growth.</p><p>The main finding of this second edition of our survey, submitted to 49 venture-capital funds on the startups they believe will be making news in the future, is the attention paid to a company's ability to reach new customers through geographical expansion or diversification of its offering.</p><p>In this healthier environment focused on conquering new markets, the entry price is also lower, paving the way for new investment players, most of them African.</p><p>Above all, 'the number of local investors with capital to invest in Africa has not fallen,' as Tidjane Deme, a partner at Partech Africa, points out. 'They are going to deploy it differently because everyone has become more demanding about the economic fundamentals of the companies analysed,' explains this fervent defender of tech in the Francophone Africa arena.</p><p>Rise of Francophone startups</p><p>While the 2023 version of our list included just one Francophone Africa startup (Djamo from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), this year our list consists of five founders from the Francophone countries, one of whom - Guy Futi, co-founder of Orda Africa, who was born in the DRC - is active in Nigeria and has already raised $4.5m.</p><p>Whether in West, North or Central Africa, the continent's Francophone contingent is not a poor relation. In fact, Africa owes the biggest exit in its history to a Tunisian startup, Instadeep, which was bought out in early 2023 by the BiotNTech laboratory for more than $400m.</p><p>Cleantech in the mix</p><p>Another absence from last year's list that has been rectified this year is a startup working on solutions to climate change. Moroccan company Sand to Green is developing technology to enable agroforestry farms to be set up in arid environments. Founded in 2022 by agricultural engineer Wissal Ben Moussa and two French partners, Benjamin Rombault and Gautier de Carcou\u00ebt, the company earns its income from farm production, carbon credits and the sale of biodiesel.</p><p>The cleantech sector is a new priority for investors, responding to the agenda of major donors. In this quest for business models that serve the public interest, which we have grouped under the heading 'Social Tech', the health sphere is attracting investor attention, with two startups in this sector - Waspito and Zuri Health - appearing on our list.</p><p>B2B services, stalwarts and a rising star</p><p>In terms of other sectors, the balance is the same. Fintech accounts for more than a quarter of our 2024 champions, while the other half are models that streamline commercial exchanges, such as e-commerce and transport logistics firms.</p><p>It is worth noting that business solutions are on a roll this year. From Lengo.ai, which is developing stock management software using voice assistants for small retailers, to Orda Africa and Chowdeck, both of which are aimed at small restaurants, many B2B models demonstrate the prospects for profitability and growth.</p><p>An autonomous ecosystem?</p><p>This ecosystem, distributed between the continent's four major markets (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Egypt) and Francophone Africa, is also nourishing itself. Senegal's Lengo.ai, for example, uses the services of its compatriot Socium, which is also in our top 10, for its recruitment process. Others have 'big sisters' among their customers - StartButton in Nigeria, for example, counts Cellulant and Paystack in its portfolio.</p><p>Finally, as we also noted last year, many of these startups are founded by former employees of big names in African tech. Among them is Olufemi Olanipekun, former product manager at Flutterwave, who founded VeendHQ. In Nairobi, Tatenda Furusa, a former manager at Cellulant, founded Imalipay. Mahmoud El Sharkawy, formerly of Swvl, co-founded Kenzz in Egypt.</p><p>This demonstrates the diversity and dynamism of a continent which, despite global sluggishness in venture capital, is the region that has seen the smallest decline in both deal volume and value.</p><p>Our methodology</p><p>Unlike the usual startup rankings, our survey is not based on the amount of funds raised, but solely on qualitative criteria. During the first three months of 2023, we submitted a detailed questionnaire to the 49 most active investors on the continent (in terms of number of transactions) to determine which African startups are destined to be the stars of tomorrow. Almost half responded, providing us with the names of around 50 startups that met our criteria, whether they were part of their portfolio, or not.</p><p>These companies had to have been founded after 1 January 2020 and could not have gone beyond the Series A phase, which often corresponds to a mature business model, and had to be considered 'the most promising' from a given pool by their team of investors. Based on their sector, their business model, their connection with the rest of the digital value chain, and their capacity to genuinely transform certain aspects of the real economy, we have tried to extract the quintessence of these companies to draw up the list we present to you: The 20 Future Champions of African Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT1605202400010010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C21-GSF1-JCH9-G0W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 16, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Still, they have no interest in conducting due diligence on whether the timber is sourced through the right procedures.</p><p>'Once the supplier delivers to our stores, and we see it's timber, we count the number of pieces and pay the supplier,' says Ngabwah.</p><p>Uganda prisons contract suppliers who deliver mahogany to their storeroom. Their suppliers have trading permits allowing them to transport timber,?but prison authorities do not check the permits, saying that the wood has already been checked many times along the road at security checkpoints.</p><p>'As long as timber comes and reaches our stores, that is all [we care about],' he says.</p><p>No paper trail</p><p>Leading furniture companies in Kampala also rely on mahogany that is smuggled outright from the DRC or transported with fake documents or no documents, as this four-part investigation details.</p><p>There is little attention on how the timber is sourced among end users. And those who claim to care, have no evidence that the timber has passed through legal channels.</p><p>Once timber arrives at the markets in Kampala and furniture workshops, it is no longer illegal, due to loopholes in the law, according to Professor Abwoli Banana of Makerere University. Indeed, no one wants to inspect it.</p><p>The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) says it can only enter company premises if it has adequate information of wrongdoing.</p><p>Bob Kazungu, Uganda's acting assistant commissioner for forestry at the Ministry for Water and Environment, argues it is counterproductive to inspect furniture companies and timber dealers to check their documents.</p><p>'You can never get good results as [law] enforcement agencies by raiding these places because ... they will provide you with forged documents, and you will go to court and spend all your time arguing,' he says.</p><p>Hardwood, Uganda furniture favourite</p><p>Despite saying that they try as much as possible to ensure that they deal with legitimate timber suppliers, Gideon Mayanja, factory manager at Erimu Company Limited, which has operated for 25 years in Uganda, says there are certain things they cannot confirm.</p><p>'We can't ensure that a [supplier] has paid tax fully,' he says. 'That is not easy to tell.' Paying tax is a prerequisite for importing timber into the country.</p><p>Mayanja says they encourage timber suppliers to 'use the right procedures' when sourcing wood from the DRC.</p><p>Master Wood Investments, a company that has produced furniture for more than three decades, largely relies on hardwood.</p><p>'I have never asked about this,' production manager Jean Mary Munabi says when asked if they require suppliers to produce documents of the timber's source.</p><p>When a supplier delivers timber, 'we check whether the measurements are okay and the quality. We offload and put it in our stores', he says.</p><p>To protect Uganda's environment and to avoid any issues with the government, Abraham Opio, furniture production manager at Nile House, a large Ugandan furniture manufacturer, says they rely on imported timber from the DRC and South Sudan.</p><p>He says the company has put in place stringent measures requiring all their suppliers to produce documents from the URA confirming that the timber is imported legally, as well as forestry documents from the countries where it's imported from confirming that the wood was legally harvested.</p><p>The market wants mahogany, and Congo timber is of the highest quality, according to Footsteps Furniture marketing executive Frank Nsubuga, who serves high-profile and government customers.</p><p>'We ensure that suppliers have lumbering permits,' he says, adding that through checks, the company ensures that they don't buy endangered species and also undergo due diligence.</p><p>Museveni, cheerleader of 'Ugandan' furniture</p><p>Uganda banned logging indigenous species from its forests since the 1990s and the ban has never been lifted, leading its furniture industries to rely on hardwood from Congo.?Uganda views DRC forests as a source of wood, while revenue generated from taxes on imported wood and its ecosystem plays a vital role in the country's rainfall patterns.</p><p>While Uganda pays lip service to protecting the Congo Basin, the reality is much more apparent.</p><p>Vice President Jessica Alupo represented Museveni at the three-basin summit - Amazon, the DRC and Borneo Mekong Southeast Asia - in Congo Brazzaville in October 2023.</p><p>Her impassioned speech on climate change and Uganda's affiliation with the Congo Basin contrasts with President Museveni's actions.</p><p>Museveni has created a sustained drive to promote the local furniture industry over the past eight years. In 2016, he commended Uganda prisons for making top-quality furniture and promised to issue a directive ensuring 'government departments, even State House [president's residence] ... to buy furniture from prisons'.</p><p>The president provided the prisons with financial support to buy new machines and revamp furniture workshops to prepare for the anticipated market boom, head of Uganda prisons Johnson Byabashaija said in an interview with a local publication in 2019.</p><p>'The president has given us some capital and directed us to produce furniture for the ministries,' Byabashaija said. 'The furniture you see in parliament was made by the Uganda Prisons Service. Most of the furniture in the president's office is made by the prison. Those big maroon chairs you see during important ceremonies, are made by Uganda Prisons Service.'</p><p>The president's 1 July 2019 directive, issued by the then-permanent secretary for the ministry of finance, called on 'accounting officers, heads of state enterprises, public corporations and heads of state parastatals to procure all their furniture requirements from national and or resident providers engaged in [the] manufacturing process'.</p><p>Ngabwah has pinned the letter to a bulletin board in his office. And orders for furniture from government agencies have been flowing in.</p><p>'For the office of the president, I have delivered an order worth about USh50m [roughly $13,000]. I have delivered an order from the parliament of Uganda. We have an order from the National Drug Authority of about USh23m [roughly $6,000] and more,' says Ngabwah.</p><p>The numbers don't add up</p><p>Although there is plenty of Congolese timber in Kampala, data on Uganda's official timber imports from the country are scanty and unreliable given the under-declaration of what is officially imported by dealers.</p><p>According to UN Comtrade, a global trading platform, 88,847 tonnes of mahogany worth $3.2m entered the country in 2020 and 2021. There was no data for 2022. According to the statistics, no other species were imported besides African mahogany.</p><p>The URA provided data for a slightly different period: 2,561 entries of mahogany from the DRC were recorded between July 2019 and June 2022, worth USh8.9bn (about $2.3m). Its quantity is hard to compute because kilograms and cubic metres are mixed in the entries. Additionally, there is no quantity for 89 of the entries. The URA describes this as human error.</p><p>At the time of the interview with The Africa Report, Erimu bought each piece of timber for USh200,000 (roughly $52 for one piece), although the prices fluctuate.</p><p>This means that the company spends about $460,000 on timber a year; 95% of it being spent on Congolese timber.</p><p>Erimu's Mayanja says that the company utilises at least 14 trucks of timber yearly at a minimum guess. But the number can increase to 20 trucks depending on furniture demand. A truck normally delivers 600-700 pieces of timber.</p><p>Ngabwah said that from May 2022 to November 2023 the prison had spent USh2bn on timber, which comes to about $530,000 if you factor in the exchange rate.</p><p>'I would say mahogany makes up 80%,' he says, referring to the prison wood order. That would mean that around $420,000 was spent on purchasing Congolese timber.</p><p>At Nile House, Opio said they use not less than 3,000 pieces of mahogany per year, which translates to $156,000, basing the price on the same 2023 benchmark.

Moreover, Planes is getting yields equivalent to before, and the reduction in insecticides - his biggest expense - has slashed his costs.</p><p>The farmer also realised that the reduction in insecticides increased the presence of beneficial insects the following year.</p><p>However, this approach requires a thorough knowledge of pests and beneficial organisms, as well as meticulous monitoring of the plot.\u00a0 According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqWMYuOdnjU\">the Aude Chamber of Agriculture</url>, farmers and technicians are not sufficiently trained to recognise species and identify biological cycles.</p><p>In a 2021 <url normalizedValue=\"https://agriculture.gouv.fr/foire-aux-questions-tout-savoir-sur-le-biocontrole#:~:text=Les%20solutions%20de%20biocontr%C3%B4le%20repr%C3%A9sentent,contre%2012%20%25%20en%202020).\">survey</url>, 69% of farmers said they use biocontrol solutions, such as insects, viruses, bacteria, and mites, across all crops and production methods.

Some schemes, such as planting strips of wildflowers, were implemented on less than 1% of the number of hectares initially planned for, while agroforestry was only implemented on a total of 50 hectares across all of Germany.</p><p>\"I am not participating in any eco-scheme,\" Ottmar Ilchmann, a dairy and arable farmer in Northern Germany, told EURACTIV.</p><p>After going through the catalogue of eco-schemes, the farmer concluded that entry barriers for those measures applicable to his grassland-heavy farm were too high for a small business.</p><p>Even for permanent pasture, one of the eco-schemes most widely taken up in Germany, collecting the necessary proof to be submitted with the CAP funds application is costly and time-consuming, and the financial reward is insufficient to justify the extra investment, Ilchmann explained.</p><p>Especially for small farms, this means that the financial risk taken outweighs the potential reward, he added. \"For me, many eco-schemes are not worth it because the risk of making a mistake [and thus not receiving the premium] is too high,\" he said.</p><p>For the farmer, who thinks the CAP should move towards rewarding public services, the poor uptake and far-ranging criticism of the eco-schemes is bad news, not only for his own farm.</p><p>\"If the situation is not remedied quickly and effectively, advocates of unconditional area-based payments will feel reassured in their position,\" he warned.

Cover crops are beneficial against erosion, they contribute to biodiversity and carbon storage. It is a voluntary solution for producers of olives, fruits or vineyards.</p><p>Cover crops are one of the nature-based solutions (NBS) within the eco-schemes of the Spanish\u00a0 CAP National Strategic Plan, with a budget of (EURO)307 million.\u00a0</p><p>Gilabert farms organically and uses integrated pest management (IPM), and he is also active in an association of farmers involved in promoting IPM, which also support cover crops as a solution to the degradation of soil caused by herbicide and other synthetic plant protection products.</p><p>In his opinion, cover crops are profitable because farmers save pesticides, which will benefit all long-term.</p><p>However, the implementation of cover crops is raising concerns in Spain in the context of the country's struggle against drought. According to the agronomist Manuel Candelas, cover crops \"compete\" with agricultural crops for water in dry areas, jeopardising production.</p><p>There are also questions about the practice's profitability, which requires specialised machines. Farmers have asked for flexibility and more help in implementing this eco-scheme.</p><p>At least around 80% of the agricultural area with applications for CAP direct payments in Spain includes eco-schemes.

Its main goal is to give back space to the community and neighbourhoods. </p><p>\"Citizens take care of the fields and harvest fruits and vegetables from them,\" di Donna explains.\u00a0</p><p>Since its inception in 2019, with a mere 10 hectares of abandoned land in Vettabbia Park, south of Milan, Soul Food Forest Farms has grown considerably. It now has an area of nearly 20 hectares, with more than 2,500 trees.</p><p>A separate project known as 'POEMA' (Ornithological and Entomological Agroforestry Monitoring Project) has been monitoring the Soul Food hub's butterfly, dragonfly, and bird populations for four years, highlighting the differences in coexistence compared to conventional agricultural areas. </p><p>The University of Milan has partnered with the project to evaluate, with an interdisciplinary approach, contributions to communities and volunteers. \"Facilitating the emergence of more complex and biodiverse agroecosystems is a guiding strategy for us to regenerate the margins of the city,\" concluded Di Donna.

Neighbouring farms may grow conventional crops, and when they use chemical fertilisers and pesticides there, it will affect your organic production as well,\" Petrov said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Stoilko Apostolov from the Bioselena Foundation for Biological Agriculture pointed out that the largest number of areas in Bulgaria will be registered under the eco-scheme for diversifying cultivated crops - a scheme which Bulgarian farmers are familiar with and, for this reason, consider easy to implement.</p><p>However, the eco-scheme for organic farming is considered the most difficult one to implement due to strict controls and the requirement to have an organic production certificate for animals and plots, despite having the highest climate and soil protection impact.

While they offer an opportunity for farmers to adopt more sustainable practices, the challenges of complexity, bureaucracy, and insufficient compensation have hindered a widespread uptake.</p><p>To receive the 'basic' eco-payment, Czech farmers must fulfil several measures, such as leaving un-mown areas, crop diversification, or allocating a buffer zone along the watercourse. There is also an option to receive a 'premium' eco-payment for farmers keeping a larger share of areas unused for production.</p><p>As EURACTIV.cz learnt, 22,092 applications were submitted this year for the basic eco-payment and 50 for premium eco-payment. In total, around 30,000 Czech farmers applied for direct payments.</p><p>Regarding particular eco-scheme measures, only limited ones are applied in practice. According to Jan Stefl, vice-president of the Czech Association of private farming, most farmers opted for fallow lands and substituted some with protein crops, taking advantage of the EU's temporary derogation.</p><p>One of the main obstacles farmers face is the insufficient financial motivation to implement other eco-schemes measures which would benefit nature - for example, landscape features, such as copses. </p><p>Czech farmers argue that low subsidy rates for establishing and maintaining such elements discourage their expansion. Moreover, the complexity and bureaucratic nature of the eco-scheme rules have deterred many farmers from participating fully.</p><p>\"Good intentions have been devalued by imperfect implementation,\" Vladim\u00edr P\u00edcha from the Agricultural Association of the Czech Republic told EURACTIV.cz. He emphasised that rules for eco-schemes subsidies are too detailed and complicated, making them difficult to follow.</p><p>Czech organic farmers are also sceptical. Katerina Urb\u00e1nkov\u00e1, manager of the PRO-BIO association of organic farmers, see it as the EU's \"failed attempt\". </p><p>She stressed that in the Czech case, eco-schemes are \"a kind of superstructure over the GAEC (Good Agricultural Environmental Conditions)\", and it brings \"many problems for practice, often without any real environmental benefit\".</p><p>Despite these problems, some farmers - particularly those from small and middle range - are applying eco-friendly measures - however not motivated by the new eco-schemes.

RIG was 0.1%, strengthening in the second quarter to 2.2%, with broad-based improvement across geographies and categories. Pricing was 2.0%, decelerating to 0.6% in the second quarter, largely reflecting a high base of comparison in 2023 and increased growth investments.

In emerging markets, organic growth was 3.7%, driven by pricing and close to flat RIG.</p><p>By product category:</p><p>Coffee was the largest organic growth contributor with mid single-digit growth, supported by our three leading global coffee brands Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and Starbucks.PetCare delivered mid single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for science-based premium brands,\u202fPurina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and Purina ONE.Sales in confectionery grew at a high single-digit rate, led by\u202fKitKat and key local brands.Water delivered mid single-digit growth, underpinned by continued momentum for\u202fS.Pellegrino and a rebound in\u202fPerrier.Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, based on continued momentum for\u202fNAN, Lactogen and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) products.Growth in Nestl\u00e9 Health Science turned positive, with sales improvements across most segments in the second quarter.

E-commerce sales grew by 10.6%, reaching 18.2% of total Group sales. Organic growth of out-of-home channels was 3.8%.</p><p>Net divestitures impacted sales by -0.4%, largely related to the creation of a joint venture with PAI Partners for Nestl\u00e9's frozen pizza business in Europe. The impact on sales from foreign exchange was negative at -4.4%. Total reported sales decreased by -2.7% to CHF 45.0 billion.</p><p>Underlying Trading Operating Profit</p><p>Underlying trading operating profit decreased by -0.8% to CHF 7.8 billion. The underlying trading operating profit margin increased to 17.4%, an improvement of 30 basis points on a reported basis and 40 basis points in constant currency.</p><p>Gross profit margin increased by 160 basis points to 47.2%, driven by pricing, lower input costs and portfolio optimization.</p><p>Distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 10 basis points to 8.5%, mainly as a result of lower freight and energy costs.</p><p>Marketing and administration as a percentage of sales increased by 130 basis points to 19.9%.

As a result, trading operating profit increased by 0.6% to CHF\u202f7.4 billion. The trading operating profit margin increased to 16.4%, an improvement of 50 basis points on a reported basis and 60 basis points in constant currency.</p><p>Net Financial Expenses and Income Tax</p><p>Net financial expenses increased from CHF 697 million to CHF 744 million, following a higher level of average net debt. The average cost of net debt was 2.6%, unchanged versus in the first half of 2023.</p><p>The Group reported tax rate increased by 170 basis points to 25.0%. The underlying tax rate increased by 150 basis points to 22.1%, mainly due to increased tax rates in some geographies related to the implementation of OECD Pillar Two.</p><p>Net Profit and Earnings Per Share</p><p>Net profit was flat at CHF 5.6 billion.

As a result, earnings per share increased by 1.8% to CHF 2.16 on a reported basis.</p><p>In constant currency, underlying earnings per share increased by 3.3% to CHF 2.51. The increase was mainly the result of positive organic growth and improved underlying trading operating profit margin. On a reported basis, underlying earnings per share decreased by -1.0% to CHF 2.40, largely due to the impact of exchange rates. Nestl\u00e9's share buyback program contributed 1.0% to the underlying earnings per share increase, net of finance costs.</p><p>Cash Flow</p><p>Cash generated from operations increased to CHF 8.1 billion from CHF 7.1 billion. The step up was mainly due to a positive contribution from working capital movements. Free cash flow increased to CHF 4.0 billion from CHF 3.4 billion. Excluding the CHF 0.6 billion proceeds from the disposal of the Prometheus Biosciences stake in the first half of 2023, the increase in free cash flow was CHF 1.2 billion.</p><p>Share Buyback Program</p><p>In the first half, the Group repurchased CHF 2.4 billion of Nestl\u00e9 shares as part of the three-year CHF 20 billion share buyback program, which began in January 2022.</p><p>Net Debt</p><p>Net debt increased to CHF 59.5 billion as at June 30, 2024, compared to CHF 49.6 billion as at December 31, 2023.

Reported sales in Zone North America decreased by -2.5% to CHF\u202f12.2 billion. The Zone drove market share gains in pet food and coffee, with losses in frozen pizza and coffee creamers.</p><p>By product category, Purina PetCare was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth, led by Purina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and Dog Chow.

In the second quarter, sales of Coffee mate turned slightly positive. Infant Nutrition saw a sales decrease, with robust growth for Nido growing up milks more than offset by a category slowdown, which impacted Gerber baby food. Growth in frozen food was negative as the category remains under pressure, reflecting soft consumer demand and continued price competition. The business delivered improved trends in the second quarter for all segments through sharpened price points and affordable innovations such as DiGiorno Classic Crust.</p><p>The Zone's underlying trading operating profit margin increased by 20 basis points, following gross profit margin improvement and lower distribution costs.

In the first 18 months of the program's test at scale, cocoa yields of participating farmers increased by 32% after adopting the high-quality pruning practices learned through the program. Their household income also rose by 38%. This is according to a report published by the KIT Institute, an independent center of expertise and education for sustainable development.</p><p>The KIT study, which was based on a sample of 1 500 income accelerator households, found that participating households had a higher rate of school enrollments than non-participating households. It confirmed that the program is helping to effectively mitigate diseases and pests on farms, facilitating income diversification, promoting financial access and empowering women.</p><p>The goal of Nestl\u00e9's income accelerator is to help close the living income gap of cocoa-farming families and to reduce the risk of child labor. The program rewards participating households for enrolling children in school; implementing good agricultural practices, like pruning; taking up regenerative agriculture activities, such as agroforestry; and diversifying their household income.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 introduced the first-ever KitKat bars made with cocoa grown by income accelerator farming families earlier this year. These KitKat bars aim to raise consumers' awareness about the sustainability of the cocoa used in the iconic bars and build consumer trust, as they showcase the traceability of Nestl\u00e9's cocoa. Consumer research shows that these efforts can help build brand loyalty and engagement<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's income accelerator has so far supported more than 10 000 families in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. It is expanding to Ghana in 2024 to include a total of 30 000 families. By 2030, the program aims to reach an estimated 160 000 cocoa-farming families in Nestl\u00e9's cocoa supply chain.\u202f</p><p><sup>1</sup>Nestl\u00e9 Sustainability Pillars Research</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Full-year 2024 outlook updated</emphasis>: we expect organic sales growth of at least 3%.

One of the 14 ecosystems identified by the Commission is agri-food. Here, primary food processing sectors play a crucial role.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Who are we?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Continuous commodities processing: a staple of the EU's food security</emphasis></p><p>Our industries are an essential link in the EU's agri-food chain, connecting farmers to markets and consumers. We contribute to European food security and sovereignty by turning agricultural crops into food products and ingredients consumed by millions of EU citizens every day.</p><p>Many of the foods we make have long been staples of European diets, such as wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil, plant-based proteins, starches, and cocoa. But European primary food processors are also at the forefront of innovation: while the overall majority of our ingredients are used in food and drink, decades of research and development have helped us find increasingly innovative outlets to ensure nothing goes to waste.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A circular industry</emphasis></p><p>Primary food processors use all of the agricultural raw materials processed to deliver a broad range of products: food and animal feed, but also biofuels, bioplastics, cardboard, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. We play a central role in the EU's thriving bioeconomy.</p><p>Some primary food processing industries also extract fibres and plant-based proteins during their production process. These help make the diets of EU citizens more sustainable, healthier and more diverse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">High energy requirements</emphasis></p><p>Reducing emissions remains among the foremost priorities of primary food processing industries across Europe. We are working hard to reduce our environmental footprint by making industrial processes more energy efficient and the energy that we do use renewable.</p><p>Our sectors also look after the planet by fostering biodiversity and using techniques like responsible soil management and agroforestry practices. We continue to work with the European institutions to meet the EU's ambitious environmental goals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What do we need?</emphasis></p><p>We cannot get it done alone. Our industries are facing considerable challenges in terms of sustainable competitiveness: energy costs have increased in no relation to other producing regions of the world. The same goes for the cost of carbon - all of this while necessary investments to reduce carbon costs have risen due to higher prices for crucial construction materials such as steel. The price of agricultural raw materials has also spiked, driven by a steep increase in fertiliser prices.</p><p>So, what do our industries need from policymakers? Investments in grid infrastructure and renewable energy capacity are required to facilitate process electrification and help our sectors decarbonise. We also need support for the use of own biomass streams as a source of renewable energy generation. Legislation on carbon removals should incentivise the installation of carbon capture and storage in conjunction with bioenergy generated from agricultural residues.</p><p>Our farmers need affordable and effective alternatives to be able to comply with revised legislation on the use of plant protection products. And they need tools to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of a changing climate, such as New Genomic Techniques (NGTs). NGTs will enhance security of supply in the EU and allow our industries to remain competitive.</p><p>Finally, increasing sustainability requires investment. EU manufacturers and farmers should be compensated for their efforts to produce in environmentally and socially sustainable ways to avoid local industry being displaced by imported products that are not produced at the same standards.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pfp-eu.org/\">Get in touch with us</url> to discuss how we can work together on a more sustainable and resilient agri-food ecosystem.</p><p>About Primary Food Processors (PFP):</p><p>PFP is composed of</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cefs.org/\">European Association of Sugar Manufacturers (CEFS)</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eurococoa.com/en/\">European Cocoa Association (ECA)</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flourmillers.eu/\">European Flour Milling Association (European Flour Millers)</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://starch.eu/\">European Starch Industry Association (Starch Europe)</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://euvepro.eu/\">European Vegetable Protein Association (EUVEPRO)</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fediol.eu/\">European Vegetable Oil and Proteinmeal Industry (FEDIOL)</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodopinionprimaryfoodprocessorsandtheeusagrifoodchaindrivingsustainabilityandfoodsecurity</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69PG-W261-JCMC-W2HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Meet Senegal's new guard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Senegal, the installation of the new government continues. Following the Council of Ministers meeting on 2 May, a dozen officials were appointed to state agencies. The new president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was sworn in on 2 April, has put together a team comprising members of his party, the Patriotes Africains du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal pour le Travail, l'Ethique et la Fraternit\u00e9 (PASTEF), many of whom are little known to the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_2</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Skilled in combat sports such as Kung Fu and Vovinam, Senegal's new president is known for his consistently calm demeanor and strong ability to listen. The former tax and property inspector has never held elected office before. Will Faye be able to keep a cool head in the face of the trials and tribulations of power? 'He is a man with a [personal] touch and strategic intelligence. He has the qualities needed to lead. Everything else is a team affair,' says one of his ministers.</p><p>The Africa Report takes a look at the leading figures in this team, the faces of what new prime minister Ousmane Sonko calls the 'breakaway' administration.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_3</p><p>Allies and close associates of Faye and Sonko describe their relationship as 'complementary' and say that their trust in each other is unshakeable. Faye even named his first son after Ousmane Sonko. The two men, who have worked together for more than 10 years, are now governing Senegal as an unprecedented pair. But had it not been for Sonko's legal odyssey - which ruled him out of the last election - he would have been the one occupying the presidential palace. So will they succeed in avoiding division? 'Many of those who raise this question are unaware of just how close the two men are,' says one politician who knows them well. Sonko, now Senegal's prime minister, founded PASTEF in 2014, and has reclaimed his place as its president, after the party was dissolved by Macky Sall's administration in July 2023. His first challenge will be to win the confidence of the members of the assembly. Sonko has until 2 July to deliver his general policy speech to MPs. However, the lawmakers have the option of voting a motion of no confidence, which would lead to the dissolution of his government.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_4</p><p>The faithful friend: Birame Souleye Diop</p><p>Birame Souleye Diop, the former tax inspector who is now minister of energy, has inherited a strategic post in the new government - at a time when oil and gas production in Senegal is eagerly awaited. The first vice-president of PASTEF, Diop is one of the founding members of the party, as is Waly Diouf Bodian, the new director of the Autonomous Port of Dakar.</p><p>PASTEF was founded in 2014 on the foundations of the first trade union established in the tax and property department, then led by Sonko. Diop was elected as a member of parliament in the 2022 legislative elections, and chairs the Yewwi Askan Wi parliamentary group in the National Assembly, a post from which he will soon vacate.</p><p>The pillar: EL Malick Ndiaye</p><p>Ndiaye, PASTEF's national secretary for communication, is a loyal supporter of both Faye and Sonko and has been involved in each one of their battles since 2021. This current minister of infrastructure and transport was on the front line when Faye and Sonko were imprisoned - as he was, too, under President Macky Sall. But as soon as he was released from prison, he was by Faye's side, joining PASTEF shortly after it was founded and becoming one of its pillars.</p><p>The veteran: Abass Fall</p><p>The PASTEF coordinator in Dakar is older than his other colleagues in the party and has not been active in the Senegalese administration, as they have. Abass Fall is nonetheless one of the party's most active members and a close friend of the president. Along with MP Ayib Daff\u00e9, he is leading ruling party's charge within the National Assembly.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_5</p><p>The private secretary: Mary Teuw Niane</p><p>Mary Teuw Niane, Sall's former minister of higher education (2012-2019), was one of the first people to be appointed to a role by the new president on 3 April. A member of the 'Diomaye pr\u00e9sident' coalition, he supported the opposition in the run-up to the July 2022 legislative elections, after resigning from his comfortable position as chairman of the board of Petrosen, the national hydrocarbons company. His candidacy for the 2024 presidential election was subsequently rejected.</p><p>Niane's appointment to the central position of chief of staff has drawn some criticism from political observers. A former member of Abdoulaye Wade's Parti D\u00e9mocratique S\u00e9n\u00e9galais (PDS) and a former minister under Sall, the mathematician is one of the few veterans of the country's political life to work closely with Faye. The latter has retained a number of government experts, such as the minister-secretary general of the presidency, Oumar Samba Ba.</p><p>The experienced ally: Moustapha Mamba Guirassy</p><p>Like Mary Teuw Niane, the current minister of education is no novice in politics having served as minister of communication under Abdoulaye Wade and previously as mayor of the southeastern town of Kedougou. He became close to Sonko when the latter's legal troubles began in early 2021. Guirassy subsequently joined the Yewwi Askan Wi opposition coalition, alongside experienced politicians such as former PDS executive A\u00efda Mbodj, former prime minister Aminata Tour\u00e9 and former minister Habib Sy. He was Faye's campaign director and strongly believed in Sonko's strategy of alliances.</p><p>The economist: Khadim Bamba Diagne</p><p>Diagne holds a doctorate in economics from the Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar and is the scientific director of the economic and monetary research analysis laboratory. Although he has no official role within the party, this specialist in financial matters is part of the PASTEF ecosystem. 'He is regularly consulted on many issues, and is highly regarded by the party's top brass,' says a source close to Faye.</p><p>The lawyer: Amadou Ba</p><p>This member of PASTEF has been extensively engaged in the legal affairs of the party for quite some time. It was his training as a lawyer that tipped the balance when it came to appointing a proxy candidate for Faye, who was in prison when he filed his candidacy, and Ba was a key player in the legal battle to ensure that Faye's application was validated. He is also adept at effectively communicating with the media.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_6</p><p>The diplomat: Yassine Fall</p><p>It comes as no surprise that this former United Nations official has been appointed to minister of African integration and foreign affairs. An economist by training, Yassine Fall worked for the UN for some 20 years. Leading her own movement, Def Lila War (Do Your Duty), she opted out of the February 2019 presidential election to support Sonko, who came in third place.</p><p>She then decided to merge her political platform with PASTEF, and in 2022 became the latter's vice-president in charge of international issues. Between 2021 and 2023, Fall made several trips abroad to meet human rights organisations, and travelled frequently between Senegal and the United States to raise awareness among American officials of Sonko's cause. As foreign minister, Fall will be working with Amadou Ch\u00e9rif Diouf, the secretary of state for Senegalese living abroad. Diouf, who is PASTEF's national finance secretary, has lived in Canada for many years.</p><p>The money man: Cheikh Diba</p><p>Cheikh Diba, a tax and property inspector, is a graduate of the 2005-2007 class of France's prestigious (but now defunct) \u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration, as are Faye and Diop. However, a number of party executives have expressed their surprise at the appointment of the former director of budget programming.</p><p>A senior civil servant, Diba has spent a large part of his career in the budget department, having previously worked for the tax authorities, but has never been active within PASTEF as he was in France when the party was founded. He expressed an interest in the anti-system party on his return to Dakar in 2015. For a while, he was approached to join the party's economic affairs committee - a choice endorsed by Sonko - but eventually gave up his active involvement. He resurfaced in the run-up to the presidential election on 24 March, and played an active role in the negotiations with Sall that led to Faye and Sonko's release from prison.</p><p>The ally: Cheikh Tidiane Dieye</p><p>Like Guirassy and Niane, the minister for water is one of PASTEF's political allies. He was a founding member of the main opposition coalition Yewwi Askan Wi, Cheikh Tidiane Dieye - along with Habib Sy. Dieye ran what he describes as a 'support bid' for Faye in the presidential election, withdrawing his candidacy on the eve of the election. The sociologist and development specialist, who is very close to both Sonko and Faye, is also one of the vice-presidents of the Ziguinchor departmental council.</p><p>The spokesman: Moustapha Sarr\u00e9</p><p>The government spokesman's first media appearance did not go unnoticed. During an interview on Senegalese radio station RFM on 21 April, the minister for vocational training warned MPs against any attempts to force the prime minister to dissolve his government, saying a motion of censure would amount to 'rowing against the vision of the majority of the people'.</p><p>Sarr\u00e9 joined PASTEF when the political party was in turmoil, as Sonko, then an opposition politician, began taking an increasingly radical stance against those in power. 'These were difficult times for the party. Many members deserted the party. There were often [only] six or seven of us at meetings,' says one PASTEF member. Sarr\u00e9 worked hard to strengthen the political group and see it through those testing times, eventually joining its political bureau.</p><p>The patron saint of women: Ma\u00efmouna Dieye</p><p>Since 2017, Dieye, the new minister for family and solidarity, has been coordinating PASTEF's women's movement, which she set up after joining the party. Elected in January 2022 as mayor of Patte d'oie - one of Dakar's 19 communes - Dieye was arrested in August 2023 and charged with 'calling for insurrection', a few days after Sonko's imprisonment. She is among thousands of political prisoners and PASTEF activists who were granted amnesty under the law passed by the National Assembly on March 6. This law pertains to demonstrations occurring between February 2021 and February 2024.</p><p>The academic: Daouda Ngom</p><p>A specialist in ecology, agroforestry and sustainable development, Ngom has been chosen to head the environment ministry. This teacher, who is also a researcher in the plant biology department of the Universit\u00e9 Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, is not a longterm PASTEF activist. However, he swiftly garnered unanimous support from members of the political party Mouvement National des Cadres Patriotes, led by Faye, eventually assuming the role of deputy leader. In 2022, when Faye was promoted to the position of secretary-general, Ngom took over the leadership of the party.</p><p>TIC_BASSIROU_DIOMAYE_FAYE_7</p><p>The chief of staff: Papa Mada Ndour</p><p>Ndour was once considered for the post of chief of protocol at the presidential palace, a role he already held at the PASTEF office, and which led him to the presidential palace during the meeting between Faye, Sonko and Sall. He is a founding member of the party, and is described as 'very active in community life' by one of his close friends. Ndour was responsible for coordinating party members who live abroad.</p><p>The spokesman: Ousseynou Ly</p><p>Ousseynou Ly's appointment on 30 April as minister-counsellor and spokesman for the presidency was eagerly awaited. Ly was already in charge of communications at the presidential palace, sending out press releases from the Council of Ministers and keeping the press informed of the Senegalese president's official trips. At PASTEF, he was in charge of digital communications, under the direction of Malick Ndiaye, the party's national communications secretary. He is also the party's coordinator in the commune of M\u00e9dina.</p><p>The youth envoy: Ibrahima Thiam</p><p>Ibrahima Thiam, 38, is one of the government's five secretaries of state, responsible for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industries (SMIs). He is no stranger to the sector, having previously been in charge of programmes for the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Employeurs du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. In 2018, while still a student, Thiam joined PASTEF after contacting Sonko on social media. A few months later, he became head of the Jeunesse Patriotique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, the party's youth structure, which he left last July.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT1405202400010007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1K-CM51-F00C-60HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2121\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 14, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N926130GQ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001676</classCode><className>TAX ENFORCEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N926130GQ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001240</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DLYU</classCode><className>MACKY SALL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC555</classCode><className>SENEGAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

However, in terms of agriculture, it is one of the worst offenders when it comes to adverse environmental impact, second only to palm oil. The product in question is cocoa, and its greenhouse gas emissions have even \"doubled between 2019 and 2022,\" according to a recent report by the climate consultancy firm\u00a0Carbone 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this increase is not only more precise methods for measuring emissions but also a significant increase in consumption, leading to an expansion of cultivated areas and, consequently, increased deforestation.</p><p>This is a reality that Alexandre Bellang\u00e9, who leads a company specializing in the development of sustainable agricultural supply chains for coffee and cocoa, urges us to face. He speaks out as the\u00a0Salon du Chocolat or Paris Chocolate Fair\u00a0is being held October 28 - November 1. Paris hosts the annual Chocolate Fair to showcase chocolatiers, pastry chefs, confectioners and professionals from the chocolate industry, along with professionals from the chocolate business and producing nations.\u00a0\"Salon du Chocolat\" events are often held in various cities around the world and are a popular destination for chocolate enthusiasts.\u00a0Visitors to such events can taste different types of chocolate, learn about <url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/news/editorials/can-swiss-chocolate-be-american/17562\">chocolate</url> production, and explore various chocolate-related activities.\u00a0</p><p>Cocoa beans pose three problems, according to the CEO of Belco,\u00a0a company specializing in the development of sustainable agricultural supply chains for coffee and cocoa. \"First, cocoa is a very water and space-intensive tree, leading to deforestation. One hectare yields about a ton of cocoa,\" he says.\u00a0Over time, the soil becomes increasingly reliant on chemical fertilizers, which are themselves significant contributors to CO2 emissions. \"Fertilizers are the second major issue related to cocoa,\" says\u00a0Bellang\u00e9, adding, \"a third issue is the carbon footprint of transportation since cocoa beans are produced far from many consuming regions.\"</p><p>According to Carbone 4, whose\u00a0expertise lies in helping organizations, businesses, and governments understand and reduce their carbon emissions and environmental footprint, \"deforestation emissions represent approximately 95% of the carbon footprint of cocoa production.\" This deforestation results in collateral damage: the destroyed trees no longer act as carbon sinks, biodiversity decreases, and the soil becomes depleted when cocoa is grown in monoculture. To make matters worse, the study by Carbone 4 explains that \"it is less costly to create new cultivation areas than to restore them.\"\u00a0</p><p>In the face of these challenges, Belco and its 75 employees advocate for a socially and environmentally responsible model. \"Since we entered the cocoa industry in 2022, we have applied the same logic as in our coffee business since our founding in 2007,\" explains Bellang\u00e9. \"We work on the ground in direct collaboration with producers, whom we train in agroforestry: contrary to deforestation, we encourage them to plant other tree species alongside cocoa trees. This prevents monoculture and soil depletion, while increasing CO2 absorption due to the greater number of trees.\"</p><p>In addition to these environmental benefits, this approach offers economic advantages, according to the CEO, as \"producers benefit from additional income thanks to these often fruit-bearing trees.\" Ensuring fair compensation for producers also involves setting a purchase price that allows them to make a living. For example, Bellang\u00e9 explains that, \"this year, we paid our cocoa producers in El Salvador twice the local market price.\" Belco also operates in Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, and Ethiopia.</p><p>To limit the environmental impact of transportation, Belco is preparing to launch into the maritime transportation sector\u00a0with the goal of having half of its shipments delivered by sea by 2026. \"This solution will reduce our transportation emissions by 90%, while ultimately cutting the 'port-to-port' transport time in half,\" explains Bellang\u00e9. \"Certainly, the crossing duration will be longer, but we will gain in loading and unloading because our shipments will not dock on container ship quays, which are overcrowded.\"\u00a0</p><p>At the chocolate fair in Paris, Ballang\u00e9 is expected to deliver a provocative message. \"To better compensate producers and help them build resilience to climate change, we cannot avoid additional costs. Therefore, we must consume less and better,\" he argues.</p><p>This position echoes the Carbone 4 study, which states, \"the more chocolate we consume, the more pressure we put on tropical forests.\" The study also raises a thorny question: \"Do we need so much chocolate so frequently? Shouldn't we first reduce our consumption of many processed products containing chocolate and restore cocoa to its festive and exceptional character?\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/uploads/news/2023/10/2-18605-24.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A worker visits a cocoa farm in Suhum, Ghana, one of the largest cocoa exporters, on August 16, 2023.

Without the regulation, the EU estimates its consumption and production of six products alone - cattle, coffee, palm oil, soya and wood - would be linked to almost 250,000 hectares of deforestation a year by 2050.</p><p>But truly protecting nature and biodiversity while simultaneously accounting for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/1/130\">hundreds of millions</url> who rely on the forest for subsistence and livelihoods requires investment and incentives that accelerate a transition to transparent, sustainable agro-ecological practices.</p><p>One country implicated by the EU's law is Peru, which is the world's eighth-largest\u00a0producer of cocoa, a sector that directly employs up to six million farmers worldwide. Around 90% of growers are smallholder producers who farm on less than five hectares.</p><p>Cocoa production can contribute to deforestation when farmers expand onto forested land to exploit more fertile soils. However, agroforestry models that combine cocoa with other complementary crops and trees can reduce the need for deforestation without compromising on cocoa yields.</p><p>For cocoa farmers to adopt these practices, they need financial incentives from the outset, for example, through premium prices linked to sustainability certification.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, our analysis of the agroecological principles employed in the Peruvian cocoa value chain found that almost 60% contributed to environmental sustainability outcomes only. This is compared with economic and social outcomes at 25% and 17%, respectively.</p><p>To succeed moves to support deforestation-free production must be designed to account for producers' ongoing economic and social well-being and environmental goals.</p><p>This means that sustainability certification must not be prohibitively expensive for smallholder farmers or based on unrealistic metrics that do not apply to small-scale production.</p><p>It also means smallholders and farmer cooperatives need equal access to tools that can demonstrate their production's provenance and sustainability, unlocking higher prices.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/131501/PB%201_DIGITAL%20VALUE%20CHAIN%20TRACING%20v2.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">Digital tools</url>, such as mobile apps and blockchain platforms, have created new possibilities for quickly and reliably tracing the origins of low-cost and easy-to-use individual commodities, meaning more farmers can verify the sustainability of their produce.</p><p>Lastly, farmers can be incentivised to avoid deforesting land through reduced transaction costs, meaning they have more capital to re-invest in agro-ecological production practices. For example, the cost of certification and verification can be streamlined via farmers' cooperatives using digital systems that do not require each individual farmer to repeat the same process.</p><p>The EU is investing in research, such as the Private Sector Incentives and Investments (<url normalizedValue=\"https://alliancebioversityciat.org/projects/private-sector-incentives-and-investments-psii-climate-change-resilience-and-environmental\">PSii</url>) project, to develop the most effective mechanisms to fully support a transition from deforestation and towards more sustainable, agro-ecological approaches.</p><p>But when these products are typically exported by less developed countries to be consumed in developed economies, it is the duty of affluent blocs like the EU and others to support those at the sharp end of supply chains. And the most effective way to do this is with carrots and sticks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentopinionhowtheeucanpreventitsdeforestationfreelawfrombeingahalfmeasure</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695J-NHP1-JCMC-W0D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Foreign distributors include British department store Harrods, among others.\u00a0</p><p>- From enemies to allies -</p><p>The jacu, with its black feathers and red throat, wasn't always welcome at the farm. It was originally seen as a hungry pest feeding off precious crops.</p><p>But when Sloper discovered \"kopi luwak,\" an expensive Indonesian coffee made with beans from civet excrement, he figured jacus might make good allies in the quest to make a better brew.</p><p>Kopi luwak sometimes has a bad reputation, with farmers accused of pressing civets -- small mammals similar to weasels -- into captivity to boost production.\u00a0</p><p>The wild jacus at Camocim, meanwhile, roam, eat and poop at their leisure.</p><p>\"It's 100 percent natural,\" said farm production supervisor Rogerio Lemke. \"The jacu is within its own natural habitat,\" in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.</p><p>Linking production to the whims of a jacu's appetite is just one of the reasons it fetches such a high price.</p><p>Jacu droppings look a bit like a cereal bar, with beige grains protruding from a blackish, pasty mess. Once collected and dried, the beans are carefully sorted and hulled, and put into a chilled room.</p><p>\"It is naturally expensive. There is no way to make a jacu coffee at a low cost,\" says Sloper.</p><p>All told, jacu coffee represents less than 2 percent of the estate's production.</p><p>The bird also carries other advantages, both for farmers and those seeking a cheaper -- if less intestinally intimate -- cup of Joe.</p><p>\"It serves not only as a selector (of the best beans), but also as a harvest alarm\" says Sloper. \"Where it eats, the coffee is ripe.\"</p><p>- 'Delicious' -</p><p>While jacus help select the best coffee, there's nothing in particular about their digestive system that imparts a different taste on the beans.</p><p>\"The birds have an extremely short intestinal transit time,\" Ensei Neto, a coffee specialist, tells AFP. \"So there is not exactly any kind of biochemical process, there is no time.\"</p><p>Their digestive process is much faster than civets or elephants -- another animal whose dung is used, in Thailand, to produce specialty coffee.\u00a0</p><p>Some think the fermentation process stemming from those animals' longer digestion times imparts a better flavor on the resulting beans.\u00a0</p><p>The jacu \"only goes for the ripe fruits,\" says Neto, producing a coffee with \"sweet notes, with good acidity.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't add anything else. But the story is good.\"</p><p>The jacus have found a fan in Poliana Cristiana Prego, 37, a Brazilian tourist who has come to visit Camocim.</p><p>\"It's a delicious coffee and the story behind its production is very original. It's a new experience for us,\" she says.</p><p>\"Our customers are lovers of exotic products, but also those who value the idea of sustainable development,\" says Sloper.</p><p>For him, \"the future of coffee will come from Brazil,\" already the world's top producer.\u00a0</p><p>Whether it comes from jacus or otherwise, Brazilian coffee \"is showing the world that we really are able to do what nobody else can.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694T-8PM1-F19C-X0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>TOURISM</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 10, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000696</classCode><className>FARM LABOR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000688</classCode><className>FACTORY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000322</classCode><className>COFFEE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N111339KM</classCode><className>COFFEE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000696</classCode><className>FARM LABOR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000688</classCode><className>FACTORY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008XSL</classCode><className>RETAILERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DSFY</classCode><className>ESPIRITO SANTO, BRAZIL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

So says US NGO Global Footprint Network, which calculates what it calls the 'Overshoot Day' each year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This date comes earlier and earlier every year, a sign that humans are continuing to have a sustained impact on the ecosystems that surround them. People around the world are suffering the consequences of climate change - droughts, floods, epidemics, famines - and if these effects can't be prevented, we must at least learn to adapt to them.</p><p>Malawi, other countries hard-hit by climate change count on new loss and damage fund</p><p>In this day-to-day negotiation with the elements, the African continent is particularly impacted, even though it accounts for only one per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. The major development finance institutions are trying to respond to the emergency, and are now urging all lenders and investors to put adaptation to climate change at the core of their strategies.</p><p>$100bn of investment</p><p>For some innovative companies, these challenges are turning into opportunities. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a private sector member of the World Bank Group, estimates that 'investment opportunities in climate change adaptation in Africa could reach $100 bn by 2040'.</p><p>According to Africa: The Big Deal's database, out of the funds raised in African tech in 2022, $1.2bn was injected into start-ups developing solutions linked to energy, water, agriculture and waste management, which professionals in the sector group together under the label 'climate tech'. This amount has doubled since the previous year.</p><p>'Today, all development banks are focusing on climate change adaptation issues,' says Maxime Bayen, co-founder of Africa: The Big Deal and partner at Catalyst Fund, an American-Kenyan investor which, since January, has chosen to concentrate all its investments on start-ups that contribute more or less directly to climate change adaptation.</p><p>Africa should not be 'bullied' on climate change</p><p>Up until now, Catalyst Fund had been playing on two sides: fintech and climate. But for the French investor, it is clear that 'it will not be able to continue financing only neo-banks'. In January, as part of its new $30m pre-seed fund, Catalyst Fund announced that it had invested $2m in 10 start-ups. The investor has since secured four further investments and should be able to add 10 more start-ups to this new portfolio by the end of the year.</p><p>'We have more investment opportunities than a year ago,' says Bayen. Catalyst Fund has received 860 applications, which it is currently studying for this second round, 129 of which correspond to the investment thesis of the new fund.</p><p>Insurance, recycling and plastic bricks</p><p>Its portfolio includes companies that, at first glance, seem off-topic. For example, the Assuraf insurance platform which aggregates and distributes the offerings of major insurers such as Axa and Allianz in West Africa. 'All insurance providers have a climate resilience component,' says Bayen. 'One out of every two health incidents is linked to climate change, and epidemics such as ebola and malaria are strongly influenced by these phenomena.'</p><p>A study published in 2019 in the journal Nature  and  Communication argues that, by 2070, climate change will create ideal conditions for the expansion of virus-carrying animal populations such as bats and some monkeys. Consequently, according to the investor, accelerating the penetration of health insurance will make populations more resilient in the face of these new epidemic risks.</p><p>Zimbabwe: Climate change activists push back against carbon credits</p><p>Other models have a more visible impact on the environment. In Morocco, Sand To Green, a start-up financed in part by Catalyst Fund, is developing technology that will enable the development of agroforestry farms in arid environments. The company, founded by agronomic engineer Wissal Ben Moussa and two French partners, Benjamin Rombault and Gautier de Carcou\u00ebt, earns its income from farm production, as well as from carbon credits and the sale of biodiesel.</p><p>In Kenya, Amini, the company launched by Kate Kallot in 2023, has already raised $2m from five investors. It uses artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to build up a reliable database on the continent's soils to improve agricultural yields and anticipate risks (pests, drought, high humidity).</p><p>Also in Nairobi, Kubik recovers used plastics and transforms them into building bricks. The company, which also operates in Ethiopia, has raised $3.4m since its creation. According to the company, the production of these bricks emits five times less CO2, for a finished product that costs 40% less.</p><p>A developing ecosystem</p><p>In Abidjan, Coliba is already a success story. The start-up was founded in 2015 by Genesis Ehimegbe and Yaya Bruno Kon\u00e9 and is supported by the start-up accelerator of the GSMA, the international telecoms lobby. It specialises in the collection and recycling of plastic waste, which is converted into granules and then resold to various industries. By March, it had secured $6m out of a total Series A target of $11.5m.</p><p>Can Tanzania realise its horticulture ambition despite lack of financing, climate change?</p><p>The scope of climate tech is vast and constantly evolving, from aquaculture to mastering the cold chain and food storage. 'The three main pillars are: fintech solutions to improve people's resilience (insurance, carbon credit, emergency payments, risk pricing); solutions linked to developing sustainable means of subsistence (precision agriculture, soil restoration); and essential services such as storage, logistics, healthcare, waste and water management,' says Bayen.</p><p>More and more funds are specialising in financing these projects, including Novastar, CommerzVentures, Equator, Ambo Ventures, Katapult and RaliCap. In September, this ecosystem gathered in Nairobi to discuss investment opportunities. Initiated by AfricArena in partnership with Catalyst Fund, the Climate Tech Festival was the first event of its kind to highlight the need for financial support for African entrepreneurs building resilience to future climate challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The illegal, and rampant, deforestation continues as a small village turns into a timber station.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first article in a four-part investigation into a Congolese wood trafficking hub on the border of Uganda. It reveals a burgeoning trade and an open secret.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This series was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center Rainforest Investigations Network.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the sun goes down in late January 2024, the rural border point of Lia situated along the Uganda-Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) frontier bustles with activity. Two trucks are unloading freshly sawn hardwood timber as a few people milling around watch attentively. Just metres away, another two trucks are being loaded with wood while three others are parked on the roadside waiting for timber.</p><p>Flourishing business</p><p>Business is booming in Lia as wood is moved from one point to another, changing hands from buyer to seller. Every day, around three dozen timber dealers and casual labourers criss-cross this border point, which has become the main area of timber coming into Uganda. Piles of planks stretch 300m all around the area.</p><p>The hustle and bustle on the Uganda border feeds the high demand for quality wood in Uganda and beyond.</p><p>'Why Congo timber? It's nice. You have to give it to them, Congo is a blessed country with a rainforest and everything. Their logs are mature, not like the ones in Uganda,' says Footsteps Furniture marketing executive Frank Nsubuga, who serves high-profile customers and government offices in Kampala, Uganda.</p><p>The mahogany family Meliaceae includes five species of African mahogany (Khaya genus) that are on the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) protected list. As the raw wood crosses through Lia's official border and travels to Uganda's capital, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania, it is not subject to scrutiny.</p><p>This seemingly 'normal' work setting hides a seamier side of the timber industry - one that involves miscategorised wood ... and a lot of money.</p><p>Interviews with traders in situ, officials and those behind the scenes, indicate that this is also a dangerous business. Most people The Africa Report spoke to in Lia requested anonymity for fear of their safety. Numerous sources discussed their part in the operation, but are not quoted.</p><p>Coupled with satellite imagery, our four-part series reveals how the illegal logging supply chain is so lucrative that those involved are willing to break the law and relocate to profit from this precious resource.</p><p>Timber station destination</p><p>Lia is a rural community, with a mixture of iron-sheet roofed and grass-thatched houses dotted across the village's marram road leading to the border point. This hamlet is growing, fuelled by the timber trade, a change clearly visible in satellite images.</p><p>Timber used to pass through another border point, Mpondwe, located about 450km south of Lia. The establishment of a road to Mpondwe of a new timber park, the first of its kind in the DRC, pushed traders northwards to Lia from 2019 onwards.</p><p>A large timber station opened in Lia in 2022, bringing in more money, traffic, people and cut wood, as evident in the images.</p><p>Timber dealers mention several provinces - North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo and Haut-Uele - as the source of timber that arrives at the Uganda border. In Ituri, they spoke of Nia Nia, a hamlet located in Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a rich tropical rainforest. It is situated to the extreme west, where Ituri borders Tshopo and Haut-Uele. Despite the huge volumes of timber at Lia, there is little presence of authorities.</p><p>The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) office in charge of clearing goods passing through Lia is staffed with two people. Across the border on the Congo side in the Ituri region, there is a one-room office occupied by a few Congolese officials.</p><p>There are no scanners or weighing scales in Lia to check or weigh timber arriving or departing in trucks.</p><p>On the ground</p><p>In August last year, The Africa Report visited Lia and spoke to numerous people who explained how the logging business works. According to a local politician, as many as 10 trucks per day arrive from the DRC, depending on the season.</p><p>The timber is unloaded, and money is exchanged. If the wood quality is not good enough, the driver has to go back to the DRC to bring more timber while the buyer waits for their full load, which could be up to two weeks.</p><p>Lia doesn't operate like other borders where trucks or people pass through to their destination. It's a stopping place for some, working as a timber exchange point and market of sorts. Uganda and Kenya timber buyers - always stationed at the border - with money and dependable connections in the DRC contract their Congolese counterparts to source timber, according to a person who works in Lia.</p><p>The buyers partially pay in advance for the raw materials and sometimes buy wood harvesting machines for their Congolese partners who go to the forests to cut trees, especially during the rainy season.</p><p>The cut wood is later transported to the border during the dry season because movement is easier. It can take as long as six months for timber to be delivered. Once it is received, the pieces are counted and confirmed to be of the right quality, and the buyer pays the remaining balance, according to one wood dealer.</p><p>French disconnection</p><p>About 80% of the timber that arrives at Lia is en route, mostly to Kenya, explained a person working at the border, saying Uganda officials merely facilitate its movement. The small portion of timber destined for the local market is cleared, taxed and transported to Kampala.</p><p>Ugandan officials \"don't care about taxes on materials being exported\", our source said, so \"they don't bother looking at the documents\" because Uganda is only for transit.</p><p>While more than 200 languages are spoken in the DRC, French is one of the primary four official languages. But Congolese who bring timber to the border come with 'tricky' and 'not serious' documents written in French, according to one person who asked not to be identified.</p><p>'It's very rare to find that they have the documents the way you want them 100%,' the source said. 'We end up initiating documents from here.'</p><p>Another person working in the wood industry at the border explained that timber arrives without the requisite documents due to corruption in the DRC.</p><p>In Haut-Uele, traders mention Isiro, Rungu and Dungu as areas where they source wood. In June 2023, DRC forest monitoring group Observatoire de la Gouvernance Foresti\u00e8re (OGF) organised a fact-finding mission to Haut-Uele, where it found that the province had not issued logging permits to artisanal operators for two years despite receiving more than 80 applications, yet artisanal operators were logging without permits, including in forest reserves.</p><p>The OGF report said it 'encountered a truck loading a batch of sawn timber for export to Uganda\" and that 'all this wood was cut without authorisation'.</p><p>In the eastern Congo, money for permits is paid to individuals and roadblock operators rather than government offices, which explains the discrepancy in documents and stamps that truckers have at the border.</p><p>'Sometimes people receive money stamps on receipts and let trucks pass through. People arrive with stamped receipts and no other documents,' says the wood industry worker.</p><p>People involved in illegal logging take home triple the income of what legal logging pays in the DRC, says Moise Mugaruka Kajiwami, the head of the Forest Management Bureau in North Kivu.</p><p>'Most of it is in the hands of armed men, then operators who abandon it and join the rebels. The latter work to increase the Ugandan economy to the disadvantage of that of the DRC,' says Kajiwami.</p><p>No permit? No problem</p><p>What is always missing, according to Lia timber clearing agent Rashid Kabuye, is the certificate of origin, because the administrative state is centralised in the DRC.</p><p>'For a person to get [the certificate], he has to go to Kinshasa, which is very far, and you have to fly as there are no roads,' he says. The Congolese capital is around 1,700km from the Ituri region.</p><p>Essylot Lubala, technical advisor of the OGF, says the excuse that dealers can't go to Kinshasa to obtain a certificate of origin should not be accepted in Uganda.</p><p>'If there is no certificate of origin, timber should not be allowed to enter Uganda, or East Africa territory,' he says. If wood without a certificate is blocked, the owners will be forced to go to Kinshasa to acquire it. 'It's through the acquisition of the document that legal compliance and tax obligations will be met.'</p><p>Although an agreement for the regulation of logging in the provinces of Ituri, Tsopo and North Kivu was signed last year in Bunia, the process is moot without enforcement, Kajiwami said.</p><p>The overall lack of infrastructure also hampers paperwork and operations.</p><p>'The offices around here have no computers, no electricity - they are still using pen and paper,' he adds.</p><p>One Congolese trucker who has ferried timber and asked not to be identified, candidly tells The Africa Report that logging is an 'atrocious' job, but that corruption is part of his daily life as he moves timber across the border.</p><p>Before reaching the Uganda border, the truck will have paid about $230 on checkpoints, he says. 'These are amounts with no receipts,' he adds.</p><p>\"If you don't accept corruption, you have to provide genuine verification [of wood] and that's different,' he says, indicating that a document showing a 20-tonne load may be for a load of 60 tonnes. 'But that's how we eat.'</p><p>If truckers are given documents that indicate they have a 3-5 tonne load, they have no way of verifying it before they hit the road - and the border check.</p><p>'Because we can't check, we have to bribe. Even with the ... [right] documents there might be an extra five tonnes for him, for his pocket, so he will let them go,' adds the trucker. \"That's how it works.\"</p><p>Researchers published a study of the park on the road leading to Mpondwe, which indicated a near-total failure to issue formal timber certification on the DRC side.</p><p>'Some 93% of what arrived at the Congo park had no legal logging permits,' Paul Omar Cerutti, head of the DRC office at the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) and the study's co-author tells The Africa Report.</p><p>This is how we do it here</p><p>There is another group of Congolese traders who bring timber to Lia without a prior arrangement with buyers. They either sell it quickly or wait for days until they secure a buyer. As a result, the border has become a marketplace.</p><p>URA spokesperson Ibrahim Bbosa tells The Africa Report that the practice of traders waiting at the border for their Congolese counterparts to deliver raw material is acceptable as long as the timber is cleared by the customs officials.</p><p>However, he also said trade in timber at the border, which is booming in Lia, is not permissible under the law.</p><p>Besides traders significantly under-declaring their raw material tonnage to cheat taxes, bribery also aids the movement of timber trucks loaded at checkpoints and weighbridges en route to Kampala or Kenya.</p><p>A Ugandan timber trader who showed his tax papers to The Africa Report just days after collecting timber from Lia had roughly paid only 20% of the tax he should have been charged.</p><p>Why traders moved to Lia</p><p>Depending on who you speak to, there are several reasons why traders stopped using the Mpondwe border, but danger coupled with the restive area certainly comes into play.</p><p>Nathan Biryomumaisho, a wood dealer, said the move was due to insecurity, while Lia clearing agent Kabuye said fighting in the North Kivu region pushed wood dealers to source wood in other areas.</p><p>'Rebels were hiding in the forests where these guys were getting timber,' says Kabuye.</p><p>'Wherever rebels found them, they would attack and kill them. They [loggers] diverted to other forests where there is no insecurity and those forests are closer to the northern routes,' he adds. Rashid Muhindo, a clearing agent who moved to northern Uganda, agrees. 'Rebels were burning trucks and people were losing lives,' he says.</p><p>However, Ngasu Jackson Bwambale, a forest ranger in charge of the area around Mpondwe, says traders felt they were being overtaxed.</p><p>'Traders are like pastoralists. They transferred their trade from Mpondwe to Lia ... and established another timber entry route,' he says. 'They shifted due to high taxes.' But taxes on timber are uniform across all borders, so they found a place where documents were not a key requirement.</p><p>Blame it on the border</p><p>In Kampala, government officials don't dispute what The Africa Report investigation reveals but argue that it is difficult to authenticate products that come from eastern DRC, which has been at war for decades resulting in weak administration.</p><p>Bbosa says contraband that crosses the Uganda-DRC border is due to the lack of control posts.</p><p>'What is still a problem and is difficult to account for is timber that could come in through our porous borders,' he says.</p><p>The ease with which traders turned Lia into a market without checks and easy bribes has made the hamlet a hub for traders.</p><p>Less than 30km south of Lia is the Vurra border, the second-largest and most-developed border, with everything that a smooth, legal timber trade requires. It is not used by timber traders.</p><p>When told about the outcome of the 2023 CIFOR-ICRAF study analysing the park near Mpondwe, Bbosa is surprised. 'I think it's good information for us to act on,' he says. \"We as tax administrators can act on such information. If there is a loophole that needs to be closed, that would be an interesting trigger.'</p><p>Bob Kazungu, Uganda's acting assistant commissioner for forestry at the Ministry for Water and Environment, says in the past they used to get forged documents which they were able to deal with but ruled out the scenario of timber passing through official borders without any documentation.</p><p>His office hadn't heard of this lack of papers 'because if it had, we would have swung into serious action,' he says. \"You're raising an issue which is going to amount to a serious investigation.\"</p><p>Yet other studies, including a Chatham House document from 2014, show that 87% of logging in the DRC was illegal.</p><p>Lia timber trade welcomed by locals</p><p>When the illegal wood route moved to Lia, the money followed. The rural community has welcomed strangers over the past two years - timber dealers. The?community is excited by the trade boom, but has a few reservations, according to Ariko Moses, a councillor representing the Arua city council, the area under which Lia is located.</p><p>In mid-2023, new timber dealers were arriving in the area from Kasese, Uganda, Moses told The Africa Report in August. Their arrival raised security concerns because some rebel groups operate along the DRC border in Kasese, he said.</p><p>'People from Kasese, the number increased this year ... we asked the security to investigate them ... there are people who are loading [raw wood], there are people who are counting timber going out,' he said. 'We discovered together with security that they are genuine businesspeople, and they have work permits,' he added.</p><p>Local politicians, Moses said, are happy with the boom in timber entering Uganda through Lia. \"It's aiding the community to develop and is a source of revenue: dealers are renting spaces where they keep their raw material as well as houses.\"</p><p>Most importantly, it has been a source of jobs for youth who load and unload timber on trucks or guard timber stockpiles. The city administration is planning to tax the timber dealers so that it can generate revenue, Moses said, but admits they will be cautious.</p><p>'We want to collect our taxes from them ... we want a moderate [tax] rate. We don't want to overtax them, you know, taxes can also chase people. Once we chase them, it will have many implications,' he said.</p><p>'If we chase them because of tax, the voters will turn against us. We don't want to collapse the business,' he added.</p><p>Besides these two types of illicit timber cross-border movement - with suspect documents or no documents at all - a third type of wood hustling, as detailed in part two of our four-part series, is smuggling.</p><p>COMING UP, IN THIS INVESTIGATION:</p><p>1) Timber hustling: Lia, a thriving hub for Congolese mahogany trafficked to Uganda, Kenya</p><p>2) 'Big men', an ugly history and the ruthless Congo Basin timber smuggling business</p><p>3) In Kampala, 'Made in Uganda' furniture pride obscures 'open secret' of illicit Congolese timber</p><p>4) Kenya talks big on climate, while illegal timber flows in daily from the DRC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT030420240008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BPV-K2C1-JCH9-G1BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 3, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

As if we need to find vast swathes of empty land solely for trees.</p><p>The reality, of course, doesn't have to be that black and white, but rather many shades of green.</p><p>What I'm talking about here is the marriage of forestry and agriculture - or, as it's known,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://api-esp.piano.io/-c/480/11173/168372/9909249/167295/Q8V9B3oBUCtMWQ2xnwXy/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=0\">agroforestry</url>.</p><p>Agroforestry can be defined as the integration of woody vegetation, crops and/or livestock on the same area of land, either by planting trees on agricultural land or introducing agriculture into existing woodland or orchards.</p><p>Seen as a \"win-win\" solution in terms of both economy and ecology, as well as the more obvious benefits of growing trees on farmland, such as producing timber and tree crops, agroforestation also carries considerable environmental benefits.</p><p>This includes contributing to flood protection, carbon capture and storage, regeneration of soils and biodiversity.</p><p>There are currently around 20 million hectares of agroforestry in the EU, according to EU agroforestry association EURAF, who estimates that close to 90% of the European grassland area could include silvopasture practices, which integrate trees, forage, and pasture, and that more than 99% of the European arable land would be suitable for silvoarable practices.</p><p>In short, there is tree-mendous (ahem) potential for integrating trees into our farming systems.</p><p>But will the idea take root?</p><p>The potential of agroforestry was highlighted by EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski during the press conferences this week.</p><p>Calling the link between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and forest strategy \"very important\", he championed agroforestry as an instrument to contribute to the forestry targets, highlighting that the new CAP will allow member states to support carbon farming and agroforestry via the new eco schemes instruments, as well as rural development measures.</p><p>\"When designing their interventions, member states can take into account the specific needs and opportunities of their forestry sectors, but they must also match the larger ambitions of the strategy as agreed,\" he said.</p><p>Historically, the uptake of CAP funding for trees has been low, as Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius noted during a press conference this week.</p><p>This can be put down to a reluctance to plant trees over fears that farmers will dip out on CAP subsidies, stemming from a limitation of tree density to 100 trees per hectare in the current CAP.</p><p>This has made farmers wary of establishing, promoting and using agroforestry practices.</p><p>According to Commissioner Sinkevicius, the new CAP offers \"increased flexibility to design forest-related interventions according to national needs.\"</p><p>The question is, will the combination of this new climate package and the CAP reform be enough to encourage farmers to branch out?</p><p>In particular, much is being made of member states' national strategic plans as a vehicle to promote agroforestry practices across the EU.</p><p>\"The Commission will ensure that strategic plans are assessed against robust climate and environmental criteria.

The investments are geared to climate protection and are intended to help stabilize the forests, it says about the forest premium.</p><p>Wellbrock welcomed the steps taken to reforest damaged areas.

In this way, she said, reforestation can be used as an opportunity to make forests more climate-resilient and sustainable in the future.</p><p>Kl\u00f6ckner concluded by mentioning the possibility of agroforestry systems as a means of combating climate change. That is why, in her opinion, support for this mixed form of agriculture and forestry should also flow into the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p><p>Only recently, the Bundestag decided to allow agroforestry systems in Germany.

The farm has managed to reduce plant protection inputs by as much as a third, while fertilisation has dropped by 20% and tractor interventions by 30%.</p><p>The approach has the added bonus of a slightly reduced workload, exemplifying the 'work smarter, not harder' concept.</p><p>And yet, the approach remains pragmatic. The farm grows crops both organically and conventionally side by side and is low-till rather than no-till.</p><p>In this way, they get the best of both worlds, Christophe explains. \"You can be a bad organic farmer or a good conventional farmer,\" he points out, envisioning a future where the two systems 'merge' - or at least are able to be inspired one by the other.</p><p>In doing so, the farm is the living embodiment of the idea of 'breaking silos', so often bandied around in Brussels, but so rarely acted upon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the farm thinks in generations, rather than harvest cycles.</p><p>\"My dad planted it, I'm looking after it but probably my children will be the ones to harvest it,\" Christophe said of the agroforestry plantation.</p><p>It begs the question; what would happen if politicians thought in generations rather than election cycles?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Natasha Foote\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/subscribe-to-the-agrifood-brief/\">Subscribe to EURACTIV's Agrifood Brief</url>, where you'll find the latest roundup of news covering agriculture and food from across Europe.

Some, like the rare Charaxes montieri, are found nowhere else on earth.</p><p>Twenty-two species of butterfly, including seven endemic species, have been selected for possible breeding. Their chrysalids will be exported to overseas collectors, who hold exhibitions of live insects in special enclosures.</p><p>Initially France will be the biggest market, said Courret.</p><p>Sustainable practice </p><p>The Sao Tomean farmers will release a portion of their captive-bred butterflies back into the wild to ensure the practice is sustainable.</p><p>\"That's what is going to be important for us. We will produce and release even more than we collect to be sure we don't have a negative impact on the population,\" said Courret.</p><p>The forests of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are a biodiversity hotspot.</p><p>In a striking example of that, scientists this month announced a new species of owl \u2013 the Pr\u00edncipe scops-owl \u2013 that lives within a tiny patch of Pr\u00edncipe's southern evergreen forests.</p><p>It's expected that more farmers on Sao Tome \u2013 the bigger of the two islands \u2013 will diversify to include butterfly farming as an extra source of income.</p><p>\"I decided to start producing butterflies because it's sustainable financially, and it will have a positive impact on biodiversity and its conservation,\" said Ant\u00f3nio Alberto Camuenha, a farmer near Santa Roza, in the centre of the island.</p><p>The area is characterised by a mix of secondary forest interspersed with agroforestry production.</p><p>Boosting local incomes </p><p>Currently Camuenha produces vanilla, ginger, turmeric, cocoa and coffee.</p><p>\"More farmers could join and follow our example after seeing the results,\" he told RFI.</p><p>An added benefit is that 90 percent of the coffee and cocoa grown on Sao Tome is organic, said Courret, meaning pesticides aren't used that could harm the butterflies.</p><p>Projections done by one of BirdLife's NGO partners have shown that individual farmers could initially earn around 1,800 euros per year, with a potential to earn up to 4,000 euros per year.</p><p>That's significantly more than can be earned from ecologically harmful practices like illegal logging and charcoal-burning, Courret explained.</p><p>The island nation is the latest African country to promote butterfly farming. In Kenya, butterflies have been farmed since the 1990s in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, near the coast.</p><p>Internationally, Costa Rica and the Philippines are currently the international leaders in butterfly exports.</p><p>The S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 butterfly project is part of BirdLife's Forest Landscape Sustainability Accelerator programme, which aims to support conservation partners across the globe to preserve forests while at the same time generating income for local communities.</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-95700773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66VC-H651-JDJN-6155-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

With this phrase, he alluded to the lack of access to food in parts of the Global South.</p><p>At the beginning of the pandemic, restricted mobility fuelled enormous concerns about food shortages in individual regions of the world. A total of 40 countries are unable to produce enough food themselves due to insufficient agricultural land.</p><p>The efficient movement of goods is therefore essential in the global fight against hunger.</p><p>Tobias Reichert, agricultural policy and global trade officer at the Berlin-based think tank Germanwatch, estimated that the impact of the pandemic on cross-border supply chains will be smaller than initially feared.</p><p>However, he said, the economic crisis in some countries and the impact on people's incomes is all the more critical for the global food supply. He told EURACTIV Germany that grain transport by ship could continue as usual and worse scenarios could be thus prevented.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preventing future pandemics</emphasis></p><p>The Berlin conference also focused on ways to prevent future pandemics. The German Environment Ministry stated that 70% of the new pathogens that have appeared in humans in the last 30 years originate from animals.</p><p>In the final declaration, the conference participants agreed on a holistic approach to improving the health of humans, animals, plants and the environment. This strategy aims to minimise the risk of zoonoses - diseases transmitted from animals to humans - in the future.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/special_report/green-deal-and-agriculture-between-words-and-deeds/\">Green Deal and agriculture: between words and deeds</url></h><p>Lying at the heart of the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity strategies play a key role in shaping the debate around the future of the European agri-food sector.</p><p>In its flagship food policy, the EU executive ...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate catastrophe drives global hunger</emphasis></p><p>The most important topic, however, was man-made climate change and its impact on global food production, and\u00a0UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres named climate change as one of the biggest challenges in tackling global famine.</p><p>He also announced a UN food summit later this year, the \"2021 UN Food Systems Summit\", to decide on concrete measures. There, global measures could be decided at the very highest decision-making level.</p><p>EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski called for global efforts and more international agricultural policy cooperation.</p><p>\"These are global problems, so we need global solutions,\" he told the conference, calling for greater efforts to improve sustainability. For example, transport distances for food should be reduced, and food should be produced more locally and diversified to reduce emissions from production.</p><p>In addition to the digitalisation of agriculture, solutions through innovation and combatting forest dieback, agroforestry is also mentioned in the final declaration as an effective method for reducing emissions in agriculture.

From this work came \"Connected Concession,\" a platform designed to improve vegetation inventory and monitoring of mined lands to support re-vegetation and land rehabilitation efforts after mining is complete.</p><p>Using a drone imagery system, the Connected Concession application provides a complete map of the mining area designated by GCO<sup>2</sup>. This has notably increased the inventory capacity from 80 to 930 hectares per team member. As a result, an area previously mapped in half a day is now mapped in a few minutes. On the technical side, the collected images are transmitted in near real time to Eramet, then processed and displayed in GCO's geographic information system (GIS) using algorithms that combine computer vision and deep learning technologies<sup>3</sup>. The solution allows Eramet to rehabilitate the areas concerned in two ways: either by replanting the soil or by identifying areas suitable for the introduction of food crops that respect biodiversity and are then used by local communities.</p><p>\"The Connected Concession application is revolutionizing the way we work on an open pit mine site. It is a human, operational and technological transformation. Because we have an impact on the environment and on people, our objective in the years to come is to ensure that this impact is minimal or positive,\" explains Ludovic Donati, Director of Transformation and Digital Performance at Eramet.</p><p>Some 20 experts spanning a multicultural and multidisciplinary team, including data scientists, developers, cloud architects, GIS experts, and designers specialized in user experience, participated in this project. Piloted entirely remotely, using agile methodology and lasting only one year, it involved end users on a daily basis in order to stay as close as possible to their needs.</p><p>Charlotte Pierron-Perl\u00e8s, Head of Intelligent Industry at Capgemini Invent, said: \"We are particularly proud of this program, which demonstrates how our connected Intelligent Industry<sup>4</sup>approach offers powerful levers of transformation for the benefit of the environment, thanks to technologies and in particular the application of data and artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>New features of the application are now being considered to extend the tool to monitor water resources, or to identify alternative routes for the mine.

competences.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strategy, which was presented by EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski during the European Parliament's agriculture committee meeting on 1 September, is one of the main initiatives of the Commission's Green Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the Commissioner, the aim of the strategy is to secure \"growing healthy, resilient forests for decades to come\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The new forestry strategy puts forward set of coordinated, consistent and science-based policy actions that can be implemented in full cooperation with member states and forest stakeholders,\" he said.</p><p>As well as protecting primary and old growth forests throughout the bloc, the strategy aims to see 3 billion new trees planted across the EU by 2030, an initiative that Commissioner Wojciechowski pointed out has been widely well-received.</p><p>To ensure an \"adequate injection of EU funds\" to the forestry sector, the Commission is calling upon member states to set up new payment schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p><p>Foresters also stand in line to benefit from the Commission's new carbon farming initiative, the first legal proposal of which is expected by the end of the year, which is set to be a new source of income for foresters, the Commissioner said.</p><h><url

sets the scene for carbon removal actions in farming</url></h><p>A new carbon removal approach in agriculture will contribute to stepping up Europe's climate ambition, the European Commission reiterated at the launch of its massive plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% before the end of the decade.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Criticism across the board</emphasis></p><p>However, MEPs remained unconvinced by the strategy, which had already received <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skog.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Joint-Letter-on-EU-Forest-Strategy-post-2020.pdf\">considerable criticism</url> from a number of member states.</p><p>One notable voice of discontent was that of Finnish MEP Petri Sarvamaa, who stressed that what the sector needed was clarity and a clear vision forward, but that this strategy offered neither.</p><p>Sarvamaa suggested that the content of the strategy betrays the \"power struggle\" inside the Commission, which led to the creation of an \"ambiguous and unclear strategy\".</p><p>\"The Greens aren't happy with it, the Socialists aren't happy, we are not happy - who is happy about this?\" he said.</p><p>Calling the strategy \"content-free and vague,\" Green MEP Martin Haeusling stressed the need to adapt to a new changing climate, warning that the bloc will see many more forest fires in the future.</p><p>\"The burden of this will fall on Greece, Italy and increasingly other countries - but the strategy provides no answers for this,\" he said.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/austria-romania-slam-eu-forest-strategy/\">Austria, Romania slam EU forest strategy</url></h><p>Austria and Romania are among 10\u00a0EU countries demanding a wide-reacing\u00a0debate on the EU's new forest strategy, one of the European Green Deal's flagship initiatives proposed last week.</p><p>The two countries said forestry falls under EU member states' competence and cannot be ...</p><p>Other MEPs expressed concerns that the strategy does not strike a balance between economic and environmental considerations.</p><p>\"It gives the impression that forests are only to be considered as carbon sinks,\" Renew Europe's Ulrike M\u00fcller complained, stressing that she cannot accept the forestry economy to be \"pushed into the background\".</p><p>Right wing MEP Mazaly Aguilar concurred, saying the strategy must do \"a lot more to implement the multi-functional role of forests.\"</p><p>Addressing the Commissioner, Aguilar said that Parliament \"continues to request more ambition to take into account national realities and not only look at forests as carbon sinks.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stepping on member states' toes</emphasis></p><p>Meanwhile, others pointed to concerns over the Commission overstepping their mark given that forestry is a national competence.</p><p>For instance, Leftist MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan said that the EU should \"concentrate on what we can do instead of dreaming over things we can't,\" suggesting that, instead of trying to influence areas outside its remit, the Commission should review the Mercosur trade agreement to offer more protection to the Amazon rainforest.</p><p>In response, the Commissioner maintained that the EU wide forestry strategy can be implemented without stepping on the toes of member states, likening the situation to that of health, also a policy area which is the preserve of member states, but which saw considerable EU action during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>While he stressed that forestry will remain firmly in the remit of member states and that this will not change, Wojciechowski sees the Commission's role as in \"encouraging joint action but to an extent that does not take away member state competences and does not interfere with them\".</p><p>\"Time will tell\" as to how far this intervention will go, he added, pointing out the overlap between the CAP strategic plans and the forestry strategy.</p><p>\"Forestry is quite a part of [CAP strategic plans] recommendations, and encouraged and included in eco schemes,\" he said, offering up the example of agroforestry.</p><p>While the Commissioner said accepted the criticisms levelled at him, he said he remained \"deeply convinced\" that that strategy adopts an approach that is \"as balanced as it gets\", covering the many functions that forests can play in the EU's economy and within EU policies on climate protection and biodiversity.</p><p>\"I think this strategy will prove its worth in the future actions,\" he said.</p><h><url

agroforestry</url></h><p>In a clear nod to the strategic importance of agroforestry, the term has now cropped up in both the European Green Deal, the European Commission's roadmap for making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050, and the EU's flagship new food policy, the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Benjamin

Legend has it that their ancestor, the common bean (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phaseolus vulgaris</emphasis>), was a gift from the god Quetzalcoatl (\u2018Feathered Serpent\u2019) to the early inhabitants of Mexico (long before the Aztecs or Maya).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Quetzalcoatl had searched high and low for the right foods to help humans feed themselves. One day, he saw a red ant carrying a maize kernel. He followed it back to a mountain, where it disappeared into a crack in the rock. Inside the mountain was a vast hoard of different seeds. He managed to retrieve them, and since then Mexicans have eaten maize, beans and squash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Quetzalcoatl\u2019s gift didn\u2019t, however, extend to sparing Mesoamerica\u2019s early farmers the arduous task of domesticating these plants. It took thousands of years of selective breeding to transform the stringy pods of the primitive vine into beans, to turn wild teosintes (grasses with tiny cobs that fell apart on reaching maturity) into maize with the large cobs we know today, and to understand the importance of growing all three crops together.</p><p>As all gardeners know (and anyone who has read <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jack and the Beanstalk</emphasis>), most <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phaseolus vulgaris</emphasis> cultivars are climbers and their stalks need support as they grow towards the sun, twining anti-clockwise as they go. It\u2019s a perfect combination: the beans enrich the soil by fixing nitrogen\u00a0(2); the maize stalks support the bean vines; and the leaves of the squash plants cover the soil, conserving moisture and preventing erosion.</p><p>Besides forming their own little ecosystem, the three plants provide a balanced diet: the beans contain the only two amino acids that maize lacks. Cultivation of this trio, known in Nahuatl (the Aztec language) as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">milpa</emphasis> (\u2018what is sown in the fields\u2019), gradually spread, allowing the first farmers in the hot lands of the South to eat their fill.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mesoamerica\u2019s early civilisations</emphasis></p><p>Around 1200 BCE, nomadic hunter-gatherers from present-day Mexico invaded the South, forcing its farmers to become the food-growing base of their society. From this conquest emerged Mesoamerica\u2019s first known civilisation, the Olmecs. The Olmecs built Mesoamerica\u2019s first pyramids, carved its first stelae and 17 colossal human heads from stone, worshipped its first gods, made its first human sacrifices, and may have laid the foundations of Mayan script before their culture vanished for unknown reasons, a few centuries BCE.</p><p>However, up until the arrival of the conquistadors in the 16th century, Mesoamerican civilisation continued to flourish. For 2,000 years, city states arose, fought and vanished \u2013 Teotihuac\u00e1n and Monte Alb\u00e1n, centre of the Zapotec civilisation, around 650 CE; the Mayan cities around 900 CE\u00a0(3). At some sites there is evidence of construction work being abandoned, at others, signs of fires, riots and the massacre of a royal family.</p><p>   Self-sufficiency farming threatened the fifth sun by limiting business profits. Human sacrifice was no longer necessary to avert disaster\u00a0; free trade would be enough     </p><p>These were sophisticated civilisations, with social castes and political rivalries. But their rulers, out of touch with reality, competed in building over-sized cities and pyramids \u2013 all dependent on the work of peasant farmers forced to adopt ever more intensive agricultural techniques in a fragile natural environment.</p><p>Growing the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">milpa</emphasis> on forest land cleared by slash-and-burn required long fallow periods for soil regeneration, and when agriculture was intensified to feed cities with tens or even hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, the forest vanished, the soil was exhausted and eventually the whole system collapsed. There were probably famines and rebellions, and repeated droughts may have been the last straw, for the city-dwellers returned to nature, rebuilt their society on a smaller scale and were once more able to eat their fill of maize and beans.</p><p>Then came the Aztecs from the desert plains of the North, who established their capital Mexico-Tenochtitlan on an island in Lake Texcoco, now the site of Mexico City, in around 1325 CE. They built an empire, conquered their neighbours and forced them to pay tribute. They also practised human sacrifice on a massive scale to prevent the sun from going out (as they believed four previous suns had done: when the fifth sun was created, it had initially stood still and a number of gods had had to give their hearts and blood to set it in motion).</p><p>The end of the Aztec civilisation came with the arrival of the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. The Aztecs are said to have mistaken Cort\u00e9s for Quetzalcoatl, whose return they were expecting. So the emperor Moctezuma II presented him with a cup of cold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">xocolatl</emphasis> (chocolate), unsweetened but seasoned with spices and vanilla. Cort\u00e9s was more interested in the golden cup in which it was served. When the Aztecs realised they were not dealing with gods after all, the slaughter began.</p><p>The Aztecs, and the Mayas before them, recorded their history, wisdom, songs and riddles in accordion-folded codices containing a mixture of text and pictures. The German painter Albrecht D\u00fcrer was moved by these colourful manuscripts but Bishop Diego de Landa, in his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Account of the Things of Yucat\u00e1n</emphasis> (1566), took a different view: \u2018They contained nothing but superstition and the lies of the Devil, so we burned them all.\u2019</p><p>After the Europeans had destroyed Mexico-Tenochtitlan, its inhabitants and its books, scholars set out to learn the secrets of the lost civilisation. A native physician helped by compiling a codex listing Aztec medicinal plants, beautifully illustrated in colour. Known by his Christian name, Martin de la Cruz, he is thought to have created the codex at the request of the College of Santa Cruz, founded by the Spanish viceroy to educate the sons of the Aztec nobility who would then spread Christianity across New Spain. Unfortunately, most died of smallpox.</p><p>Originally written in Nahuatl, the codex was translated into Latin in 1522 by one Juan Badiano, probably an Aztec student at the college and \u2018of Indian race\u2019 according to the manuscript. The original was lost but the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis</emphasis> (Little Book of the Medicinal Herbs of the Indians), otherwise known as the Cruz-Badiano Codex, crossed the Atlantic and ended up in the Vatican archives. There it lay forgotten until 1929, when the world rediscovered this lively record of Aztec medicine, science and art, listing 250 species of plant, 185 of them illustrated, including agave, touch-me-not, cacao, vanilla, datura, ipomoeas and achilleas.</p><p>Illustration 24 shows the delicate leaves and flowers of yarrow or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Achillea millefolium</emphasis> (named after the Greek hero, who used it to treat a wounded adversary). The Aztecs called it <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tlalquequetzal</emphasis> (earth feather). Not all plants in the codex are so easily identified, and it may not in fact contain maize or beans. But the Aztecs had not lost Quetzalcoatl\u2019s gifts. They preserved the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">milpa</emphasis>, which guaranteed their self-sufficiency, through genocide, wars and revolutions. Then the high priests of modern economics changed the rules: self-sufficiency farming threatened the fifth sun by limiting business profits. But human sacrifice was no longer necessary to avert disaster; free trade would be enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The \u2018tortilla crisis\u2019</emphasis></p><p>In 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) liberalised trade between Mexico, the US and Canada, and US maize poured into Mexico, causing the price to crash. Family-run Mexican farms couldn\u2019t compete with North American agroindustry, with its fertilisers, pesticides and subsidies. Agricultural production collapsed. Millions of Mexican maize farmers put out of work were unable to find employment except in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">maquiladoras</emphasis> (foreign enterprises exempt from customs duties), and saw emigration as their only hope.</p><p>Then, speculation caused prices to soar, leading to the 2007 \u2018tortilla crisis\u2019, when Mexicans went hungry and profits moved north. Demonstrators carried banners reading \u2018No maize, no country\u2019. Today Mexico is one of the world\u2019s largest importers of maize (which could wake ancient gods and dormant volcanos).</p><p>But surely the Mexicans still had beans? In the 1990s Colorado farmer Larry Proctor bought a sack of mixed beans on a market in Mexico. Returning home, he planted only the yellow ones. After just two crops, he applied for a patent; his \u2018invention\u2019 was to selective breeding what fastfood is to gastronomy. This was another disaster for Mexico: it was possible to claim beans as intellectual property, and the Mexicans had failed to do so.</p><p>Among the 10,000 known cultivars of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phaseolus vulgaris</emphasis>, Mexicans were familiar with at least 30 different yellow varieties, all painstakingly described by their own botanists. Proctor\u2019s application referred only to \u2018yellow beans\u2019, yet the US Patent and Trademark Office had given its approval. Proctor demanded a 22% license fee on all yellow beans sold in the US, blocked imports and started taking people to court for infringing his patent. Mexico\u2019s yellow bean sales collapsed, and the world learned a new word: biopiracy.</p><p>So Mexico went to court. The case took ten years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, but the patent was revoked and Proctor no longer receives royalties. The battle was won, but the war went on, and attempts to patent and privatise nature continue.</p><p>Some Mexicans dream of the return of Emiliano Zapata, agrarian reformer and leader of Mexico\u2019s 1910-20 revolution; others recall the words of the Aztec poet-king Nezahualcoyotl: \u2018My friends, this earth is only lent to us.\u2019 These are the heirs of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">milpa</emphasis> farmers. They see this polyculture as the place where science meets traditional knowhow, a means of building food sovereignty that will make it possible to maintain a social structure built on agriculture. In 2022 the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recognised it as a \u2018globally important agricultural heritage system\u2019\u00a0(4). It has been studied, refined and expanded to include aromatic plants and forage, which make it possible to maintain small-scale livestock farming and enrich the ecosystem; it has been combined with agroforestry, which constitutes a return to its origins. This flagship of agroecology makes it possible to achieve a balanced diet through farming on a human scale.</p><p>Agronomist Marc Dufumier believes agriculture based on this body of knowledge could feed a global population of nine billion: \u2018This is intelligent agriculture. It revisits ancient knowhow built up by generations of farmers, brings back forgotten varieties, and at the same time is based on scientific research, which has made many discoveries regarding soil biology and has many more yet to make\u2019\u00a0(5). The struggle seems unequal, but Quetzalcoatl may still have something to say, as may Zapata.</p><p>(1)\u00a0Many modern varieties are cultivars of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phaseolus vulgaris</emphasis>.</p><p>(2)\u00a0More precisely, bacteria living on the roots of the plant fix nitrogen and in return benefit from the glucose that the plant produces by photosynthesis.</p><p>(3)\u00a0The name means \u2018people of maize\u2019.</p><p>(4)\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fao.org/giahs/en/\">www.fao.org/giahs/en/</url>.</p><p>(5)\u00a0Marc Dufumier, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">50 id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues sur l\u2019agriculture et l\u2019alimentation</emphasis> (50 preconceived ideas on agriculture and food), Allary, Paris, 2014.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LMNDEN-10321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LMNDEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692J-MVT1-F035-X00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420124</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Le Monde Interactif All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde Diplomatique (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37590\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 1, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GATT &amp; NAFTA</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REY3Njg0MkNFMDQ1NEUxRTlDQzY4Q0YwNTAyM0MxNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzczQ0MwNDEzMjhGNDIxQ0FEM0ExM0EwQjk0QjI0RTk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000647</classCode><className>EROSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001300</classCode><className>PATENT LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001227</classCode><className>NUTRITION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR116</classCode><className>CENTRAL AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Simon Zadek is Chair of the Finance For Biodiversity initiative.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The opportunity of the century\" is how President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has described the EU Recovery Plans this week - in terms of rebuilding our economies in a way that protects the environment and the climate, and creates sustainable jobs. These plans are a defining moment for reset, and they should completely overhaul Europe's economic systems and set the region onto a new pathway that delivers the ambitions of the European Green Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In reviewing the plans, which were due for final submission to the European Commission on 30 April, it is clear that the story emerging so far is one of some progress to support the green transition, yet a complete failure to apply a smart or systemic approach to addressing Europe's environmental sustainability challenges.</p><p>The devil will be in the detail of the numerous climate measures included in the plans, yet the role of nature in the green transition is glaringly absent - whether it's in tackling climate change and the dramatic loss of biodiversity in Europe or strengthening Europe's long-term growth potential.</p><p>The National Resilience and Recovery Plans (NRRPs) are the vehicles that EU Member States are using to access money from the (EURO)670 billion Resilience and Recovery Facility (RRF) - the centrepiece of the Next Generation EU recovery instrument. In emerging analysis that will be released in full by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vivideconomics.com/\">Vivid Economics</url> at the end of May, findings show that for every single euro being invested through the NRRPs, less than 2 cents benefit nature - a massive missed opportunity for jobs, economic stimulus, emission reductions and biodiversity gains.</p><p>Why? It may not be well known, but direct investments in agroforestry, reforestation, wetland restoration and urban greening deliver impressive economic yields and employment gains, and in some cases even outperform traditional and other low-carbon investments.</p><p>For example, the emerging Vivid analysis of five countries - France, Italy, Germany, Bulgaria and Poland - shows that agroforestry creates an average of 56 jobs per (EURO)1 million invested compared to 45 jobs for electric vehicles and 31 jobs for road-building. In terms of economic return, every (EURO)1 of spending on agroforestry produces on average (EURO)3 of gross-valued added (GVA) to the economy compared with (EURO)1.8 for electric vehicles and (EURO)1.2 for upgrading roads.</p><p>There is a clear opportunity to improve the performance of the Member State plans - and indeed all future EU spending - to invest in more nature-specific interventions, which would not only deliver a job-rich recovery with strong economic multipliers, but also reduce emissions and strengthen resilience and biodiversity.</p><p>The scientific understanding of nature's role in restoring balance to the climate has deepened in the last few years and is now well-established - nature can deliver <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/11645\">a third of the climate solution by 2030</url>.</p><p>So too has our understanding of the full range of benefits that nature-based solutions deliver for people: alongside jobs, the benefits include filtering water, reducing air pollution, regulating local climate and providing resilience to extreme weather events. There doesn't have to be a trade-off between choosing to spend on climate, biodiversity and economic well-being; they go hand-in-hand and reinforce each other.</p><p>It is important to remember that when EU leaders agreed to the recovery facility, as COVID-19 was decimating economies, they embedded green principles at the outset. The aim was to advance the green transition, and mainstream climate action and environmental sustainability, while ensuring that all measures 'do no significant harm' (DNSH).</p><p>If applied rigorously, the DNSH principle should ensure that all spending under these plans is compatible with a nature-positive recovery - in other words, that no recovery measure should put undue pressure on ecosystems. And it is very clear that Member States need to do much more to meet these goals - on both <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.e3g.org/news/a-recovery-with-green-elements-but-not-a-green-recovery/\">climate</url> and nature.</p><p>As governments struggle with the historic challenges posed by COVID-19, there are measures that can be taken that provide a 'triple win' - for jobs, climate and nature. What is needed is a comprehensive and transparent assessment of the NRRPs by the European Commission that takes a smart and systemic approach to environmental sustainability - placing both climate and nature at the heart of the EU's review process.</p><p>There is much work to be done to help decision-makers understand the significant benefits and opportunities that both climate-positive and nature-based solutions can offer as part of their recovery plans.</p><p>Our hope is that the emerging analysis from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vivideconomics.com/casestudy/greenness-for-stimulus-index/\">Vivid Economics</url> and many other initiatives, such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenrecoverytracker.org/\">Green Recovery Tracker</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://bankwatch.org/blog/last-chance-for-member-states-to-include-biodiversity-in-recovery-plans\">Bankwatch</url>, EuroNatur, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iisd.org/sustainable-recovery/geography/europe/\">IISD</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://zoe-institut.de/en/publication/systemic-change-for-a-resilient-europe/\">ZOE-Institute</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://zoe-institut.de/en/project/a-green-economic-recovery-in-europe/\">and New Economics Foundation</url>, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.f4b-initiative.net/greenstimulus\">Finance for Biodiversity</url> to name a few, will contribute to this process of increasing knowledge and transparency in these areas - and will provide Member States with the tools they need to further increase ambition for future spending on both climate and nature.</p><p>The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is not simply a question of putting the 'old' economy back on its feet but building forward better - solidly embedding nature in the economic rebuild to deliver a truly green and just transition and ensuring Europe becomes more resilient over the long-term.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1600760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62KT-GF41-JCF9-42HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 5, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Biodiversity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU recovery fund</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU recovery plan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>national recovery plan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis></p><p>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending.</p><p>These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>ENDS</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell's 2024 AGM. Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from\u00a0our operations and energy products while becoming an\u00a0increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans\u00a0cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and\u00a0Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we\u00a0believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helping reduce emissions for our customers</emphasis></p><p>We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to\u00a0sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel.</p><p>To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].</p><p>Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\u00edzenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in\u00a02021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from\u00a0fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the\u00a0energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future.</p><p>Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for\u00a0many years with oil, gas and LNG.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to\u00a0build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technologies of the future</emphasis></p><p>We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis></p><p>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis></p><p>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis></p><p>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis></p><p>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis></p><p>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis></p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions.

Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale.

We expect continued growth in the transport and\u00a0industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more\u00a0than a quarter of the world's population\u00a0still lack basic\u00a0energy provisions.</p><p>Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the\u00a0Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per\u00a0annum (mtpa) in\u00a01983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a\u00a0figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output.

If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%.

The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis></p><p>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis></p><p>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also\u00a0needed to decarbonise the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-energy use</emphasis></p><p>Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis></p><p>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis></p><p>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis></p><p>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:</p><p>Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity.Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable.Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.</p><p>[A] Net absolute emissions cover the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our energy products; these are calculated by product and allocated to businesses based on final point of sales, so emissions associated with upstream production are largely included under downstream as point of sale.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses.</p><p>The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and\u00a0Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our\u00a0products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are\u00a0reported as Scope 3.</p><p>Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil\u00a0products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.</p><p>[B] Oil products includes gas-to-liquids (GTL).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leading Integrated Gas</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022.

LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is\u00a0scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG.</p><p>To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with\u00a0the use of LNG.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p><p>As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry.</p><p>We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry.</p><p>We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non-operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Working with others</p><p>Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions.</p><p>We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments.</p><p>We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.</p><p>In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for\u00a0cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives.</p><p>As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a\u00a0result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products.</p><p>Our strategy is to:</p><p>Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of the future.

As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced.</p><p>We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the\u00a0USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell\u00a0Pakistan.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Oil for lubricants and chemicals</p><p>Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in\u00a0low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building for tomorrow (2025+)</emphasis></p><p>To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.</p><p>Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis></p><p>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry.

The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.</p><p>[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry.

The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis></p><p>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis></p><p>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis></p><p>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year [A].</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>[A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis></p><p>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis></p><p>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis></p><p>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.

This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat.</p><p>Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and\u00a0reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The\u00a0storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate policy engagement</emphasis></p><p>Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial\u00a0part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and\u00a0regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions.</p><p>Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our\u00a0advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world.</p><p>In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and advocacy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy Themes:</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Achieving net-zero emissions</emphasis></p><p>Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B Supplying the secure energy the world needs</emphasis></p><p>Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C Driving changes in demand</emphasis></p><p>Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D Growing low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p><p>Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy in action</emphasis></p><p>Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators.</p><p>In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS.

We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our\u00a0production through the natural decline of existing oil and\u00a0gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries intolow-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.</p><p>If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.</p><p>The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our\u00a0Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we\u00a0expect to achieve our target in 2030.

These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl.

Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis></p><p>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the\u00a0use of our oil products</emphasis></p><p>We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT</p><p>[B] Liquefied natural gas</p><p>[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.

As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities.

Over\u00a0the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as\u00a0evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate\u00a0disclosures.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG rating agencies [B]</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISS</emphasis></p><p>The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in\u00a0the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.</p><p>Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are\u00a0rated on a 12-point scale from A+ (best) to D-(worst).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Initiatives</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transition Pathway Initiative</emphasis></p><p>The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark.</p><p>TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a\u00a0company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050).</p><p>In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the\u00a0highest score of four (strategic assessment) for\u00a0the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks\u00a0and\u00a0opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This\u00a0exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90)</p><p>In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\u00b0C benchmark. This is the\u00a0result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Action 100+</emphasis></p><p>Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with\u00a0assets of around $68 trillion.</p><p>Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three\u202fhigh-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>The\u00a0disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May\u00a029, 2023.</p><p>We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that\u00a0our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome\u00a0in their assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures</emphasis></p><p>Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.</p><p>Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in\u00a0the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cautionary note</emphasis></p><p>The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our' are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking statements</emphasis></p><p>This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of\u00a0its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or\u00a0its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net-zero emissions target</emphasis></p><p>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking non-GAAP measures</emphasis></p><p>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report.</p><p>We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additional information</emphasis></p><p>As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e( CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>LEI Number: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70</p><p>Published: March 20, 2024</p><p>Classification: Additional Regulated Information required to be disclosed under the laws of the United Kingdom</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000930352en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKR-SWM1-F15W-N2JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"25725\"/><timeReceived>04:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 20, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The company launched this initiative at a time when youth unemployment in Europe was at a record high. The goal was to help young people all over the continent improve their employability and obtain employment. Since then, the program has scaled to a global scope.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 helps youth become more employable by offering traineeships and apprenticeships. Last year alone, the company provided nearly 11 500 such opportunities. Nestl\u00e9 also offers online training, career guidance, mentorships and networking opportunities. Well over one million people took part in digital events in 2022. While many trainees and apprentices take a permanent position with Nestl\u00e9, the goal of the program is to equip them with skills that can help them secure a job anywhere.</p><p>Employability remains a key pillar of the program today, but Nestl\u00e9 has also expanded it to include two additional dimensions: agripreneurship and entrepreneurship. Supporting young farmers and entrepreneurs all over the world is in line with the company's objectives to advance regenerative agriculture and to develop innovative products and services.</p><p>With the average age of farmers now well into the 50s in many parts of the world, Nestl\u00e9 is also striving to make farming more attractive to young people. Encouraging them to pursue a livelihood in farming is an opportunity to embed regenerative agriculture methods, which are key to helping address climate change. Through Nestl\u00e9's Agripreneurship Program, young farmers learn how to run their farms as businesses from which they can make a decent living. Nestl\u00e9 provides them with access to training courses that include regenerative farming topics like agroforestry, soil health and animal welfare. In 2022, more than 5\u00a0000 young farmers participated in the program.</p><p>The ability to sustainably feed the world's growing population will be determined not only by today's young farmers but also by today's young innovators. Many of them have ideas in line with Nestl\u00e9's priorities - be they related to regenerative agriculture, plant-based products, sustainable packaging solutions, or nutrition.

By the end of 2023, Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with 2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in the energy transition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>\"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending.</p><p>These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell's 2024 AGM. Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from\u00a0our operations and energy products while becoming an\u00a0increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans\u00a0cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and\u00a0Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we\u00a0believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helping reduce emissions for our customers</emphasis>We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to\u00a0sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel.</p><p>To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].</p><p>Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\u00edzenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from\u00a0fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the\u00a0energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future.</p><p>Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for\u00a0many years with oil, gas and LNG.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to\u00a0build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technologies of the future</emphasis>We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition.

Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity.Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by 2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The energy system: our beliefs</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in\u00a0many developing countries where security of\u00a0supply and stable prices are critical to their\u00a0development.</emphasis></p><p>The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250\u00a0mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale.

We expect continued growth in the transport and\u00a0industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more\u00a0than a quarter of the world's population\u00a0still lack basic\u00a0energy provisions.</p><p>Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the\u00a0Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per\u00a0annum (mtpa) in\u00a01983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023.</p><p>Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a\u00a0figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Primary energy demand by region and energy source, 2023 (exajoule)</emphasis></p><p>[A] Electric renewables are dominated hydroelectricity, wind, and solar.

Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.</p><p>[A] Includes emissions from industrial processes, 18% of total.[B] Includes rail, 3.5% of total.[C] Emissions for operation of buildings - not construction (which is in industry sectors).[D] 70% methane, from agriculture and fossil production and use; 23% nitrous oxide; 7% others.[E] land use, land-use change emissions and forestry (LULUCF).Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industry</emphasis></p><p>Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil,\u00a0gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand.</p><p>Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also\u00a0needed to decarbonise the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-energy use</emphasis>Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We\u00a0believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this\u00a0sector.</p><p>Source: International Energy Agency.

Global CO2emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a\u00a0year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions.</p><p>Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio-alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.</p><p>[A] Noth-west European retail prices.[B] Beyond production costs, taxes significantly increase the price customers pay for biodiesel, diesel and gasoline.[C] Electric costs (0.2-0.6$kWh) adjusted for 2.4x higher efficiency of electric versus international combustion engine vehicles.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to\u00a0start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through\u00a0the 2030s.</p><p>We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one\u00a0that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions.</p><p>Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the\u00a0oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future.

They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production.</p><p>As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on\u00a0the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.</p><p>A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).</p><p>[A] Peer range comprises BP, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Chevron and represents all Integrated Gas and Upstream related activities. based on external reporting and Shell internal analysis including peer working capital assumptions.[B] Shell internal analysis of Woodmac Lens data.

Peers are the majors, large- and mid-cap companies and represent all Integrated Gas and Upstream related activities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Decarbonising our operations</emphasis>As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible.</p><p>We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transforming our businesses to offer more</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">low-carbon solutions while reducing sales</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">of oil products</emphasis></p><p>We are reshaping our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses with a more focused geographic portfolio of products to deliver more value with less emissions. We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments.</p><p>We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.</p><p>In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for\u00a0cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives.</p><p>As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a\u00a0result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products.</p><p>Our strategy is to:</p><p>Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own production, will help\u00a0us\u00a0deliver affordable and low-carbon solutionsfor our customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future</emphasis></p><p>Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and lubricant offeringsBuilding for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuelsPreparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storageSupported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delivering today</emphasis></p><p>Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low-carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced.</p><p>We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the\u00a0USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell\u00a0Pakistan.</p><p>Oil for lubricants and chemicals</p><p>Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in\u00a0low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building for tomorrow (2025+)</emphasis></p><p>To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry.

Our strategy is based\u00a0on\u00a0the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity</emphasis>As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by\u00a02030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensityof our operations.</p><p>Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%,non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to\u00a0reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it\u00a0starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year.</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today. For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they emit.Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions.</p><p>The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors.</p><p>At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat.</p><p>Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and\u00a0reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The\u00a0storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate policy engagement</emphasis></p><p>Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial\u00a0part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and\u00a0regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions.</p><p>Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our\u00a0advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world.</p><p>In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and advocacy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy Themes:</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Achieving net-zero emissions</emphasis>Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B Supplying the secure energy the world needs</emphasis>Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C Driving changes in demand</emphasis>Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D Growing low-carbon solutions</emphasis>Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p><p>Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy in action</emphasis></p><p>Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators.</p><p>In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross-border CCS\u00a0hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region.</p><p>In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy transition in action</emphasis></p><p>Selection of portfolio developments [A]</p><p>These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets, ambitions and\u00a0performance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050</emphasis></p><p>It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring.</p><p>We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets and ambitions</emphasis></p><p>Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3)</p><p>Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030</p><p>Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>Updated</p><p>Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition</emphasis>New</p><p>Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)</p><p>On a net basis.Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis></p><p>In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.</p><p>To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:</p><p>making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our\u00a0production through the natural decline of existing oil and\u00a0gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries intolow-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.</p><p>If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.</p><p>The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our\u00a0Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we\u00a0expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis>Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A], [B]</p><p>The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Operational control boundary.Including nature-based solutions.</p><p>Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria\u00a0Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Routine flaring</emphasis>We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the\u00a0use of our oil products</emphasis></p><p>We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT[B] Liquefied natural gas[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.</p><p>Read more about our approach at shell.com/sustainability/our-climate-target/our-climate-target-faqs</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell net zero by 2050</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We are committed to our target to become a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</emphasis></p><p>To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Critical factors on the path to net zero</emphasis>The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this.</p><p>We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p>To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net\u00a0zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and\u00a0heat and power storage solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multi-energy business</emphasis>There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of\u00a0the\u00a0future energy system. As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Share of global primary energy mix (%)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just transition and governance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A just transition</emphasis></p><p>A successful energy transition depends on more than financial investment and technological advances. It also needs to be a\u00a0just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Closing the energy access gap</emphasis>Today, around 675 million people do not have access to\u00a0electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and\u00a0Social Affairs.</p><p>Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative\u00a0to help people get access to energy in the near and\u00a0medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and\u00a0South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skills for the future</emphasis>As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This\u00a0requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce.</p><p>We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a\u00a0focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation.</p><p>In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and\u00a0storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p>We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights\u00a0and labour rights.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Equal opportunities</emphasis>Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under-represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most\u00a0diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of\u00a0our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Communities</emphasis>At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the\u00a0proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over\u00a0the\u00a0next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a\u00a0community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will\u00a0use as the community sees\u00a0best.</p><p>In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the\u00a0country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human rights, governments and industry</emphasis>Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set\u00a0out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</p><p>Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate governance</emphasis></p><p>Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on\u00a0the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery.</p><p>In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the\u00a02023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for\u00a0senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both\u00a0vesting in 2026.</p><p>Carbon management framework (CMF)</p><p>We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes.</p><p>To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and\u00a0generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per\u00a0unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each\u00a0other.</p><p>For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our\u00a0journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:</p><p>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025\u00a0[A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and\u00a0achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030\u00a0and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material.</p><p>In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our\u00a0annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to\u00a0build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate standards and benchmarks</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition.</emphasis></p><p>They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties\u00a0and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria.</p><p>Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations.</p><p>Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as\u00a0our\u00a0efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over\u00a0the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as\u00a0evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate\u00a0disclosures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG rating agencies [B]</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISS</emphasis>The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in\u00a0the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.</p><p>Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are\u00a0rated on a 12-point scale from A+ (best) to D-(worst).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Initiatives</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transition Pathway Initiative</emphasis>The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark.</p><p>TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a\u00a0company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050).</p><p>In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the\u00a0highest score of four (strategic assessment) for\u00a0the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks\u00a0and\u00a0opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This\u00a0exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90)</p><p>In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\u00b0C benchmark. This is the\u00a0result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Action 100+</emphasis>Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with\u00a0assets of around $68 trillion.</p><p>Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three\u202fhigh-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>The\u00a0disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May\u00a029, 2023.</p><p>We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that\u00a0our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome\u00a0in their assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures</emphasis>Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.</p><p>Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in\u00a0the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cautionary note</emphasis></p><p>The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general.

In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net carbon intensity</emphasis>Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or\u00a0its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net-zero emissions target</emphasis>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking non-GAAP measures</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report.</p><p>We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additional information</emphasis>As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e( CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>LEI Number: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70Published: March 14, 2024Classification: Additional Regulated Information required to be disclosed under the laws of the United Kingdom</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000929115en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJD-MKK1-JDPT-Y530-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"25557\"/><timeReceived>08:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 14, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The investment will enable PUR to accelerate its growth, further develop its operations, and support the scaling of natural climate solutions globally - working with nature to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions whilst generating multiple environmental and societal co-benefits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Humanity is facing an unprecedented climate crisis and investing in nature is an essential part of the solution,\" said Tristan Lecomte, Founder of PUR Projet. \"This crisis is bigger than us. Bregal's investment in PUR will help us scale nature-based solutions projects worldwide and further strengthen the impact that we have on the communities we partner with across the globe.\"</emphasis></p><p>Founded in 2008, PUR is a certified B Corp and a pioneer in the development of \"insetting\" - working with clients to develop NbS projects within their supply chain which are designed to sequester and store carbon emissions whilst creating positive impacts for communities and the ecosystems they inhabit. The Company has partnered with corporates and leading brands, implementing over fifty projects to date, with a particular focus on agroforestry and regenerative agriculture within coffee, cocoa, and other commodity supply chains globally.</p><p>Designed in close partnership with local communities, PUR's NbS projects aim to maintain and restore essential ecosystem services, improve community resilience through capacity building and income diversification activities, and support essential climate mitigation efforts. Through these projects, the Company has supported more than 50,000 farmers in rural areas across six continents; worked with communities to restore and preserve over 300,000 hectares of land; and planted over 20 million new trees.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Making capital work for the good of people and the planet is a societal imperative,\" said Alain Carrier, CEO of Bregal. \"As a firm, responsible and sustainable investment practices are a core part of our investment philosophy, and we are excited to be partnering with a mission-driven company such as PUR, as the first step on our journey to launching a dedicated impact platform - Bregal Sphere.\"</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Our partnership with Bregal comes at a crucial point in PUR's journey, as we seek to strengthen our global project portfolio and create better impact while allowing more precise measurements (biodiversity, water, soil, livelihoods),\" said Alexandre Schouler, Managing Director of PUR. \"There is a clear need for companies to take ambitious climate action and we are excited to support leading corporates to achieve their Net Zero strategies, through nature-based interventions.\"</emphasis></p><p>Bregal's investment in PUR will aim to help scale the global development and deployment of high-quality NbS projects and support efforts to address the significant financing gap for nature and biodiversity. Going forward, the Bregal Sphere platform will look to deploy targeted capital to help address key societal and environmental challenges in a responsible and sustainable way.</p><p>About PUR Projet</p><p>PUR Projet (\"PUR\") is a leading international developer of high-quality nature-based solutions (\"NbS\") projects, with a 14-year track record of field-based project development.

The country aims to achieve this target by increasing the share of solar and wind to 54% (from 2,000\u00a0MW to 3,070 MW)\u00a0by 2030 and decreasing the share of coal by 73.5% (from 7,940\u00a0MW to 2,120 MW)\u00a0by 2030. Under its unconditional target (using its domestic resources), in the energy sector Myanmar seeks to\u00a0avoid\u00a0105 MtCO2eq\u00a0by 2030 from the BAU. By 2030, the share of solar and wind will remain unchanged, and coal will decrease by 54% from the BAU to 3,620MW.</p><p>The country has set 2030 targets for improvement of energy efficiency of the residential sector by 8%, the industrial sector by 7%, the commercial sector by 4%, and other sectors by 1%. In addition, through the distribution of 5.1 million fuel-efficient cookstoves, Myanmar will achieve a cumulative emissions reduction of approximately 13 MtCO2e. The government has also set an unconditional target to support the distribution of one million LPG stoves resulting in an emission reduction of 15 MtCO2eq\u00a0by 2030.</p><p>In the agriculture sector, the country has introduced a new conditional cumulative target of sequestrating 10.4 MtCO2eq\u00a0through promotion of tree planting and agroforestry.\u00a0 Within the forest land and other land use sector, Myanmar has set a conditional target of reducing deforestation by 50% by the year 2030, resulting in a cumulative emissions reduction of 257 million tCO2e (against the 2005-2015 baseline)\u00a0over the period of 2021-2030. The country has also set an unconditional target to reduce deforestation by 25% by the year 2030, resulting in a cumulative net emissions reduction of 124 MtCO2eq.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Myanmar First/Myanmar Updated NDC July 2021.pdf\">Myanmar's government press release</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENNGYN-84758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENNGYN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63FN-9D11-DXSK-G3J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465327</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"319\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Enerdata s.a.s.

The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen expressed her impressions regarding the outcome of this year\u2019s meeting in Egypt, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_22_7043\">admitting</url> that \u201cWe have treated some of the symptoms but not cured the patient from its fever.\u201d Negotiations were dominated by loss and damage funding, a new agenda item pushed by the G77, a group of more than 130 developing countries and China \u2013 but little substance was achieved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Loss and damage refer to the negative impact of climate change that can be neither mitigated nor adapted to. Extreme weather events, such as storms, floods and heatwaves, and slow-onset events, including sea level rise, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and diversification, could lead to economic and non-economic consequences for vulnerable countries, particularly small island states and the least developed group of countries.</p><p>However, the concept is vague, difficult to quantify and not well defined in climate policy, while the Paris Agreement does not establish it as a legally binding obligation.</p><p>The EU was initially opposed to this idea fearing unlimited liability and time constraints, and instead emphasised the existing mechanisms, such as the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage, the Santiago Network, the Glasgow Dialogue or the German-led Global Shield, which aim at facilitating dialogue and providing technical assistance.</p><p>While a deal was struck in the end, it came at the expense of fossil fuel reduction goals and opened the door to arduous follow-up negotiations to hammer out the details.</p><p>Despite the fact that Brussels has pledged more stringent CO2-reduction goals during the summit, the numerous pledges that form the bulk of COP27\u2019s conclusions will not suffice to effectively tackle the enormous challenges posed by climate change in a world that has just reached eight billion inhabitants \u2013 many of whom struggle with growing food insecurity, only exacerbated against the background of the Ukraine-Russia war.</p><p>Indeed, one of the crises that fell by the wayside at this year\u2019s COP is whether we will be able to feed the growing world population. According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the impact of soil degradation could amount to 23 trillion dollars in lost food ecosystem services and income worldwide by 2050.</p><p>Worse, UN reports highlight that soil erosion could reduce crop yields by up to 10% by 2050. In light of this and because managing losses and damages may be more challenging for locations with unsustainable development patterns, inequity, marginalisation and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods, the need for a focus on systemic and innovative solutions is an obvious priority.</p><p>Adapting modern, less resource-intensive farming techniques is thus a low-hanging fruit of the global food ecosystem. This is especially the case given that the agricultural sector is expected to be highly affected by the sea level rise and extreme weather conditions while also contributing to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions and consuming nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s fresh water.</p><p>As such, the combination of climate, geopolitical and demographic pressures has created an urgent need to redirect the focus on actionable results and to fundamentally rethink current unsustainable practices characterising intensive farming, namely overgrazing, deforestation, the use of heavy machinery, decline in organic matter in soil, and soil contamination, to address pressing issues linked to climate change and food security.</p><p>But unlike the contentious issue of phasing out fossil fuels worldwide, a solution does exist to square the circle between restoring the ecosystem while also boosting yields and cutting key inputs (like water and fertiliser): regenerative agriculture.</p><p>A farmer that uses regenerative methods \u2013 crop rotation, managed livestock grazing, and low-to-no tilling \u2013 mitigate climate change effects by building organic matter and increasing the soil\u2019s water-holding capacity. In parallel, regenerative agriculture helps farmers deal with climate change impacts by making them resilient to flooding and drought while tapping into the sector\u2019s mitigation potential via carbon capture (due to conservation tillage), avoiding disease and pest problems and providing nutrients for the plant.</p><p>This leads to wider positive knock-on effects as it contributes to biodiversity as well. For instance, agroforestry enabled the rediscovery of Faidherbia, a nitrogen-fixing tree that facilitates crop growth thanks to reverse phenology. In other words, regenerative agriculture works with the environment surrounding it.</p><p>Aside from its climate and food security benefits, regenerative agriculture could generate 70 billion dollars for African farmers along with five million jobs by 2040, according to the International Union for Conversation of Nature and Vivid Economics.</p><p>At the same time, such innovations apply to developed and developing countries, including the EU, where climate losses and damages have also been mounting. It is also noteworthy to mention that a group of 102 CEOs of global companies wrote an open letter in the run-up to COP27 calling on governments to use regenerative agriculture practices to increase climate adaptation and resilience.</p><p>If there is one lesson to be drawn from COP27, it is that smart and innovative solutions must shape our future given the colossal nature and urgency of the issues at stake in a world whose population is slated to keep growing for decades to come and in which one crisis follows another in a global domino effect.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionclimateenvironmentopinionslowprogressatcop27underlinesneedforsystemicsolutions</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XF-SY91-F03F-K2JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

They are building a tree nursery representing an Ethiopian lion, visible from space. The goal? To alert public authorities to the climate crisis while promoting the local agricultural sector.</p><p>This ambitious project, entitled \"Trees for Life,\" is being headed up by Ethiopian charity Rural Organization for Betterment of Agro-Pastoralists (ROBA). It is supported by the Earth Art Studio, the British Council, the Canadian Kwantlen University and Scottish planners from the city of Dundee. They are all working to create a 50-meter lion-shaped nursery, which ROBA describes as the world's first living art installation.\u00a0</p><p>Located near a school in Kofele, the nursery will help preserve the wildlife, flora and culture of the Oromia region, the most populous in Ethiopia. Local people, in particular women and younger generations, will also be able to learn much-needed skills in tree farming and agroforestry. \"When I speak with elders, they describe us as victims of climate change who have lost our culture. When you ask them about trees, and how Oromos maintained them, the key players they indicate are culture and art,\" Hussein Watta, director and founder of ROBA, told Hyperallergic. \"When a practice is ingrained into a people's culture -- in art and song, or even in technology and photography -- they do it better. My goal right now is to mobilize the people around this.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The art of planting trees</emphasis></p><p>This desire to include an artistic component in this project translates into the lion shape chosen for the nursery. This animal is anything but insignificant for Ethiopians, as it is one of the country's national symbols. The Abyssinian lion is a \"keystone\" species, whose predominant role determines the plant and animal species found in their habitat. Its presence in the Ethiopian highlands determines the composition of the rest of the region's ecosystem. While it once reigned supreme on the African continent, researchers now estimate that the Abyssinian lion could disappear by 2050 due to massive deforestation of the savannah and poaching.\u00a0</p><p>While the Trees of Life project can't rebuild their natural habitat, the hope is that it can raise awareness about the important role trees play in our ecosystem. \"If we can truly educate our people about the art of tree planting, to prevent soil erosion, limit pollution, create jobs, and regulate the water cycle, I believe no one would cut down a single tree again,\" Hussein Watta told Hyperallergic.\u00a0</p><p>Despite frequent poor weather conditions that have hit Ethiopia in recent months, the nursery produced more than 8,000 trees by May. The structure should be able to maintain a \u00a0production of 10,000 to 12,000 trees per six-month growing cycle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6482-31Y1-F19C-X088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>ENTERTAINMENT</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 8, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;

Developed countries have provided only $80bn of the $100bn in climate finance they pledged to contribute annually to developing countries; of this, less than $20bn was provided in total to Africa between 2016 and 2019.</p><p>Voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) can play a role in filling this gap while driving a sustainable, inclusive economic transformation in Africa. Fully developed VCMs could not only generate attractive returns on investment in African countries, but also help them meet their own environmental challenges, from boosting renewable power to adopting cleaner cooking methods to reducing deforestation. For example, the recently published UN Global Crisis Response Group's 3rd Brief on Energy highlights the opportunity for carbon markets to provide the necessary financing to overcome issues related to the high upfront costs of clean energy projects.</p><p>Fatal missteps</p><p>Unfortunately, this potential is far from being realised. The organisations we represent - focused on speeding the energy transition, ending energy poverty and tackling climate change- have launched the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) to accelerate the growth of Africa's voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>Globally, VCMs have grown strongly in the last five years. Last year saw a greater than 50% increase in real demand (as measured by the retirement of existing carbon credits), to a total of nearly $700m. But of the total credits issued from 2016 to 2021, only about 11% stem from African countries, and the bulk of these come from a few large projects. In 2021, Africa credits were just 15% of the global traded volume. This is just scratching the surface. We estimate Africa could generate at least 1.5 - 2.5 Gt of CO2e annually - and at USD20/tonne CO2 this could be worth $50bn per year.</p><p>Some innovative projects already underway demonstrate what success could look like.</p><p>Creating victory</p><p>SunCulture is a climate-tech platform for rural emerging markets that has raised $40m to provide small holder farmers with reliable access to water, irrigation, lighting and mobile charging through off-grid solar technology. Their solar irrigation systems allow farmers in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African markets to switch from CO2-emitting petroleum and diesel pumps to solar pumps.</p><p>This reduces emissions while creating sustainable agriculture jobs less dependent on rainfall. SunCulture is working on developing its carbon credit business to reduce end-user prices and increase access to their systems -they expect to generate over 2Mt of CO2 emissions reduction credits between 2020-2027.  SunCulture intends to scale across several sub-Saharan African countries in the coming years, selling hundreds of thousands of solar pumps by 2025.</p><p>KOKO Networks is 'the technology platform protecting African forests'. KOKO is driving an energy transition across Kenya, replacing deforestation-charcoal with sustainable bioethanol delivered via a unique utility platform that resembles a telecommunications company in scale and sophistication.  Over 600,000 households now cook with KOKO Fuel, with carbon revenues solving the affordability gap instead of government subsidies.</p><p>Potential in the continent</p><p>Africa also has a significant share of global potential for nature-based credits. One of the largest REDD+ projects on the continent is the Kasigau Corridor in Kenya, which seeks to protect endangered species, prevent forest degradation and drive direct climate finance to local communities for self-determined, transformative economic development.</p><p>In partnership with local communities, Wildlife Works has co-created new economic opportunities, increased food and water security, and improved access to healthcare and education. The Kasigau Corridor covers over 500,000 acres of dryland forest and will generate enough carbon credits to offset 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually for the next 30 years.</p><p>The Acorn agroforestry platform established by Dutch financial institution Rabobank encourages small farmers in a number of African countries to plant trees on their land, improving soil quality and extracting CO2 from the atmosphere. It uses satellite data to measure biomass growth on participating farms and issues certified carbon credits that can be bought by companies, like Microsoft, seeking to offset their emissions.</p><p>A number of factors are holding back the wider adoption of carbon credit projects across the continent. First, it is very hard for lower-income African countries, which have limited funds and technical capacity, to participate in the carbon market on fair terms.</p><p>Prices are unpredictable and many of the climate benefits Africa provides don't fit into current carbon credit methodologies. Second, there are challenges with the pipeline -the ecosystem of project developers is very limited in scale and scope: 65+ percent of project developers in Africa operate only one project and 80 percent operate in only one country.</p><p>Third, navigating land rights for nature-based projects can be challenging. Fourth, it can be expensive to validate and verify individual projects. And finally, market mechanisms to de-risk investment in supply have not been developed.</p><p>Future focus</p><p>Our joint initiative, the newly established Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), aims to develop a structured approach to address each of these issues. By the time of the COP 27 climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt next month, we plan to announce an ambition for VCMs in Africa, partner with leading African governments and develop a concrete roadmap for how to scale African VCMs in the years ahead. As a neutral player in the space, ACMI will serve as an accelerant, not a competitor, to existing work.</p><p>Carbon credits and associated products have the potential to strengthen African economies and advance the global fight against climate change while creating jobs, protecting ecosystems and expanding energy access.</p><p>Success would mean radically reducing the time it takes to generate credits, increasing the underlying quality and price of African carbon credits, and significantly increasing the volume of credits produced. The time to act is now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT191020220000503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66ND-KGR1-JCH9-G4GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 19, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

However, for 2019-2020, only $46bn was mobilised. Therefore, during the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and Drought, held in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire from 9-20 May, Gilbert Houngbo, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) president, made an appeal to do more, and faster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Togolese, who will take up the post as head of the International Labour Organisation in October, has headed the UN agency specialising in agriculture and food since 2017. IFAD is very active on the continent, notably through the granting of loans to small farmers, promotion of agroforestry, training in water-saving cultivation techniques and advocacy for women. Supporting the Great Green Wall project, IFAD has also pledged $130m to the Abidjan Legacy programme, launched on the sidelines of COP15, which aims to strengthen African food chains.</p><p>Despite the difficulties, this former Togolese prime minister believes in the capacity to speed things up on the climate front.</p><p>You have insisted on the urgent need to increase funding to ensure the continent's climate resilience. Who should pay?</p><p>Gilbert Houngbo: I prefer the term 'pay' to 'invest' in order to develop our infrastructure. Given that Africa accounts for only 4% to 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it would be ecologically unfair to ask it to make the largest contribution. Especially since, at the 2015 Paris climate conference, OECD countries pledged to mobilise $100bn a year to help southern countries cope with the consequences of global warming. The aim is not to obtain new commitments from them, but to implement those they have already made and to combine them with the efforts that African countries must also make.</p><p>What should the private sector contribute?</p><p>If the private sector is expected to participate in financing, it must also be the driving force behind investment in technologies that will facilitate the energy transition and resilience. Innovation must help combat droughts and floods, better manage natural resources (including water), increase productivity, and speed up the processing of basic goods.</p><p>The results of the Great Green Wall, an emblematic project led by the African Development Bank and supported by a large number of partners, including IFAD, are very modest. Only 18% of the objectives were met, according to the latest evaluation published in September 2020. How can this be explained?</p><p>When it was launched 10 years ago, the project - although ambitious, pioneering and innovative because it combined both environmental and security factors - was greeted with a certain amount of scepticism. It suffered from a lack of political commitment. However, in recent years, things have changed, which will make it possible to accelerate both funding and implementation.</p><p>The fact that several countries wish to join the initiative, in addition to the 11 initial promoters, is evidence of this new dynamism. At the same time, much effort is being made to improve the synergy between the stakeholders and monitoring of the project, which guarantees better results.</p><p>In the immediate future, the continent must deal with supply difficulties and soaring food prices that are causing social tensions. Do you fear food riots?</p><p>I am worried about the risks of undermining social cohesion due to the rising cost of living, especially as production is expected to decrease due to the reduced availability of fertilisers, agricultural inputs and seeds. More generally, I am afraid that the current situation will be seen as a one-off crisis to which a short-term response will suffice before returning to business as usual.</p><p>Of course, it has. It has been exacerbated by the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and, more recently, by the impact of the war in Ukraine. On the continent, there are about 50 countries, 30% of those imports come from Ukraine and Russia. Each year, the continent imports $70bn worth of food, an amount that will reach $100bn by 2025 if nothing is done. The solution is known: Africa must increase its local production.</p><p>How can this be achieved?</p><p>There are a number of levers to pull. Increasing African productivity is key, as it is the only way to increase the volume of harvests while ensuring competitiveness.</p><p>This requires investment in equipment and training. It is also necessary to add a minimum amount of added value - i.e. a certain degree of processing - to the commodity chains in order to better preserve products and improve farmers' income. We also know that access to land as well as to local, national and sub-regional markets is crucial.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT2405202200006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65HW-7711-F00C-6278-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 24, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Human beings are displacing the planet's other species at an unprecedented rate, a disaster that the landmark U.N. Biodiversity Conference known as COP15 is focused on this week in Montreal. We're a unique menace, but we at least have a unique ability to recognize it and do something about it.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first step toward recovery, of course, is admitting your problem, and the conference's draft plan warns up front that a million species will face extinction if we don't clean up our act. But while the delegates in Montreal are pointing fingers at everything from plastics to pesticides to invasive species, biodiversity loss is not that complicated a mystery.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The basic problem is that we've converted half of Earth's habitable land into agricultural land. We're destroying and degrading the habitats of other species to grow food for our own.       </p><p>This means the fate of the world's bugs, bunnies and other creatures and critters - and what's left of the forests, wetlands and other habitats they call home - depends more than anything else on what we put in our mouths and how it gets made. Unfortunately, telling people what to eat and farmers how to farm are politically unpalatable tasks, which helps explain why yakfests like COP15 tend to obscure the problem with word salad.       </p><p>Environmentalists hope to leave Montreal with commitments from governments to preserve 30 percent of the earth by 2030 and to meet 21 other targets. But governments have already failed to achieve less ambitious conservation goals set for 2010 and 2020. There's also buzz around nailing down corporate commitments to greener supply chains, but COP15 is mostly dancing around the crux of the biodiversity crisis.       </p><p>The crux is that if current eating and farming trends continue, the world will clear land equal to at least one and a quarter Indias by 2050. That would be a disaster for the climate and wildlife, dooming carbon-rich and biodiverse ecosystems like the Amazon and Congo rainforests.       </p><p>So those eating and farming trends better not continue. Humanity needs to start shrinking our agricultural footprint and expanding our natural footprint, after thousands of years of doing the reverse.       </p><p>This will be an extraordinary challenge, because we'll also need to produce more than 7.4 quadrillion additional calories every year to feed our growing population, in an era when climate-fueled droughts, heat waves, floods and blights could make it harder to grow food.       </p><p>You can see why word salad can seem more appetizing.       </p><p>You can also see why promises to conserve land or promote deforestation-free products can ring hollow. Governments can pledge to ban land clearing, but when their people get hungry, land will get cleared. Some companies might sign agreements to avoid soy or beef from newly deforested land, but it won't do much if other companies keep buying soy or beef from newly deforested land.       </p><p>If we are serious about cleaning up the mess we're making for less influential species, there are four things individuals as well as nations and corporations can do.       </p><p>The first is to eat less meat, which would be a lot easier if meat weren't so beloved and delicious. Limiting access to cheeseburgers can turn politicians into ex-politicians, so it's no coincidence that the Montreal draft mentions changing diets only in passing in its 16th target. But the inconvenient truth is that when we eat cows, chickens and other livestock, we might as well be eating macaws, jaguars and other endangered species.       </p><p>That's because livestock chew up far more land per calorie than crops. Producing beef is 100 times as land-intensive as cultivating potatoes and 55 times as land-intensive as peas or nuts. Livestock now use nearly 80 percent of agricultural land while producing less than 20 percent of calories. Cattle are the leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon, followed by soybeans, another commodity, which get fed to pigs and chickens.       </p><p>Meat consumption is expected to increase dramatically as billions of the global poor escape poverty. If Americans continue to average three burgers a week while the developing world starts to follow our path, it's hard to see how the Amazon survives.       </p><p>But it's at least possible that we could shrink agricultural footprints by shifting our diets toward meat made without livestock, like the plant-based substitutes offered by companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat or maybe someday cultured meat grown from animal cells.       </p><p>The next thing we need to do is waste less food<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. </emphasis>About a third of the food grown on Earth is lost or tossed before it reaches our mouths, which means a third of the land (as well as the water, fertilizer and other resources) used to grow that food is also wasted. But the Montreal text includes only a single mention of the need to \"halve per capita global food waste,\" with no suggestions of what technological, behavioral and policy changes could help to meet such an ambitious goal.       </p><p>Every acre of land on Earth matters, because we desperately need to grow more food, provide habitats for more native flora and fauna and store more carbon to limit climate change. And that's why it's particularly crazy to use the Earth's limited land to grow fuel. The third way to ease the global land squeeze would be to stop using productive farmland for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel - and to stop burning trees for power - but the Montreal plan doesn't even address the topic.       </p><p>In fact, there's global momentum to expand bioenergy's dominion over the land. A new paper in the journal Nature estimates that new European Union policies could wipe out half the continent's most biodiverse grasslands and divert a fifth of its cropland to energy crops, which would lead to land clearing overseas to replace the lost food. The E.U. is also promoting wood-burning power plants, a recipe for massive forest cutting around the world.       </p><p>Farm and forest interests have so much political power that government efforts to increase demand for crops and wood are often considered untouchable. But if biodiversity is a real priority, they can't be.       </p><p>Finally, if we're going to shrink our agricultural footprint enough to stop deforestation and hopefully restore some degraded ecosystems so they can once again serve as wildlife habitats and carbon sinks, farmers will have to supersize their yields enough to make a lot more food with a lot less land. And while the 20th century's Green Revolution raised yields by using fossil-fuel-derived fertilizers, toxic pesticides and other environmentally damaging innovations, the 21st century will require some greener ones that can ramp up productivity without messing up the planet.       </p><p>Once again, this doesn't seem like a priority in Montreal. There's been much more focus on regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and other gentler, lower-yield alternatives to intensive industrial farming that can improve biodiversity on farmland. The problem is that they can require more farmland to produce the same amount of food, accelerating the destruction of the natural lands that provide far more biodiversity than farmland ever can - and suck far more heat-trapping carbon from our overloaded atmosphere.       </p><p>Earth now has more than 12 billion acres of agricultural land, an area twice the size of North America. Adding more is the surest way to wipe out more species - and maybe, someday, our own.       </p><p>Michael Grunwald, a host of the \"Climavores\" podcast, is working on a book about how to feed the world without frying it.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.
