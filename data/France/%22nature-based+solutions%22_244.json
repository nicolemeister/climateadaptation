For the soft drinks sector, water is more than a raw material: it's our main ingredient, making up over 90% of every soft drink. It's also vital to our operations, from maintaining hygiene and safety standards to ensuring the sustainability of the agricultural ingredients we depend on.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>That's why we welcomed the release of the European Commission's new EU Water Resilience Strategy in early June. This new Strategy is a timely and welcome step toward ensuring that Europe becomes more water-resilient.<br/></p><p><br/>Across Europe, water stress is rising. Nearly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/water-stress-is-a-major#:~:text=About%2030%20%25%20of%20Europe%E2%80%99s%20population%20is%20affected,increasing%20the%20frequency%2C%20magnitude%2C%20and%20impact%20of%20droughts.\">a third of Europeans now live in areas with permanent water scarcity</url>, and 70% face seasonal pressure during summer months. Floods and droughts are intensifying, and the natural balance of our watersheds is being tested. Between 2010 and 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/sendai-framework-action/water-risks-and-resilience#:~:text=Water%20related%20disaster%20deaths%20have%20more%20than%20doubled,were%20due%20to%20water-related%20disasters%20%28Sendai%20Framework%20Monitor%29\">almost 95% of infrastructure losses reported in the EU were linked to water-related disasters</url>.<br/></p><p><br/>Now is the time to step up and the newly released Strategy is a move in the right direction.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the Strategy gets right and what it needs to further champion </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>We're particularly encouraged by the Strategy's recognition of one simple but critical truth: water challenges are local. Conditions vary widely from one river basin to the next. Local context, climate, ecosystems, and community needs must all guide action. A one-size-fits-all approach simply won't deliver.<br/></p><p><br/>And here's something we think the Strategy also gets right: it's not about adding layers of new legislation. We indeed applaud its continued focus on implementation. Europe already has robust water legislation. The key now is to make it work in practice.<br/></p><p><br/>At UNESDA, we represent an industry committed to being part of the solution. While our sector accounts for only a small share of industrial water use, <url normalizedValue=\"https://unesda.eu/our-priorities/addressing-water-challenges/\">we take our responsibility seriously</url> - and we're already acting by:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>improving water efficiency through reduction, reuse, and recycling in production</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>replenishing the water in our products through initiatives that restore water to nature and local communities</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>supporting nature-based solutions that enhance ecosystems and buffer against floods and droughts</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>promoting good water governance, sourcing water-sustainable ingredients, and advocating for regenerative agriculture</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>preventing water pollution and treating wastewater to high standards</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>and by supporting improved access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene in the communities we serve</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>We see particular value in expanding the role of replenishment initiatives. These represent a powerful and proven way to build local water resilience. They act as \"sponges\" that retain, store and release water, helping to prevent floods and ease droughts. They are already being implemented by our members with measurable success and we would welcome more formal recognition of these actions as part of the EU's resilience toolbox.<br/></p><p><br/>Another key, and perhaps the most debated, element of the Strategy is the proposed water efficiency target, including a 10% reduction by 2030. From our perspective, the priority lies in promoting genuine water stewardship. What can truly make a difference is setting proper stewardship standards and driving collective action. That means ensuring every actor with a significant water footprint takes actions to make circular water use the norm.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Turning ambition into impact</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Looking ahead, the Strategy has also earmarked over (EURO)15 billion in financing through the European Investment Bank to support water-related projects between 2025 and 2027. That is a major opportunity to scale up nature-based solutions, upgrade infrastructure, and deploy innovation where it's most needed.<br/></p><p><br/>Still, there are practical challenges to address to help us (and others) go further. Examples include unlocking regulatory barriers for the reuse of water in production processes and finding solutions for the discharge of wastewater after water filtration processes.<br/></p><p><br/>Europe's water moment has arrived and our sector stands ready to contribute. We have ideas, experience, and proven models to share. Let's work together to protect one of Europe's most vital shared resources.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Delphine Close is Senior Public Affairs Manager at UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe.</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetopinioneusnewwaterstrategymustbegroundedinlocalactionandsharedresponsibility</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G75-N353-RT7W-D006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

These are not distant environmental concerns, but existential issues.\"<br/><br/><br/>In Kazakhstan's southern regions, glacier melt accounts for up to 90 per cent of river flow, critical for irrigation and drinking water alike. The country's water-intensive sectors, particularly <url normalizedValue=\"https://qazinform.com/news/water-saving-technologies-to-cover-13-mln-ha-of-irrigated-land-in-kazakhstan-384d48\">agriculture</url>, contribute heavily to the strain.<br/><br/><br/>\"This figure is even higher than 72 per cent for agricultural uses in Kazakhstan... while placing mounting pressure around snow and glacier-fed rivers like Syrdarya and Illi,\" Neupane added.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reforms to support adaptation</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>To meet this challenge, Kazakhstan is undertaking sweeping reforms.<br/><br/><br/>At the Astana International Forum in May, Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev <url normalizedValue=\"https://astanatimes.com/2025/05/aif-2025-spotlights-water-security-in-central-asia-urges-reform-and-regional-unity/\">announced</url> major infrastructure investments, including 42 new reservoirs, 30 reconstructions and the overhaul of more than 14,000 kilometres of irrigation canals.<br/><br/><br/>A new digital water platform, hydro.gov.kz, will centralise real-time data. Subsidies for water-saving technologies such as sprinkler and drip irrigation systems have been raised to 80 per cent.<br/><br/><br/>\"Kazakhstan views water not only as a natural resource, but also as a powerful driver of cooperation, sustainable development and regional stability,\" Bozumbayev stated.<br/><br/><br/>In June, the country also adopted a new <url normalizedValue=\"https://astanatimes.com/2025/06/new-water-code-sets-framework-for-smarter-resource-use-in-kazakhstan/\">Water Code</url>, seen as a legislative turning point. It introduces concepts such as \"water security\" and \"ecological flow\", mandates basin-level planning, and strengthens protections for small rivers, glaciers and wetlands.<br/><br/><br/>\"These are the recognition of water as an integral part of the environment, the basis of citizens' life and economic development... the introduction of water-saving technologies and adaptation to climate change,\" explained Water Resources Minister Nurzhan Nurzhigitov.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regional collaboration</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Across the region, cooperation is gaining new momentum. The five Central Asian states reached a new water-sharing agreement for the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers.<br/><br/><br/>Tajikistan, which holds more than half of the region's glaciers, is leading with investments in early warning systems and nature-based solutions. This includes glacial lake monitoring, slope reforestation and pilot solar-powered drip irrigation systems in highland farms.<br/><br/><br/>Digital tools are also transforming management.<br/><br/><br/>River basin forecasting platforms now integrate climate, hydrological and crop data, allowing basin authorities in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to optimise irrigation schedules and reservoir releases.<br/><br/><br/>Still, gaps remain in cross-border sharing and governance. \"Water does not stop at borders - but the data often does,\" regional experts <url normalizedValue=\"https://astanatimes.com/2025/06/from-glaciers-to-farms-how-regional-cooperation-is-shaping-central-asias-water-issues/\">warned</url> in a recent opinion piece.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support from international partners</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The European Union is playing a key supporting role. At the 17th Kazakhstan-EU Dialogue Platform in June, both sides <url normalizedValue=\"https://astanatimes.com/2025/06/kazakhstan-eu-join-forces-for-sustainable-water-and-waste-management/\">reaffirmed</url> their commitment to sustainable water management.<br/><br/><br/>Germany pledged support for transboundary cooperation under the Green Central Asia initiative, while the Netherlands proposed a desalination plant in Aktau and a regional flood early warning system.<br/><br/><br/>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is also <url normalizedValue=\"https://astanatimes.com/2025/04/tackling-water-challenges-in-kazakhstan-call-for-collaborative-action-and-sustainable-solutions/\">investing</url> heavily in resilience. Following the devastating floods in 2024, it supported the launch of a flood early warning system for key basins and is now expanding it to include drought forecasting.<br/><br/><br/>In partnership with local authorities, the UN agency has helped develop water management plans for Lake Balkhash and secured climate finance for dam safety, including a $2 million grant from Japan.<br/><br/><br/>The Asian Development Bank's 'Glaciers to Farms' programme, which aims to mobilise up to $3.5 billion in regional investments, supports this transition. ADB Director Yasmin Siddiqi stressed the need for smarter infrastructure and shared incentives.<br/><br/><br/>\"Future investment must avoid repeating past mistakes. They must result in less water use overall through efficiency gains. We need smarter water infrastructure,\" she said, calling for immediate action in the region.<br/><br/><br/>As Central Asia races to adapt to a future shaped by climate volatility and shrinking glaciers, Kazakhstan's efforts demonstrate both the promise and the complexity of developing sustainable solutions.<br/><br/><br/>Whether it is building dams, rewriting laws or digitising river management, the success of one country is inseparable from the fate of its neighbours.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionglobaleuropenewskazakhstanisinvestingtotacklecentralasiawatercrisis</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G89-SXC3-RS1X-01JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

The slow adoption, highlighted by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/product/31829\">NetworkNature report</url>, reveals deeper issues such as policy incoherence across sectors (i.e. climate, agriculture, and biodiversity) and insufficient funding. An added difficulty is the non-binding nature of many NbS related targets. In the absence of a clear legal framework, earmarked funds, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eib.org/en/publications/20230095-investing-in-nature-based-solutions\">private sector involvement</url>, cities and local authorities are left without the budget or guidelines necessary to implement green infrastructure effectively. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Without a policy sea change, NbS implementation will remain fragmented, small-scale, and incapable of achieving the transformative impact Europe desperately needs.</emphasis></p><p>It is essential that the incoming European Commission takes clear and funded steps to bridge these gaps. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/product/31829\">NetworkNature report</url> proposes a series of coordinated steps to unlock the potential of NbS.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The EU must ensure policies coherently integrate and align NbS across all relevant sectors, setting clear, enforceable targets for NbS adoption, along with budgets that enable action.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>We need to break down silos and foster collaboration among stakeholders.

There is <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/network-nature-case-study-keywords/106\">ample evidence</url> that NbS can save money in the long run by reducing flood risks, enhancing air quality, and creating cooler urban microclimates.

Or to put it another way, less than a sixth of what they are right now.</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>It's easy to grow complacent - cynical, even - about climate action at the political level.<br/></p><p><br/>Anyone who was at the COP29 climate conference in Baku last year - as I was - will have sensed the futility of governments wrangling over what seem like pennies, given what's at stake. Added to which the US, which had already ramped up oil and gas production to world record levels under the Biden administration, has pulled out of the Paris Agreement.<br/></p><p><br/>But without the luxury of oil and gas reserves, Europe is now asking if it can afford to replace gas from the east with gas from the leaky fracking fields of America. The proposed 2040 target implies a more profound choice: one between import dependency and missing the target, or accelerating the green transition.<br/></p><p><br/>Seventeen years after Europe's first emissions reduction target was set in law, the appetite for fossil fuels remains high, thanks to the failure to insulate homes, switch heat pumps for gas boilers, or halt the rise of emissions from road transport.<br/></p><p><br/>The scale of investment now needed is beyond any New Deal or Marshall Plan, or the bank bailouts that followed the 2008 financial crisis.<br/></p><p><br/>It took a war with real bullets for Europe's champion of frugality to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/german-parties-strike-deal-to-on-historic-debt-funded-investment-package/\">tear off its self-imposed fiscal straightjacket</url>. Will that logic - coupled with a pooling of European debt, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/eu-agrees-to-set-aside-37-of-recovery-fund-for-green-transition/\">has only ever happened</url> in the face of a global pandemic - be replicated to reach the 90% target?<br/></p><p><br/>The fossil fuel industry will have to back up its talk of \"blue\" hydrogen and sequestering billions of tonnes of CO2 underground with serious investment of its own. The greening of the financial system will have to be accelerated, and questions may have to be asked about the pursuit of shareholder value, boardroom bonuses and GDP growth.<br/></p><p><br/>There is, of course, a risk that progress will be hampered by entrenched political ideologies. For the populist right - and increasingly parties on the traditional conservative centre - positions against climate action are part of a hymn sheet that includes opposition to immigration, culture wars on issues like sexuality, and asserting motorists' right to monopolise city streets.<br/></p><p><br/>These issues need to be dealt with separately. Progress will also require greens and left-wingers to reach across the political divide - and perhaps ask themselves why they have lost much of their traditional voter base to the right.<br/></p><p><br/>Plenty of public and political figures in Europe still claim that climate change is - as Trump would have it - bullshit. Kurt Wilders' Freedom Party won the Dutch election after dismissing climate action as \"unaffordable madness\".<br/></p><p><br/>The disingenuous polemics and spin will have to stop, and a certain gravitas must be injected back into politics.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Roundup</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2040 climate targets revealed -</emphasis> As expected, the Commission has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/seven-key-points-about-the-eus-new-2040-climate-target/\">settled on a proposal</url> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels.

Cities, which can be 10 to 15 \u00b0C hotter than the surrounding land, feel these changes in climate acutely - and are looking for solutions.</p><p>Nature-based solutions, which are \"effective for cooling and water retention in cities,\" have become the tool of choice for most cities, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/newsroom/news/cities-are-key-to-a-climate-resilient-europe\">finds a new report</url> by the European Environment Agency (EEA). This approach is present in 91% of the 19,000 local climate action plans surveyed.\u00a0</p><p>\"They also provide many other benefits, such as space for recreation and reducing pollution,\" the agency adds.\u00a0</p><p>What do nature-based solutions entail? Creating and maintaining parks and urban forests, green roofs and putting in place \"natural water retention measures\" are considered best-practice.</p><p>As a consequence, the report observes a shift in established dogma: from cities opting for either \"grey\" or \"green\" infrastructure to a \"grey with green\" approach.</p><p>Across Europe, how much green infrastructure has been put in place varies greatly. In the Slovak town of Trnava, a mere 7% of space was green, while the Spanish town of Caceres boasts a whopping coverage of 96%.</p><p>While a city may boast a lot of green space, this does not mean that it is accessible for citizens. \"Publicly-accessible green areas\" only account for 3% of the area of European cities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_488931040-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>Positive energy neighbourhoods: Building a resilient and inclusive Europe</h><p>Faced with an energy crisis, Positive Energy Neighbourhoods (PENs) could become Europe's solution for sustainable and energy-efficient urban spaces as it moves forward with the green transition, write Maarten De Groote and Gabi Kaiser.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cities to learn from</emphasis></p><p>Across Europe, some cities stand out. In Madrid, the local government is working on surrounding the city with a ring of trees as part of the 'Madrid 360' project.</p><p>Over the next 10 years the Spanish capital aims to plant two million trees in a 75 kilometre-long forest belt. However, the project struggles with extreme weather events that are harmful to young trees and clashes over land ownership.\u00a0</p><p>The Polish city of Poznan greened urban spaces and opened them to the public. It also established \"city beaches\" on previously unusable brownland along the river Warta.</p><p>In Gothenburg, Sweden, city planners have embraced the\u00a0 rain that pours down on them around 40% of the time. Known as \"Regnlekplatsen\" (a rain playground), these play areas are designed to be most fun for children when it is raining.</p><p>While the report welcomed progress made to date, it concluded that more work is needed to 'mainstream' climate adaption across all industries and levels of decision making.\u00a0The report argues for stakeholders to establish a \"common vision for what a resilient urban future looks like,\" which combines nature integration with consideration of citizen's well-being.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Donagh Cagney/Chris Power]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentnewseureport91ofcitieslooktonaturebasedsolutionsinfaceofclimatechange</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BX6-BTF1-JCMC-W3WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

As professionals directly concerned with this debate, representatives of the Fourth Estate are ever ready to add their two cents to the conversation.<br/></p><p><br/>And discussion was lively after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/money-for-nothing-commission-pours-millions-into-struggling-eu-media/\">Euractiv revealed</url> that the EU is putting rather more money into a coterie of outlets than had previously been acknowledged. If journalists are to hold authorities to account, to what extent is this mission compromised by subsidies that allow them to carry out that task? And even if you don't depend on public funds, does this not make you beholden to commercial interests? Such questions could keep Brussels media circles animated until the cows come home.<br/></p><p><br/>Having spent most of my time in Brussels managing a small media outlet, I know the struggle of competing with far larger operations. Not everyone has the luxury of a multi-million-euro parent company backing them, and it's a tough war of attrition. For all the canny efforts small media use to attract an audience and deliver a fresh take on current affairs, it is disingenuous to overlook the structural advantages that big media enjoy. Should we not provide a helping hand to smaller initiatives in the name of media plurality?<br/></p><p><br/>And setting aside the question of how media manages to be commercially viable, subsidies are surely not the main barrier to critiquing our legislators. More problematic is the closeness of journalists and public officials, where friendliness is rewarded with insider access to valuable information. This pursuit of leaks is incentivised by the concentration of lobbies that cluster around the institutions.<br/></p><p><br/>These are issues most of us will be familiar with, though how we address them - and the tenor of that argument - depends largely on the stakes, which are inevitably personal. Still, we could certainly design a more democratic way of dispensing with public money. Which is kind of the whole point, if we are to accept that the media's primary duty is to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">demos</emphasis>.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A dull Danish presidency</emphasis><br/>Denmark took over the EU presidency on Tuesday, during which it will focus on a secure, competitive, and green agenda. The generally discreet Scandinavian country also champions a hardline approach to migration - which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/the-capitals-denmarks-pro-climate-anti-migrant-pm/\">puts Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at odds with other European Socialists</url>.<br/></p><p><br/>But Denmark's guiding principle during its six-month stint at the helm of policy-making will be running a tight ship - which, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/opinion/the-brief-danish-presidency-ditches-borgen-for-boring/\">as Magnus Lund Nielsen writes</url>, means no fuss, limited expectations, and a plea to opposition parties to lay off domestic spats until the duty has been served.<br/></p><p><br/>Are you not entertained? Not if Denmark can do anything to help it.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tariff countdown</emphasis><br/>With Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs on EU goods due to kick in on 9 July, negotiations to strike a deal were led by trade chief Maros Sefcovic in Washington. At last week's EUCO summit, France's Emmanuel Macron argued Europe should not bend to the punitive levies. But with the deadline now so near, Germany has pushed for a quick compromise to prevent the worst-case scenario.<br/></p><p><br/>The latest hope is that the EU pulls off the same deal as the UK - an \"agreement in principle\" that would keep Trump's 10% baseline tariffs in place. It's something trade ministers had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/barely-a-deal-eu-trade-ministers-slam-uk-us-trade-agreement/\">scoffed at a few weeks ago</url> but looks much more appealing when faced with the imminent alternative.<br/></p><p><br/>And it's not only ministers who have shifted in their attitude towards the negotiations; journalists, too, have lacked consistency in reporting on the saga - as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/why-its-obvious-the-eu-will-accept-trumps-10-baseline-tariff/\">Thomas Moller-Nielsen points out</url>.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2040 climate targets</emphasis><br/>The EU revealed on Wednesday its 2040 target for greenhouse gas emissions, which must be reduced by 90% compared to 1990. The scale of ambition is huge: it will mean cutting emissions to less than a sixth of what they are right now.<br/></p><p><br/>Achieving the goals will need a massive effort from all sectors - and citizens won't be spared <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/what-a-90-emissions-cut-could-mean-for-eu-citizens/\">the knock-on costs</url>. Indeed, the project won't be managed solely through efficiency gains and scaling up renewables; it will require a complete change in mindset.

In the end, Poland's image as Kyiv's staunchest ally has been badly dented.<br/></p><p><br/>Tusk's final remarks to the press at the end of a rather bland June summit - usually an opportunity for presidencies to take a victory lap and trumpet their achievements - were lacklustre. A meeting with the Polish national press the day after descended into a parochial affair, dominated by questions on domestic affairs and Tusk's barbs against his conservative opposition.<br/></p><p><br/>For months, Tusk's government held back from bold policy moves, blaming the looming presidential election - which they lost regardless. Having done precious little to actually shape EU policy, Poland now hands over the rotating presidency, leaving Tusk to face a brewing domestic storm. On the menu: a fragmented parliament, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/opinion/the-brief-fighting-for-the-hearts-of-polish-farmers/\">swelling farmer protests</url>, and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/polish-presidential-result-spells-trouble-for-tusk/\">surging extreme far-right</url> led by Slawomir Mentzen, which could shake up the political scene before the next parliamentary polls in 2027 (or earlier).<br/></p><p><br/>The past six months have highlighted a chronic Brussels affliction: big countries should, in theory, have the heft to shape collective decisions regardless of local distractions. But when national leaders are too distracted by domestic concerns, their European agendas are invariably hijacked.<br/></p><p><br/>Poland is not alone in this.<br/></p><p><br/>France, during its presidency in 2022, was similarly inward-looking, obsessing over its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/editors-take-rocky-start-as-french-presidency-turns-out-very-french/\">\"Frenchness\"</url> as meetings, documents and debates had to be conducted in French. It was an exercise in nationalist box-ticking that stifled efficiency and reflected Macron's constant fear of being outflanked by the far-right before an upcoming presidential election.<br/></p><p><br/>Denmark may offer a calmer interlude. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, a leftist pioneer of hard-line migration policies, enjoys broad domestic support for her <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/ukraine-and-denmark-sign-10-year-security-agreement/\">pro-Ukraine</url> and defence-heavy stance.<br/></p><p><br/>But after the Danes, Cyprus will likely bring more headaches as Nicosia looks poised to play out its national disputes on the Brussels stage. The island's long conflict with Turkey, arguments over energy exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean, and lingering tensions with the Turkish-Cypriot north threaten to spill over onto the EU agenda.<br/></p><p><br/>Nicosia has often used its leverage to block or delay wider EU initiatives - most notably in any negotiations involving the bloc's ties with Ankara - and many fear its presidency could become a megaphone for nationalist grievances rather than a platform for European unity.<br/></p><p><br/>Until Europe's leaders learn to leave their local feuds at the door, Brussels will not be able to deliver results at the pace the current world demands.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Roundup</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media money -</emphasis>\u00a0The European Union is pumping\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/money-for-nothing-commission-pours-millions-into-struggling-eu-media/\">more money</url> than it has previously acknowledged into a handful of media outlets that would have difficulty surviving without substantial subsidies, a Euractiv analysis has found.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emissions cut confirmed - </emphasis>The European Commission is set to propose a target to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/brussels-to-stand-its-ground-on-90-emissions-cut-by-2040/\">slash greenhouse gas emissions</url> to one-tenth of 1990 levels.

Engage with diverse stakeholders and discover pathways toward a resilient future for people and the planet.\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://eurac.tv/9Y8-\">Learn more</url>.<br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://eurac.tv/9Y90\">Register.</url><br/><br/></p><p><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brussels is a cosy place. So cosy in fact that many, if not most, people here have convinced themselves (and one another) that it's perfectly acceptable, normal even, for the EU to directly fund the media that cover them.</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>'What's the big deal?' was the response in some quarters to Euractiv's revelation this week that the institution is spending <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/money-for-nothing-commission-pours-millions-into-struggling-eu-media/\">vastly more than previously acknowledged</url>:\u00a0(EURO)\u00a035 million per year on average.<br/><br/><br/>What's so shocking about this to anyone not born and bred in the \"Bubble\" is the double standard. How is it that the Commission, which is so proud of its efforts to 'level the playing field' when it comes to competition in European industry, has no qualms about manipulating the marketplace of ideas by not just subsidising, but in some cases creating, pliant media <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/tapping-the-eus-media-slush-fund-kallas-view-from-nowhere/\">staffed by journalistic neophytes</url><br/><br/><br/>In most European countries (with the glaring exception of France), using taxpayer money to bankroll the national press in perpetuity would be taboo - and for good reason.<br/><br/><br/>Imagine for a moment if Berlin were to write a generous cheque every year to help Der Spiegel maintain its political coverage. It would lose all credibility. And no, such payments are not analogous to national public broadcasters, which rely on license fees earmarked solely for them.<br/><br/><br/>In Brussels, generous subsidies for media have long been par for the course, as the shocking example of Euronews, which has received nearly\u00a0(EURO)250\u00a0million over the past decade, makes all too clear.<br/><br/><br/>That dependency has consequences, most disturbingly in that it has created a passive and obsequious press corps. Journalists in Brussels like to think of themselves as the 'fourth estate'. In reality, they often function more like a fifth column that works\u00a0hand in glove with the people they are supposed to cover in exchange for access.<br/><br/><br/>If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider the following exchange that transpired in a WhatsApp group this week between reporters who covered the Polish presidency and Poland's press team.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Thank you Wojciech, Magdalena, Katarzyna, Magdalena, Inga and the others that worked to inform the press in such a helpful and detailed way, day after day for the last six months. You have set a precedent, an example to follow for the future of the EU presidencies,\"</emphasis> gushed a correspondent for Italy's Askanews.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"I agree - you guys rocked,\" </emphasis>responded a writer for the EUObserver.<br/><br/><br/>Not to be outdone, a Bloomberg editor wrote: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"I'd like to propose a binding measure to keep the PL press team in the current form for at least a year or so, to continue keeping us informed  Then a well-deserved promotion. You guys rocked.\"</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>That triggered a virtual orgy of praise with dozens of 'journalists' - including reporters for Mlex, Politico and Reuters - piling in to pay fealty to the Polish flacks.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Denmark is freaking out rn,\" </emphasis>a Politico man interjected at one point (This week Denmark took over the presidency from Poland).\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Once the elation had ebbed, the Bloomberg editor signed off with: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"And they ended with dozens of reporters dancing to Love is in the Air.\"</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>So much for holding power to account.<br/><br/><br/>Such behaviour is symptomatic of a broken journalistic culture that encourages cheerleading and discourages critical voices. Even if the EU's press subsidies are not the only cause of this dysfunction, they have contributed to making journalists dependent on the politicians who control their economic fate and skewing the market for everyone else.<br/><br/><br/>There's a simple way for the EU to fix that: defund the media.<br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Roundup</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU budget breakdown - </emphasis>The Commission will present the bulk of its new budget proposal on 16 July, kicking off more than two years of difficult negotiations.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

Still, it is one of the NbS that The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is implementing in Berlin to help promote urban biodiversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First launched in the German capital, the Europe Urban Greening programme is also being implemented in Stuttgart. TNC has taken different approaches according to the cities' unique needs, as programme director Jamie Chan explained to Euractiv.</p><p>\"In Berlin, we have focused on working with city officials to pilot various NbS to reduce heat and flood risks and strategies to increase biodiversity. In Stuttgart, we created a challenge grant to support civil society organisations and start-ups in developing and implementing innovative NbS proposals.\"</p><p>These include a green wall system that combines nesting opportunities and plant diversity, an ecosystem services decision support tool, retail fa\u00e7ade greening, tiny forests, and a balcony greening tool.</p><p>\"It is all about a variety of actors experimenting with different pathways toward climate adaptation and urban greening. Embedding NbS into municipal processes in major cities to accelerate the transformation from grey to green infrastructure, is a key goal.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More funding needed</emphasis></p><p>Such site-specific projects and partnership approaches can be replicated across other cities. \"We would build on the programme, leverage its successes and lessons learned in other geographies,\" Chan said when asked if it would expand.</p><p>But the programme relies on a (EURO)5 million fund to support it until 2025. Although it is sufficient to bridge the gap that municipalities often face when it comes to project planning and coordination, Chan noted there is a need for more.</p><p>\"We have been able to get municipalities to match the funding for implementation. But this is not enough to cover the actual cost of implementation. More funding should go towards innovative NbS initiatives!\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Planting trees to save lives</emphasis></p><p>Rob McDonald, TNC lead scientist for NbS, identified reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate adaptation, and using NbS effectively for human well-being and biodiversity as some of the key problems facing cities in terms of urban sustainability.</p><p>\"Cities are beginning to use heat action planning to get ready for the more intense heat waves that will occur with climate change, and nature-based solutions are part of that,\" McDonald told Euractiv.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-024-00150-3\">study</url> about the potential for NbS to help communities in the United States, in which Mcdonald was the lead author, found that planting trees in urban areas could potentially save an additional 464 lives and prevent some 80,758 cases of heat-related illnesses each year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU climate strategy is outdated</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, the European Commission adopted its <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en\">Climate Adaptation Strategy</url>, which sets out how the European Union can adapt to climate change and become resilient by 2050.</p><p>But TNC Europe climate policy lead Rebecca Humphries argued that \"The strategy lacks teeth. There is a need to strengthen governance, and capacities, and ensure the fight financing for climate adaptation.\"</p><p>Humphries said the strategy needs to become a framework/law, \"that can guide efforts at Member States' level and send a unified signal to the international community on how the EU is taking leadership and increasing efforts on climate mitigation.\"</p><p>This could aid in setting a governance structure and dedicated financing that would help guide and empower efforts at the subnational level. It might come especially in handy as a handful of European cities prepare to host major sporting events this summer, known for their carbon footprint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Getting locals onboard</emphasis></p><p>When it comes to making such initiatives work, engagement from local governments and communities is a must. Chan said there is a high level of awareness of the challenges posed by climate change, but hardships remain.</p><p>\"Many German municipalities do not have the bandwidth or capacity to work with NGOs to explore climate adaptation approaches. They are often weighed down by the day-to-day running of the city and thus unable to experiment with new approaches.\"</p><p>According to Chan, environmental education is \"a critical way to gain early traction in the fight against climate change\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A part of nature, not apart from nature</emphasis></p><p>Allowing nature to heal and help resolve even man-made faults stands at the heart of the Urban Greening programme. TNC has long called for a shift towards natural solutions to address climate challenges.</p><p>According to Humphries, \"Efforts need to be made to ensure the EU becomes climate resilient as soon as possible, especially with climate impacts becoming more severe. Additional measures and financing need to be put in place to address risks and impacts across different sectors holistically.\"</p><p>\"We need to implement sustainable urban planning, promote green infrastructure, invest in renewable energy, and foster international cooperation. Systemic changes in policies, regulations and governance structures are also needed to drive large-scale change and ensure long-term resilience to climate change,\" concluded Chan.</p><p>[By Xhoi Zajmi\u00a0I Edited by Brian Maguire | <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentnewsbuildclimateresilienceincitiesusingnaturebasedsolutionssayconservationexperts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1K-79F1-JCMC-W1X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion.

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal.

This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 5 of 14, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 14, Source: Company Website, 179 words </p><p>July 31: Scor: Second quarter 2025 results</p><p>SCOR SE's Board of Directors met on 30 July 2025, under the chairmanship of Fabrice Bregier, to approve the Group's Q2 2025 financial statements.</p><p>Thierry Leger, Chief Executive Officer of SCOR, comments: \"After a strong first quarter, all our business activities continue to perform well, contributing to a Group net income of EUR 226 million in the second quarter of 2025. The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date. I remain confident for the rest of the year and in SCOR's ability to execute the Forward 2026 strategic plan.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 14, Source: Company Website, 127 words </p><p>July 17: SCOR releases its 2024 Sustainable Business Report</p><p>SCOR has released its 2024 Sustainable Business Report, complementing the information set out in the Sustainability Statement of the Group's 2024 Universal Registration Document (Section 6, page 285).

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 5 of 14, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo.

However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution.

We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 14, Source: Company Website, 179 words </p><p>July 31: Scor: Second quarter 2025 results</p><p>SCOR SE's Board of Directors met on 30 July 2025, under the chairmanship of Fabrice Bregier, to approve the Group's Q2 2025 financial statements.</p><p>Thierry Leger, Chief Executive Officer of SCOR, comments: \"After a strong first quarter, all our business activities continue to perform well, contributing to a Group net income of EUR 226 million in the second quarter of 2025. The excellent combined ratio in P&amp;C is the result of our disciplined underwriting and of successful strategy to grow into profitable and diversifying lines of business. This allows us to build an additional level of prudence to our P&amp;C reserves. L&amp;H and Investments also deliver strong results. Despite increased competition in the P&amp;C reinsurance segment, SCOR has compensated the impact by optimizing its business mix and retrocession, leading to an unchanged net expected technical profitability in the treaty renewals year-to-date.

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 14, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 14, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words</p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words</p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words</p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 11, Source: Company Website, 243 words </p><p>July 02: Enhancing the Underwriting Process with SCOR's AI Assistant</p><p>One of SCOR's strategic objectives under the Forward 2026 plan is to be future-ready, and digital transformation is playing a key role in helping us to achieve this. We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words </p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

The results of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000383615\">global survey</url> indicate that about 70% of the youth doubt the quality of climate change education and think there is <url normalizedValue=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000383615\">need for improvement</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Shreya Utkarsh is Nature-based Solutions and Biodiversity officer at ICLEI Europe. Kassia Rudd is Strategic Communications &amp; Campaigns officer at ICLEI Europe and former garden educator.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe, nature is intertwined with a rich cultural heritage and diverse landscapes, offering many opportunities to connect with nature. As environmental challenges escalate rapidly and the adverse effects are felt increasingly, there is an urgent need to equip future generations with education and employment in the field of sustainable development. This isn't just our opinion: 67% respondents of the Eurobarometer survey see protecting the environment and fighting climate change as a priority. <url normalizedValue=\"https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2224\">What's more, over half of respondents call for an improvement in education and training</url>. Despite strong support for sustainability education, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377362\">2021 UNESCO study</url> revealed that 45% of national education documents studied (inc. some European countries) made little to no mention of environmental themes. Biodiversity was even more poorly represented, failing to appear in 81% of\u00a0 all evaluated educational strategies.</p><p>This gap in education for sustainable development\u00a0 is being noticed: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_327\">European commission</url> identifies \"providing teachers, trainers, youth leaders and academic staff with quality professional development opportunities on the environment and sustainability\" as the number one action item. Making sustainability a cross-cutting issue in curricula and study programmes came in a close second.</p><p>Urgent calls from the European youth and general populations for better education for sustainability are being heard and the Commission is reacting. The recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52022DC0011\">council recommendation</url> to member states on <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.ec.europa.eu/news/learning-for-environmental-sustainability\">learning for environmental sustainability</url> states that \"education and training systems and institutions have a duty to respond to the growing youth voice on the climate and biodiversity crises and involve young people in designing solutions related to learning for environmental sustainability.\"</p><p>On a global level, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-urges-making-environmental-education-core-curriculum-component-all-countries-2025\">UNESCO has urged all countries to make environmental education a core curriculum component by 2025</url>, indicating their support for speedy action. EU level policy also highlights support for environmental education - the<url normalizedValue=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en#:~:text=The%20EU's%20biodiversity%20strategy%20for,contains%20specific%20actions%20and%20commitments.\"> EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</url> in particular states a need to improve knowledge and awareness for biodiversity conservation. Within this context, nature-based solutions (NbS) have arisen as a promising tool for supporting biodiversity globally in partnership with communities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutions_en\">Nature-based solutions, defined by the EC as</url>:</p><p>Solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions. Nature-based solutions must therefore benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services.</p><p>Moreover, NbS are increasingly gaining attention not only within the field of sustainability action, but as a potential teaching tool. In Europe, environmental education is either imparted as a standalone subject, part of a subject (in most cases science) and/or as a multi-disciplinary approach to teaching. The growing focus from the European commission on NbS education with tools such as the GreenComp Framework and Horizon projects such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://nbseduworld.eu/\">NBS EduWORLD</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://coolschools.eu/\">CoolSchools</url> is building momentum to incorporate NbS into school curricula.</p><p>Prioritising environmental education in schools and extra-curricular programs isn't just trendy, the many benefits it brings are backed up by research.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X13000370\"> Biodiversity education through formal (i.e. school day lessons) and non formal (i.e. youth led initiatives, vocational training etc.) pathways can increase respect and concern for nature</url>. Because <url normalizedValue=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1334433.pdf\">knowledge and attitude are often linked</url>, improved eco-literacy could result in more meaningful sustainable action over students' lifetimes.\u00a0 What's more, <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916508318748\">attitudes towards nature can change over time</url> - especially in response to the hands-on and joy-filled learning opportunities offered by NbS education programs.</p><p>Bringing NbS into schools plants the seed for future generations to develop skills and competencies in the field of sustainability. By fostering a love of the environment and building green job expertise,\u00a0 NbS lessons create informed voters, change makers, and future professionals. When information is <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1053825916676190?journalCode=jeea\">contextualised in the real world</url>, it can be easier to remember, resulting in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317813693_Teaching_and_Learning_Science_Outdoors_in_Schools'_Immediate_Surroundings_at_K-12_Levels_A_Meta-Synthesis\">better performance in school</url>. Hands-on learning can also increase student motivation and interest across academic subjects.</p><p>With all this evidence in support of a hands-on <url normalizedValue=\"https://education.ec.europa.eu/document/input-paper-a-whole-school-approach-to-learning-for-environmental-sustainability\">whole school approach</url> paired with bringing NbS into the classroom, you might be wondering why more teachers aren't already on board. Despite the many reasons to invest in NbS education financially and politically, and ample teacher interest, many teachers simply lack the resources and support. Training for NbS education is not easy to find, outdoor learning spaces may not be nearby, and funding for supplies may be lacking.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187772/#:~:text=Commonly%20listed%20barriers%20to%20initial,18%20and%20challenges%20incorporating%20a\">It is no wonder that so many teachers, despite interest, may feel overwhelmed by the thought of bringing the outdoors into their schools</url>. Luckily, there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenschoolyards.org/outdoor-learning-resources\">many existing examples</url> of schools around the world adding hands-on education to their teaching without overburdening teachers. Small scale <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/how-we-work/youth-engagement/nature-lab/school-garden-resources/\">classroom gardening</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://eu-citizen.science/\">citizen science</url> are two examples of many.\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.saps.org.uk/teaching-resources/resources/639/growing-seeds-in-a-plastic-bag/\">Planting seeds in (re-purposed) see-through bag</url>s can allow students to observe the plant parts and growth habits of very different plants. Participating in a community science program such as the Cornell University<url normalizedValue=\"https://celebrateurbanbirds.org/\">Celebrate Urban Birds</url> initiative gives students direct experience collecting and analysing data, and teaches them about animal behaviour and local habitats.</p><p>For the uninitiated, finding these programs is the first barrier, and identifying curricular connections the second. Luckily, EU Horizon projects such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://nbseduworld.eu/\">NbS EduWORLD</url> are taking steps to help teachers connect with these resources, reducing barriers to finding relevant local lessons by storing lessons in one place as well as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs, i.e. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/courses/course-v1:Scientix+NBS+2023/about\">Exploring Nature-based Solutions in Your Classroom</url>) and<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eun.org/stem-discovery-campaign-2023\"> curriculum development campaigns</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/\">NetworkNature</url>, an EU Horizon project dedicated primarily to the communication of NbS research and tools, is beginning to explore the role of education in combating climate change equitably, justly, and effectively.</p><p>The evidence is clear-Nature-based solutions have the potential to address many of today's societal and ecological challenges. Integrating NbS into teaching materials should be a key part of efforts to educate young learners on potential solutions to address ongoing climate change and biodiversity challenges. This requires urgent action on the part of educators, but also by national, regional and local decision-makers.</p><p>Curious to learn more about the potential of NbS education?

This includes strips of wildflowers for pollinators, practices to improve soil health, or planting trees for wind and soil protection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These practices should, at least in theory, be supported by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) via the eco-schemes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But how many farmers have taken these up, and what impact has this had? What barriers remain to the uptake of nature-based solutions?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ladybirds against aphids.</emphasis> Over the last ten years or so, Romain Planes, a cereal and protein crop farmer in the Aude region of southern France, has found an effective alternative to insecticides in the fight against aphids: crop auxiliaries.</p><p>After joining <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.fr/section/agriculture-alimentation/news/reduire-les-pesticides-en-maintenant-les-resultats-economiques-la-protection-integree-peine-a-simposer-en-france/\">the DEPHY network</url> -\u00a0 which consists of 2,000 farms in France experimenting with techniques to reduce pesticide use - the farmer began observing his plots and identifying the insects that naturally regulate pests.</p><p>An adult ladybird can consume between 50 and 70 aphids a day, their larvae up to 200 a day, and hoverflies 60 a day.</p><p>By letting the beneficial insects do their thing and only spraying when the aphids reach a 'nuisance threshold' (or when there are too few beneficial insects), he has considerably reduced the need for insecticides.</p><p>He is now down from four treatments to one for oilseed rape and from three to one for protein crops. Moreover, Planes is getting yields equivalent to before, and the reduction in insecticides - his biggest expense - has slashed his costs.</p><p>The farmer also realised that the reduction in insecticides increased the presence of beneficial insects the following year.</p><p>However, this approach requires a thorough knowledge of pests and beneficial organisms, as well as meticulous monitoring of the plot.\u00a0 According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqWMYuOdnjU\">the Aude Chamber of Agriculture</url>, farmers and technicians are not sufficiently trained to recognise species and identify biological cycles.</p><p>In a 2021 <url normalizedValue=\"https://agriculture.gouv.fr/foire-aux-questions-tout-savoir-sur-le-biocontrole#:~:text=Les%20solutions%20de%20biocontr%C3%B4le%20repr%C3%A9sentent,contre%2012%20%25%20en%202020).\">survey</url>, 69% of farmers said they use biocontrol solutions, such as insects, viruses, bacteria, and mites, across all crops and production methods.

Some schemes, such as planting strips of wildflowers, were implemented on less than 1% of the number of hectares initially planned for, while agroforestry was only implemented on a total of 50 hectares across all of Germany.</p><p>\"I am not participating in any eco-scheme,\" Ottmar Ilchmann, a dairy and arable farmer in Northern Germany, told EURACTIV.</p><p>After going through the catalogue of eco-schemes, the farmer concluded that entry barriers for those measures applicable to his grassland-heavy farm were too high for a small business.</p><p>Even for permanent pasture, one of the eco-schemes most widely taken up in Germany, collecting the necessary proof to be submitted with the CAP funds application is costly and time-consuming, and the financial reward is insufficient to justify the extra investment, Ilchmann explained.</p><p>Especially for small farms, this means that the financial risk taken outweighs the potential reward, he added. \"For me, many eco-schemes are not worth it because the risk of making a mistake [and thus not receiving the premium] is too high,\" he said.</p><p>For the farmer, who thinks the CAP should move towards rewarding public services, the poor uptake and far-ranging criticism of the eco-schemes is bad news, not only for his own farm.</p><p>\"If the situation is not remedied quickly and effectively, advocates of unconditional area-based payments will feel reassured in their position,\" he warned.

The EU green subsidies framework applies as well to the erosion control measure for permanent crops, fruit, wine and hops, with 5,000 applications of this type arrived</p><p>These nature-based solutions would \"not only have a positive impact on climate, soil, and animal welfare, but also applicants benefit from the compensation for services provided,\" Strasser emphasised.

Cover crops are beneficial against erosion, they contribute to biodiversity and carbon storage. It is a voluntary solution for producers of olives, fruits or vineyards.</p><p>Cover crops are one of the nature-based solutions (NBS) within the eco-schemes of the Spanish\u00a0 CAP National Strategic Plan, with a budget of (EURO)307 million.\u00a0</p><p>Gilabert farms organically and uses integrated pest management (IPM), and he is also active in an association of farmers involved in promoting IPM, which also support cover crops as a solution to the degradation of soil caused by herbicide and other synthetic plant protection products.</p><p>In his opinion, cover crops are profitable because farmers save pesticides, which will benefit all long-term.</p><p>However, the implementation of cover crops is raising concerns in Spain in the context of the country's struggle against drought. According to the agronomist Manuel Candelas, cover crops \"compete\" with agricultural crops for water in dry areas, jeopardising production.</p><p>There are also questions about the practice's profitability, which requires specialised machines. Farmers have asked for flexibility and more help in implementing this eco-scheme.</p><p>At least around 80% of the agricultural area with applications for CAP direct payments in Spain includes eco-schemes. Improving the soil structure is one of their main goals.

Its main goal is to give back space to the community and neighbourhoods. </p><p>\"Citizens take care of the fields and harvest fruits and vegetables from them,\" di Donna explains.\u00a0</p><p>Since its inception in 2019, with a mere 10 hectares of abandoned land in Vettabbia Park, south of Milan, Soul Food Forest Farms has grown considerably. It now has an area of nearly 20 hectares, with more than 2,500 trees.</p><p>A separate project known as 'POEMA' (Ornithological and Entomological Agroforestry Monitoring Project) has been monitoring the Soul Food hub's butterfly, dragonfly, and bird populations for four years, highlighting the differences in coexistence compared to conventional agricultural areas. </p><p>The University of Milan has partnered with the project to evaluate, with an interdisciplinary approach, contributions to communities and volunteers. \"Facilitating the emergence of more complex and biodiverse agroecosystems is a guiding strategy for us to regenerate the margins of the city,\" concluded Di Donna.

Financial gratification is an important compensation for potential increased costs related to implementing the specific practices,\" the farmer told EURACTIV.pl.</p><p>\"This makes farmers more eager to participate in pro-environmental activities. The money is an essential incentive, but the eco-scheme programme inspires more farmers to implement certain practices, even regardless of that reward,\" the farmer said.

Nevertheless, some farmers in Transylvania have been applying these principles for many years.</p><p>High-nature value (HNVF) farmland represents around 30% of Romania's usable agricultural land, most of which is located in the Transylvania region. </p><p>Here, the ADEPT Transylvania Foundation has been working for over 19 years to protect biodiversity through collaboration with small farmers from local communities to create nature-friendly business models. For Benone Mehedin, manager at the foundation, though HNV products are still a niche market, they can be local solutions to significant global challenges.</p><h>However, small and medium-sized farms producing food sustainably \"struggle to remain economically viable\", explained Laura Chirila Pasca, marketing manager at ADEPT Transylvania.</h><p>\"Although there are consumers interested in these products, they cannot purchase them either because they might not be aware of their availability, even though these products are sometimes in their immediate vicinity,\" Pasca said.</p><p>To protect biodiversity and the farm, an organic farm in the village of Ciocanari in the D\u00e2mbovita county avoids chemical fertilisers, preferring the 'green' options, which, according to the farm coordinator Cristina Briziou protect the soil from sun or torrential rains.</p><p>However, these environmentally-friendly methods do come with a cost. \"We face difficulties in obtaining quality manure at a more affordable price\", Cristina Briziou told EURACTIV.ro.</p><p>She added that a better organisation from both the local administration and animal farms to assure the availability of quality natural fertilisers for farmers \"would significantly help reduce costs and especially to popularise this practice among farmers from neighbouring farms.\" (Catalina Mihai/Manuela Preoteasa | EURACTIV.ro)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BULGARIA</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bulgarian farmers rely on natural fertilisers and pasture rotation. </emphasis>A significant proportion of Bulgarian farmers use animal manure to nourish the soil, which is a good option for developing organic farming and a money saver for conventional farms. </p><p>This is especially important given difficulties accessing chemical fertilisers in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the chairman of Bulgaria's young farmers association Petar Petrov.</p><p>For Petrov, a livestock breeder with 13 years of experience in farming, the country's best ecological practices are related to the rotational use of pastures and\u00a0nourishing the soil with natural fertilisers.</p><p>However, the uptake of organic agriculture in Bulgaria is threatened by local specificities in land ownership, as small farms trying to implement these practices are bordered by bigger ones owned by agri-businesses engaged in conventional farming.</p><p>\"You cannot have only 10 acres of land and grow 10 acres of organic tomatoes. Neighbouring farms may grow conventional crops, and when they use chemical fertilisers and pesticides there, it will affect your organic production as well,\" Petrov said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Stoilko Apostolov from the Bioselena Foundation for Biological Agriculture pointed out that the largest number of areas in Bulgaria will be registered under the eco-scheme for diversifying cultivated crops - a scheme which Bulgarian farmers are familiar with and, for this reason, consider easy to implement.</p><p>However, the eco-scheme for organic farming is considered the most difficult one to implement due to strict controls and the requirement to have an organic production certificate for animals and plots, despite having the highest climate and soil protection impact.

When they are used, it is mostly in organic farms as they are not yet applied in conventional agricultural crops at a large scale.\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, an example of a recently launched pilot programme called 'regenerative farming in Greece' has been implemented in four conventional farms promoting regenerative farming - a type of nature-based solution.</p><p>The programme started in 2021 after the wildfires on the island of Evia and in the Attica region in that year's summer. </p><p>In the face of grounds destroyed by fire and the economic collapse of a large part of the Greek agriculture sector, the start-up organisation 'Southern Lights' launched this initiative \"to enable and support the transition of farming in Greece into a regenerative one, by sharing the knowledge (...) and building resilience facing climate change\".\u00a0</p><p>Four pilot farms have participated, and according to the project's website, these farms \"represent the most prevailing agricultural models in the Mediterranean\". The project is implemented in Larissa, Trikala, Sparta, and Scala regions.</p><p>Examples of nature-based solutions implemented in these projects include an agroforestry system at an almond pilot farm in Larissa, which consists of a mix of pecan, elderberry, and poplar trees interplanted with standard almond tree monocultures to increase water retention and boost soils fertility.</p><p>Meanwhile, at a pomegranate pilot farm in Sparta, existing tree lines were interplanted with figs and Eucalyptus trees, among other crops, for the same reasons. Similar practices have been implemented at the other two farms for olives, grains, and legumes, improving the environmental impact of their crops.

While they offer an opportunity for farmers to adopt more sustainable practices, the challenges of complexity, bureaucracy, and insufficient compensation have hindered a widespread uptake.</p><p>To receive the 'basic' eco-payment, Czech farmers must fulfil several measures, such as leaving un-mown areas, crop diversification, or allocating a buffer zone along the watercourse. There is also an option to receive a 'premium' eco-payment for farmers keeping a larger share of areas unused for production.</p><p>As EURACTIV.cz learnt, 22,092 applications were submitted this year for the basic eco-payment and 50 for premium eco-payment. In total, around 30,000 Czech farmers applied for direct payments.</p><p>Regarding particular eco-scheme measures, only limited ones are applied in practice. According to Jan Stefl, vice-president of the Czech Association of private farming, most farmers opted for fallow lands and substituted some with protein crops, taking advantage of the EU's temporary derogation.</p><p>One of the main obstacles farmers face is the insufficient financial motivation to implement other eco-schemes measures which would benefit nature - for example, landscape features, such as copses. </p><p>Czech farmers argue that low subsidy rates for establishing and maintaining such elements discourage their expansion. Moreover, the complexity and bureaucratic nature of the eco-scheme rules have deterred many farmers from participating fully.</p><p>\"Good intentions have been devalued by imperfect implementation,\" Vladim\u00edr P\u00edcha from the Agricultural Association of the Czech Republic told EURACTIV.cz. He emphasised that rules for eco-schemes subsidies are too detailed and complicated, making them difficult to follow.</p><p>Czech organic farmers are also sceptical. Katerina Urb\u00e1nkov\u00e1, manager of the PRO-BIO association of organic farmers, see it as the EU's \"failed attempt\". </p><p>She stressed that in the Czech case, eco-schemes are \"a kind of superstructure over the GAEC (Good Agricultural Environmental Conditions)\", and it brings \"many problems for practice, often without any real environmental benefit\".</p><p>Despite these problems, some farmers - particularly those from small and middle range - are applying eco-friendly measures - however not motivated by the new eco-schemes.

Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 11, Source: Company Website, 243 words </p><p>July 02: Enhancing the Underwriting Process with SCOR's AI Assistant</p><p>One of SCOR's strategic objectives under the Forward 2026 plan is to be future-ready, and digital transformation is playing a key role in helping us to achieve this. We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words </p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

ESG</p><p>2.1 September 07 2023: ScorSCOR launches its new strategic plan: Forward 2026</p><p>Press Release</p><p>7 September 2023 - N 17</p><p>SCOR launches its new strategic plan</p><p>Forward 2026</p><p>Driving value creation. Shaping the reinsurer of tomorrow.</p><p>At its 2023 Investor Day in Paris, SCOR presents its new strategic plan for 2024-2026, Forward 2026.</p><p>SCOR takes a step forward to fully benefit from the most supportive market environment in the past two decades</p><p>As the world continues to undergo fundamental changes, risks are multiplying, and intensifying, creating unprecedented challenges for societies. This rapidly evolving risk landscape has led to a growing demand for protection, and to favorable market conditions for reinsurers. At the same time, the increase in both P&amp;C reinsurance rates and interest rates is expected to support reinsurers margins.</p><p>In such an environment, SCOR is well placed to seize market opportunities, benefiting from its leading global franchise, strong balance sheet, and differentiating in-house expertise. Forward 2026 will combine the art and science of risk to protect societies, while firmly maintaining sustainability at the heart of the Groups raison detre.</p><p>SCOR is set to accelerate value creation over the next three years</p><p>Forward 2026 sets two ambitious and equally weighted targets over the duration of the plan:</p><p>A financial target: an Economic Value growth rate of 9% per annum, at constant interest and foreign exchange rates1. A solvency target: a solvency ratio in the optimal 185% to 220% range. The Group aims to maintain a AA-level of security for its clients. With Forward 2026, SCOR will drive value creation for its shareholders, clients, employees, and for society as a whole. The Group maintains a controlled risk appetite and disciplined underwriting as it acts on business opportunities created by the supportive market conditions, fueling growth on its diversified and equally weighted P&amp;C and L&amp;H portfolios.</p><p>All three businesses contribute to growth and value creation:</p><p>In Life &amp; Health (L&amp;H) reinsurance, SCOR leverages the full potential of its leading platform to grow its Contractual Service Margin (CSM) through (i) further growth of the Protection portfolio across geographies, (ii) diversification of the Longevity franchise globally, (iii) increased revenues from Financial Solutions, and (iv) further deployment of digital services to differentiate its product offering.</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 11, Source: Company Website, 243 words </p><p>July 02: Enhancing the Underwriting Process with SCOR's AI Assistant</p><p>One of SCOR's strategic objectives under the Forward 2026 plan is to be future-ready, and digital transformation is playing a key role in helping us to achieve this. We are already seeing huge positive impacts from digital transformation across our business, particularly on our underwriting and claims processes. Using AI to augment decision making and support human judgment, we are speeding up these processes, while maintaining the accuracy of our risk decisions.</p><p>Our teams use AI Assistant, SCOR's proprietary AI system created by and for underwriters. A Gen-AI powered, cloud-based solution, AI Assistant accurately extracts key information from all types of documents in record time, regardless of length, language, complexity, or the presence of handwritten text. Initially launched as a pilot with select medical underwriters in 2024, the tool is now used by more than 150 of our underwriting and claims experts on a daily basis.</p><p>AI Assistant leverages our teams' risk knowledge to save time and improve the quality of assessments in a wide range of use cases, especially for underwriting and claims (for example, for medical underwriting in Life &amp;Health we have already achieved time savings of 30%). And through its growing usage - processing around one million pages each month with around 90% accuracy across key data fields - it's fast improving the consistency of our underwriting and claims decisions.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 11, Source: Company Website, 348 words </p><p>July 01: SCOR Innovation Days - (Re)insuring the World of Tomorrow</p><p>Held on 24 and 25 June in Paris, our Innovation Days event brought together industry experts from across the world to discuss how (re)insurance can improve resilience and support the transition to a better future.</p><p>With an introduction on the first day by P&amp;C CEO Jean-Paul Conoscente, the event focused on two main themes: ecological resilience and the future of mobility.</p><p>Day One explored how (re)insurers can become key players in ecological restoration and nature resilience, demonstrating that, from financing nature-based solutions to setting industry standards, innovation is shaping a more resilient planet.</p><p>Titled \"Insuring Nature's Resilience,\" this day featured two keynote speeches. The first, by Professor of International Forest Governance at ETH Zurich, Claude Garcia, looked at becoming a change architect. The second was delivered by Sarah Payne, the CFO of nature restoration company Nattergal. From the perspective of a client, Sarah discussed the benefits of Restore, the first product launched for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, which is part of SCOR's nature restoration and conservation initiative NatReCo. This first product has now been followed by a second - Manage - which was launched during the event.</p><p>Complementing the keynotes were panel discussions on understanding the ecosystem restoration landscape, the role and responsibility of the insurance industry in nature resilience, the importance of standards for restoration projects, and the future landscape leveraging NatReCo. Our own SCOR experts were also joined by representatives from Beijing University, the private investment firm Ardian, AXA, Diot Siaci Corporate Solutions, the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), the non-profit ratings agency Foundation for Nature, the NatReCo Lead Advisory Group (LAG), and the project developer NatureRe.</p><p>Day Two took a deep dive into the future of mobility - from electric vehicles, battery technologies and novel risk prevention to the rise of autonomous vehicles - to explore how (re)insurance can help define the road ahead.</p><p>Titled \"The Future of Mobility is Here,\" this second day had an equally impressive line-up of speakers, with three keynote speeches and three panel discussions.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 11, Source: Company Website, 288 words </p><p>June 23: SCOR launches its second Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution Product: \"Manage\"</p><p>We are pleased to confirm the launch of the second product for our Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution, \"Manage\", which was announced this morning by Jean-Paul Conoscente (CEO of SCOR P&amp;C) in his welcome speech kicking off SCOR's Innovation Days in Paris.</p><p>With many ecosystems rapidly declining and even at risk of collapse, there is now a greater understanding that healthy ecosystems are crucial, and a greater awareness that ecological restoration requires major financing - ensuring ecosystem integrity and resilience has become an international priority. However, factors like the inherent unpredictability of ecosystems mean that there can be some reluctance in this regard.</p><p>To address this issue, SCOR developed the unique, scalable and impact assessment-based Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution as part of its NatReCo Initiative, which offers pro-active, innovative (re)insurance solutions to support nature-resilient projects that address societal challenges. The Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution aims to support ecological restoration projects whose planned recovery trajectories have been adversely impacted by pre-defined perils, giving them a greater prospect of completion. By de-risking financing opportunities, this Solution bridges the \"gap\" between the need and the desire to finance ecological restoration projects.</p><p>SCOR launched both the NatReCo Initiative and the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution with the launch of the \"Restore\" product in May 2024. Restore covers the phase of the ecological restoration project which focuses on the implementation of the conditions for recovery, in line with the project plan.</p><p>The \"Manage\" product marks the next evolution of the Ecological Restoration Insurance Solution. It covers the ongoing management phase of a project, which focuses on maintaining and improving the conditions for recovery that have been implemented.</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 11, Source: Company Website, 112 words </p><p>June 02: SCOR's 2024 P&amp;C triangles disclosure confirms reserving adequacy</p><p>A copy of this document is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website.</p><p>At SCOR, the actuarial analysis axis is the actuarial segment which groups together homogeneous contracts based on a variety of criteria (proportional or non-proportional basis, underlying risk typology, geography, etc.).

COP30 is not just another conference, it's an opportunity for a new axis of leadership to emerge. This is why we're calling on the Global South, led by Brazil and supported by committed partners like the EU, to seize this opportunity to lead and shape a strong agenda for the coming decades.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Global South's turn to lead</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>The world cannot afford another lost year of negotiations. COP29 exposed the dangers of disunity and geopolitical tensions, and these issues must not be repeated this year. This is why Brazil, alongside partners like Indonesia, Egypt, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and others across the Global South, must step forward with initiative and lead the way.<br/></p><p><br/>Global climate policy, like so many other issues, has often been shaped through a Northern lens. COP30 offers a chance for a different story.<br/></p><p><br/>It's an opportunity to move from reactive participation to proactive leadership. The summit can be a success, if a coherent and focused agenda is set early on. Climate is not its own, siloed issue. It's integrated across trade, finance, industry, and every other sector, and therefore its policy should be integrated as well. Baku showed us the risks of a fragmented and incohesive narrative, and therefore the Global South must ensure a bold yet coherent agenda that will lead to concrete action in key areas.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rethinking climate alliances</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>But the Global South is not alone.<br/></p><p><br/>The EU should play a significant role supporting the efforts of the South, but must change its global view. There is no longer a need to default to US leadership - there can be an alternative transatlantic alliance.<br/></p><p><br/>This also requires an updated perspective on collaboration. Trade negotiations like the EU-Mercosur deal can serve as a model for climate cooperation, if managed holistically and equitably. The agreement shows the potential of the EU-South partnership, but also the pitfalls of compartmentalised negotiations.<br/></p><p><br/>As mentioned above, climate is not a singular issue that can be negotiated as such. Climate, trade, investment and technology must be aligned at a macro level, negotiated in tandem. Europe cannot cherry-pick areas of engagement and should be open to link key policies, such as the EU ETS, with emerging compliance carbon markets in the world.<br/></p><p><br/>To go further, there should also be a push for more domestic policy coherence from all sides. The EU and the Global South must lead by example at home. Greater alignment reinforces trust and reaffirms credibility. For success at the global level, policy compatibility is essential. Commissioner Hoekstra, this is your chance to show the EU is truly committed to the global climate cause, beyond the $1.3 trillion funding figure that hijacked Baku's tedious meeting.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COP30 and beyond</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>This year's summit will take place in Bel\u00e9m, deep in the heart of the Amazon, bringing the fragility and significance of nature to the centre of attention. But this is more than just symbolic. As leaders gather on the edge of the world's largest rainforest, the planet's ecosystems must move from the margins to the core of climate negotiations.<br/></p><p><br/>This must be the moment we move from rhetoric to delivery. A successful COP30 requires more than declarations, it demands a clear, actionable agenda and shared accountability. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) must become more than technical exercises; they should serve as national investment strategies, guiding the next phase of climate policy and economic planning.<br/></p><p><br/>More concrete projects between the Global South and Global North are needed - Article 6 progress is a positive signal, but we need to build on that to accelerate the pace and trigger the full potential of voluntary carbon markets bilaterally and multilaterally.<br/></p><p><br/>But not all countries can do this alone. Many in the Global South will need targeted support to design, implement, and finance these plans. It's in the collective interest of global partners, especially the EU, to help make this possible.<br/></p><p><br/>The private sector and regional development banks must also step up. Businesses cannot wait on regulatory and geopolitical certainty to begin acting. They must take ownership of emissions across their supply chains, channel finance into nature-based solutions, and contribute to the development of a just transition in the regions they operate. Climate leadership in 2025 means demonstrating real impact, not just commitments on paper.<br/></p><p><br/>National banks such as BNDES, the European Investment Bank, and others should send a strong signal to those that want to take a risk to invest in green tech, infrastructure and future value chains.<br/></p><p><br/>Looking ahead, Brazil and its COP30 presidency must begin shaping expectations now. What does success look like? What breakthroughs are needed on climate finance, loss and damage, nature, and transition pathways? Setting that vision early will determine whether COP30 becomes a defining moment or just another missed opportunity.<br/></p><p><br/>We urge you, President Lula, Commissioner Hoekstra, and Ambassador Correa do Lago, to rise to this occasion. Together, you have a rare chance to shift the balance of global climate politics. Let COP30 be remembered as the moment the Global South - from Brazil to Benin, from Barbados to Bangladesh - stepped forward with a united voice, and the EU stood not behind, but beside it.<br/></p><p><br/>The world is watching - the historic Rio 92 meeting deserves a new, memorable chapter for our planet.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">M\u00e1ximo Miccinilli is the Head of Energy and Climate at FleishmanHillard EU.</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ana Domingues is the CEO at FleishmanHillard Brasil.</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetopinioncop30theglobalsouthsmoment</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRH-5TR3-RSHT-Y3GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

The natural world has reached a tipping point. The case for protecting and restoring nature is well-recognised by scientists, the European Commission and NGOs, but not so clear yet from the perspective of European businesses. Europe will not meet its climate goals without nature-based solutions, Europe will not achieve sustainable growth without nature; at SIG, we are recognising that nature is fundamentally intertwined with business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jos\u00e9 Matthijsse is the President and General Manager of Europe in SIG.</emphasis></p><p>There are signs of positive momentum for action on nature in Europe. The European Green Deal brought about a series of new strategies and laws, including a law on nature restoration. \u00a0In September, President von der Leyen spoke of the necessity to 'fundamentally rethink' the link between our economy and nature. Meanwhile, Mario Draghi's competitiveness report outlined the necessity for integrated policies across the EU if we are to unlock growth. I believe both these imperatives must be combined. Nature and growth are not a trade-off, but mutually reinforcing.</p><p>There is a path towards reimagining our relationship with nature so that it is both preserved and supports sectors critical to the EU's climate transition. This can help realise EU growth, support innovation and meet climate goals. Forests are an important example. Europe still has forests which host habitats for biodiversity, contribute to water resilience, store carbon and, crucially, support many key industries in Europe. Forests are a critical resource for mitigating climate change and growing Europe's economy. We need to protect them to support biodiversity, while also optimising how they can be used to help industries to decarbonise and grow. There are ways to do this: protecting old forests that have not been intensively logged, restoring critical areas of nature, and, ensuring sourcing is covered by the world's most rigorous 3<sup>rd</sup> party forestry standard, FSC(TM).</p><p>SIG has been a member of FSC(TM) since 2008, and by driving change we were, in 2021, the first in our industry to purchase 100% of our liquid packaging board with FSC(TM) certification<url normalizedValue=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</url>. We have focused on product innovation: our SIG Terra packaging range increases the paper content in our cartons to up to 82%, by removing aluminium and ensuring that all main materials are linked to forest-based renewable resources. We believe the future of packaging is regenerative, and deeply linked to nature-based solutions.</p><p>On top of that operational commitment, we've also set out a commitment to support nature beyond our raw materials usage with our Forest+ goal to improve, protect and restore 650,000 hectares of forest by 2030. To achieve this goal, we partnered with WWF in 2022 and are currently supporting forest landscape projects in <url normalizedValue=\"https://explorer.land/p/project/cpcmexico\">Mexico</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://explorer.land/p/project/sig-malaysia\">Malaysia</url> through WWF's <url normalizedValue=\"https://forestsforward.panda.org/\">Forests Forward</url> programme.</p><p>In September, we attended WWF's Business and Biodiversity forum, where this message was reiterated: 'It is not too late to do what nature needs, but we need to accelerate drastically, and to work together to build collective solutions.' More must be done by the private sector to place value in nature, both in terms of protecting it but also recognising healthy ecosystems can help business growth and mitigate risks.</p><p>To get there, industry actors like SIG must go beyond just meeting regulations. There are a set of immediate actions for forests that I am calling on the private sector to support.</p><p>First, the EU needs common criteria of sustainable forest management, applicable to all Member States. This will help to overcome discrepancies in treatment of forests across Europe and encourage companies to commit to the strongest, most credible standard of forest management. Stronger common criteria will help protect biodiversity and could unlock investment into nature-based solutions.</p><p>Secondly, inspired by the EU's Nature Restoration Law, companies can set ambitious targets on restoration. These can encourage collaboration between local jurisdictions, business and smallholders. This may also create new business opportunities by placing greater value in protecting and restoring nature.</p><p>Nature, and nature-based solutions, will be central to this if the private sector and regulators can work together to take transformative action. The combination of protecting nature, using renewable sources sustainably, and large-scale nature restoration can help Europe achieve its goals of sustainable economic growth.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sig.biz/en/sustainability/forest\">Forest+ - SIG - for better</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</url> FSC<sup>TM</sup> trademark license code: FSC<sup>TM</sup> C020428</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetopinionbusinessisyettounlockthetruevalueofprotectingandrestoringnature</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D9D-N8M1-F03F-K3BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

This means that projects in this area will need to start ramping up on a massive scale.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Only a global effort will be able to deliver removals at scale\" says Mhairidh Evans, Global Head of CCUS Research. \"However, trade-off with other social needs is still inevitable, given the volume of projects required.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The report states that to achieve this goal, three key things must happen. Carbon removals must be monetised, governments must set national carbon removal targets and provide sufficient incentives and stimulate demand and developers need to deliver projects at cost levels that make removals an attractive option based on expected future carbon prices.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The report adds that nature-based solutions such as afforestation and soil carbon offer the greatest potential for scale at a lower cost per tonne than engineered solutions with many deployment opportunities available below US$100/tonne of CO2. This compares favourably with engineered solutions that currently range between US$100 and US$1,000/tonne.\u00a0</p><p>Furthermore, some of the world's highest emissions emitting countries such as the US, Brazil, China, Indonesia and India have land resources available to accommodate huge removals projects on a gigatonne scale.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, the carbon removals project sector remains too risky for many investors because of inconsistent policy support from governments worldwide.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Government policy and incentives are the driving force behind the sharp rise in planned engineered projects across North America and Europe, which host over 95% of capacity announced to date,\" says Evans. \"To deliver on the required scale, nature-based solutions will require greater support from governments around the globe.\"\u00a0</p><p>The report also states that the investing in carbon removals can be difficult because, unlike renewable energy or clean fuels, there is usually no \"product\" produced. This can make the value of a project hard to define and financial value often comes from stacking different sources of income. These include voluntary and compliance carbon markets, direct corporate buyers, government incentives and by-product sales - but values vary greatly around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Carbon markets are the primary mechanism for translating emissions mitigation from removals into a monetisable commodity. \u00a0</p><p>\"With a carbon price, governments and companies would be able to put a monetary value on having less CO2 in the atmosphere.\" Says Evans. \"Companies need to be willing to pay for this in the voluntary market, while governments could create a regulated mandatory market, where companies can trade removal credits. We see an increasing role for removals in compliance markets\"\u00a0</p><p>Wood Mackenzie forecasts show that currently committed voluntary carbon market participants will demand more than 1.7 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent (BtCO2e) a year of avoidance and removal carbon offsets by 2050. Demand could more than triple if the controversial issues of market integrity, trustworthiness of monitoring, reporting and verification, and offset quality are resolved quickly.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The report also states that governments should also use their purchasing power to stimulate demand. Other initiatives along these lines also includes government-to-government trading which would achieve better global equity and encourage investment in removals projects in developing countries.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The report adds that while strong governmental support is essential to kick-start projects, developers also have to work hard to deliver the right cost levels to attract potential investors.\u00a0For Direct Air Capture, one of the most promising removals technologies, this will require supply-chain optimisation, a step-change in energy consumption, larger project sizes and the application of next-generation capture technologies. \u00a0</p><p>The report concludes that nature-based solutions will deliver 90% of carbon removals in Wood Mackenzie's base case. Engineered removals come at a higher cost but will be essential at gigatonne scale to help the world reach net zero. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\"The promise of carbon removals is clear. What's less clear is their pathway to becoming a major lever to help meet the Paris goals and help companies to achieve their net zero targets,\" Evans concludes. \"Nevertheless, there are no-regrets actions that can - and should - happen now.\"\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/cd4b7909-a582-4d9d-8467-51e8fa9b40b9\">Carbon removals by scenario, from today until 2050</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000992714en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D0P-6DM1-JDPT-Y088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 19, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Despite international commitments, 6.37 million hectares of forest were lost in 2023 alone.</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The \"2024 Forest Declaration Assessment: Forests under fire\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://forestdeclaration.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024ForestDeclarationAssessment.pdf\">report</url> raises a critical alarm about the worsening state of global deforestation and degradation.<br/><br/><br/>Forests are essential in combating climate change and biodiversity loss, yet they face ongoing human-driven threats, including deforestation, degradation, and fires. These pressures exacerbate climate and social inequalities.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>The report argues that while forest restoration is possible, it cannot fully replace the complexity and function of original ecosystems. Immediate action is necessary to prevent further damage.<br/><br/><br/>Key issues highlighted in the report include high levels of tropical deforestation, significant primary forest loss, forest degradation, and rising forest fire intensity.<br/><br/><br/>Restoration efforts are hindered by inadequate data and inconsistent monitoring, while forest loss continues in biodiversity-critical areas. The conversion of other natural ecosystems, such as grasslands, further compounds the challenge.<br/><br/><br/>To meet global environmental goals, urgent action is required to prioritise forest conservation and restoration, curb overconsumption, and implement large-scale restoration initiatives.<br/><br/><br/>The report urges governments to adopt a human-rights-based approach, enforce protected area regulations, and tackle human-induced fire patterns. Protecting Key Biodiversity Areas and ensuring equitable management are essential for sustaining forests and their vital ecosystem services.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hope and hardship</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>An <url normalizedValue=\"https://forestsnews.cifor.org/90550/a-year-of-hope-and-hardship-for-the-worlds-forests?fnl=\">analysis</url> by forest researcher Robert Nasi, referencing the same report, describes 2024 as a year marked by both progress and challenges for global forests. While innovative technologies and international cooperation provide hope, forests continue to face severe pressure.<br/><br/><br/>Countries like Brazil and Indonesia have made significant strides in reducing deforestation through stricter regulations and sustainable management practices. Technology, especially satellite imagery, has been instrumental in monitoring forest health and detecting illegal activities.<br/><br/><br/>Indigenous communities, whose traditional practices contribute to sustainable forest management, have been recognised for their vital role in conservation, particularly in areas like the Amazon where deforestation rates have decreased.<br/><br/><br/>Despite positive steps, Nasi points out that challenges remain, especially climate change, which continues to exert pressure on forests. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent wildfires compound the threat.<br/><br/><br/>While deforestation rates in the Amazon have declined, other tropical regions are experiencing an increase in deforestation driven by illegal logging and unsustainable resource use.<br/><br/><br/>To address these challenges, Nasi concludes that a multi-faceted approach is required, including international cooperation, strong governance, sustainable agriculture, and the empowerment of Indigenous communities.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Realigning Europe's ambitious targets</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The European Union has set ambitious targets for tackling climate change and halting deforestation and forest degradation, with various policies in place or awaiting full implementation.<br/><br/><br/>However, the natural role of European forests as carbon sinks is under severe threat due to extreme weather events, fires, diseases, and unsustainable forestry practices, which have turned many forests from absorbers into carbon emitters.<br/><br/><br/>For instance, the European Commission's proposed 90 per cent net greenhouse gas emissions <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2040-climate-target_en\">reduction target for 2040</url> is seen as insufficient, given the urgency of the climate crisis.<br/><br/><br/>With 2024 expected to be the hottest year on record and significant environmental impacts already underway, critics argue the proposal does not match the scale of action needed.<br/><br/><br/>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwfeu.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/2040-position-paper_1.pdf\">position paper</url> from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) stresses the importance of protecting nature, enforcing biodiversity legislation, and prioritising nature-based solutions for climate adaptation.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raising emissions targets</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>It recommends raising the 2030 emissions reduction target to at least 65 per cent and making significant reductions before 2035. It also calls for halving energy consumption by 2040 and phasing out fossil fuels by 2030.<br/><br/><br/>The WWF calls for a full transition to renewable energy by 2040. A just transition framework, which supports vulnerable communities and workers, is essential.<br/><br/><br/>The paper advocates for increased international climate finance to assist developing countries. The amount of support should reflect the EU's historical responsibility for emissions, with the EU's fair share of global climate efforts guiding the scale of financial assistance.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/world-is-far-from-halting-deforestation-urgent-government-action-required/\">World is far from halting deforestation, urgent government action required</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com\">Euractiv</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewsworldisfarfromhaltingdeforestationurgentgovernmentactionrequired</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DR4-7DR3-RRY2-B0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

permits generated by projects that have avoided or removed greenhouse gas emissions, which companies can use to compensate for their own emissions - has been put under scrutiny.<br/><br/>There is currently a wide range of standards and methodologies to evaluate the mitigation potential of carbon mitigation and removal projects, despite several public and private-led initiatives that have sought to enhance the integrity of voluntary carbon markets.<br/><br/>\"Transparency in assessing the quality of these projects is absolutely paramount to make sure that reputational risks are also mitigated, both on the investors or the people financing these projects,\" said Mathilde Cr\u00eapy, head of environmental transparency at Brussels-based green NGO ECOS.<br/><br/>The EU's sustainable finance agenda is also looking into setting robust and credible frameworks for reporting on environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, which are set to bring more transparency and integrity to markets.<br/><br/>\"The new [EU] mandate will have the possibility to have a closer look on what actually worked and what we should develop further: we do not just need to talk about transparency, but we also need to talk about standardisation,\" said MEP Rasmus Andresen.<br/><br/>\"And there, I think European legislation is still reluctant to do with this, and there had also been a lot of struggles to agree in this direction,\" he added.<br/><br/>Because of the fragmentation of methodologies to measure the emissions potential of these carbon credits, companies are still in \"a waiting position\" before investing in nature-based solutions, said Robin Stoffers, managing director at ClimatePartner Impact, a project developer of nature-based carbon credits.<br/><br/>\"[Corporates] want to invest into nature-based solutions or other reduction activities, but also they really try to navigate through new frameworks, they don't know what to do, what is the right thing [...] there's a lot of insecurity on the corporate side, on the investor side, on what is the right thing to do,\" he told the event.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financing Europe's ecological restoration</emphasis><br/><br/>Carbon markets are \"one of the main sources of funding for many of the ecological restoration projects around Europe\", said Marcos L\u00f3pez Ercilla, project manager at Life Terra Foundation.<br/><br/>\"And the truth is that there's a lot of organisations who are doing a great job, and they could do way more, and on a much bigger scale and in many more countries if they just would have access to this funding,\" he added. \"But the companies are still uncertain about it.\"<br/><br/>Precisely because of climate change, it has become a big challenge to invest in nature-based projects in Europe due to shifts in climate zones, extreme weather risks such as forest fires or draughts, and soils losing their quality and CO2 absorption potential.<br/><br/>\"It's not just the fact that we don't have a lot of land available in many places, but it's also the soil quality which creates another critical issue on the ground,\" said Marika Luiati, Europe Forest Manager at OneTreePlanted.<br/><br/>\"This is the result of our history and centuries of extensive agriculture practices, industrial activities, pollution, all of these elements, they have degraded soils in many different parts of the world and in Europe specifically, which makes it challenging for trees to thrive,\" she told the event.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boosting credibility and pricing</emphasis><br/><br/>The global voluntary carbon market hit about $2 billion in value in 2021, but the average prices of carbon credits globally have ranged between $4-7 per tonne of CO2 equivalent in recent years.<br/><br/>Increasing the demand in Europe will likely drive the price upwards, the experts at the event agreed. \"I think giving a strong price signal [...] is really paramount to ensure, well, high-quality carbon credits and high-quality carbon removal projects,\" said ECOS' Cr\u00eapy.<br/><br/>All in all, the impact of the EU's green policies \"can be huge\" in channelling this finance towards nature and ecological restoration in Europe, said Robin Stoffers.<br/><br/>\"But I think we are not there yet. I think we still need to do a lot of groundwork in really achieving confidence and trust and knowledge by the investors and the companies to really open their wallets and invest into those important projects.\"<br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewseuneedscommonstandardsdefininghighqualitycarboncreditssayemissionsexperts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D7K-6T11-F03F-K0JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

This involves improved water governance, better technologies, infrastructure upgrades, and awareness raising. All this requires a renewed culture of valuing water,\" she told Euractiv.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Addressing vulnerabilities</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The World Bank identifies Central Asia as one of the most vulnerable regions, with significant economic and environmental challenges from water stress. Countries in Europe are also endangered, such as Czechia, Hungary, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine.<br/><br/><br/>Ziganshina said the countries of Central Asia are building resilience through structural/infrastructure transformations, lining canals, modernising pumping stations and other infrastructure, advancing non-structural measures and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/><br/>Extreme weather events are expected to increase due to climate change, worsening water availability and flood risks. Financial losses from flooding already amount to $64 billion annually - the South Caucasus area is the most economically exposed.<br/><br/><br/>At the same time, drought hazards are also expected to increase significantly, particularly in Central Asia and the South Caucasus, threatening lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure.<br/><br/><br/>Ageing and inefficient water supply systems exacerbate the issue, leading to high water losses. Forty-four per cent of water is lost on average, and under half of collected wastewater is treated.<br/><br/><br/>The estimated annual cost to achieve water security and meet <url normalizedValue=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">water-related</url> Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is $77 billion. The report suggests encouraging private investment to address this gap.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Plenty of water, plenty of challenges</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Albania, as one of the countries studied in the report, has abundant water resources with low water stress but faces various risks and challenges in economic water productivity and water management.<br/><br/><br/>Key sectors reliant on water include hydroelectricity (which accounts for 97 per cent of the total domestic production), agriculture, and tourism, a prospective sector with huge potential for economic growth.<br/><br/><br/>Ami Kozeli, Deputy Minister of Infrastructure and Energy, spoke to Euractiv about the reforms the country is implementing to align with EU standards in modernising water supply and sanitation through utility consolidation and partnerships with the World Bank.<br/><br/><br/>Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/iwrm.shtml\">principles</url> guide these efforts, supported by River Basin Management Plans and legislative harmonisation with the EU <url normalizedValue=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/water/water-framework-directive_en\">Water Framework Directive</url>.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regional warning systems</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Albania is increasingly exposed to the impacts of climate change and poor management practices. An average of 2.4 per cent of the population in Albania is annually affected by floods, with significant GDP losses.<br/><br/><br/>The economic loss caused by floods is estimated at $2.3 billion, so the Albanian government, as well as governments in the Western Balkans region, must focus on modernising information systems to enhance water resource monitoring.<br/><br/><br/>Kozeli mentioned the regional warning system implemented partially for the Drin-Buna river basin, which aims at expanding collaboration between four partner countries: Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.<br/><br/><br/>\"The Government of Albania is assessing the possibility to have national plans in place to deal with flood emergencies. We are very much aware of the relevance of effectively managing information related to flood risk between different authorities,\" he told Euractiv.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transboundary water management</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Given the shared nature of water resources in the Western Balkans, Kozeli highlighted the need for neighbouring countries to foster trust and collaborate in managing these resources equitably.<br/><br/><br/>Measures include establishing institutional mechanisms like joint water management commissions, transparent data-sharing systems, and cross-border monitoring. Kozeli also discussed learning from global best practices and leveraging international organisations' expertise in supporting these efforts.<br/><br/><br/>\"As Albania, we remain committed to working with our regional partners to develop sustainable, fair, and effective solutions for managing our shared water resources,\" Kozeli concluded.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/europe-central-asia-under-pressure-to-modernise-water-security-infrastructure-reports-world-bank/\">Europe, Central Asia under pressure to modernise water security infrastructure, reports World Bank</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com\">Euractiv</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewseuropecentralasiaunderpressuretomodernisewatersecurityinfrastructurereportsworldbank</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNH-XDG1-F03F-K4RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Experts are calling for the creation of a carbon removal budget to encourage enhanced storage as a sustainable practice to combat climate change.</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Given that forests cover 40 per cent of Europe and nearly half are privately owned, a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://efi.int/sites/default/files/files/publication-bank/2024/efi_fstp17_2024.pdf\">report</url> by the European Forest Institute (EFI) advocates for incentivising forest owners to adopt sustainable practices, such as temporal carbon credits.<br/><br/><br/>These credits provide annual financial rewards based on measurable carbon storage, fostering trust in carbon markets while discouraging environmentally degrading activities like logging and land clearing.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>The report emphasises that afforestation - replanting and regenerating forests - is the most effective way to store carbon long-term, alongside measures such as diversifying tree species, agroforestry, and wetland management.<br/><br/><br/>It also calls for improved geospatial monitoring and third-party verification to ensure the credibility of carbon farming initiatives and that they deliver genuine climate benefits, helping enhance forest resilience.<br/><br/><br/>Scientists stress the critical role of forests in removing CO2, preserving biodiversity, and improving air quality, noting the increasing threats of wildfires, droughts, and storms, with 2024 on track to be the <url normalizedValue=\"https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-2024-update-cop29\">warmest year</url> on record.<br/><br/><br/>To achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the report urges policymakers to align national and EU-level strategies, balancing the promotion of wood use with measures to reduce harvests and enhance forest resilience.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Certification for carbon farming</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>EU forests <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/forests-and-forestry\">absorb</url> around 10 per cent of the total EU emissions, playing an important role both in climate change <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-mitigation-reducing-emissions\">mitigation</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation\">adaptation</url>. Their innate ability to regenerate and adapt makes forests a great ally in facing the damaging effects of climate change.<br/><br/><br/>However, they are facing increasingly dramatic changes. While the north has seen changes in rainfall, the south experiences more frequent heatwaves and lower rainfall, making them susceptible to droughts and forest fires.<br/><br/><br/>In November, the European Council approved a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/11/19/council-greenlights-eu-certification-framework-for-permanent-carbon-removals-carbon-farming-and-carbon-storage-in-products/\">regulation</url> establishing the EU's first certification framework for carbon removals, carbon farming, and carbon storage in products, advancing the goal of climate neutrality by 2050.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Categorising carbon removal</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The regulation includes three main categories of activities: permanent carbon removals that store carbon for centuries, carbon storage in long-lasting products for at least 35 years, and carbon farming practices that enhance carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in soils over a minimum of five years.<br/><br/><br/>To qualify for certification, activities must demonstrate measurable net carbon or soil emission reductions, provide additional benefits beyond existing requirements, ensure long-term carbon storage, and avoid significant environmental harm while contributing to sustainability goals.<br/><br/><br/>All certified activities will undergo independent verification by third-party bodies and adhere to strict monitoring, reporting, and liability standards. An EU-wide electronic registry will be launched four years after the regulation takes effect to ensure transparency and traceability of certified carbon units.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon removal budget</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Achieving net-zero carbon emissions is critical to stabilising carbon levels, but this requires both drastically reducing emissions and addressing residual emissions through carbon removal.<br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-removals-and-carbon-farming_en\">Carbon removal</url>, a critical yet complex aspect of climate action, encompasses a range of methods, from nature-based solutions like planting trees to technological innovations that capture and store carbon underground.<br/><br/><br/>Durable carbon removal, though essential, is scarce and expensive, costing approximately 100 times more than traditional carbon credits focused on emission avoidance. Overreliance on land-based removal methods also risks undermining food security and human rights.<br/><br/><br/>To address these challenges, experts at the World Economic Forum (WEF) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/why-the-world-needs-a-carbon-removal-budget-not-just-a-carbon-budget/\">propose</url> establishing a global carbon removal budget analogous to a carbon emissions budget.<br/><br/><br/>The framework would quantify removal capacity, set its value, and guide its equitable allocation across countries, companies, and financial institutions.<br/><br/><br/>Such a budget could help ensure the responsible use of finite removal resources, prioritising them for emissions that are hardest to eliminate.<br/><br/><br/>Experts argue that integrating carbon removal budgets into climate strategies would support informed decision-making, equitable resource distribution, and investments in expanding removal capacities.<br/><br/><br/>By embedding this concept into global climate negotiations and net-zero planning, nations and organisations can ensure carbon removal fulfils its essential role in combating climate change.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/put-forest-resilience-at-heart-of-carbon-storage-incentives-budget-say-experts/\">Put forest resilience at heart of carbon storage incentives budget, say experts</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com\">Euractiv</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetnewsputforestresilienceatheartofcarbonstorageincentivesbudgetsayexperts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMJ-DJJ1-JCMC-W0FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Sapphire used '[a] synthetic process... whereby they were taking algae from an ivory and growing it in very artificial static situations... [requiring] massive infrastructure... [and] very expensive full bio-reactors,' Gubbioli explained. This fragile and high-cost method never recovered from the post-2008 oil price collapse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lessons learnt for nature-based CCS</emphasis></p><p>By contrast, Gubbioli believes the sector can become much more resilient if it embraces more grassroots, uncertain production methods.</p><p>'We looked at our failures and we learned from them, and that's why we moved to very natural processes,' he explained of Brilliant Planet's own development journey. Brilliant Planet sequester carbon directly from the atmosphere by growing specific strains of microalgae in open saltwater facilities on the coast of Morocco.</p><p>'We grow our algae by the sea with the local species, and in a natural environment. So, what that means is that the algae naturally is ready to compete with its predators. Survival of the fittest - that's how we've adopted the technology,' explained Gubbioli. The result is a lower-cost, simpler and more resilient solution than previous iterations of algae CCS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biden puts CCS back in focus</emphasis></p><p>The discussion between Caldwell and Gubbioli follows the return of CCS to the top of the climate debate, with its inclusion in the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by President Biden this month.</p><p>The bill's inclusion of $369 billion in investments for clean energy and climate will reduce US emissions by 42% by 2030 (versus just 27% under prior policy) according to a preliminary analysis by Princeton University. This includes billions of dollars for agricultural nature-based solutions and increases the value of the 45Q tax credits which pay firms to capture and store carbon. Particularly relevant is an increase in the tax credit for removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere to $180 a ton, which is expected to encourage more start-ups like Brilliant Planet to develop nature-based CCS solutions.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BfPPYiDIKHpgUU9NeQLIIm_dXm2hqA6ZQZ014CNRw36D_8-TFQasjc1KcYA8h3PRVczCWQP5SJJlxVJx4MhNXP-o9DkvZ5jh4LJkenUHhyqThUy4Xyb_EoazG6_DT7LeIc0H13uaBUZHdCKFkbzaTw==\">Conversations on Climate</url>offers a space for entrepreneurs, leaders and global experts to contribute their experience and expertise to the climate change discussion.

In June, <url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dxbbKHfs?url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/breaking-eu-countries-rubberstamp-nature-restoration-law-after-months-of-deadlock/\">the EU nature restoration law only just passed on a knife-edge vote</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dxbbKM2v?url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/09/26/bern-convention-eu-will-propose-changing-the-conservation-status-of-wolves/\">In September, the European Council announced a decision</url> to propose a downgrading of the conservation status of the wolf.</p><p>On the 2nd October, <url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dxbbKRRx?url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5009\">the European Commission announced a delay</url> in the implementation of its Deforestation Regulation-a landmark new legislation that was adopted during the last CBD conference in 2022. Even Switzerland, one of the richest countries in the world, <url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dxbbKXqz?url=https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/switzerland-swiss-voters-reject-biodiversity-initiative-proposal-conservation\">rejected a proposal in September</url> that would have made authorities do more to protect natural habitats from pollution and development.</p><p>At the same time, we see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.devex.com/news/why-are-billions-being-cut-from-european-aid-budgets-107647\">new cuts being proposed by several European government donors</url> to their overseas development aid budgets that provide funding to the world's least developed countries. This is particularly concerning, as most of the world's remaining biodiversity is found in poorer countries, which have the least resources to protect it.</p><p>The irony is that this hesitancy is coming just the three so-called Rio Conventions offer the greatest opportunity for integrated action on the environment.</p><p>An integrated approach can deliver nature-based solutions, which means investing in biodiversity to solve other environmental and societal problems. In particular, such solutions must prioritise areas that maintain ecological integrity.</p><p>This enables them to support biodiversity, provide climate change resilience, adaptation and mitigation benefits, support for Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and health benefits to people and wildlife.</p><p>For example protecting the last remaining tracts of forest ecosystems still high in ecological integrity protects biodiversity and reduces desertification while delivering multiple benefits for the climate, societies, and economies.</p><p>Consider the vast remaining tracts of tropical forest across Central Africa.</p><p>These provide habitat for critically endangered gorillas and forest elephants, whilst also providing essential services for wellbeing of our planet in the form of climate and water regulation. People depend on these natural services for resources and economic opportunities like tourism.</p><p>Restoring the ecological integrity and health of oceans likewise delivers economic benefits and food security to coastal communities and beyond.</p><p>If richer countries now waver in protecting their own biodiversity and cut back on their financial commitments to poorer countries, it is unclear how we will protect these last remaining ecosystems that we all depend on.</p><p>The upcoming global environmental meetings offer us an opportunity for meaningful global action that will give all of us a more secure future. The EU and likeminded countries must keep building on the leadership they have shown in the past and seize this opportunity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectioneetopinioninthisseasonofglobalenvironmentalnegotiationstheeumustnotwaver2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D7X-PBM1-F03F-K2RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

According to projections, areas of North America will suffer devastating damage from insects and disease by 2027.<br/><br/>Global wood production has reached record levels, and the global demand for roundwood is expected to rise by as much as 49 per cent between 2020 and 2050, posing additional challenges to the forest sector.<br/><br/>To address these issues, the report underscores the importance of innovation in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">2030 Agenda</url>.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Innovative forest-based solutions needed</emphasis><br/><br/>\"The speed at which new challenges to sustainable development are rising is only matched by the rate at which innovations are emerging to deal with them,\" FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu says in the report's <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/722e0c62-cd6e-47dd-8cc2-976a854d577c/content/src/html/foreword.html#gsc.tab=0\">foreword</url>.<br/><br/>Innovation, according to Qu, is vital to accelerating the transformation of agrifood systems and achieving three major Global Goals: eradicating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition; eliminating poverty and driving forward economic and social progress for all; and promoting the sustainable management of natural resources.<br/><br/>\"But innovation does not arise in a vacuum. It requires enabling policies; strong, transformative partnerships; investment; an inclusive culture that is open to and encouraging of new ideas; and a willingness to take calculated risks,\" Qu emphasised.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five types of innovation</emphasis><br/><br/>The report singles out five <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/722e0c62-cd6e-47dd-8cc2-976a854d577c/content/src/html/types-innovation-forests-trees.html#gsc.tab=0\">types</url> of innovation that can enhance the potential of forests to address global challenges: technological, social, policy, institutional, and financial. It also presents 18 case studies from around the world, where innovations are being tested and implemented.<br/><br/>Among technological innovations, the report highlights the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can support efforts to stop and reverse deforestation and degradation.<br/><br/>AI could automate the analysis of vast amounts of data collected by drones, satellites and space stations, and it holds promise for controlling invasive species such as mammals, plants and invertebrates.<br/><br/>FAO also notes the dynamic relationship between social, policy and institutional innovation in the forest sector, therefore treating the three categories together in its report.<br/><br/>The organisation remarks that social innovations arise from interactions among stakeholders and can foster inclusivity and participation.<br/><br/>FAO encourages the promotion of gender-responsive policies, balanced employment opportunities, and the monitoring to ensure that women, youth and Indigenous people are included in locally-led solutions.<br/><br/>In terms of financial innovations, FAO advocates for increasing financing from national sources for forests and nature-based solutions, particularly by engaging the private sector to put more money into the sustainable development of forests and conservation.<br/><br/>Other innovations aim to make financing more environmentally and socially responsible, incentivising measures to reduce the environmental footprint of investments. An example of that is forest resilience bonds, which support restoration projects.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Overcoming barriers</emphasis><br/><br/>To promote and scale up innovation in the forestry sector, the report suggests five key actions: raising awareness, building skills and knowledge, fostering partnerships, ensuring accessible financing, and creating supportive policies and regulations.<br/><br/>FAO also identifies four barriers to scaling up innovation: lack of innovation culture, risk, limitations in resources, and unsupportive policies and regulations.<br/><br/>The report emphasises the need for inclusive and gender-responsive approaches to ensure that innovation benefits all, including men, women, youth, and marginalised groups.<br/><br/>[By Xhoi Zajmi\u00a0I Edited by Brian Maguire | <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodnewsinnovateandmaximiseforestpotentialtofightfoodandclimatechallengessaysfao</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D36-HD71-JCMC-W214-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Diversifying sustainable sources of biomass that is free of conflicts of use, thanks to regenerative, resilient, and productive crops such as bamboo grown on marginal lands and barren grounds, is a strategic challenge. The contribution of such crops to decarbonization is going to be significant.</p><p>Haffner Energy has developed an innovative, patented biomass and organic waste thermolysis technology, backed by 30 years of experience. This technology produces renewable hydrogen and clean fuels for industry and mobility applications. In addition, it generates biocarbon (char or biochar), a natural carbon sink, and biogenic CO2.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0</p><p>Bambbco is a nature-based solutions company that uses several species of bamboo to produce renewable energy, sequester carbon, prevent soil erosion, re-establish the water cycle, promote biodiversity, and contribute to the biomass-to-energy circular economy. Bambbco is a laureate of France's start-up booster program French Tech.</p><p>Bamboo produces up to four times as much biomass , as wood residues from a forest in standard conditions. In addition, bamboo displays remarkable characteristics such as being drought tolerant, requiring no chemical inputs, and capturing heavy metals and toxic chemical elements through its roots system. Those properties make it an ideal candidate for soil and ecosystem regeneration on marginal land, while simultaneously generating value.</p><p>\"Europe is the only continent in the world where bamboo is not recognized yet for its many benefits, from regenerating marginal lands and natural ecosystems to providing a highly sustainable, renewable, and competitive alternative to wood and wood residues for countless applications,\" points out Pierre-Alexandre Lemarquis, CEO of Bambbco.\u00a0\"I am excited about the forward-looking approach that Haffner Energy is taking with regard to biomass procurement. Together, we'll be able to develop local, circular economy-based ecosystems for clean fuels production projects,\" he adds.</p><p>\"We are happy to engage with Bambbco and develop biomass-to-energy projects in locations that would otherwise not be suitable. Barren areas can be brought back to life with robust energy crops and our technology,\" says Marcella Franchi, Haffner Energy Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Sales.\u00a0\"We can't wait to show visitors the new bamboo plantation at our new center in Marolles (Marne County, France). The plants can be used on location, among various feedstocks, to produce renewable syngas and hydrogen, and they will beautify the site.\"</p><p>The signing of this partnership will enable Haffner Energy and Bambbco to offer a turnkey solution for the production of green energy, with guaranteed feedstock availability and cost all year round. It builds on Haffner Energy's strategy to diversify sustainable biomass procurement, initiated earlier this year with the signing of a partnership with XanoGrass developer Hexas, in the United States.</p><p>The aggregated environmental virtues of those solutions are formidable:\u00a0</p><p>Securing biomass procurementCapturing CO2through photosynthesis\u00a0Sequestering CO2in biocarbon (char or biochar) and biogenic CO2through Haffner Energy's solutions\u00a0Regenerating marginal lands and creating value thanks to specialty crops\u00a0\u00a0Avoiding greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating fossil energy and replacing it by the ultimate renewable energy - energy from energy crops grown on marginal land</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Haffner Energy</emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>Haffner Energy, located in France, supplies solutions to produce competitive clean fuels.
