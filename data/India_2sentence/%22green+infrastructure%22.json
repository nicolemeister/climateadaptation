Climate risks and green infrastructure financing, as a catalyst for achieving net-zero emissions, has to move over time from the margins of policymaking to the heart of global and national agenda and occasions such as these should help in this endeavour.</p><p>2. Climate change is a phenomenon which we are seeing and living through on a daily basis. With each passing year, the extremes of weather patterns are becoming more intense. Whether it is extreme rainfall, droughts, heat waves or cyclones, changes and aberrations have become the norm. The incidents of formation of heat dome over USA or the monsoon rains hitting Mumbai before the scheduled onset reflect recent examples of the climate change. The probability of changing weather patterns is going to be more regular and its economic impact very severe in the times to come. A recent report2 on economic cost of extreme weather events estimates that over a ten-year period from 2014 to 2023, economic cost associated with climate-related extreme weather events amounted to $2 trillion. Notably, the estimated cost over the last two years taken together i.e., 2022 and 2023, was around $451 billion. Moreover Climate-induced disasters also disproportionately affect the poorest nations and communities.</p><p>3. The scale of the impact of events arising out of climate change therefore requires sizeable investments in technology and scale of finance to both build resilience and enable mitigation. As per OECD report3, the investment required for green and sustainable infrastructure is estimated at around USD 3 to USD 5 trillion per year until 2050. This is not just a nominal allocation of capital resources - it would require a significant shift of financial flows, complemented with appropriate policies, and reorientation of institutional priorities. The question is no longer about if but how to finance this transformation, which must then be our collective resolve going forward. Financing sustainable and green infrastructure can no longer remain a peripheral concern; it has to now become central to achieving both global and national net-zero targets, and for fulfilling the commitments of the Paris Agreement. These aspects are important for climate risk mitigation and facilitating a just transition. While more than 140 countries over the world have made commitments to net-zero targets-the real challenge lies in their achievement. Climate finance remains significantly off-track, fragmented, overly reliant on public funds and often inaccessible to the developing countries that need it most. So, the question before us is both urgent and clear: How do we catalyse sustainable and green infrastructure financing to deliver on the promise of net-zero? Let me share a few thoughts on this.</p><p>Sustainable and Green Infrastructure - The need of the hour</p><p>4. For, the current period marked by climate related volatility, limited resources and widening inequality, sustainable and green infrastructure is likely to be a necessity. The infrastructure whether in the form of power plants, highways, apartments, commercial buildings, or fuel pipelines, must be taken as steppingstones towards achieving the goal of net-zero in carbon emissions and not emerge as barriers in achieving these targets. According to a World Bank study4, every single dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure can save up to four dollars in avoided losses. Green and Sustainable infrastructure not only improves the quality of life through cleaner air, accessible mobility, and more efficient public services, while remaining climate friendly, it also helps in reducing vulnerability and inequality, particularly in communities that are prone to climate risks. Creation of climate resilient infrastructure reduces disaster risks and prevents catastrophic losses from floods, cyclones, and heatwaves. It also reduces the volatility of losses that may occur on corporate balance sheets in the face of physical climate risks, thereby help in improving financial stability. While the arguments for climate resilient infrastructure are compelling, the hurdles are many. It has been estimated5 that less than 1.5% of total assets under management (AUM) of global investment funds are aligned with Paris goals. Green infrastructure pipelines in emerging markets remain underdeveloped and the climate finance gap which is estimated at over $2.5 trillion annually6, is widening.</p><p>Financing Sustainable and Green Infrastructure - Issues and Challenges</p><p>5. While discussing sustainable and green infrastructure, the first step is to establish a clear definition and reach a consensus on what qualifies as green infrastructure. The green taxonomy plays a critical role in this regard. The government has recently released the draft of the climate finance taxonomy for public consultation, which paves the way for much-needed uniform classification across the economy and financial system. The draft taxonomy lays down four essential criteria viz. avoidance of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, reduction of GHG emissions intensity, adaptation solutions that reduce the risk of adverse impacts of climate change and research and development, for classification related to climate finance. But the key to enable sustainable and green infrastructure is technology. New technologies can lead to reduction in emission intensities, increase energy efficiency, provide alternate energy sources to help avoid GHG emissions, and build innovative solutions to drive adaptation and resilience towards mitigating the perils of climate change.</p><p>6. This dependence on technology is however both the enabler as well as the main constraint on the flow of finance. Let me elaborate a bit. Finance always follows the principle of risk and reward. Financial institutions adopt risk-based pricing for financial products, considering both the borrower's risk profile and the inherent risks associated with the proposal. The technologies underlying sustainable and green infrastructure are still evolving and are therefore less reliable regarding their future viability as compared to the traditional technologies, which are comparatively stable and have stood the test of time regarding cash flow generation. There may also be lack of technical expertise and capacity among the creditors in understanding these evolving technologies. Hence, compared to traditional technologies, there are higher perceived inherent risks related to sustainable and green infrastructure technologies which then get reflected in their risk pricing. Sustainable and green projects thus often face higher upfront costs including capex requirements. The perceived risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure limit access to debt financing for early-stage technologies, highlighting the need for greater equity investment (First Loss Default Capital). Other constraints relate to longer payback periods creating asset-liability mismatches, information gaps, lack of robust assurance and verification functions, which limit understanding and appraisal of these technologies to prepare investment-grade infrastructure projects i.e., those with well-defined cash flows, clear governance, and measurable impact metrics.</p><p>7. Climate change risks directly impact the real economy, and the financial sector in turn gets impacted on account of its credit exposure to the real economy. For the financial sector to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, relevant information flow from the real economy i.e. corporate/institutional borrowers in a timely manner is important. Given that climate change and climate risks is likely to impact a business segment consisting largely of MSMEs, unorganised sectors and un-listed corporates, creating an awareness and understanding amongst these borrowers on climate change risks and obtaining the required information becomes important.</p><p>8. Understanding climate change is an elaborate process involving the use of complex models to analyse the weather and climate patterns to predict the changes. Along with historical data, projections of climate variables such as rainfall, and temperature, are also inputs for forward looking risk estimations. However, the financial system or financial analysts have limited exposure to climate science. At the same time climate scientists have limited understanding of financial modelling and risk estimations. This creates a gap between these two input streams and that challenges us in accurately estimating the risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The availability of climate related data with proper understanding about its sources and methodology of its estimation is essential for financial analysts to aid their decision making.</p><p>9. Since sustainable and green infrastructure technologies contribute to the reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas emission intensity, a critical consideration for financing entities is to address the risks of green washing. For a creditor to fund any project which is intended to achieve reductions in GHG emissions, there is a need to clearly understand how these projected reductions are being quantified. It would also require a robust and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) function. Standardised processes and databases to inform and quantify such benefits would be necessary to increase the funding avenues for such infrastructure projects.</p><p>10. There are several building blocks or ecosystem enablers which are required to be fostered and promoted to remove the bottlenecks surrounding sustainable and green infrastructure projects. Without innovative financial instruments to mitigate early-stage risks, lack of availability of avenues for blended finance, many projects lack the scale or bankability needed to attract private capital. These limitations are further exacerbated in case of emerging market economies as inadequate financial instruments, and fragmented institutional coordination are critical constraints that are further exacerbated by poor sovereign ratings which leads to further increase in risk premium particularly when trying to access global funds. Global funding, where available, is predominantly denominated in foreign currencies, exposing borrowers to exchange rate risks and consequently increasing the cost of financing - despite their need to access low-cost funds. Moreover, globally climate finance availability is spread across several funds which have different application procedures, eligibility criteria, and reporting standards, which makes it onerous and time consuming for ensuring flow of such funding. These factors lead to institutional paradox with capital seeking sustainability, while sustainable assets seeking capital are unable to scale up and access these funds.</p><p>Catalysing the finance to Sustainable and Green infrastructure</p><p>11. Given the issues and challenges, our focus should be on identifying effective ways to mobilise the financing required to transform our infrastructure landscape toward green and sustainable development. Let me float a few ideas for you to ponder on. To unlock the required flows into green and sustainable infrastructure, we need a holistic reconfiguration of the financial ecosystem - one that rewires risk, institutionalises sustainability, and aligns incentives. We need to follow a building block approach whereby the ecosystem enablers are first put in place, thereafter harmonised and made consistent across all the sectors. We could categorise these enablers in two categories as endogenous and exogenous enablers. The endogenous enablers refer to the requirements of information flow, data gap bridging, MRV requirements, and building up of technical expertise. They can then act as the lynchpin between the availability and requirement of credit flow and cover the entire ecosystem right from the appraisal to disbursement and monitoring of finance related to sustainable and green infrastructure projects. These enablers will prepare the financial system to cater to the financing needs and facilitate the flow of funds with greater certainty.</p><p>12. The exogenous enablers would involve mechanisms that can be built to cater to the innate risks associated with green and sustainable infrastructure, which is requirement of risk capital, first loss default capital, concessional funding, quantum of funding, global funding, public and private capital mobilisation. Blended finance, which combines concessional public finance with private capital, is essential for bridging the bankability gap of green and sustainable infrastructure. There is a need for an adequate mix of public and private funding where the public funds crowds in the private funds through appropriate incentive structure. Specific mechanisms need to be enabled wherein global funds scale their mandates from project-level support to market-shaping interventions, also targeting underdeveloped sectors like adaptation infrastructure, and nature-based solutions. There is also requirement for Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), National Development Banks (NDBs) and Vertical Climate and Environmental Funds (VCEFs) to harmonise approach and operations and enable joint funding to enable shift from being direct lenders to catalytic partners and bring in economies of scale in sustainable and green infrastructure projects financing. Instruments like first loss guarantees, and subordinated debt, which can de-risk early-stage investments and crowd in institutional capital are also required.</p><p>13. Scalability of finance towards any cause comes either from policy nudges or market mechanisms that adequately incentivises risk taking. Once the endogenous enablers are in place, supported by exogenous enablers, innovative financial instruments such as sustainability linked loans, transition finance instruments, green debt securities etc., can get the required traction for enabling the flow of finance. Digital solutions are changing the way traditional finance works and that innovation needs to be channelised to the cause of sustainable and green infrastructure. Digital tools to automate MRV requirements, and data and information flows, can bring down compliance costs substantially. I would request all the tech enthusiasts to innovate and bring in solutions in this regard. To foster tech-based innovation in finance, RBI has instituted a regulatory sandbox wherein innovative solutions can be tested to provide market wide scalable solutions. RBI has also allowed 'Theme Neutral' applications as part of the 'On Tap' facility under the regulatory sandbox under which application containing any technology / theme can be made under various topics including sustainable finance and climate risk mitigation. Tokenization may soon enable fractional investment in infrastructure, opening new liquidity channels and investor bases. This approach needs to be explored for sustainable and green infrastructure. Fintech, blockchain, and AI have the power to streamline project verification, improve traceability, and democratise access to green and sustainable finance. We must capitalise on these efforts to establish an infrastructure pipeline of sustainable and green projects, a repository of vetted, investment-ready projects across sectors and regions. We must also empower local governments, indigenous communities, and civil society to lead climate infrastructure efforts. This may include decentralised renewable energy systems, sustainable land use practices, and community-based adaptation projects.</p><p>14. No country can achieve net-zero in isolation. Climate change is the quintessential global challenge and so too our response. There is a requirement of enhanced global cooperation in this regard which must also extend to technology transfer, R&amp;D funding, and skills development to enable development of technical expertise to identify, design, and structure bankable sustainable and green infrastructure projects. The focus needs to shift from project-based finance to overall market development with policy reforms, development of a project pipeline, and consistent regulatory frameworks, creating systemic conditions for fostering sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The international financial architecture also needs to be reoriented toward sustainability. The de-risking of sustainable and green infrastructure can work best when national, local, and multilateral institutions co-invest, signalling policy credibility and technical robustness. MDBs and global climate funds may need to revisit their governance structure to reflect the voice of recipient countries, particularly the global south and not just donor countries. Innovative financial instruments such as debt-for-climate swaps and climate-resilient debt clauses must also be scaled up to create fiscal space for green investments. We all need to work towards the creation of a reformed, empowered, and climate-aligned multilateral financial system.</p><p>Conclusion - Financial Leadership - Call to Action</p><p>15. The transition to net-zero is not just about finance, but also about knowledge, trust, and solidarity. We are at the crossroads or in climate terms nearing a tipping point. This is a moment not only for climate policy, but for the financial leadership to act together. A sustainable and green infrastructure is the best legacy we can pass on to the future generations. As finance professionals and leaders, we need to act in unison to foster endogenous and exogenous enablers and build a robust ecosystem to scale climate finance to catalyse green and sustainable infrastructure in a prudent manner. We need to align our mandates and approaches with the country's net-zero pathways, innovate and strategise and collaborate globally, even as we may act locally. The Reserve Bank of India has been proactive in its resolve to facilitate creation of a robust ecosystem wherein the assessment and mitigation of climate change risks are fostered and its impact on the economy and financial system is curtailed. In this context, we have followed a building block approach, focused on wide stakeholder consultation, capacity development, channelising flow of credit towards green finance, efforts to bridge limitations such as climate data gaps and modelling challenges, and building a conducive regulatory framework for risk assessment balancing compliance and conduct.</p><p>16. We need bold and urgent action to finance the future requirements. There is a need to catalyse the capital that helps to build the world we need. Sustainable and green infrastructure is the foundation of climate action, economic resilience, and social justice. It is a significant lever for us to achieve net-zero targets, protect our communities, and create a more equitable world. The future has been built and will continue to be built, one way or another. The question is: will it be sustainable? And what can we do to ensure it?</p><p>Let me leave you with these thoughts and wish you all successful deliberations and fruitful outcomes during these meetings.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>1 Inaugural Address delivered by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Conference on Green Infrastructure Finance on July 03 at College of Agriculture Banking, RBI, Pune in Collaboration with Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) India.

Climate change is a phenomenon which we are seeing and living through on a daily basis.", "This is not just a nominal allocation of capital resources - it would require a significant shift of financial flows, complemented with appropriate policies, and reorientation of institutional priorities. The question is no longer about if but how to finance this transformation, which must then be our collective resolve going forward. These aspects are important for climate risk mitigation and facilitating a just transition. While more than 140 countries over the world have made commitments to net-zero targets-the real challenge lies in their achievement.", "While more than 140 countries over the world have made commitments to net-zero targets-the real challenge lies in their achievement. Climate finance remains significantly off-track, fragmented, overly reliant on public funds and often inaccessible to the developing countries that need it most. Let me share a few thoughts on this. Sustainable and Green Infrastructure - The need of the hour4.", "So, the question before us is both urgent and clear: How do we catalyse sustainable and green infrastructure financing to deliver on the promise of net-zero? Let me share a few thoughts on this. For, the current period marked by climate related volatility, limited resources and widening inequality, sustainable and green infrastructure is likely to be a necessity. The infrastructure whether in the form of power plants, highways, apartments, commercial buildings, or fuel pipelines, must be taken as steppingstones towards achieving the goal of net-zero in carbon emissions and not emerge as barriers in achieving these targets.", "Let me share a few thoughts on this. Sustainable and Green Infrastructure - The need of the hour4. The infrastructure whether in the form of power plants, highways, apartments, commercial buildings, or fuel pipelines, must be taken as steppingstones towards achieving the goal of net-zero in carbon emissions and not emerge as barriers in achieving these targets. According to a World Bank study4, every single dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure can save up to four dollars in avoided losses.", "It has been estimated5 that less than 1. 5% of total assets under management (AUM) of global investment funds are aligned with Paris goals. 5 trillion annually6, is widening. Financing Sustainable and Green Infrastructure - Issues and Challenges5.", "Green infrastructure pipelines in emerging markets remain underdeveloped and the climate finance gap which is estimated at over $2. 5 trillion annually6, is widening. While discussing sustainable and green infrastructure, the first step is to establish a clear definition and reach a consensus on what qualifies as green infrastructure. The green taxonomy plays a critical role in this regard.", "5 trillion annually6, is widening. Financing Sustainable and Green Infrastructure - Issues and Challenges5. The green taxonomy plays a critical role in this regard. The government has recently released the draft of the climate finance taxonomy for public consultation, which paves the way for much-needed uniform classification across the economy and financial system.", "The draft taxonomy lays down four essential criteria viz. avoidance of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, reduction of GHG emissions intensity, adaptation solutions that reduce the risk of adverse impacts of climate change and research and development, for classification related to climate finance. New technologies can lead to reduction in emission intensities, increase energy efficiency, provide alternate energy sources to help avoid GHG emissions, and build innovative solutions to drive adaptation and resilience towards mitigating the perils of climate change. 6.", "Finance always follows the principle of risk and reward. Financial institutions adopt risk-based pricing for financial products, considering both the borrower's risk profile and the inherent risks associated with the proposal. There may also be lack of technical expertise and capacity among the creditors in understanding these evolving technologies. Hence, compared to traditional technologies, there are higher perceived inherent risks related to sustainable and green infrastructure technologies which then get reflected in their risk pricing.", "The technologies underlying sustainable and green infrastructure are still evolving and are therefore less reliable regarding their future viability as compared to the traditional technologies, which are comparatively stable and have stood the test of time regarding cash flow generation. There may also be lack of technical expertise and capacity among the creditors in understanding these evolving technologies. Sustainable and green projects thus often face higher upfront costs including capex requirements. The perceived risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure limit access to debt financing for early-stage technologies, highlighting the need for greater equity investment (First Loss Default Capital).", "Hence, compared to traditional technologies, there are higher perceived inherent risks related to sustainable and green infrastructure technologies which then get reflected in their risk pricing. Sustainable and green projects thus often face higher upfront costs including capex requirements. Other constraints relate to longer payback periods creating asset-liability mismatches, information gaps, lack of robust assurance and verification functions, which limit understanding and appraisal of these technologies to prepare investment-grade infrastructure projects i. e.", "However, the financial system or financial analysts have limited exposure to climate science. At the same time climate scientists have limited understanding of financial modelling and risk estimations. The availability of climate related data with proper understanding about its sources and methodology of its estimation is essential for financial analysts to aid their decision making. 9.", "The availability of climate related data with proper understanding about its sources and methodology of its estimation is essential for financial analysts to aid their decision making. 9. For a creditor to fund any project which is intended to achieve reductions in GHG emissions, there is a need to clearly understand how these projected reductions are being quantified. It would also require a robust and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) function.", "Standardised processes and databases to inform and quantify such benefits would be necessary to increase the funding avenues for such infrastructure projects. 10. Without innovative financial instruments to mitigate early-stage risks, lack of availability of avenues for blended finance, many projects lack the scale or bankability needed to attract private capital. These limitations are further exacerbated in case of emerging market economies as inadequate financial instruments, and fragmented institutional coordination are critical constraints that are further exacerbated by poor sovereign ratings which leads to further increase in risk premium particularly when trying to access global funds.", "Moreover, globally climate finance availability is spread across several funds which have different application procedures, eligibility criteria, and reporting standards, which makes it onerous and time consuming for ensuring flow of such funding. These factors lead to institutional paradox with capital seeking sustainability, while sustainable assets seeking capital are unable to scale up and access these funds. Given the issues and challenges, our focus should be on identifying effective ways to mobilise the financing required to transform our infrastructure landscape toward green and sustainable development. Let me float a few ideas for you to ponder on.", "We could categorise these enablers in two categories as endogenous and exogenous enablers. The endogenous enablers refer to the requirements of information flow, data gap bridging, MRV requirements, and building up of technical expertise. These enablers will prepare the financial system to cater to the financing needs and facilitate the flow of funds with greater certainty. 12.", "There is a need for an adequate mix of public and private funding where the public funds crowds in the private funds through appropriate incentive structure. Specific mechanisms need to be enabled wherein global funds scale their mandates from project-level support to market-shaping interventions, also targeting underdeveloped sectors like adaptation infrastructure, and nature-based solutions. Instruments like first loss guarantees, and subordinated debt, which can de-risk early-stage investments and crowd in institutional capital are also required. 13.", "Once the endogenous enablers are in place, supported by exogenous enablers, innovative financial instruments such as sustainability linked loans, transition finance instruments, green debt securities etc. , can get the required traction for enabling the flow of finance. Digital tools to automate MRV requirements, and data and information flows, can bring down compliance costs substantially. I would request all the tech enthusiasts to innovate and bring in solutions in this regard.", "RBI has also allowed 'Theme Neutral' applications as part of the 'On Tap' facility under the regulatory sandbox under which application containing any technology / theme can be made under various topics including sustainable finance and climate risk mitigation. Tokenization may soon enable fractional investment in infrastructure, opening new liquidity channels and investor bases. Fintech, blockchain, and AI have the power to streamline project verification, improve traceability, and democratise access to green and sustainable finance. We must capitalise on these efforts to establish an infrastructure pipeline of sustainable and green projects, a repository of vetted, investment-ready projects across sectors and regions.", "No country can achieve net-zero in isolation. Climate change is the quintessential global challenge and so too our response. The focus needs to shift from project-based finance to overall market development with policy reforms, development of a project pipeline, and consistent regulatory frameworks, creating systemic conditions for fostering sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The international financial architecture also needs to be reoriented toward sustainability.", "Climate change is the quintessential global challenge and so too our response. There is a requirement of enhanced global cooperation in this regard which must also extend to technology transfer, R&amp;D funding, and skills development to enable development of technical expertise to identify, design, and structure bankable sustainable and green infrastructure projects. The international financial architecture also needs to be reoriented toward sustainability. The de-risking of sustainable and green infrastructure can work best when national, local, and multilateral institutions co-invest, signalling policy credibility and technical robustness.", "The focus needs to shift from project-based finance to overall market development with policy reforms, development of a project pipeline, and consistent regulatory frameworks, creating systemic conditions for fostering sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The international financial architecture also needs to be reoriented toward sustainability. MDBs and global climate funds may need to revisit their governance structure to reflect the voice of recipient countries, particularly the global south and not just donor countries. Innovative financial instruments such as debt-for-climate swaps and climate-resilient debt clauses must also be scaled up to create fiscal space for green investments.", "We are at the crossroads or in climate terms nearing a tipping point. This is a moment not only for climate policy, but for the financial leadership to act together.

According to a recent industry data, the green building market was valued at $30.24 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $39 billion by 2025, of which $28 billion will come from the residential sector and $11 billion from the commercial segment. By 2028, it is expected to hit $45 billion, growing at over 5% CAGR. The green building materials segment alone is forecasted to reach $39.01 billion by 2033, growing at a strong CAGR of 1 1.28%.<br/><br/>These figures indicate that sustainable construction is no longer a niche segment, it is mainstream and mission-critical. Clients are demanding greener buildings, and regulatory bodies are creating systems like the Net Zero Carbon Rating, green mandates, and IGBC certifications to support this transition. Green roofing, rainwater harvesting, and automated HVAC systems are some of the visible outcomes of this shift.<br/><br/>What steps do you believe are essential to further accelerate the adoption of green infrastructure in India?<br/><br/>Sustainability is no longer just a design option: it's a design obligation. For India to scale its green infrastructure ambitions, we need three major shifts: policy clarity, public-private collaboration, and capacity-building. Governments must update building codes to reflect green priorities and offer tax breaks or faster approvals for certified projects. At the same time, the construction industry must invest in R&amp;D to bring down the cost of green technologies and materials. Stakeholder education, whether through colleges, industry seminars, or digital platforms, is equally vital.<br/><br/>Lastly, institutions like the Indian Concrete Institute (ICI), PSI, ACCE(I), which I represent, are playing a pivotal role by promoting technical awareness, pilot programs, and cross-sector knowledge exchange. Together, these steps will drive the shift from intent to implementation.<br/><br/>What sustainable practices are being adopted on your construction sites to minimize environmental impact?<br/><br/>We're adopting several sustainable practices at our construction sites, which help us significantly reduce our carbon footprint. These include the use of locally sourced and recycled materials, energy-efficient machinery, and water-saving systems such as rainwater harvesting and recycling units. Our project teams also focus on waste segregation and material reuse. These steps have led to measurable reductions in water usage, energy consumption, and carbon emissions, helping us align with national green construction goals.<br/><br/>What are the major challenges you face in delivering green infrastructure projects, especially in balancing sustainability targets with project costs and deadlines?<br/><br/>One of the biggest challenges is balancing the high initial cost of green technologies with tight project budgets and timelines. Sustainable materials and systems often come at a premium (about 10-15% higher than conventional alternatives). There's also the issue of sourcing these materials consistently, as well as aligning stakeholders (clients, contractors, and regulators) on the importance of long-term environmental returns over short-term cost savings. Additionally, regulatory frameworks are still catching up to the needs of modern green infrastructure, which sometimes slows down approvals and adds to project complexity.<br/><br/>We are actively managing construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste by implementing waste segregation, material tracking, and partnerships with certified recycling agencies. Wherever feasible, we repurpose materials on-site and promote the use of fly ash, C&amp;D aggregates, and other alternative resources in concrete mixes and backfilling. These materials are increasingly being accepted due to their cost-effectiveness and sustainability benefits. However, the extent of adoption also depends on project specifications, client awareness, and availability of local processing units.<br/><br/>How are digital technologies such as BIM, IoT, and real-time project monitoring enhancing efficiency and helping you meet sustainability goals?<br/><br/>Emerging technologies hold great promise for our industry. 3D printing, for instance, reduces material usage and offers design flexibility, which is particularly useful for affordable housing or rapid infrastructure development.<br/><br/>Monolithic construction techniques help improve structural integrity and cut down construction timelines significantly. Digital technologies like Building Information Modeling (BIM), IoT-based monitoring systems, and digital twins allow for better project visualization, early error detection, and improved coordination between stakeholders. These tools not only enhance efficiency but also help in achieving environmental benchmarks through better resource planning and lifecycle analysis.<br/><br/>How is your company leveraging advanced mechanization and modern construction methods to meet project timelines and ensure quality and safety?<br/><br/>We've increasingly adopted modern construction methods such as precast technology, modular scaffolding, tunnel formwork, and slipform systems. These methods reduce dependency on manual labor, enhance safety, and ensure faster delivery. Equipment like advanced cranes, hydraulic jacks, and concrete placement systems have become integral to our project timelines.<br/><br/>While the initial investment is higher, ROI is justified by the reduction in project duration, fewer accidents, better quality control, and lower lifecycle costs. In green projects, these technologies also support sustainability by minimizing material waste and enhancing site efficiency.<br/><br/>How is the training of your workforce being aligned with the new technologies, safety standards, and sustainable practices?<br/><br/>We invest heavily in skilling our workforce to adapt to new technologies and green practices. Training modules cover green construction standards, safety compliance, use of digital tools, and advanced construction equipment handling. We conduct on-the-job sessions, expert-led workshops, and partner with industry bodies like PSI and ACCE to create structured training and certification programs. This ensures that both white-collar and blue-collar workers are aligned with our goals of delivering high-quality, sustainable, and technology-integrated infrastructure.</p>", "publisher": "NBM & CW", "instances": ["\"Greener construction must be backed by smart policy, skilled people, and scalable technology to ensure India's infrastructure is resilient, future-ready, and climate-aligned.

Rapid urban growth surpasses effective urban and transport planning, resulting in worsening air and noise pollution, urban heat islands, and limited green spaces. These challenges contribute to significant health risks, including increased mortality rates for city dwellers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, with strategic urban planning and sustainable transport solutions, cities can mitigate these harmful effects and create healthier, more liveable environments.</p><p>One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through active transportation. Cities that invest in pedestrian-friendly pathways and bike lanes encourage physical activity while also minimising reliance on cars.</p><p>By ensuring safety and convenience, such infrastructure makes walking and cycling more appealing to residents, reducing vehicle congestion and emissions.</p><p>Public transport also plays a critical role in sustainable urban mobility. Expanding metro networks, bus services, and other mass transit options can significantly ease traffic congestion and lower pollution levels. For example, Paris is enhancing its transit system with new routes to offer viable alternatives to car travel, encouraging a shift toward greener commuting habits.</p><p>Technology is another powerful tool for improving urban transport. Smart traffic systems that analyse real-time road conditions can optimise signal timings, reducing unnecessary idling and emissions. Adaptive traffic control strategies lead to smoother traffic flow, minimising pollution and enhancing efficiency.</p><p>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key component of sustainable transport. By investing in EV charging stations, cities make it easier for residents to adopt cleaner transportation options. Many municipalities are prioritising this shift to align with long-term sustainability goals. Green urban planning extends beyond transport infrastructure. Parks, green roofs, and urban forests help combat the heat island effect while providing essential recreational spaces. Brisbane, for instance, has been actively designing cooler, walkable urban spaces, setting a precedent for other cities worldwide.Sustainable road construction materials further contribute to environmental benefits. The use of recycled asphalt and permeable concrete minimises resource consumption and improves stormwater management, making roads more resilient while reducing their ecological impact.</p><p>The advantages of sustainable urban transport planning are far-reaching. Reduced vehicle usage leads to lower carbon emissions and improved air quality. Access to green spaces and active transport options fosters healthier lifestyles, reducing the risk of lifestyle-related diseases. Efficient public transport and smart traffic systems ease congestion, enhancing the daily lives of commuters. Additionally, investments in sustainable infrastructure create job opportunities and attract responsible businesses, stimulating economic growth.</p><p>Despite these benefits, several challenges must be addressed. Implementing sustainable infrastructure requires significant initial investment, but the long-term savings in public health improvements, reduced environmental damage, and economic development make it a worthwhile endeavour. Strong policies and regulations are essential to drive these initiatives forward, ensuring that sustainable urban development remains a priority. Community engagement is also crucial-when residents are actively involved in planning, projects are more likely to meet local needs and gain public support. The journey toward sustainable cities is both necessary and achievable. By prioritising active transport, public transit enhancements, smart traffic solutions, and green infrastructure, urban areas can minimise their environmental footprint while improving the quality of life for their residents. While challenges exist, the long-term benefits of a low-carbon, people-centric urban environment far outweigh the obstacles, paving the way for a greener and healthier future.</p><p>(The writer is managing director of Systra Group India.

Focused on protecting lives, livelihoods, and economic activity in Turkiye's largest city, the project aims to improve Istanbul's resilience.With Istanbul generating nearly one-third of Turkiye's gross domestic product (GDP) and home to over 15 million people, the city's vulnerability to earthquakes and climate shocks poses risks not only to its population but also to the national economy. </p><p>The project will help ensure that key public services can function during and after disasters, protect communities, and preserve economic continuity in the event of a major emergency. The Istanbul Resilience Project focuses on four key areas:Strengthening Emergency Preparedness and Response: The project will finance the construction of critical emergency response infrastructure, including 250 paramedic stations, two search and rescue centers, and 19 fire stations and wildfire detection towers. It will also enhance emergency logistics, and search and rescue capacity through equipment provision, training, and community-level preparedness activities.Enhancing the Resilience of Public Buildings: Approximately 50 critical public buildings including schools, dormitories, elderly care facilities, and community centers will be constructed to high seismic and climate resilience standards. These buildings will serve as safe shelters during disasters and incorporate green infrastructure such as on-site solar power generation, rainwater harvesting, and energy-efficient systems that would serve as self-sufficiency features.Technical Assistance and Institutional Strengthening: The project will support Istanbul's provincial authorities and the Istanbul Project Coordination Unit (IPCU) with technical studies, institutional capacity building, and planning for longer term investment needs. Among these topics, technical assistance on seismic resilience standards and international good practice is also being provided to the IPCU team with support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.Contingent Emergency Response: A dedicated component will enable rapid reallocation of project funds in the event of a future emergency to support urgent recovery and reconstruction needs. The project supports Turkiye's national priorities outlined in the 12th National Development Plan, Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategy, and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which prioritize disaster risk reduction, urban resilience, and green infrastructure development. It also aligns with Istanbul's Provincial Risk Reduction Plan (IRAP).With Istanbul's public building stock aging and emergency response capacity under strain, this investment will help ensure faster and more effective disaster response while strengthening infrastructure against seismic and climate hazards. Ultimately, the project aims to protect millions of people and ensure the continuity of vital services across Istanbul Province.The World Bank remains committed to supporting Turkiye in building disaster resilience for its cities and communities, helping protect lives and secure sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

A treatment system will also be required to collect and treat any leachate from the constructed containment cells. Clean backfill will replace removed soil.</p><p>A low-permeability cover will be placed on areas of the site with lower levels of contamination to keep precipitation from creating contaminated runoff. These areas will also be covered with clean backfill.</p><p>Since 1991, provincial legislation in Nova Scotia requires mining companies to provide funds for reclamation - such as cash or bonds - before mining begins to cover full reclamation costs.

According to the IBEF\u2013JLL study (2024), India\u2019s green warehousing stock is expected to quadruple to 260 million sq. ft. by 2030, driven by growing demand from ESG-conscious occupiers and evolving regulations. This clearly signals that sustainability is a key differentiator.</p><p><br/><br/>At Welspun One, sustainability is not an add-on, it\u2019s integral to how we conceptualise, design, and deliver our parks. From IGBC-certified designs and solar-ready rooftops to rainwater harvesting, water recycling systems, and EV infrastructure, we embed green thinking at every stage.<br/><br/>We\u2019re also enabling our tenants to meet their own ESG goals by offering them plug-and-play solutions that reduce carbon intensity and improve energy efficiency from day one. As India targets net-zero and works to reduce logistics costs, future-ready infrastructure must be both green and performance-driven. For us, sustainability is how modern logistics will grow, endure, and lead.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the key factors driving sustainable operations in warehousing and logistics sector?</emphasis><br/><br/>The shift toward sustainable logistics is being driven by a mix of regulatory momentum, market expectations, and operational efficiencies. On one hand, government policies are increasingly pushing for greener infrastructure and emissions compliance, especially under frameworks like the National Logistics Policy. On the other, ESG-conscious clients, particularly in e-commerce, FMCG, and pharma, are actively seeking partners that align with their sustainability goals. Technology is a strong enabler allowing for better visibility and smarter decision-making across warehouse operations.<br/><br/>The rise of automation, IoT, and real-time analytics is enabling smarter, energy-efficient operations, while green infrastructure, such as IGBC- and LEED-certified warehouses, rooftop solar, and rainwater harvesting, is becoming standard across top-grade parks. Importantly, sustainability also makes business sense. Over time, these measures drive operating efficiencies, reduce lifecycle costs, and support long-term asset value creation.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How will increasing the share of railways and waterways bring in more sustainability in logistics?</emphasis><br/><br/>Research suggests that railways and waterways have a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to road transport. By pushing freight movement through these modes, we can reduce fuel consumption, traffic congestion, and emissions. At Welspun One, we view this as a long-term enabler and are already factoring in rail connectivity and port proximity into the master planning of our industrial and warehousing parks.<br/><br/>Our WTC Nhava Sheva project, for instance, is strategically located just minutes away from India\u2019s busiest container port, a deliberate move to support modal shift and improve freight efficiency.<br/><br/>This is about creating plug-and-play ecosystems that support modal shift, improve turnaround times, and reduce environmental impact. As the government rolls out initiatives like the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs), we believe private players like us have a big role to play in bridging policy intent with last-mile execution.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the sustainability measures taken by the company in its warehousing operations?</emphasis><br/><br/>We integrate a comprehensive suite of green measures that align with both global benchmarks and India\u2019s evolving environmental priorities. Our entire portfolio is green-certified, with built-in features like solar power, rainwater harvesting, low-VOC materials, and natural ventilation systems.<br/><br/>Our parks are designed to be water-neutral, with advanced sewage treatment and recharge infrastructure. To reduce embodied carbon, we use low-carbon concrete, optimize material sourcing, and adopt modular construction wherever feasible. We\u2019ve also committed to deploying solar power at scale across our portfolio, both at the rooftop and park level.<br/><br/>As India's green warehousing footprint is expected to quadruple to 260\u2013270 million sq. ft. by 2030 (JLL India), Welspun One is building ahead of the curve, making sustainability a competitive edge.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Indian Real Estate News", "instances": ["On the other, ESG-conscious clients, particularly in e-commerce, FMCG, and pharma, are actively seeking partners that align with their sustainability goals.
