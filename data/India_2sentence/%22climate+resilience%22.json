Across flood-prone villages, drought-hit agricultural belts, and vulnerable coastal towns, it is the ingenuity and action of local communities that are quietly leading the charge toward a more climate-resilient future. Ajay Hinduja, a Swiss citizen and an active member of the steering committee of the Hinduja Foundation, argues that enabling local leadership is critical to effective climate action. The Hinduja Family has invested for many years in initiatives that connect global knowledge with local implementation. </p><p>Now, as climate-related disasters intensify and become more frequent, Ajay Hinduja is advocating for a recalibration of how the philanthropy and development sectors approach climate resilience. \"Communities are not just victims of climate change. They are the most important agents of change,\" says Ajay Hinduja. \"When we pay attention to their lived experiences, and upon that build their wisdom, we create adaptive sustainable solutions.\"  This conviction guides the climate resilience programmes of the Hinduja Foundation. While working with NGOs, scientists and local government to create ecosystem-based livelihoods and disaster preparedness. A growing segment of the Foundation's environmental focus is now aligned with the global movement toward nature-based solutions, regenerative agriculture, and climate education tailored for youth in vulnerable regions. Ajay Hinduja highlights that while technology plays a vital role, it is not a substitute for community engagement. \"We are missing the point if the last-mile communities do not trust and utilise the best satellite mapping tools or early warning systems,\" he says. \"Climate adaptation is more than just statistics. It has to do with internal leadership, culture, and trust.\" This process is different to traditional philanthropic models where commitment is generally to large infrastructure or technology investments without a long-term locally owned model. The Hinduja Foundation under Hinduja Family's stewardship, is starting to shift its investments in climate-related activities towards participatory governance projects in rural India. For example, the foundation's recent project in Maharashtra helped train women from tribal communities to be climate educators, so they could run workshops on water conservation, soil health and resilient farming. Such efforts underscore the Foundation's conviction that the most impactful climate leaders are often those who are least recognised on the global stage. Ajay Hinduja notes, \"These women are not environmental scientists in the traditional sense. But they are restoring forests, reviving water bodies, and teaching future generations. That is leadership. That is resilience.\" It is a philosophy that is culturally based as well as philanthropically based. The Hinduja Family, one of the most respected Indian origin business families in the world, has consistently advocated for a norm where service and sustainability coexist. The Hinduja Foundation, philanthropic arm of the family, will continue to support, and potentially expand our investments in healthcare, education, and the environment as fundamentally related to improving and sustaining social good.  Ajay Hinduja's voice in the Foundation has been critical to move climate action into the forefront for the family. With his perspective as a Swiss citizen, he has been able to reconcile the valid realities of India with trends from around the world in a manner from which the Foundation can remain locally sensitive and globally relevant. \"The climate crisis is not unfolding in isolation. It affects food, health, gender equality, and economic stability,\" says Ajay Hinduja. \"We need integrated responses that make people more secure, not just environmentally, but socially and economically as well.\" Looking ahead, the Foundation aims to expand its climate work in urban areas too, focusing on youth-led innovation and community green spaces. Ajay Hinduja emphasises the importance of intergenerational dialogue in shaping the future. \"Young people are more aware than ever. They do not want empty pledges. They want action, accountability, and a seat at the table,\" he notes. Ajay Hinduja's focus on local leadership serves as a reminder, in a world filled with climate financing obligations and international summits, that the most lasting changes are designed for, place, culture and community. More than just a practical plan, the Hinduja Foundation is committed to this idea on a human level.  As climate risks escalate, the urgent work on the Hinduja family's legacy of inclusive development takes on a new dimension. Ajay Hinduja is supporting the climate activities at the Foundation, where the message is clear: to build resilience, you have to listen to the local. Enact the priorities from the edges.

It has disrupted normal life and has significant impact on business and industries in these states. The incident of forest fire in Uttarakhand - reported to be 11,256 incidents in the year 2023-2024 and spread in many districts - has caused heavy damage to the biodiversity of the region. These incidents highlight the need to look into the approach followed by Government in dealing with disaster and climate resilience and whether there is need for course correction to contain such massive loss of life, property, business, beside other long-term impacts on the environment and ecology. As per the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, 2025 (GAR) published by UN Office on Disaster Risk Reduction, the economic cost of disaster is increasing every year. </p><p>From an average of $70-80 billion a year (1970-2000), the annual cost is now $180-200 billion. The real cost of disaster is estimated to be $2.3 trillion when other related aspects are taken into account. India itself suffered economic losses of about $12 billion in 2023 against an average of $8 billion (2013-2021). Some estimates project the loss of about 2 per cent GDP due to disaster in the medium term. The trend is showing substantial increase in losses and likely to increase in future. Disaster happens almost in all countries across the world and has become a very regular phenomenon, thus affecting the community, infrastructure, flora and fauna, environment and economy. In India, the Disaster Management Act, 2005 provides the framework for effective management of the disasters which include, besides the responses to deal/manage after the occurrence of event, provision for implementing measures in prevention of danger or threat of any disaster. Section 6 of the Act inter alia authorises the NDMA/SDMA - national/state authority - to lay down guidelines to be followed by all departments by integrating the disaster plan in their existing schemes and programmes. It also prescribes for making disaster plan at various level/department of the Government and also allocating the resources in their budget proposal for the same.</p><p>Has the Act and its provisions been able to enthuse every departmental functionary at all levels to appreciate and understand the need to take steps necessary for mitigating and addressing the causes and factors leading to disaster? Though the response of the administrative machinery has been laudable after the event (disaster/calamity) has happened, their support in addressing the causes/factors has not been very encouraging. The seriousness to be taken by every department of the Government in designing and developing programmes and making them integral part of their functioning does need a lot of improvement. The committee approach at various levels has not been able to mainstream the disaster mitigation and related issues addressed appropriately and with desired sincerity in view of large scale and long-term consequences.</p><p>There are six main types of disasters - earthquake, floods, storms, heatwaves, forest fire and droughts - which accounted for more than 95 per cent of direct losses noticed/accounted in disasters across the world. The losses include environmental, human displacement cost, health impact, and other social cost including loss of education and business. Disaster impacts almost every walk of life . Almost every sector of the economy - from agriculture, forest, fisheries, small and medium industries and labour - are affected in disaster. In case of special children and Divyang, disaster is a way of life for them as they encounter it every day. This means that every department/institution of the Government needs to design programmes/schemes for mitigation of disaster. For example, a disaster by flooding will require measures from Irrigation Department (to design control measures), Public Works, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Food and Civil Supplies, Education, Forest, Social Welfare/Revenue, Education, Police, Health. This reflects the need for dovetailing the disaster and climate resilience programmes in every department so as to facilitate preventative as well as effective management aspects of such events.</p><p>Central level and state level bodies with mainly coordination function do not seem to suffice this requirement. Most Government bodies think that disaster and climate resilience are issues to be addressed by Disaster Department or Forest and Environment Departments.</p><p>The exigencies of dealing with climate resilience are not integral to their functioning. Disasters destabilise national economy, strain public finances, deepen poverty and inequality and disrupt long-term development gains, beside social and psychological impact on the community. One example of the disaster is on children - most vulnerable section of the society. At least 242 million pre-primary and upper-secondary students have experienced school disruptions due to climate events in 2024 across 85 countries or territories and three-quarters (74 per cent) of those affected students are in low- and lower-middle-income countries.</p><p>In India too, schools are generally the first one affected in any disaster - closed or used as shelter. Nowadays extreme weather events such as heatwave, pollution especially in the urban areas are having serious and long-term impact on the students. The main events leading to nationwide school disruptions in 2024 in at least 20 countries were heatwaves, tropical cyclones, storms, and floods largely influenced by ongoing climate change. It is estimated that globally 90 per cent of children are exposed to one or more major climate and environmental hazard.</p><p>Another major sector affected by disaster and climate change is Health. Globally around 4.2 million premature deaths take place due to air pollution. The emergence of new strain of virus - COVID - also poses serious disaster impacting large and vulnerable population. Unpreparedness of the Health Department infrastructure and, in some cases, a total collapse was noticed during the COVID outbreak.</p><p>With such long-term consequences, can disaster management be left to a \"postmortem approach\" - deal with it after occurrence of the disaster event - or does it need to be looked at differently in view of the serious impacts these disasters have on communities and nations? Presently, climate resilience approach has not been integrated in a manner that every department of the Government follows a focused and continuous approach in addressing the same. At one point of time, a similar approach as adopted by the NDMA Act was followed for dealing with matters relating to North Eastern States. North Eastern Council (NEC) was set up as a statutory body in 1972. Persuading every department to provide for specific component of their schemes for NE states despite issuance of guidelines/advisory was not found to be very effective. Despite NEC having all state Governors, Chief Ministers, Union Minister (Chairman) as members, the approach of exciting/persuading every department in Government was not found to be highly satisfactory. It was thereafter decided in 1998-99 to prescribe allocation of 10 per cent of total budget of each department for NE states. The unutilised portion of earmarked funds is maintained in a \"non-lapsable pool\" of resources. Ministry of Development of NE implements various schemes/programmes from the non-lapsable pool. Re-appropriations or diversion of funds from such allocation is strictly prohibited.</p><p>This has really helped and supported in mainstreaming the developmental issues related to NE states. Some of the most affected states - coastal, hilly, adjoining main rivers - do take a proactive approach in bringing stakeholders to appreciate the impact/consequences of such disaster on community, flora and fauna and other economic consequences. However, mainstreaming climate resilience in every agency of Government functioning still remains a challenge. The impact of climate disruption and disaster on future generations is going to be far more due to the significant environmental changes noticed due to various factors such as receding glaciers, rising temperature, forest fire, pollution of land and sea, water crisis and certain emerging technologies such as AI.</p><p>(The writer is a retired IAS officer.

This news, prominently featured by The Pioneer on July 21, marks a significant milestone for gender representation within India's esteemed All India Services and underscores the pressing need for governance that is both responsive to climate issues and inclusive of gender perspectives. In an era where the world grapples with disasters stemming from climate change - such as flash floods, cloudbursts, extreme weather events, wildfires, rising sea levels, and prolonged droughts - the role of the Indian Forest Service is becoming increasingly vital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the primary stewards of India's natural resources, forest officers bear the responsibility not only of safeguarding our forests and biodiversity but also of addressing and alleviating the effects of climate change, environmental degradation, and pollution. This transition in leadership, which highlights the role of women, occurs at a time when the global community calls for a more compassionate, inclusive, and resilient approach to climate management.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate Change and Women: A Crisis of Injustice</p><p>Climate change does not impact all genders uniformly. The consequences are particularly severe for those who are already vulnerable, with women, especially in countries like India, bearing the brunt of its effects. From having to travel longer distances to fetch water due to drought, facing increased risks of displacement during floods, to being the last to receive food aid during famines or relief efforts, women often suffer in silence. Even though women are largely underrepresented in key decision-making roles, they contribute the least to global carbon emissions. It is a commonly overlooked truth that the majority of choices and consumption patterns affecting the climate are driven by men, while women are more likely to suffer the consequences - a disparity that is not only environmental but also fundamentally social and ethical. This situation necessitates a dedicated effort towards climate justice, not just on a global level but also from a gender perspective.</p><p>Acknowledging this disparity is the first step. Addressing it through inclusive governance is the path forward - and this is where women officers in the Indian Forest Service can have a substantial influence.</p><p>Women IFS Officers: Pioneers in Climate Resilience</p><p>The Indian Forest Service holds a unique position within India's administrative structure. It directly tackles critical elements of environmental security - including forest conservation, biodiversity protection, water resource management, climate resilience, afforestation, and forest fire management.</p><p>A newly established all-female executive committee now at the helm of the</p><p>IFS Association instils renewed hope that the issues faced by women in climate-sensitive sectors will receive increased attention. These officers bring not only their knowledge and hands-on experience but also a level of empathy that is often lacking in top-down policy formulation. Women forest officers understand - both instinctively and through personal experience - the specific vulnerabilities that climate change poses to women.</p><p>For instance, in regions like Odisha, Uttarakhand, Assam, and Rajasthan, where women predominantly manage domestic water needs and livelihoods related to forests, climate variability and extreme weather conditions exacerbate their difficulties. Deforestation, wildfires, erratic rainfall, and diminishing springs impact their health, nutrition, time availability, and safety. Enhancing the representation of women in leadership positions within the Indian Forest Service (IFS) can contribute to reforming forest and climate policies that specifically acknowledge and address these vulnerabilities.</p><p>Government Initiatives: Progress, Yet Gaps Persist</p><p>India has achieved significant advancements in nature conservation and climate-related initiatives. The National Mission for a Green India, the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), and the Compensatory Afforestation Programme are commendable efforts. Additionally, the Van Dhan Yojana, along with the National Agroforestry Policy, merges forest-dependent livelihoods with conservation initiatives. At the community level, Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) and Eco-Development Committees (EDCs) promote participatory governance. These are often influenced or led by local women, who serve as traditional custodians of knowledge concerning biodiversity and sustainable practices. Nevertheless, their viewpoints are rarely included in comprehensive climate strategies or state action plans that address climate change.</p><p>This is where an increased representation of women in decision-making positions within the IFS can have a profound effect - by linking grassroots knowledge with policy frameworks. Their participation can incorporate gender considerations into forestry operations, climate risk assessments, and the development of adaptation strategies.</p><p>A Remarkable Accomplishment</p><p>This pioneering all-female committee is set to not only alter the leadership dynamics within the IFS but also serve as a beacon of inspiration for aspiring young women across India. An increasing number of girls will now aspire to join this prestigious All India Service, viewing it as a chance to make meaningful contributions to both the environment and society.</p><p>The Indian Forest Service has evolved beyond the traditional perception of merely managing remote forests. It now plays a crucial role in shaping India's climate resilience strategy, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and guiding the nation towards a greener and more inclusive future. As more talented and passionate young women opt for this career path, the service will benefit from enhanced diversity, innovative ideas, and greater effectiveness.</p><p>Echoes from the Top: A Vision Aligned with National Leadership</p><p>Prime Minister Shree Narendra Modi has consistently emphasised the importance of development driven by women and environmental stewardship. At the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in 2021, he remarked: \"We need to ensure that our daughters are entitled to a clean environment just like our sons.\"</p><p>He also mentioned in his \"Mann Ki Baat\" speech: \"Women play a crucial role in environmental conservation and must be at the forefront of our initiatives to protect nature.\"</p><p>These words are not just symbolic; they set the tone for national initiatives that recognise women's contributions to sustainable development. The newly established women-led IFS Association committee embodies this principle, highlighting that women are not simply victims of climate change but rather significant agents of climate action.</p><p>Path Ahead: Collaborative Climate Leadership for a Sustainable India</p><p>The establishment of an all-female executive committee represents not only a milestone in gender equality but also provides a strategic advantage for India. As the country faces recurring disasters such as the Sikkim cloudburst, Himachal and Uttarakhand landslides, Kerala floods, and escalating coastal threats in regions like Odisha and Tamil Nadu, the IFS must respond to climate challenges with agility and insight.</p><p>When empowered, women officers can execute comprehensive strategies for forest governance, promote community-oriented climate adaptation, ensure the collection of gender-disaggregated data, and advocate for eco-sensitive development planning that aligns conservation efforts with community welfare.</p><p>This transition also serves as a call to action - to provide enhanced training, support, and leadership opportunities for women in the forest and environmental sectors. The Government and training organisations must improve programs that cultivate skills in gender-sensitive climate planning and disaster risk reduction.</p><p>(The writer is Former Executive Director of National Institute of Disaster Management)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

The discourse wove together the fates of livestock herds, rural women in the informal sector, and the citizens of Meghalaya into a single tapestry of adaptation, ingenuity, and urgency.</p><p>Dr. Ragavendra Bhatta, Deputy Director General (Animal Science) at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research , painted a vivid portrait of the stakes in safeguarding livestock-lifelines for over 750 million of the world's poorest people-from the gathering storms of climate change. Livestock, more resilient to climatic shocks than many crops, remain imperilled by rising temperatures, shifting disease patterns, and insidious threats like the bluetongue virus in Europe. Heat stress in poultry and dairy animals erodes productivity and health, making the development of biomarkers and adaptive management strategies essential. His clarion call was unequivocal: investment in robust animal health systems is not charity but necessity-central to food security, the One Health paradigm, and the progressive elimination of priority animal diseases, with two-month disease risk forecasts offering a critical window for action.</p><p>Megha Desai of the Self Employed Women's Association, Gujarat , turned the lens to the sweltering fields and parched lanes where India's unorganised rural women labour unseen. Through her Swachha Akash campaign, she illuminated how heatwaves sap strength, dehydration threatens life, and basic potable water becomes a rare commodity during weather extremes. For these women, climate change manifests not as an abstract curve on a graph but as sunburnt skin, foot ulcers, and fatigue that blurs the boundary between endurance and exhaustion. Her prescription was as practical as it was humane: bridge the chasm between government health systems and the informal sector's familial networks, embed targeted health camps as a regular fixture, and dignify these women's labour with climate-adaptive safeguards.</p><p>In the verdant hills of Meghalaya, Sampath Kumar, Principal Secretary for Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of Meghalaya , offered a sobering forecast: even under mild scenarios, long-term temperatures could rise by 2.2C, with extreme projections touching 3.5C. The impacts-deforestation, erratic precipitation, altered land use-are already shaping the health realities of its people. His cost-of-inaction calculus was stark, prompting a two-pronged intervention strategy. On the supply side: Payment for Ecosystem Services, Energy Access Programmes, a forward-looking Water Policy, rat trap bond masonry for resilient infrastructure, solar-powered health facilities, and upgraded early childhood development centres. On the demand side: empowered village facilitators and natural resource management committees, all overseen by an apex body chaired by the Chief Minister to ensure coordination and political will.</p><p>What emerged from their collective narratives was a truth too often obscured: climate adaptation is not a monolith. It is a symphony of sectoral harmonies-where veterinary science meets gender equity, and state policy aligns with village stewardship. Only through such polyphonic engagement can India hope to weather the tempests ahead, ensuring that neither herds, nor women, nor highland communities are left to face the gathering storms alone.</p>", "publisher": "AgroSpectrum India", "instances": ["The discourse wove together the fates of livestock herds, rural women in the informal sector, and the citizens of Meghalaya into a single tapestry of adaptation, ingenuity, and urgency.

With public budgets under pressure, much of the adaptation effort will need to come from the private sector. A new World Bank report lays out policy reforms that would help households and firms adapt to increasingly frequent and damaging weather events.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Released today,From Risk to Resilience: Helping People and Firms Adapt in South Asia, finds that awareness of climate risk is high. More than 60 percent of households and firms have experienced extreme weather in the last five years, and more than 75 percent expect it for the next decade. Many households and businesses are already taking steps to adapt to climate risks. Around 80 percent of households and 63 percent of firms have taken some measures to adapt. However, most of these measures are basic, such as raising house foundations or installing fans. More advanced options, like using climate-resilient seeds, or relocating from high-risk areas, remain less common.</p><p>\"The urgency is growing. People and firms are already adapting, but they are doing so with limited tools and few resources,\" saidMartin Raiser, World Bank Vice President for South Asia.\"Governments must act quickly to remove the barriers that prevent more effective adaptation. This includes removing distortions in land and labor markets, expanding access to finance and investing in public infrastructure to support people and businesses as they respond to climate risks.\"</p><p>The report finds that market barriers and income constraints are holding back stronger adaptation. Households with more education or access to formal finance are more likely to adopt advanced strategies. Similarly, better-managed firms with fewer regulatory barriers tend to be more adaptive. Removing these barriers would enable more effective adaptation by households and firms.</p><p>\"Private sector adaptation could reduce one third of the region's projected climate damage, but this requires governments to strengthen enabling environments,\" saidFranziska Ohnsorge, World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia.\"Adaptation is most effective when markets function well and when essential services like transport, water, healthcare, and digital connectivity are widely accessible.\"</p><p>The report calls for both targeted adaptation efforts and broader development measures that also build climate resilience. Governments have a critical role to play, even with limited fiscal space. They can expand access to localized climate information, promote weather-indexed insurance, and support the use of resilient technologies such as energy-efficient cooling systems. Public investments in infrastructure that keep people safe and connected, such as roads, drainage, power supply, and mobile networks, are also essential.</p><p>In Bangladesh, investments in early warning systems and cyclone shelters have helped reduce fatalities during major storms. In India, cities like Ahmedabad are leading with heat action plans to protect urban populations from rising temperatures. They demonstrate how targeted investments, and effective institutions can help scale up local adaptation successfully.</p><p>The report calls for policy action guided by three core principles. First, implement a comprehensive package of adaptation measures. Second, prioritize solutions that support both development and climate resilience.

That framing is incomplete. As governments increasingly allocate resources to address environmental risks and invest in adaptation and resilience projects, they open up new streams of commercial activity. They create markets for goods, services and technologies built to withstand climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The flow of capital, mostly from public sources, is directed towards the private sector as public institutions identify adaptation and resilience requirements, allot budgetary funds and engage private contractors to deliver solutions.</p><p>Also Read: Climate havoc: Jellyfish are getting in the way of electricity supply</p><p>Globally, adaptation finance reached $63 billion in 2021-22, less than 5% of total climate finance, according to Climate Policy initiative (CPI), a think-tank. Climate finance today is directed almost entirely at mitigation measures (like energy transition). The adaptation gap is massive. Developing countries alone would require about $212 billion a year in adaptation finance by 2030, says the Global Commission on Adaptation.</p><p>The business-ready adaptation and resilience market in India could be worth $24 billion by 2030, a likely conservative estimate by Boston Consulting Group. The annual investment needs for climate-resilient infrastructure, agriculture, water systems and health services could exceed $100 billion, according to CPI, which has identified specific requirements for water resource management, coastal protection and disaster risk reduction, all of which represent tangible business opportunities.</p><p>Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | Uttarakhand flash flood: Climate's the big culprit</p><p>Demand for adaptation is rising rapidly. The World Bank expects India's urban climate infrastructure demand to balloon to $2.4 trillion by 2050-encompassing flood defences, water supply systems, drainage networks and more. Listed Indian firms like VA Tech Wabag, Jain Irrigation and Larsen &amp; Toubro are already seeing returns from such projects and are participating in government programmes such as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut), Smart Cities and the National Water Mission that integrate resilience requirements with infrastructure procurement.</p><p>Besides infrastructure, a variety of sectors stand to gain from adaptation spending, including agriculture, technology and finance and insurance. But investing in adaptation requires early bets on frontier innovation, a mindset of long-horizon investment and a pipeline of climate-tech and resilience-first startups. These would range from biotech firms developing drought-resilient farm seeds to companies pioneering flood-proof urban materials, distributed water systems or climate-risk intelligence platforms.</p><p>Also Read: Leena Srivastava: Watch out for the legal implications of climate inaction</p><p>Currently, most adaptation finance flows through public channels or international donors. In the face of climate impacts, both the public and private sectors must collaborate on meeting investment needs. However, private capital is constrained by a lack of risk data, the absence of bankable project pipelines and low regulatory clarity. This is where India needs to catalyse a new ecosystem of adaptation innovation through blended finance, procurement incentives and R&amp;D missions aimed at resilience.</p><p>The Reserve Bank of India, in a 2022 report, projected that Indian industries will require an investment of Rs.85.6 trillion by 2030 to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This sum, equivalent to 2.5% of GDP, is enormous. The report notes that investment on this scale is necessary to maintain operations, manage risks and create new economic avenues.</p><p>Also Read: The 16th Finance Commission could catalyze climate governance in India</p><p>The innovations needed should focus on solutions for sectors where market-ready products or services do not yet exist. Analyses by T20 India and PwC India identify a set of priority areas.</p><p>These include climate intelligence and analytics tools for remote sensing, forecasting and early warning systems, apart from urban water resilience devices such as rainwater harvesting, decentralized wastewater treatment and smart metering; agricultural technologies, including drought-tolerant seeds and bio-stimulants, and integrated crop insurance and advisory platforms; resilient construction materials like cool roofs, permeable paving and flood-resistant coatings; and health infrastructure capable of tackling heatwaves, floods and other climate-linked emergencies.</p><p>The urgency is clear. Without a sharp increase in adaptation spending, climate risks will rise, inflicting greater economic losses and constraining growth. For the private sector, this has two implications. First, public spending on resilience will continue to grow, providing stable demand for private contractors. Second, policy reforms and financial innovation are likely to open new commercial avenues.</p><p>Also Read: India's urban climate crisis is the result of our own policy failures</p><p>Adaptation finance has begun to resemble a growth industry where demand is policy-backed and funding is anchored in necessity. With heatwaves, floods and water stress accelerating, climate adaptation and resilience can also create a competitive advantage.</p><p>Countries that move early to build local markets, invest in R&amp;D and nurture adaptation-focused entrepreneurship will gain both in economic and ecological terms. This is not just about disaster management, but about developing a growth sector that private players, institutional investors and startups cannot afford to ignore.</p><p>The author is an independent expert based in New Delhi, Kolkata and Odisha.

The plan has been framed after a massive   exercise with various subcommittees   working under a 45-member committee. The biodiversity plan not only documents the state's biodiversity in minute detail but also proposes a strategy to drive the conservation of the state's resources by linking them to livelihood for local populations. </p><p>  This is expected to give the local populations a further incentive to conserve. The GSBSAP contains separate chapters on the conservation of the biodiversity   of coastal, marine, and vulnerable ecosystems. Dedicated   chapters address sustainable   development planning for rural and urban areas, climate   change, traditional knowledge, mid-plains, forest areas, and agri biodiversity among others. The sub-committee on wetlands   and water bodies has said   that a sea level rise could pose   a threat to Goa's mangroves.   \ufffd\u20ac\u0153The average sea level rise   trends in Goa has seen an increase at the rate of 1.45mm per year from the period of 1969-2013,\ufffd\u20ac the draft said.

Gopala Krishnan, MD, Southeast Asia and Middle East, GBCI<br/><br/>Adaptive Design<br/><br/>Adaptive design helps infrastructure respond and evolve alongside increasing environmental pressures. By adding flexibility through modular materials, data-connectivity, and mixed \"green-gray\" systems, it offers several advantages:<br/><br/>* Lower lifetime costs, as prevented failures and reduced energy use, make up for initial expenses.<br/><br/>* Better public health, as cooler temperatures and cleaner air lead to fewer heat-related illnesses.<br/><br/>* Quicker bounce-back after disasters, smart systems help in planning ahead instead of just reacting.<br/><br/>These benefits are real, and not just ideas. In Ahmedabad, South Asia's first Heat Action Plan combined public outreach, early-warning systems, and adaptive design elements like cool roofs. A 2019 study found this approach saved about 1,100 lives annually.<br/><br/>Nature-Based and Hybrid Solutions in Action<br/><br/>In Kolkata, municipal officials recently unveiled a new Climate Action Plan, a \"survival plan\" which includes 60 sectoral recommendations, with 30 earmarked for immediate activation. These range from white reflective roads and green public spaces to ward-level weather stations and clean-air zones. Such integration of nature-based and smart interventions is critical, given that more than 75% of India's population resides in districts highly vulnerable to extreme hydro-meteorological events.<br/><br/>In Mumbai, adaptive design through nature-based solutions is gaining ground with measurable results. According to Maharashtra's state forest department, mangrove cover in the region has risen from 186 km in 2012 to 320 km in 2022, reflecting both restoration and protective efforts. Urban authorities are piloting permeable concrete pavement blocks in Delhi, India's first trials which have shown the capacity to capture, treat, and recharge stormwater, significantly mitigating monsoon flood risks.<br/><br/>India's reach of adaptive design extends beyond cities. Through the Infrastructure for Climate Resilient Growth (ICRG) project, over 900 climate-resilient infrastructure assets from roads and check dams to culverts were built in 22 districts across 3 Indian states, entirely by \"barefoot engineers\" living in remote rural communities. Over 10,000 locals have been trained to build and maintain these projects, effectively creating climateready rural roads and water systems without dependence on external contractors.<br/><br/>Early Warning Systems<br/><br/>Digital innovations are fortifying adaptive design further. Ahmedabad is now piloting wearables in urban slums to monitor physiological signs during heat waves. Simultaneously, sensor networks in cities such as Lucknow and Kolkata continuously track temperature, humidity, and air quality, enabling real-time alerts to residents. At a national level, scientists warn that oppressive, high-humidity heatwaves could increase fivefold by the century's end under 1.5C warming, highlighting the need for anticipatory systems.<br/><br/>Policy and Investment to Scale Resilience<br/><br/>Funding for adaptation is accelerating. Mumbai's 2025-26 budget allocates Rs 16,321 crore (37.8% of capital expenditure) to climate-focused projects, including water harvesting, waste management, and flood protection-up from Rs 10,224 crore in the previous year. At the national level, programmes such as the Smart Cities Mission, NDMA heatwave protocols, and NDC-linked frameworks are increasingly embedding adaptive design within regulatory systems.<br/><br/>In May 2025, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) initiated a revision of the National Building Code (NBC) to incorporate resilience against climate hazards, covering wind, seismic events, and sustainability norms like solar design and energy efficiency. This update includes provisions for climate-adaptive pavements, flood-resistant plinths, and renewable-energy-ready rooftops, signaling institutional mainstreaming of adaptive planning.<br/><br/>However, gaps remain especially in smaller towns and rural areas, where data is limited and technical capacity is low. Closing this gap requires \"no-regret\" solutions such as elevated roads, passive ventilation systems, and rainwater gardens deployable even without full climate forecasting. Enhancing community awareness and capacity through local champions and NGO partnerships, Ahmedabad's HAP further grounds resilience in a societal context.<br/><br/>The Road Ahead: Mainstreaming Resilient Design<br/><br/>India stands at a decisive juncture. With urbanisation racing forward and climate risks intensifying, embedding adaptive design into every new infrastructure project is not optional-it is essential. Achieving this requires:<br/><br/>* Institutional restructuring: Cities must create crossdepartment resilience cells and integrate adaptive design training into engineering curricula.<br/><br/>* Standardizing real-time monitoring: Bringing sensor networks online in Tier-II and rural areas to inform locally responsive signals.<br/><br/>* Scaling nature-based solutions: Systematically restoring wetlands, expanding green cover, and adopting permeable landscapes.<br/><br/>* Mobilizing finance: Leveraging blended models-like project finance instruments, green bonds, and insurance-backed mechanisms-to enable scalable resilience.<br/><br/>* Enabling policy translations: Updating building codes, zoning regulations, and procurement norms to require climate adaptation.<br/><br/>India's resilience depends not just on surviving climate events, but on thriving through them. It is time to realize infrastructure that doesn't merely endure climate shocks, but delivers hope, opportunity, and continued growth for generations ahead.<br/><br/>By aligning engineering excellence with ecological wisdom and digital foresight, our infrastructure can become the foundation of a climate-resilient, equitable future.<br/><br/>P.

This will result in a major cooling effect in areas that are often the hottest, most crowded, and least green parts of the city.<br/><br/>Besides bringing temperatures down, rooftop gardens can help with rainwater absorption and even supply produce for households, the report adds.<br/><br/>However, the proposed nature-based solutions require substantial investment.<br/><br/>The report estimates that around \u20b92,203 crore would be needed to put key nature-based solutions into action across selected wards in the city.<br/><br/>But it also finds that the economic benefits, like reduced damage from floods, could amount to over INR 500 crore in savings each year. Essentially, Chennai could recover the costs in over 4 years, the report notes. \u201cWithout intervention, Chennai risks Rs 10,000 crore in climate-related damages over the next 2 decades,\u201d it adds.<br/><br/>Lakshmi Menon, Senior Analyst in the Adaptation and Risk Analysis group at CSTEP, highlights<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis>\u00a0\u2018In cities like Chennai and Mangaluru, even modest ward-level investments in green infrastructure can yield substantial long-term savings and ecological benefits. As climate risks intensify, integrating nature-based solutions into urban planning is not just desirable\u2014it is essential for building resilient, adaptive, and sustainable cities.\u2019<br/><br/>Chennai\u2019s wetlands are another key part of the solution. Neighbourhood lakes and river catchments can serve as natural sponges, absorbing excess water during storms and filtering pollutants.

This achievement highlights the country's strong economic growth, expanding international influence, and increasing economic resilience. As India aspires to become a fully developed nation by 2047, marking the hundredth anniversary of its independence, there is a strong sense of optimism that prevails. Nevertheless, this aspiration is overshadowed by significant challenges, especially those arising from climate change and natural disasters. If India does not incorporate climate and disaster resilience into its fundamental development goals, it may jeopardise the numerous economic gains it has worked so hard to achieve.</p><p>The effects of climate change and associated disasters pose serious limitations on development, disrupting business activities, damaging infrastructure, and jeopardising supply chains - concerns that are particularly relevant for developing countries like India. With the rising frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, their impacts are being felt across multiple sustainable development goals, especially those associated with economic growth, trade, transportation, energy, environmental sustainability, and public health. These escalating risks not only slow progress but also reveal how specific development priorities can increase vulnerability to disasters and climate change through emissions, land-use modifications, and exposure to hazards. Consequently, a comprehensive and proactive strategy for climate and disaster resilience is essential.</p><p>India's distinct geography - characterised by tropical monsoon systems, a 7,500-kilometer-long coastline, and the seismically active Himalayan region - along with its socio-economic realities, makes it one of the most disaster-prone nations in the world. On average, the country encounters five to six cyclones each year, with two or three usually classified as severe. Unpredictable monsoon patterns lead to recurring floods in major river basins. Over the past two decades, India has faced significant economic losses due to extreme weather events, which have severely undermined development progress. A 2022 report from the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) stated that India experienced economic damage of around $80 billion between 1999 and 2020 due to floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes - events whose frequency and severity have been worsened in the recent past.</p><p>Numerous high-profile disasters highlight the connection between climate - induced events and setbacks in development. The Chennai floods of 2015 impacted over three million individuals, disrupted more than 20,000 small and medium enterprises and resulted in damages estimated at $2.25 billion. Likewise, the Kerala floods of 2018 - considered the worst in a century - affected 5.4 million people, damaged over 10,000 km of roads, and caused losses exceeding $4.3 billion. The tourism sector, contributing 12 per cent to the state's GDP, halted operations, and recovery needs were estimated at $3.8 billion. In 2020, Cyclone Amphan struck West Bengal and Odisha, resulting in damages estimated at $13 billion, disrupting infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods across both states.</p><p>The agriculture industry, which employs almost half of India's workforce, has proven to be particularly susceptible to severe weather. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)'s 2023 report, The Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2023 - Avoiding and Reducing Losses Through Investment in Resilience, approximately 23 per cent of the overall economic losses resulting from disasters are incurred by the agriculture sector. This highlights the sector's considerable susceptibility to natural hazards such as droughts, floods, and storms. The report emphasises the urgent need for investment in resilience to mitigate these impacts. In India, repeated droughts in states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Karnataka have resulted in consistent crop failures, worsening rural hardship and leading to significant migration. According to the World Bank's Climate Risk Profile for India (2021), climate-related catastrophes could potentially decrease India's GDP by up to 2.8 per cent each year. Information from CRED's EM-DAT database (2023) shows that flooding constitutes nearly 50 per cent of all disaster-related financial losses in the country. The disruption of livelihoods, mass displacements, collapse of infrastructure, and halts in economic activities further strain public finances and obstruct developmental progress, particularly in regions most vulnerable to climate impacts.</p><p>Major urban centres in India, which are essential to the nation's economic development, are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather phenomena. Cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Kolkata frequently experience flooding, heat waves, storms, and unusually heavy rainfalls. These occurrences damage infrastructure, disrupt transportation systems and interfere with essential services. Megacities like Delhi and Mumbai, which have high population densities and depend heavily on climate-sensitive infrastructures, are particularly at risk.</p><p>Recently, Mumbai experienced its wettest May in over a century, with a month's worth of rainfall falling in just 24 hours. This record-breaking rainfall flooded roads, disrupted flights and local trains, and caused parts of the newly constructed Worli underground station on Metro Line-3 to become non-operational. Meanwhile, the National Capital Region (NCR) and Delhi faced severe, off-season rainfall and dust storms that damaged infrastructure, caused power outages, uprooted trees, and halted traffic. In May 2025, unexpected storms followed by heavy rains compromised public infrastructure, leaving typically dry areas inundated. These events indicate a significant, climate-led transformation in urban weather patterns and highlight the pressing need for resilient infrastructure and urban planning.</p><p>The financial burden of disasters is primarily shouldered by state Governments. Relief efforts, emergency medical assistance, and evacuation costs exert pressure on public finances, particularly as revenues from sectors like tourism and agriculture decline. While states that experience fewer disasters can often manage these expenses internally, more vulnerable states typically depend on central assistance or borrow from financial markets, which increases public debt and diverts resources from long-term development goals. Procedural challenges in accessing the State Disaster Response Fund, including spending limits and bureaucratic red tape, further hinder recovery processes.</p><p>Beyond the economic impacts, disasters worsen social inequalities and obstruct inclusive development. In Chennai, major companies relocated their operations while informal workers and small exporters suffered heavy losses. In Kerala, the cancellation of tourist reservations drove small business owners and homestay operators into debt. These trends recur with each disaster, displacing vulnerable communities, often into urban areas that are similarly at risk.</p><p>There is no doubt that India has made significant progress in disaster preparedness. The nation has developed advanced cyclone warning systems and an expanding array of disaster shelters. Nevertheless, substantial policy and institutional deficits persist. Disaster risk financing in India remains largely reactive, relying on budget reallocations after disasters occur. Financial instruments like catastrophe bonds, parametric insurance, and resilience bonds - widely used in regions like the Caribbean and Mexico - are still in the experimental phase within India. Barriers such as high premiums, inadequate actuarial data, and ambiguous regulatory frameworks impede their broader adoption.</p><p>India possesses a significant opportunity to take the lead in this domain. The nation's effort to establish the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), now supported by the G20, offers a robust basis for integrating disaster resilience into infrastructure planning and development. The effectiveness of this initiative will rely on aligning it with major national programs like the PM Gati Shakti master plan, as well as state-level climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>What India requires is a development paradigm focused on climate resilience. All future infrastructure developments - such as high-speed trains, solar parks, smart cities, and coastal highways - should be assessed for their exposure to various hazards and designed to withstand the climate challenges expected by 2050 and beyond. Early warning systems need to expand beyond just cyclone notifications to include alerts for flash floods, lightning-prone areas, and cloudbursts in hilly regions. Fiscal resilience must be enhanced through a structured approach</p><p>to disaster risk financing that merges strong disaster response resources with innovative financial strategies and contingent credit options. Environmental protections - including stricter land-use regulations, nature-based solutions, and ecosystem restoration - should be integral to national development frameworks.</p><p>Global research indicates that investing a single dollar in disaster preparedness can save up to seven dollars during recovery and response. However, disaster prevention and preparedness still garner only a small share of climate finance. If India harnesses its demographic advantages and advancements in technology to enhance robust infrastructure, promote community-oriented adaptation, and implement efficient risk financing, it can transform disaster risks into opportunities. This would lead to inclusive and sustainable development. The next two decades are critical. Whether natural disasters continue to drag down development or become a driving force for better planning and innovation will depend on the policy decisions made today. As India looks forward to celebrating a century of independence in 2047, embedding climate and disaster resilience at the core of its development strategy is not merely wise - it is a national necessity.</p><p>(The writer is a former Executive Director, National Institute of Disaster Management, GOI and former Director, SAARC Disaster Management Centre.

This points to uneven climate preparedness, especially in areas with degraded ecosystems and high exposure to extreme climate events.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nearly 30% of Central India's districts are poorly equipped to withstand and adapt to climate change impacts, according to a new study assessing regional resilience using agro-climatic and socio-economic indicators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study, conducted by Chaitanya Ashok Adhav under the guidance of Hari Nath Singh from the department of Agricultural Economics at G B Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Uttarakhand, found that 27.39% of districts in central India fall into the 'low resilience' category, highlighting significant vulnerabilities across farming communities, ecosystems and rural livelihoods.</p><p>Published in the International Journal of Environment and Climate Change recently, the study, titled - Assessing Climate Change Resilience in Central India: A Regional Indicator-Based Approach and Agro-Climatic Zone Mapping - evaluated 102 districts spread across four states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Southern UP- highly susceptible to erratic rainfall, rising temperatures, and drought-like conditions.</p><p>\"Low resilience means these districts have limited capacity to absorb climate shocks, whether in agriculture, water availability or public health,\" explained Adhav, lead author. \"It is a combination of high exposure, low agricultural productivity with inadequate adaptive infrastructure and social support systems.\"</p><p>The latest study used 50 sub-indicators, including rainfall deviation, forest cover, population density, literacy rates, crop insurance, irrigation coverage, and road infrastructure, grouped into three key components: climate exposure, agricultural productivity and climate adaptability. These were synthesised into a Composite Climate Change Resilience Capacity Index (CCRCI) using principal component analysis (a statistical technique used to assign weights to individual indicators in a dataset while retaining most of the original information) coupled with standard index development procedures and visualised through GIS mapping.</p><p>While only 28.71 % of districts were rated as 'highly resilient', a majority (43.91%) were found to have moderate resilience. The remaining 36 districts, which constitute nearly 30% of the study area, lack both institutional and ecological buffers to cope with climate variability.</p><p>\"Districts with low resilience scores typically face a dual burden-on one hand, they are highly exposed to climatic variability like drought and erratic rainfall; on the other, their capacity to adapt is severely constrained due to poor infrastructure, lower literacy, and limited institutional outreach. These areas require immediate attention and targeted intervention for climate adaptation planning,\" said Adhav, adding that moderately resilient districts can cope to some extent but remain vulnerable under intensified climate stressors.</p><p>Some of the least resilient districts identified in the study include Bhopal, Damoh, Guna, Morena, Panna, Sidhi, Tikamgarh, Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh all of which scored poorly on key indicators such as health infrastructure, forest cover, and literacy rates. Other low-resilience areas such as Sheopur (MP) and Durg (Chhattisgarh) faced a combination of environmental and institutional stress, including frequent droughts, poor road connectivity, and limited livelihood diversity. In contrast, Ahilya Nagar in Maharashtra was classified as highly resilient due to better forest cover, road infrastructure, and lower population density.</p><p>Districts such as Sangli and Kolhapur in Maharashtra and Raipur in Chhattisgarh also performed well, attributed to relatively better access to education, markets, and public services. All the selected districts from southern UP show low to moderate resilience, revealing inefficiencies in policy implementation.</p><p>\"The spatial variation in climate resilience across districts reflects not only ecological differences but also disparities in governance and infrastructure,\" said H N Singh, co-author and climate adaptation researcher. Further, Chaitanya Adhav explained - \"Districts with higher investments in public goods-like education, roads, and forest management-tend to have stronger buffers against climate risks in agriculture.\"</p><p>Across central India, climate change is manifesting in region-specific ways, with significant implications for agriculture, water security, and rural livelihoods. In Maharashtra, a study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology projects a temperature rise of 1-2.5 degree Celsius by 2050, particularly affecting districts such as Pune, Solapur, and Satara. The state has also seen a marked increase in extreme weather events, including the recurrent floods that devastated Konkan and Western Maharashtra, disrupting agricultural activities and damaging infrastructure. Additionally, there have been series of climate events connected to untimely rainfall and drought over central Maharashtra and Vidarbha over the past five years.</p><p>Both Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are witnessing intensifying similar climate stresses, with tangible impacts on agriculture, water resources, and public health. The Rajasthan State Action Plan on Climate Change (2022) flags a rise in heatwaves, erratic rainfall, and droughts, contributing to worsening water scarcity and crop failures in major agrarian belts. Similarly, the Chhattisgarh State Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health (2024) highlights the growing frequency of extreme weather events and rainfall decline, which are undermining rain-fed farming and triggering health impacts such as vector-borne diseases and acute respiratory infections.</p><p>According to Singh, the study is a call for more granular and regionally tailored climate planning. \"Most adaptation policies are designed at national or state levels, but climate vulnerability is hyper-local,\" he said. \"Our findings make the case for district-specific investments, especially in education, natural resource management, and decentralised infrastructure.\"</p><p>In Madhya Pradesh, a 2023 study published in the Journal of Water and Climate Change, analysed long-term rainfall patterns using high-resolution gridded data from 439 India Meteorological Department (IMD) grid points. The study found a significant decrease in annual, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter rainfall, with a notable increase in pre-monsoon rainfall.</p><p>The analysis identified shifts in rainfall patterns in 1998 (monsoon, annual), 1955 (pre-monsoon), 1987 (post-monsoon), and 1986 (winter). The maximum average annual rainfall reduced from 1,769 mm to 1,401 mm after 1998, affecting water availability. These long-term climatic shifts are indicative of how communities dependent on predictable monsoons and traditional crop cycles are now grappling with uncertainty, water stress, and declining productivity. To address the vulnerabilities in low-resilience districts, the study also recommended promoting water harvesting and land-use diversification to mitigate environmental stress, as well as enhancing institutional support systems, such as rural agricultural extension services and disaster preparedness mechanisms. The importance of ecological restoration and community-led natural resource management as long-term strategies for building climate resilience from the ground up was also listed.</p><p>\"Resilience is not just about technology or infrastructure,\" Adhav said. \"It also depends on social capital, governance, and the ability of communities to anticipate, plan for, and respond to climate events.\" The study concludes by urging policymakers to integrate regional resilience mapping into climate adaptation frameworks, particularly within the government's ongoing agro-ecological zoning and rural development strategies.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The MME approach uses the coupled global climate models (CGCMs) from different global climate prediction and research centers, including IMD's Monsoon Mission Climate Forecasting System (MMCFS) model. The MMCFS and MME forecasts are updated every month. This was to satisfy the demands from different users and Government authorities for the forecasts of the spatial distribution of monthly and seasonal rainfall along with the regionally averaged rainfall forecasts for better regional planning of activities. </p><p><br/><br/>Since introducing the Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS) in 2007 and implementing the MME approach in 2021 for seasonal forecasting, IMD operational forecast for the monsoon rainfall has shown noticeable improvement. For example, the average absolute forecast error in the forecasting of all India's seasonal rainfall has reduced by about 21% during the recent 18 years (2007-2024) compared to the same number of \u00a0previous years (1989-2006), which indicates a highly successful forecast in recent years compared to previous years. The anomaly correlation between the observed and forecast ISMR during 2007-2023 was 0.55 compared to -0.21 during 1989-2006. It may be noted that IMD was able to correctly forecast the twin deficient monsoon years of 2014-2015, as well as the below-normal rainfall in 2023 and above-normal rainfall in 2024. These clearly indicate improvement made in the operational forecast system in the recent 18 years period compared to the earlier 18 years period. For 2025, the MME approach will continue to be used as this method introduced in 2021 has shown good skill in forecasting both the area-averaged rainfall at various geographical regions and spatial distribution of rainfall across the country at monthly as well as seasonal scales.<br/><br/>To strengthen weather and climate services for the agriculture sector, the MoES has launched the Mission Mausam, which is envisaged to be a multi-faceted and transformative initiative to boost India's weather and climate-related science, research, and services. The Mission is launched to make Bharat a weather-ready and climate-smart nation with the aim that no weather will go undetected and early warning for all. It will help monsoon-dependent agricultural regions, citizens, and last-mile users to tackle extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change in a better way.<br/><br/>Further, the Mission's focus includes improving the observations by augmenting various observational networks throughout the country to provide highly accurate and timely weather and climate information across temporal and spatial scales, capacity building, and awareness generation. Apart from physics-based numerical models, the Ministry is developing new methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for weather, climate, and ocean forecasting systems. And the formulation of collaborative research projects with academic institutions to share knowledge and develop innovative solutions for weather forecasting and climate modeling capabilities. Local user communities such as farmers/agricultural authorities, aviation authorities, power generation &amp; distribution agencies, industries, health agencies, etc., are constantly involved/engaged, and periodic familiarization is imparted through user meet/stakeholder meet awareness programs, etc. The feedback is taken from the communities for the improvement of all-weather &amp; climate services. Extensive use of local languages in forecast dissemination and regularly organizing workshops and awareness programs for community outreach is being undertaken. <br/><br/>By strengthening the observational network will also help to observe the changes in long-term weather patterns compared to past years to assess the changes in the climate and take measures towards climate resilience. <br/><br/>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been using satellite technology extensively for weather monitoring and forecasting. This started with the use of photographs from Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS-1) launched by the United States of America (USA) in April 1960. These photographs provided new information on cloud systems, including spiral formations associated with large storms, immediately proving their value to operational meteorologists. Over the years, IMD has embraced new developments in satellites and their applications, boosted through global coordination and support, such as geostationary satellites in 1974 and polar-orbiting satellites. With the advent of Indian National Satellites (INSAT) developed by the Space Research Organisation (ISRO) satellites in 1982, IMD has augmented satellite applications utilizing image and data products in collaboration with the ISRO. Currently, IMD is utilizing available international satellites, including European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and INSAT-3DR/3DS, as well as polar-orbiting satellites, including Oceansat-3 and Metop-B/C. The utilization of satellite data and products has improved nowcasting and severe weather along with timely detection of large-scale systems like monsoon circulation, cyclones, western disturbances, thunderstorms, etc. Above 90% of the data in the numerical models run by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is satellite-based. The assimilation of satellite data in the models has improved the accuracy in short to medium range forecasting by about 20% to 30%. Algorithms/tools developed by IMD/ISRO and other international institutes, such as EUMETSAT, like nowcast tools, RAPID, Dvorak technique, etc., have improved decision-making and forecasting. These data and products are proven to be useful for disaster preparedness. However, there are still gaps in detecting small-scale weather events, such as cloudbursts, thunderstorms, localized heavy rainfall, squalls, hail storms, etc., due to a lack of high-resolution data, products, and satellite-based tools. Considering this, IMD and ISRO are working together for the development of the INSAT-4 series with better sensors and resolution.<br/><br/>This information was given by Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, MoS PMO, Department of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Space and Department of Atomic Energy, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today. \u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>*** <br/><br/>NKR/PSM <br/></p>", "publisher": "Indian Government News", "instances": ["The feedback is taken from the communities for the improvement of all-weather &amp; climate services.
