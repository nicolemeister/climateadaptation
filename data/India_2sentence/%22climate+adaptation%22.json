After that, residents in high-risk areas became ineligible for buyouts or standard recovery funding.</p><p>Future government investment was limited to Crown-owned assets or projects with \"national benefit\". Restoration of local infrastructure such as roads and power lines would depend on whether councils or ratepayers could pay.</p><p>Today, parts of Te Taone remain cut off.

Those with the means can move to escape risk, while others are left behind to bear it.</p><h>Adaptation or abandonment?</h><p>Maori communities are especially affected. Parts of the floodplain include ancestral land, some communally owned, some leased by whanau who cannot easily relocate. In many cases, this land was only recently returned from the Crown, after years of land court proceedings or Treaty settlements.</p><p>The prospect of abandoning it again, without coordinated support, echoes earlier waves of institutional neglect. Mere Rakete is now considering joining a class action, one of several reportedly forming across the country.</p><p>Residents are challenging the government or local councils over a failure in their duty of care by allowing homes to be built, sold or inhabited in known risk zones without clear and enforceable warnings or adequate alternatives.</p><p>Meanwhile, adaptation experts are calling for a reset: a national compensation framework with clear eligibility rules, long-term investment in affordable housing beyond hazard-prone areas.</p><p>Above all, they argue, government policy based on a climate adaptation framework developed 25 years ago has not reduced exposure to risk.

Treating climate risk as an individual responsibility may reduce short-term government liability. But it will not reduce long-term social and fiscal liability.</p><p>The risk of failing to act systemically is that the country pays in other ways - in fractured communities, rising inequity and preventable harm.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change has to be about more than limiting the upfront costs of buyouts or infrastructure repairs. Ignoring the wider impacts will only shift the burden and increase it over time.</p><p>Real economic and community resilience means planning with people in mind, investing early and making sure no one is left behind.

The assessment considers a range of risks including risks of flooding, overheating, new pests / diseases, wildfire etc to which an assigned risk rating score is applied.On publication of the CCCs independent assessment the UK Government and Devolved Administrations use the information in the CCCs assessment to develop what is known as the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) which is laid in Parliament under section 56 of the Climate Change Act 2008.Section 60 of the 2008 Act requires that relevant Northern Ireland departments lay programmes before the Northern Ireland Assembly setting out the objectives of the department in relation to adaptation to climate change. This programme is known as the Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme (NICCAP) which DAERA co-ordinate the development of on behalf of all Departments. There is no legal requirement under the 2008 Act to consult on the draft NICCAP.Under section 48 of the Climate Change Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 the CCC will be legally required to undertake independent assessments of future adaptation programmes which are laid in the Assembly. The independent assessment of NICCAP3 will be expected to take place in 2028.Even with working towards achieving Net Zero and limiting global warming to 1.5c there will still be locked in impacts of climate change which we cannot avoid and must continue to adapt to.Following completion of the public consultation exercise DAERA, in consultation with other Departments, will make any necessary refinements to the draft NICCAP3 prior to seeking Executive agreement to lay it in the Assembly.Follow DAERA on formerly called Twitter and .All media queries should be directed to the DAERA Press Office: or telephone: 028 9016 3460.The Executive Information Service operates an out of hours service for media enquiries only between 1800hrs and 0800hrs Monday to Friday and at weekends and public holidays.

I very much welcome the collaborative effort from across all government departments and wider society in developing the draft NICCAP3.The draft NICCAP3 sets out details of over 250 actions from government departments, councils, academia, NGOs, businesses and civil society which aim to improve our resilience to the impacts of climate change to protect our economy, communities and environment from the worst impacts.Welcoming the launch of the consultation, Ciaran Fox the Director of the Royal Society of Ulster Architects and Chair of Climate NI said: I welcome the proactive approach that has been taken to the development of the draft NICCAP3 through both the inclusion of actions from outside departments and the co-design approach that has been taken to the development of the high-level vision and aims. This approach recognises the important role key stakeholders, from across all sectors, can play in building and improving our resilience to climate change.The draft NICCAP3, through the series of short case studies included in it, demonstrates some of the positive work that has already been progressed. These help to demonstrate the role all sectors of society can play.He added It is crucial that we ensure our current processes and infrastructure take account of and are equipped to face the climate impacts highlighted in the Met Offices UK Climate Change Projections and those impacts which are now already locked in.The public consultation on NICCAP3 will be open for eight weeks and will close on 4th August 2025. The consultation can be accessed via either the DAERA Consultation webpage.</p><p>Notes to editors:</p><p>Under section 57 of the Climate Change Act 2008, on a five yearly basis, the Climate Change Committee publishes an independent assessment of the risks of climate change to the UK. The assessment considers a range of risks including risks of flooding, overheating, new pests / diseases, wildfire etc to which an assigned risk rating score is applied.On publication of the CCCs independent assessment the UK Government and Devolved Administrations use the information in the CCCs assessment to develop what is known as the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) which is laid in Parliament under section 56 of the Climate Change Act 2008.Section 60 of the 2008 Act requires that relevant Northern Ireland departments lay programmes before the Northern Ireland Assembly setting out the objectives of the department in relation to adaptation to climate change. This programme is known as the Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme (NICCAP) which DAERA co-ordinate the development of on behalf of all Departments. There is no legal requirement under the 2008 Act to consult on the draft NICCAP.Under section 48 of the Climate Change Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 the CCC will be legally required to undertake independent assessments of future adaptation programmes which are laid in the Assembly. The independent assessment of NICCAP3 will be expected to take place in 2028.Even with working towards achieving Net Zero and limiting global warming to 1.5c there will still be locked in impacts of climate change which we cannot avoid and must continue to adapt to.Following completion of the public consultation exercise DAERA, in consultation with other Departments, will make any necessary refinements to the draft NICCAP3 prior to seeking Executive agreement to lay it in the Assembly.Follow DAERA on X(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab formerly called Twitter and Facebook(external link opens in a new window / tab)external link opens in a new window / tab.All media queries should be directed to the DAERA Press Office: pressoffice.group@daera -ni.gov.uk or telephone: 028 9016 3460.The Executive Information Service operates an out of hours service for media enquiries only between 1800hrs and 0800hrs Monday to Friday and at weekends and public holidays.

The survey of professionals and residents in several facilities shows that specific measures such as changes to daily routines already exist in many facilities, but that heat protection is not systematically implemented. \"The differences between the facilities demonstrate that heat protection has not been established across the board. Structural conditions also influence the effectiveness of measures. How residents assess the effectiveness of heat protection ultimately also affects their satisfaction with the facility,\" says Peters. The survey already allows for concrete recommendations for action.</p><p>Social work students have developed a detailed heat protection plan for a Worms facility based on the discussions. They developed the concept in the course \"Climate Crisis, Disaster Risk Reduction: Intersectional, International, and Interprofessional Approaches\" with the participation of those affected and local specialists, as well as in consultation with Worms' climate adaptation manager, Marco Elischer. Caroline Schmitt and Professor Dr. Timo Tohidipur, Professor of Social Work Law, especially migration law, including European and international aspects, led the seminar, which will continue in the next semester. The plan will be reflected on and adapted in the winter semester in consultation with the facility. \"As a team for climate protection and climate adaptation, transdisciplinary projects and scientific collaborations are important to us so that we can benefit from new research findings early on in Worms.

Last year was the world's hottest on record and extreme weather is lashing Queensland. But there are hints of progress. Australia's emissions have begun to fall and the main power grid is now 40% renewable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So before Australians head to the polls on May 3, it's worth closely examining the climate policies of the two major parties. What are they offering on cutting emissions, preparing for climate-boosted disasters and future-proofing our energy systems? And where are the gaps?</p><h>Energy transition - Tony Wood, Grattan Institute</h><p>Cost-of-living pressures, escalating damage from climate change and global policy uncertainty mean no election issue is more important than transforming Australia's economy to achieve net zero. But our energy supply must be reliable and affordable. What should the next government prioritise?</p><p>There is great pressure to deliver power bill relief. But the next government's priority should be reducing how much a household spends on energy, rather than trying to bring down the price of electricity. Far better to give financial support for battery storage and better home insulation, to slash how much power consumers need to buy from the grid.</p><p>The Liberal-led Senate inquiry has just found supporting home electrification will also help with cost of living pressures.</p><p>The electricity rebates on offer from Labor and the temporary cut to fuel excise from the Coalition aren't enough.</p><p>Federal and state governments must maintain their support and investment in the new transmission lines necessary to support new renewable generation and storage.</p><p>Labor needs to do more to meet its 2030 target of reaching 82% renewables in the main grid. Currently, the figure is around 40%. The Coalition's plan to slow down renewables, keep coal going longer and burn more gas while pushing for a nuclear future carries alarmingly high risks on reliability, cost and environmental grounds.</p><p>Gas shortfalls are looming for Australia's southeast in the next few winters and the price of gas remains stubbornly high. Labor does not yet have a workable solution to either issue, while the Coalition has an idea - more and therefore cheaper gas - but no clarity on how its plan to keep more gas for domestic use  would work in practice.</p><p>So far, we have been offered superficially appealing ideas. The field is wide open for a leader to deliver a compelling vision and credible plan for Australia's net-zero future.</p><h>Climate adaptation - Johanna Nalau, Griffith University</h><p>You would think adapting to climate change would be high on the election agenda. Southeast Queensland just weathered its first cyclone in 50 years, estimated to have caused A$1.2 billion in damage, while outback Queensland is enduring the worst flooding in 50 years.</p><p>But so far, there's little to see on adaptation.</p><p>Both major parties have committed to building a weather radar in western Queensland, following local outcry. While welcome, it's a knee-jerk response rather than good forward planning.</p><p>By 2060, damage from climate change will cost Australia $73 billion a year under a low emissions scenario, according to a Deloitte report. The next federal government should invest more in disaster preparation rather than throwing money at recovery. It's cheaper, for one thing - longer term, there are significant savings by investing in more resilient infrastructure before damage occurs.</p><p>Being prepared requires having enough public servants in disaster management to do the work. The Coalition has promised to cut 41,000 jobs from the federal public service, and has not yet said where the cuts would be made.</p><p>While in office, Labor has been developing a National Adaptation Plan to shape preparations and a National Climate Risk Assessment to gather evidence of the main climate risks for Australia and ways to adapt.</p><p>Regardless of who takes power, these will be useful roadmaps to manage extreme weather, damage to agriculture and intensified droughts, floods and fires. Making sure climate-exposed groups such as farmers get necessary assistance to weather worse disasters, and manage new risks and challenges stemming from climate change, is not a partisan issue. Such plans will help direct investment towards adaptation methods that work at scale.</p><p>New National Science Priorities are helpful too, especially the focus on new technologies able to sustainably meet Australia's food and water needs in a changing climate.</p><p>              Intensifying climate change brings more threats to our food systems and farmers.                Shirley Jayne Photography</p><h>Emission reduction - Madeline Taylor, Macquarie University</h><p>Emission reduction has so far been a footnote for the major parties. In terms of the wider energy transition, both parties are expected to announce policies to encourage household battery uptake and there's a bipartisan focus on speeding up energy planning approvals.</p><p>But there is a clear divide in where the major parties' policies will lead Australia on its net-zero journey.</p><p>Labor's policies largely continue its approach in government, including bringing more clean power and storage into the grid within the Capacity Investment Scheme and building new transmission lines under the Rewiring Australia Plan.</p><p>These policies are leading to lower emissions from the power sector. Last year, total emissions fell by 0.6%. Labor's Future Made in Australia policies give incentives to produce critical minerals, green steel, and green manufacturing. Such policies should help Australia gain market share in the trade of low-carbon products.</p><p>From January 1 this year, Labor's new laws require some large companies to disclose emissions from operations. This is positive, giving investors essential data to make decisions. From their second reporting period, companies will have to disclose Scope 3 emissions as well - those from their supply chains. The laws will cover some companies where measuring emissions upstream is incredibly tricky, including agriculture. Coalition senators issued a dissenting report pointing this out. The Coalition has now vowed to scrap these rules.</p><p>The Coalition has not committed to Labor's target of cutting emissions 43% by 2030. Their flagship plan to go nuclear will likely mean pushing out emissions reduction goals given the likely 2040s completion timeframe for large-scale nuclear generation, unless small modular reactors become viable.</p><p>On gas, there's virtually bipartisan support. The Coalition promise to reserve more gas for domestic use is a response to looming shortfalls on the east coast. Labor has also approved more coal and gas projects largely for export, though Australian coal and gas burned overseas aren't counted domestically.</p><p>Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has promised to include gas in Labor's renewable-oriented Capacity Investment Scheme and has floated relaxing the Safeguard Mechanism on heavy emitters. The Coalition has vowed to cancel plans for three offshore wind projects and are very critical of green hydrogen funding.</p><p>Both parties will likely introduce emission reduction measures, but a Coalition government would be less stringent.

This tool seeks to empower indigenous communities, family farmers and, in general, forest users to adopt practices that contribute to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change from the sustainable management of forests.</p><p>The fight against climate change is not only the responsibility of the great international forums, it begins in the territory, in the farm, in the community. Therefore, from the Osinfor, we promote that all our holders implement concrete measures of adaptation and mitigation. The new forest backpack is part of that effort, said William Arellano Olano, head of the Osinfor.</p><p>This version of the forest backpack was first implemented in the district of Chirinos, province of San Ignacio, where more than 20 coffee producers and students of technological institutes were trained with a participatory, visual and intercultural methodology. Through mobile and dynamic images in a franelograph, participants understood how their daily activities can reduce pressure on forests and contribute to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p><p>Also, at the National University of Jaen, 14 facilitators were trained among cooperative technicians, representatives of indigenous organizations and outstanding university students, who will be multiplier agents and replicate the tool in more communities.</p><p>A practical guide to face climate change from the forest</p><p>The new forest backpack addresses issues such as the value of ecosystem services, the role of agroforestry systems in carbon capture and the importance of carbon markets as a mechanism to promote sustainable and informed decisions. It also promotes the understanding of how to conserve forests and avoid sanctions for their misuse.</p><p>This approach takes on special relevance in areas with assignment contracts in use for agroforestry systems (CUSAF), where farmers take advantage of the forest legally while maintaining a part of their forest coverage. The Osinfor has found that, in the CUSAF, more than 80% of holders already apply good practices such as soil conservation and diversification of crops such as coffee and cocoa with forest species.</p><p>A collective creation for inclusive climatic action</p><p>The new forest backpack was cooked with the Amazonian BLF Andes project of the United Kingdom, with the technical support of Practical Action, in close collaboration with the Inter -Ethnic Association of Development of the Peruvian Jungle (AIDESEP), in a process that lasted more than ten months. This work included validations with regional governments and indigenous organizations to ensure their cultural relevance.</p><p>We get together for something in common: to arrive in a simple, comprehensive and intercultural way to communities to strengthen climate governance, said Iliana Perez Melendez, executive of the Subdirectorate of Development of the Osinfor capacities.</p><p>With this initiative, the Osinfor reaffirms that forests are not only key to conserving biodiversity, but also a living tool to deal with the climatic crisis, from the hands of those who inhabit and take care of them.</p>", "publisher": "TendersInfo - News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 24, "title": "India, Harvard Univ to organise joint conference on climate adaptation strategy", "published": "2025-03-17", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">India, March 17 -- The Union environment ministry and two institutes at Harvard University will organise a four-day conference starting March 19 titled: 'India 2047: Building a Climate-Resilient Future.'

This brief highlights the critical role of domestic public funding in driving adaptation initiatives. While international climate finance mechanisms exist, their effectiveness is limited by slow disbursement processes and regional disparities in fund distribution. Public finance management systems can act as catalysts for mobilising private finance for climate action. In the context of fiscal constraints and elevated debt levels after the Covid-19 pandemic, the brief explores alternative financing solutions, including parametric insurance and regulatory reforms. The integration of climate-responsive budgeting in public finance systems emerges as a crucial tool for reflecting government accountability and priorities. The brief also examines innovative approaches to expand adaptation finance beyond traditional public funding, particularly in developing countries, where climate vulnerabilities are highest.</p><p>Article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement highlights the global goal on adaptation. To support the work towards this goal, signatories to the agreement created the Glasgow-Sharm El-Sheikh work programme at COP26. The two-year work programme was carried out by two technical bodies that support the Meeting of Parties to the Paris Agreement CMA-the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation. While the work programme highlighted that adaptation action has a time-bound goal, the adoption of the global goal at COP28 fell short due to a lack of quantified targets and financial support.</p><p>Previous attempts to define the targets of adaptation have had limited success, as adaptation actions have been local and context specific. While these challenges may persist, there are ongoing efforts to create indicators to measure success and collect data to support adaptation planning. Finance remains the key challenge.

This is where India needs to catalyse a new ecosystem of adaptation innovation through blended finance, procurement incentives and R&amp;D missions aimed at resilience.</p><p>The Reserve Bank of India, in a 2022 report, projected that Indian industries will require an investment of Rs.85.6 trillion by 2030 to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This sum, equivalent to 2.5% of GDP, is enormous. The report notes that investment on this scale is necessary to maintain operations, manage risks and create new economic avenues.</p><p>Also Read: The 16th Finance Commission could catalyze climate governance in India</p><p>The innovations needed should focus on solutions for sectors where market-ready products or services do not yet exist. Analyses by T20 India and PwC India identify a set of priority areas.</p><p>These include climate intelligence and analytics tools for remote sensing, forecasting and early warning systems, apart from urban water resilience devices such as rainwater harvesting, decentralized wastewater treatment and smart metering; agricultural technologies, including drought-tolerant seeds and bio-stimulants, and integrated crop insurance and advisory platforms; resilient construction materials like cool roofs, permeable paving and flood-resistant coatings; and health infrastructure capable of tackling heatwaves, floods and other climate-linked emergencies.</p><p>The urgency is clear. Without a sharp increase in adaptation spending, climate risks will rise, inflicting greater economic losses and constraining growth. For the private sector, this has two implications. First, public spending on resilience will continue to grow, providing stable demand for private contractors. Second, policy reforms and financial innovation are likely to open new commercial avenues.</p><p>Also Read: India's urban climate crisis is the result of our own policy failures</p><p>Adaptation finance has begun to resemble a growth industry where demand is policy-backed and funding is anchored in necessity.

We in Africa have not been immune to the adverse impacts of a changing climate.</p><p>Entering the second half of the year offers a good opportunity to reflect on our ever-evolving climate and the need to talk more about how we are adapting to changes which are indisputable. Importantly, we need to talk about how we move forward in finding innovative financing solutions to build resilience in our communities.</p><p>According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) \"State of the Climate in Africa 2024\" report, our continent has been, and will continue to be, disproportionately affected by climate change and the associated high costs required to fund essential climate adaptation and build resilience. The same report highlights that costs associated with climate change can be as much as 5% of African Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and many are allocating up to 9% of their annual budgets to respond to climate extremes.</p><p>It is therefore essential that the public and private sectors shift their focus and prioritise adaptation and resilience, alongside mitigation. We need to continue to focus on climate mitigation projects in order to slow down or minimise negative impacts of climate change through, for example enabling and funding cleaner energy sources and decarbonisation activities.</p><p>However, we equally need to consider how we reduce vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change. This is what is referred to as climate adaptation finance and includes investments in climate smart agriculture such as drought resistant crops or improved water management, investment in resilient infrastructure like flood defences and early warning systems, energy storage systems and development of resilient buildings. Financing these activities improves resilience of economies and communities to floods, drought and other extreme weather events.</p><p>We have a collective and urgent responsibility to prioritise and find innovative ways to fund adaptation and integrate strategies that prepare us to be resilient.</p><p>This is a core part of my team's daily focus. I recently participated in two conferences held in Cape Town in June, the 2025 SADC Sustainable Finance Forum and a Group of 20 (G20) engagement on adaptation and resilience. Both of these forums made it clear that addressing climate-related impacts and specifically prioritising adaptation and resilience are both a moral and business imperative.</p><p>Based on various reports, including the Emerging Economies Climate Report of 2023, the business cost associated with climate change for Africa is undisputable. According to the above report, 79% of respondents said climate change is impacting their organisation today, up from 68% in 2022, with flooding, drought and heat noted as the top physical risks.</p><p>Business and finance need to invest in our assets, infrastructure and communities to ensure we can better withstand these risks. This is not, however, an easy call to action. There are many challenges that exist in scaling up financing for adaptation and resilience. These include, but are not limited to, a lack of clear revenue streams, insufficient and inaccurate data, a lack of expertise, limited resources in low-income countries to fund these projects, and the difficulty in accurately measuring and valuing the impact of these projects.</p><p>Thus, it is incumbent on players in the finance sector to develop solutions that can provide tangible solutions and meet business requirements. Among some of the newer thinking in addressing financing gaps are initiatives such as using revenue streams from carbon credits or from associated ecotourism to fund adaptation projects. Similarly, blended finance solutions are essential in bringing together multiple players with differing risk appetites and mandates to fund some of these critical projects that may not be commercially bankable on a standalone basis, and index based (parametric) insurance can be applied to mitigate physical risks.</p><p>In the famous words of W. Edwards Deming, \"in God we trust. all others must bring data\". While adaptation is a relatively new concept for many governments, real economy firms and financial institutions, data will be a foundational building block for any adaptation strategy. Better data, modelling tools, and geolocation data will be essential for comprehensive solutions.</p><p>Corporate and financial institutions have the potential to include adaptation considerations into strategy setting and targets, though this remains a nascent consideration. We will need a measure of boldness and visionary leadership to drive a step-change in conventional business considerations.</p><p>In pursuit of an integrated considered approach and to paraphrase a famous French philosopher, Voltaire, \"we should not let perfect be the enemy of the good\". As most readers will know, South Africa holds the presidency of the G20 this year and is effectively using the global convening platform to drive key initiatives that make adaptation a norm rather than an exception.</p><p>At Standard Bank, we believe in embracing a balanced approach in creating solutions to existential challenges. This balance requires cross-societal responses that include the private sector, public sector and civil society to ensure a sustainable future.</p><p>In April this year, we announced a revised target to mobilise more than R450 billion of sustainable finance by 2028. As at end of 2024, we had already mobilised R177 billion, since 2022. Our green and social mobilisation sub-targets include adaptation and resilience financing activities such as basic infrastructure, essential services, and biodiversity conservation in addition to sustainable farming.</p><p>We have also funded some of the largest battery energy storage system (BESS) projects across Africa to the tune of approximately R12 billion. BESS projects improve the resilience of the national grid and improve access to energy for communities.</p><p>Standard Bank has also published a target to finance more than R7bn in climate smart agricultural practices by 2030 with more than R2bn financed in 2024 alone. With almost 40% of land in Africa dedicated to agriculture, this sector is a critical custodian of our valuable natural habitat - which is a valuable asset requiring investment in order to drive adaptation and enhance resilience.</p><p>Multilateral organisations and forums also have a key role to play in driving systemic and behavioural changes. The scale of the challenge is too big for any one participant to solve alone. Gatherings like COP30, G20, and SADC Sustainable Finance Forum (among others) must serve as catalysts for innovation, action and target-setting.</p><p>It is crucial for African countries to make our voices heard in these forums, given the scale of the challenges faced by our continent.</p><p>We have the opportunity to make a lasting difference.

Once considered rare phenomena, cloudbursts are now occurring with increasing frequency and intensity, bringing with them destruction, displacement, and death. </p><p>This disturbing trend underscores the urgent need to re-evaluate how we understand and address climate-related disasters. A cloudburst is an extreme rainfall event over a localized area in a short period, often leading to flash floods. In mountainous regions like Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, the steep slopes and fragile geology amplify the destruction. Flash floods resulting from such events wash away homes, roads, and infrastructure within minutes, leaving communities devastated and cut off from essential services.The growing incidence of such disasters is not coincidental. Experts agree that climate change is intensifying the water cycle, causing wetter regions to become wetter and dry areas to become drier. Warmer air holds more moisture, and when this moisture is released rapidly, it results in intense rainfall events like cloudbursts. Moreover, unplanned urbanization, deforestation, and encroachments on riverbanks and wetlands further exacerbate the damage by disrupting natural drainage systems.What is deeply concerning is the lack of preparedness. Early warning systems are either inadequate or non-existent in many vulnerable areas. Relief and rescue operations, though improving, often arrive too late to prevent loss of life and property. Climate resilience must now become the core of policy and infrastructure planning. Investment in robust early warning systems, community awareness programs, and sustainable development practices can go a long way in minimizing disaster impacts.Furthermore, a larger shift in thinking is required. Climate change is not a distant threat; it is a present and escalating crisis. Governments at all levels must integrate climate adaptation strategies into planning, while individuals must push for greater accountability and adopt sustainable practices.In conclusion, cloudbursts and flash floods are not just natural calamities-they are increasingly man-made disasters, intensified by climate negligence. As we witness the destructive power of water unleashed, it is imperative to act decisively. The window for mitigation is rapidly closing, and without urgent, collective action, these \"once-in-a-century\" events may soon become the new normal.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Brighter Kashmir.

But the recent spate of catastrophic events, detailed in harrowing reports from both sides of the border, necessitates a grim reframing. The greatest threat to the people of Kashmir, and by extension to the hundreds of millions downstream in India and Pakistan, is no longer just the soldier's gun, but the melting glacier, the bursting cloud, and the collapsing mountain.</p><p>The evidence presented is overwhelming and terrifyingly symmetrical.

As journalist Nidhi Jamwal rightly points out, this deflects from the real issue. The mayhem is not caused by a single weather event but by a systemic failure to heed scientific warnings.</p><p>Scientists have been crying themselves hoarse about the accelerated melting of Himalayan glaciers, which could lose up to 75% of their volume by 2100. This melting creates vast, unstable glacial lakes, ticking time-bombs for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). The disaster at South Lhonak Lake in Sikkim was a deadly preview. Yet, the Indian Himalayan Region remains a \"data-dark zone,\" a black hole of information precisely where we need it most.</p><p>This data vacuum is not a scientific accident; it is a political choice.</p><p>The very region that serves as the water tower for a billion people is one of the most militarized and least cooperative places on earth. How can we possibly create a robust early warning system for floods when the nations sharing the watershed refuse to share hydrological data in real-time, citing security concerns? How can we build climate-resilient infrastructure when resources are perpetually diverted to maintaining military positions on the Siachen Glacier, a dying relic whose melt water ironically threatens the very people it is meant to protect?</p><p>India-Pakistan Political Distrust</p><p>The political distrust runs so deep that it poisons the well of potential cooperation. Amid this unfolding environmental catastrophe, India and Pakistan remain locked in a Cold War mindset. Mutual accusations of \"water aggression\" persist and the Indus Water Treaty hangs in limbo. Whether these claims are fully accurate or part of a broader narrative of grievance, they underscore the toxic atmosphere.</p><p>The Indus Water Treaty, a rare example of past cooperation, is now viewed with suspicion rather than as a foundation upon which to build. This is misplaced. The Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, whose headwaters lie in the disputed territory, are the shared arteries of North India and Pakistan. A GLOF event eastern Jammu and Kashmir (Indian side) will inevitably send a devastating pulse of water into Pakistan. A degraded watershed in western Jammu and Kashmir (Pakistan side) will increase siltation and flood risk downstream in Punjab.</p><p>Continuing this conflict is an act of collective self-harm. We are fiddling while our shared home burns-or rather, drowns. The immediate and overwhelming vulnerability of the region's population demands a radical shift in priorities. We need to move beyond blaming each other for the floods and start building a shared ark.</p><p>The first step must be to declare a \"climate ceasefire.\" The conflict in Kashmir must be insulated from the urgent, life-saving work of climate adaptation. This would open the door for what is desperately needed: joint mechanisms. India and Pakistan must establish a joint glaciological research canter focused on the Himalayas, pooling satellite data, field reports, and scientific expertise. They must create and operate a unified, cross-border early warning system for GLOFs and flash floods, with transparent data-sharing protocols that can save lives in Muzaffarabad as quickly as in Kishtwar.</p><p>This isn't a call for an immediate resolution to the final political status of Kashmir-a goal that has remained elusive for 78 years. It is a pragmatic call for humanitarian and environmental cooperation as a precursor to peace.

India, a global leader in climate action, is committed to transitioning into a green economy. As per various agencies\u2019 estimates, India\u2019s climate mitigation goal by 2070, popularly known as net-zero, needs $10-12.5 trillion in the next 25-45 years. Besides, there is additional capital investment required for climate adaptation \u2014 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030 as per the Reserve Bank of India, translating into about $100 billion per annum.</p><p><br/><br/>Mobilising this humongous volume of capital needs all kinds of financial institutions. In India, given a banking-driven economy, the discussion is largely moving around mobilising capital from banks. One of the largest sources of capital, which is missing, is pension funds, currently managing about $600 billion and growing at a rate of 10 per cent per annum.<br/><br/>Although a substantial portion, more than 50 per cent, of these funds is allocated in government securities, a significant portion is parked in public equity, corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. Pension funds seldom invest in companies in the climate space. Given pension funds\u2019 long investment cycles, appropriate financial instruments, such as Infrastructure Investment Trust (InVIT), Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) and corporate bonds with credit enhancement, can be deployed to raise capital from them.<br/><br/>Most of the financial markets unnecessarily worry or show exuberance on rallies, market dips, and quarterly reports, which make them undisciplined, leading to suboptimal performance. Pension funds, in particular, have a long investment cycle. For example, pensioners who are contributing to pension funds are unlikely to withdraw for several years unless there is an emergency.<br/><br/>This long investment cycle perfectly aligns with the investment cycle of climate technology, be it renewable energy, clean transportation, or climate adaptation. Investment in all these technologies and segments could perform better than the broader market, at least better than carbon-intensive technologies, as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive economy.<br/><br/>Climate change risk, regarded as a systemic risk to the financial system, will affect the financial performance of companies and industries more in the long term. As pension funds have long-duration liabilities, pensioners withdraw funds after a few decades, and they need to be more cognisant of this risk. This has prompted several pension funds in Europe to integrate climate risk into their investment strategies to protect the interests of beneficiaries.<br/><br/>Pension funds are low-risk seeking investors and they avoid risky bets, and invest in companies with sound fundamentals and a resilient business model that lasts for decades and withstands all possible kinds of risks, including climate change. Although pension funds are protected from downside risks, given their large exposure to government securities, investment in corporate financial assets is also increasing. As the financial sector develops, pension funds will gradually move away from government securities to corporate financial assets. Hence, it is important that these funds integrate climate change risk in their securities selection and portfolio management.<br/><br/>Pension fund regulation on climate risk and pension fund regulators in several countries are asking their regulated entities to disclose the latter\u2019s climate-related risks and opportunities. Although the pace of adoption varies across countries, sponsors and trustees of pension funds are taking notice of these developments in the interest of fund participants. However, pension fund management in India remain largely insulated in terms of climate risk management and reporting due to limited guidance from regulators.<br/><br/>Pension funds in India are primarily managed by the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and the National Pension System (NPS). While EPFO manages the fund itself, NPS has selected fund managers to manage, although it is the discretion of the investor to choose fund managers. The NPS has a stewardship code for the fund manager to promote responsible investment practice, but it has limited wherewithal to force fund managers to follow the norms in spirit. Beneficiaries are also not aware whether fund managers are integrating climate risks into their risk management strategies.<br/><br/>NPS is a member of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO); it outlines a prescription on sustainability risk and opportunities, including climate change, for asset managers, including pension funds. This prescription is meant to standardise climate-related disclosures, ensuring that investors and regulators have access to consistent and reliable information to assess and manage climate risks. Following international best practices could allow Indian pension funds to better assess the transition risks associated with industries exposed to carbon-intensive activities and evaluate the physical risks that may affect government securities and other key assets. NPS can at least start a consulting process, like the Reserve Bank of India did last year, on climate risk and sustainable finance.<br/><br/>Pension fund has a crucial role to fill the green financing gap in India while making the fund resilient to climate-related financial risks, and it can start with regulation.<br/><br/>Jena is Visiting Senior Fellow, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), and Advisor, CSI; Jindal is an Energy Economist<br/><br/>Published on  August 7, 2025 <br/></p>", "publisher": "Business Line", "instances": ["As per various agencies\u2019 estimates, India\u2019s climate mitigation goal by 2070, popularly known as net-zero, needs $10-12. 5 trillion in the next 25-45 years. 5 per cent of GDP by 2030 as per the Reserve Bank of India, translating into about $100 billion per annum.

This monsoon season alone, the state has already witnessed 72 landslides, 38 cloudbursts and 74 flashfloods by mid-August.

This partnership means developers and owners can rely on third-party verification to gauge vulnerability and see which adaptation measures work.</p><p>The need for independent, credible assessment is growing fast as floods, cyclones, heatwaves, and earthquakes threaten business operations, jobs, and access to insurance.</p><p>Businesses need to know if their assets will hold up, explained Diep Nguyen-van Houtte, IFCs Senior Manager of Climate Business. This partnership opens the door to better, externally verified data so companies and communities in high-risk areas can plan and invest more safely.</p><p>By adding Bureau Veritas as a global verifier, the BRI helps communities spot threats early, protect jobs, and boost trust by making results public. The initiative also helps trigger better financing by enabling insurers and investors to gauge risk more clearly. Started with backing from the Australian Government and several global partners, the BRI aims to make climate adaptation practical and accessible for everyone.</p>", "publisher": "TendersInfo - News", "instances": ["By adding Bureau Veritas as a global verifier, the BRI helps communities spot threats early, protect jobs, and boost trust by making results public.

Fisheries research institutes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) are also carrying out scientific studies to gauge the impact of climate change and to develop climate-resilient strategies for sustainable fisheries and aquaculture.</p><p>Under the National Innovation in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), studies are being conducted on wetland fisheries in Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Kerala, along with climate trend analysis of major river basins, fish distribution shifts, catch composition and yield. In the marine sector, research includes climate change modelling, projections for fish catch and mariculture, ocean acidification, blue carbon studies and adaptive management. Awareness and capacity-building programmes are also underway in states such as Odisha, Assam, West Bengal and Kerala to prepare fishing communities for climate impacts.</p><p>The government said the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is playing a key role in climate adaptation and mitigation by promoting sustainable fishing practices, eco-friendly aquaculture and marine ecosystem conservation. Artificial reef development and sea ranching programmes are among the major ecological restoration efforts. A flagship initiative under PMMSY aims to develop 100 coastal fishermen villages into climate-resilient, economically vibrant hubs. Each village is being developed with an investment of Rs 2 crore fully funded by the Centre.</p><p>In addition, PMMSY has sanctioned 58 fishing harbours and landing centres at an outlay of Rs 3,281.31 crore, besides support for cold storage, fish retail markets, wholesale markets, kiosks, value-added enterprises and post-harvest transportation facilities. More than 27,000 post-harvest transport units have been approved, including refrigerated and insulated trucks, live fish vending centres, motorbikes and bicycles with ice boxes. The deployment of Sagar Mitras in coastal villages is further helping fishers adopt hygienic handling and sustainable practices.</p><p>The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), through its NETFISH initiative, has also conducted over 45,500 awareness and training programmes since 2007, reaching nearly 15 lakh stakeholders. These measures have helped reduce post-harvest losses, improve seafood quality, enhance fisher incomes and boost the competitiveness of Indian marine exports.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The indian awaaz.
