More than just a method of cultivation, it is a philosophy that rebuilds soil health, empowers farmers and reimagines our relationship with the land</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world today is confronting an unprecedented climate crisis, and at the centre of this challenge lies carbon. Carbon, the building block of life, has become a critical marker of our environmental health and our failure to safeguard it.</p><p>Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, primarily from burning fossil fuels and large-scale industrial agriculture, is driving global warming, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss. Yet the story of carbon need not be only one of crisis - it can also be one of hope. Regenerative agriculture offers a powerful, practical, and inclusive pathway to manage carbon sustainably while building climate resilience, economic equity, and social well-being.</p><p>What Is Regenerative Agriculture?</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is not merely a set of farming techniques; it is a holistic philosophy rooted in restoring the natural balance between soil, water, plants, animals, and people.</p><p>At its core, it seeks to rebuild and maintain soil health. Healthy soils are teeming with life - bacteria, fungi, insects, and plant roots work together to cycle nutrients and store carbon in organic matter. This process, known as soil carbon sequestration, is one of our most effective natural strategies to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and lock it safely underground.</p><p>The Cost of Industrial Agriculture</p><p>Industrial agriculture, with its reliance on intensive tillage, monocultures, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides, has contributed significantly to the climate crisis by degrading soils and releasing vast stores of carbon.</p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that agriculture, forestry, and other land use changes contribute about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. This damage is not theoretical: vast areas of fertile land have been stripped of organic matter, leading to erosion, desertification, and falling yields. In many regions, farmers are caught in a cycle of declining soil fertility and rising input costs, pushing them further into poverty.</p><p>How Regenerative Practices Work</p><p>In contrast, regenerative farming practices aim to heal the soil and break this destructive cycle. Techniques include cover cropping, no-till or reduced-till farming, composting, crop rotation, agroforestry, and managed grazing.</p><p>Each of these methods is designed to increase organic matter in the soil, boost biodiversity, improve water retention, and strengthen the resilience of farms to droughts and floods. For example, cover crops prevent erosion and add biomass to the soil, while agroforestry integrates trees into farmland, providing shade, windbreaks, and additional income sources.</p><p>A Lifeline for Small Farmers</p><p>Beyond its environmental benefits, regenerative agriculture is vital for social and economic reasons.</p><p>Smallholder farmers, who produce a large share of the world's food, are on the frontlines of climate change. They face increasing uncertainty due to erratic rainfall, shifting growing seasons, and extreme weather events.</p><p>Regenerative practices can help these farmers build resilience by reducing dependence on expensive inputs and by improving yields over time.</p><p>Healthier soils retain more water and nutrients, offering protection against both drought and flooding.</p><p>Empowerment Through the Soil</p><p>Equity is at the heart of regenerative agriculture's promise. By valuing local knowledge and traditional practices, it empowers farming communities-especially women and indigenous people - who often play central roles in land stewardship but are marginalised in decision-making and markets. Restoring degraded lands can create opportunities for local employment, support food security, and enhance livelihoods.</p><p>The shift to regenerative models also recognises the need for fair access to land, finance, and markets so that all farmers, not just large corporate operations, can participate in the transition to a more sustainable food system.</p><p>A Global Climate Imperative</p><p>There is also an urgent global imperative to scale up regenerative practices. According to the InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), land-based solutions, including soil carbon sequestration, could sequester up to 23 gigatons of CO2 by 2050.</p><p>This is not a silver bullet that replaces cutting fossil fuel emissions, but it is an essential part of a comprehensive climate strategy. The world cannot meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5degC without transforming agriculture and land use.</p><p>Momentum and the Risk of Co-option</p><p>Many Governments, businesses, and civil society groups are recognising this potential. Large companies in the food and beverage industry have begun investing in regenerative supply chains. Initiatives such as the OP2B coalition have mobilised billions of dollars to promote regenerative practices among farmers. Monitoring and verification technologies are improving, enabling better measurement of carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services on farms. Financial incentives, certification schemes, and policy support can help make regenerative farming economically viable at scale.</p><p>Yet these efforts must be carefully designed to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. A just transition to regenerative agriculture must prioritise the needs and rights of farmers, especially smallholders. Solutions must be adapted to local contexts rather than imposed from above.</p><p>Land rights, tenure security, and inclusive decision-making are essential to ensure that the benefits of regenerative agriculture are widely shared. Without this focus on equity, the promise of regenerative agriculture risks being co-opted or limited to wealthy markets.</p><p>India's Regenerative Opportunity</p><p>India, with its vast and diverse agricultural landscape, is particularly well placed to champion regenerative agriculture. Many traditional farming systems in India already embody regenerative principles, such as mixed cropping, composting, and agroforestry.</p><p>Revitalising and modernising these practices can help address soil degradation, water scarcity, and rural poverty while contributing to India's climate goals. Government support, research institutions, civil society, and farmer producer organisations can all play critical roles in scaling these solutions.</p><p>A New Carbon Story</p><p>Ultimately, regenerative agriculture offers not only a response to the carbon and climate crisis but a vision for a healthier, fairer, and more resilient world. It reframes carbon from a pollutant to be feared into a vital building block to be stewarded with care. By working with nature rather than against it, we can repair broken ecosystems, secure livelihoods, and leave a more hopeful legacy for future generations. In a time when climate news often feels overwhelming and despairing, regenerative agriculture stands out as a genuine source of optimism-a practical, science-backed pathway to resilience, equity, and hope.</p><p>(The writer is well-known agriculture expert and General Manager at Solidaridad.

Indigenous crops like Kattuyanam rice, Poongar rice, and Kuzhiyadichan rice are now near extinction. Their revival is essential to preserve biodiversity and tackle rising nutritional deficiencies in the population.<br/><br/>With India\u2019s population expected to reach 166.8 crore by 2050, a critical question arises: Can we restore ecological health while ensuring food security?<br/><br/>A promising answer lies in regenerative agriculture\u2014a holistic, outcome-based farming system focused on restoring, not depleting, natural resources. Unlike conventional practices, regenerative agriculture improves soil fertility, boosts water retention, and enhances biodiversity, all while delivering strong yields. Key practices include reducing soil disturbance, maintaining year-round soil cover, retaining living roots, intercropping, agroforestry, and integrating livestock to enhance nutrient cycling.<br/><br/>Regenerative farming is also a vital climate solution. According to the IPCC, agriculture, forestry and land use contribute around 22 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to deforestation and chemical-intensive farming. Regenerative practices could potentially sequester up to 23 gigatonnes of CO\u2082 by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).<br/><br/>Moreover, a 1 per cent increase in soil organic matter in 0.4 hectares can improve water storage capacity by 75,000 litres (Observer Research Foundation)\u2014a game-changer in a country where agriculture consumes over 80 per cent of freshwater.<br/><br/>While regenerative practices are effective, scaling them across India\u2019s diverse agricultural landscape demands tech-enabled precision. Tools such as AI, IoT, remote sensing, and Variable Rate Technology (VRT) support data-driven decisions, optimise input usage, and enhance soil and crop health.<br/><br/>In Telangana, an AI-powered initiative helped chilli farmers increase yields by 21 per cent and reduce pesticide use by 9 per cent, according to the WEF. In India\u2019s multilingual setting, tech platforms can also help overcome language barriers, enabling inclusive knowledge dissemination and wider adoption.<br/><br/>With accurate, real-time data, farmers can adopt low-carbon, resource-efficient farming systems that marry traditional wisdom with modern science.<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture is gaining ground globally, especially among FMCG giants, integrating it into their sourcing strategies. One leading food company aims to source 50 per cent of its key ingredients from regenerative practices by 2030. Another is applying regenerative farming across 7 million acres worldwide.These efforts are yielding tangible results. In Spain, regenerative methods helped a drought-affected farm avoid 40 per cent  yield loss. In the U.., farms are using AI-based irrigation systems, robotic weeders, and IoT solutions to reduce chemical dependency and improve soil integrity.<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture is not just ecologically sound\u2014it\u2019s economically promising. A Deloitte study found that increasing climate-smart farming by 20 per cent in the EU could boost farmer incomes by \u20ac9.3 billion annually.

Swaminathan Research Foundation to sketch an agricultural renaissance-one in which regeneration, rather than mere sustenance, is the organising principle. The symposium, alive with the cross-pollination of ideas from India to Kenya and Nebraska to Tanzania, became a crucible for reimagining food systems that can heal the land, empower rural economies, and restore the balance between humanity and nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr. Himanshu Pathak, President of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Director General of ICRISAT , unfurled a vision grounded in hard-won experimentation. From the resilient cropping systems of millets to the restorative sweep of conservation agriculture, his approach married resource optimisation with landscape regeneration across both Alfisols and Vertisols.</p><p>The data was not abstract but intimate, tied to specific geographies and livelihoods: in the havelis of Uttar Pradesh, water tables rose to 4.5 metres and base flows strengthened; in Odisha, a 500-acre intervention touched 410 households, lifting average incomes to Rs 30,160; in Maharashtra, groundwater recharge strategies reinforced the very foundation of sustainable agriculture. His work in Tanzania saw pigeon pea yields leap from 300 to 500 kilograms per hectare, while Ethiopia embraced nutrient-water budgeting as part of a regenerative agricultural blueprint. The scaling ambitions were no less audacious-expanding conservation agriculture to a quarter of India's arable land, some 140 million hectares, and reclaiming 25 million hectares of degraded terrain.</p><p>Yet the discussion was not devoid of introspection. Professor Chittaranjan Ray, Director of the Nebraska Water Center at the University of Nebraska , invoked the \"lingering effects\" of the Green Revolution's first wave-pollution, biodiversity loss, and compromised public health-reminding the audience that the triumvirate of fertilisers, credit, and fair pricing once offered to governments came with ecological costs now impossible to ignore. He described the slow attrition of the High Plains Ogallala Aquifer, counterpointed by Nebraska's relative success in stalling its decline, and warned of rising nitrate levels in irrigated groundwater.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture, he argued, must transcend the yield fetish, anchoring itself instead in returns on investment that embed environmental conservation and soil vitality. His blueprint was unambiguously technological: crop simulation, dynamic yield estimation, evapotranspiration monitoring, in-season nitrogen management, IoT applications, and yield-gap analytics-all tied to precision interventions. Linking this to global energy transitions, he spoke of ongoing efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel from canola, a reminder that regenerative thinking must embrace industrial as well as agrarian spheres.</p><p>If Dr. Ray offered a bridge from technological exactitude to environmental prudence, Dr. Ch. Srinivasa Rao, Director and Vice Chancellor of ICAR-IARI , elevated the discourse into philosophical terrain. Regenerative agriculture, he insisted, is not merely a set of practices but a paradigm shift-a deliberate turning towards healing lands, restoring livelihoods, and tempering the climate. He enumerated the four cardinal principles: minimal soil disturbance, maximum biodiversity, permanent soil cover, and the integration of livestock.</p><p>In Bastar's Tahakapal district, an integrated farming systems model was transforming lives, while the prescription that one-third of all farmland be placed under agroforestry hinted at a structural reordering of Indian agriculture. He championed agroforestry as a mechanism for restoring soil carbon, lauded India's four million hectares under organic farming, and underscored the potential of a circular carbon economy through crop residue management. His call for a National Mission on Regenerative Agriculture, coupled with the development of next-generation fertilisers, aimed not at incremental change but systemic transformation-anchored in climate-resilient villages, with Maharashtra's 107 model villages already replicated five thousandfold.</p><p>From this Indian crucible, the conversation leapt to the global commons. Carlo Fadda, Director of Agrobiodiversity at the Alliance Bioversity International and CIAT in Kenya, warned that the annual economic toll from lost ecosystem services stood between $ 4.3 and 20 trillion, with ten million hectares of forest disappearing each year.</p><p>The \"true cost\" of food-encompassing environmental degradation, social dislocation, and health impacts-remained invisible in conventional economic metrics. His advocacy for \"nature-positive\" agriculture was both moral and operational: conserve natural capital, support smallholder farmers, halt deforestation, rehabilitate degraded lands, deploy appropriate technologies, reduce agriculture's carbon footprint, and institutionalize traditional knowledge through participatory research. In Kenya, aggregated farming villages and community seed banks were fortifying resilience, while in Maharashtra, model farms embodied the promise of such principles in practice.</p><p>Closing the loop from macro to micro, Dr. V. R. Prabavathy, Former Director of Biotechnology at MSSRF , returned to the very bedrock of life-the rhizosphere where plant, microbe, and soil are in constant colloquy. Regenerative agriculture's core principles, she reminded the audience, demand minimising soil disturbance, maximising biodiversity, maintaining living roots, and integrating livestock. Her research illuminated the shifts in soil microbiomes induced by cultivated crops, and her development of biocapsules as biostimulants-trialled in turmeric and ginger, with a mere one capsule sufficient for an acre-offered a tantalising glimpse of low-cost, high-impact interventions that marry science with farmer pragmatism.</p><p>By the symposium's close, the rhetoric of regeneration had been grounded in field data, economic logic, ecological necessity, and moral imperative. The vision that emerged was not simply of agriculture as a food-producing enterprise, but as a civilisation-sustaining covenant-one that measures its success not in yield alone, but in the restoration of soils, the replenishment of aquifers, the resilience of communities, and the reconciliation of humanity with the natural systems that cradle it.

Since the project began, it is estimated that the tons of CO2e emitted into the atmosphere have already been reduced by an average of 40%.</p><p>To achieve this, farmers are developing various practices, including no-till planting. This method allows farmers to sow seeds directly without tilling the soil. This promotes an increase in organic matter and, consequently, improves its quality and ability to respond to adverse weather conditions, giving the crop greater climate resilience.</p><p>Precision agriculture is also being used , which allows farmers toOptimize the use of inputs. Through technologies such as remote sensing, it is possible to determine the actual nitrogen nutrient requirements of crops, as well as the characteristics and variability of the terrain within the plot, in order to apply different amounts of fertilizer based on the soil's productive potential. This reduces chemical fertilization.</p><p>In addition, disease-warning weather stations are being used to monitor disease at the appropriate time based on risk.</p><p>On the other hand, crop rotation is being encouraged while integratingLegume crops are also part of the rotation. Thus, farmers alternate between cereals and legumes to take advantage of the latter's ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil and benefit the cereal in the following harvest.</p><p>Likewise, the use of biostimulants is being promoted , which improve nutrient efficiency while promoting plant growth and development and helping to reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.</p><p>FGN technicians, with support from Nestl and farmers, also assess the biodiversity associated with different regenerative agriculture practices to understand their impact on the quality of the agricultural ecosystem.</p><p>For Maite Llorens, FGN technician and project leader, \"regenerative agriculture practices are key to improving soil quality and health, as well as optimizing resource management.

Agriculture, a cornerstone of human survival, is also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Regenerative agriculture emerges as a vital response, aiming not just to minimise harm but to actively restore soil health, enhance biodiversity, and build resilience against climate challenges. Research suggests that regenerative farming on 40 per cent of the world\u2019s cropland could save around 600 million tonnes of emissions annually, highlighting its transformative potential for environmental recovery and sustainable food systems.</p><p><br/><br/>At the heart of regenerative agriculture is the recognition that healthy soil is the foundation of sustainable farming. Conventional practices often strip the land of nutrients, leaving it vulnerable to erosion and carbon loss. Regenerative methods, however, focus on rebuilding soil structure and organic matter. No-till farming, for instance, reduces soil disturbance, allowing carbon to remain stored underground while improving water retention and microbial activity.<br/><br/>Planting cover crops is another cornerstone of this approach. These plants, grown between main crops, shield the soil from erosion, add vital nutrients, and enhance fertility. Such practices not only boost agricultural productivity but also play a crucial role in sequestering carbon\u2014capturing it from the atmosphere and locking it in the soil. Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) suggests that widespread adoption of regenerative practices could offset up to 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key tool in combating climate change.<br/><br/>Biodiversity is an essential component of resilient ecosystems, and regenerative agriculture prioritises its enhancement.

Healthier soils and improved ecosystem services often lead to better crop yields and reduced reliance on expensive inputs like synthetic fertilisers and pesticides.

Studies show that transitioning from conventional agriculture to regenerative methods can increase the return on investment for farmers by 15 to 25 per cent.<br/><br/>Moreover, regenerative practices contribute to food security by improving the resilience of crops to extreme weather conditions. As these methods gain traction, they also create opportunities for new markets centered around sustainably grown products, offering consumers choices that align with environmental values. Notably, the global regenerative agriculture market is projected to reach $16.8 billion by 2027, reflecting growing demand and investment in this field. However, transitioning to regenerative agriculture is not without challenges. Farmers may face initial financial burdens and require technical training to adopt these new practices effectively.<br/><br/>Government policies play a pivotal role in enabling the widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture.

By working together, businesses, policymakers, and farmers can create a resilient food system that benefits people, the planet, and the economy.</p><p>Six recommendations to scale regenerative agriculture practices across the EU</p><p>Based on comprehensive studies and various stakeholder interviews in the agri-food value chain, the report presents six key recommendations to enable the transition to regenerative agriculture in collaboration with value chain experts.</p><p>1. Create an EU-wide, outcome-based definition of regenerative agriculture. This definition can serve as the foundation of an EU-wide benchmarking system, aligning with the Strategic Dialogue's recommendations. It would align clear metrics on outcomes such as minimize GHG emissions, increased cultivated biodiversity, and improved soil health (increased soil organic carbon), while setting progressive adoption targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 to align with EU climate goals. More information on aligned KPIs here.</p><p>2. Develop an EU-wide measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) program to standardize outcome measurement methodologies. This EU-wide program would standardize data collection and reporting, focusing on key metrics like carbon sequestration and soil health. It would build on the work done by DG AGRI through the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) to ensure robust and credible monitoring, reporting, and verification systems. Investments in cost-effective technologies and the use of existing data, such as satellite imagery, can ensure scalability and accuracy.</p><p>3. Incorporate outcome-based criteria into CAP Pillar I payments. Farmers would receive practice-based payments during the transition and outcome-based rewards tied to measurable environmental improvements, leveraging the existing eco-schemes framework.</p><p>4. Create an Agri-Transition Fund through the European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance the transition. This fund, managed through the European Investment Bank (EIB), would facilitate three important components in a farmer's financing stack: a land bank conditioned on regenerative practices, insurance products to mitigate risks such as extreme weather or reduced yields during transition, and capital loans to help farmers cover the initial investments of transition.</p><p>5. Improve knowledge-sharing programs to accelerate adoption of Regen Ag. Peer-to-peer farmer networks, digital resource hubs, and in-person training sessions would facilitate the exchange of best practices. Integrating Regen Ag into agricultural education and advisory services would ensure long-term capacity building.</p><p>6. Develop a public-private market to link payments to the provision of ecosystem services. This framework would link private investments to environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, water quality improvements, and biodiversity gains. Tax incentives and technical support can encourage private-sector participation while providing financial rewards to farmers.</p><p>Central to these proposals is the Agri-Transition Fund, led by the European Investment Bank, which aims to address the financial risks farmers face during the multi-year transition to regenerative agriculture. This fund offers innovative tools such as a regenerative land bank to support sustainable practices and insurance products to protect farmers from challenges like yield reductions and extreme weather. The Agri-Transition Fund can provide a robust framework to ensure farmers have the financial stability and confidence needed to embrace regenerative practices and secure a sustainable future.</p><p>Aligning on an outcome-based definition for regenerative agriculture and implementing MMRV systems will lay a solid regulatory foundation. Short-term initiatives, including financing and knowledge-sharing programs, will enable immediate progress, while the integration of CAP and the development of ecosystem services marketplaces will drive systemic change.

How has technology helped them ensure transparency, traceability, and consumer trust in food sourcing? Also, how the brand has discovered practical strategies for reducing food waste, supporting smallholder farmers, and meeting consumer expectations for sustainability, all while maintaining profitability and trust<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 1. How can FMCG companies integrate regenerative agriculture and support smallholder farmers while maintaining cost efficiency and scalability?</emphasis><br/><br/>The FMCG companies can advocate and support smallholder farming operations by training them on improved crop rotation, agroforestry practices, affordable equipment, and access to technology for all sustainability techniques. Farmer cooperatives and contract farming can take forms to provide a stable market economy at scale. Precision agriculture and digital marketplaces will make optimal use of resources to lower costs. Rewards, such as prizes for sustainable food and carbon credit opportunities, will encourage farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Companies can balance cost efficiency and environmental impact if they match their effort to the consumer demand for sustainability.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 2. What role can new-age technology (such as blockchain or AI) play in ensuring transparency, traceability, and consumer trust in food sourcing?</emphasis><br/><br/>New-age technologies such as blockchain and AI are changing the face of the food supply chain through improved transparency, traceability, and consumer trust. Blockchain provides a safe, tamper-proof digital ledger that goes through the processing steps of food items from the farm to the fork. It can thus identify where the contamination or fraud came from and at the same time offer detailed information on a product's farming practices and history of transportation to the consumers. Blockchain further ensures smart contracts that comply with sustainability and ethical sourcing standards.<br/><br/>Similarly, AI plays a pivotal role by using predictive analytics to optimize inventory and ensure waste reduction, guaranteeing efficient supply chain operations. AI-powered tools can improve quality control by detecting defects in raw materials or finished goods, with consistent quality. AI helps brands by aligning their strategic sourcing that evolving ethical and sustainability expectations, which offers deep insights into consumer preferences to build consumer trust.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 3. How can food brands balance the need for ethical labor practices with the complexities of global supply chains and ensure fair wages and working conditions?</emphasis><br/><br/>Brands work within complex global supply chains characterized by multi-tiered networks, diverse geographies, and sometimes conflicting labor laws. Ethical labor practices can be hard to ensure, but building sustainable and responsible businesses relies on them. Brands can find the balance by prioritizing ethical standards, promoting supply chain transparency, obtaining fair wages, leveraging technology, empowering workers, advocating for legal and policy alignment, engaging stakeholders, and reporting progress. Food brands can dive into global supply chains and be a part of robust business models, gaining fair wages and better working conditions for workers in cases where they are effectively integrated into the core operations with partnerships.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 4. What are the key strategies FMCG companies can adopt to reduce the environmental impact of sourcing ingredients like palm oil, soy, and cacao while maintaining sustainability goals?</emphasis><br/><br/>FMCG companies can adopt several strategies to balance environmental impact and sustainability goals:<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Protecting Natural Ecosystems</emphasis><br/><br/>Ensure ingredients are not sourced from a deforested or converted natural ecosystem. Use globally recognized tools to identify and protect high-carbon stock forests, high conservation value areas, intact forest landscapes, peat soils, and ecologically sensitive landscapes.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Sustainable Sourcing Strategies</emphasis><br/><br/>Implement robust certification standards (e.g., RSPO for palm oil), develop traceability systems, and maintain a clear chain of custody from agricultural origins to manufacturing. Regular supplier audits should be conducted, and suppliers must protect ecosystems, implement no-burning policies, and follow best management practices.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Human Rights and Social Responsibility</emphasis><br/><br/>FMCG companies should respect and promote human rights in their supply chains, protect the land rights of indigenous communities, and adhere to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) principles. Eliminating forced and child labor, ensuring safe and fair working conditions, and empowering smallholder farmers are also essential.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Transparency and Monitoring</emphasis><br/><br/>Conducting risk assessments of sourcing materials, mapping supply chains, and using technology to trace sustainability are necessary steps. FMCG companies should aim for traceability to the farm or plantation level and ensure compliance through independent verification.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Regenerative and Innovative Approaches</emphasis><br/><br/>Invest in projects that restore degraded landscapes, support regenerative farming practices, and monitor risks with new technologies. Focus on restoring soil health, improving water quality, increasing biodiversity, and enhancing climate resilience.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Collaborative Ecosystem</emphasis><br/><br/>Partnering with multi-stakeholder platforms, NGOs, trade unions, academic institutions, local communities, and governments helps us drive industry-wide sustainable transformation. Companies should support and improve commodity standards and advocate for systemic changes in global supply chains.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Remediation and Accountability</emphasis><br/><br/>Develop grievance mechanisms, address non-compliance, take action against suppliers who fail to meet standards, and continuously update policies to ensure long-term progress toward sustainability goals.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 5. What are the best practices for FMCG companies in reducing food waste throughout the supply chain, from production to retail, while aligning with sustainability goals?</emphasis><br/><br/>FMCG companies can reduce food waste across the supply chain while advancing sustainability goals through strategic interventions. At the production level, smart farming technologies like IoT sensors and AI enable precise resource management, reducing waste and inefficiencies. Companies can also repurpose byproducts for secondary markets or animal feed, minimizing disposal. In the supply chain, advanced demand forecasting powered by AI ensures production aligns with consumer needs, preventing overstocking. Efficient logistics, including cold-chain technologies, reduce spoilage during transportation. At the retail level, practices like dynamic pricing encourage the sale of products nearing expiration, while clear labeling helps consumers make informed decisions and avoid unnecessary waste.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 6. How are consumer demands for sustainability and ethical sourcing impacting food pricing, and how can brands balance profitability with these growing expectations?</emphasis><br/><br/>The increase in the consumer demand for sustainability and ethical sourcing is altering food pricing and profitability dynamics. Sustainable and ethically sourced products involve higher costs due to environmentally friendly production practices, fair wages, and certifications, leading to premium pricing. Most consumers are willing to pay more for such products, forcing the brands to balance affordability with sustainability. By adopting new technologies like AI, blockchain, and IoT, the process for profitability becomes streamlined and less costly. Another way to justify premium pricing is to communicate the tangible benefits of sustainable practices, such as better health or reduced environmental impact. Finally, scaling up production as demand increases can reduce per-unit costs.

At the centre of this discussion is a critical but traditionally neglected element- soil health. </p><p><br/><br/>Healthy soil is not merely about producing more food; it is about producing better food that will feed millions while sustaining farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Over 99.7 per cent of our food comes from the soil. However, soil health degradation worldwide has reduced agricultural productivity, water availability, and the health of forest and pasture ecosystems. This decline has also impacted human nutrition, with around 9.2 per cent of the world\u2019s population, that is around 735 million people were chronically undernourished.<br/><br/>India\u2019s Green Revolution-driven agricultural boom brought prosperity to millions from hunger. But three decades of intensive cultivation, high chemical fertilizer use, and monocropping have taken their toll. Government estimates indicate that almost 30 per cent of India\u2019s soil is degraded, which is close to 146.8 million hectares. Of this, around 29 per cent is lost to the sea, 61 per cent is transferred from one place to another, and 10% is deposited in reservoirs. All of these have resulted in reduced productivity, poor crop quality, and rising vulnerability to floods and droughts.<br/><br/>Nutrients- starved crops are produced by barren soils, which later result in wide-scale malnutrition, especially amongst rural communities. Degradation of soil leads to damaging effects on the economy, environment, food security, and health.<br/><br/>Restoring soil health is not only about preventing land degradation; it also holds the potential to rediscover the nutrient content in food. The overall nutrient value of crops has declined due to the excessive use of chemicals and synthetic fertilisers. Healthy soil, rich in organic matter, has the potential to enhance the nutrient value of various crops. When farmers adopt natural farming methods that promote soil regeneration, the taste of the produce is said to improve. This can be taken as an indication of the difference in nutrient value of the produce increases with soil health improvement.<br/><br/>By adopting sustainable practices such as organic farming, cover cropping, biofertilizers, and crop rotation, farmers can naturally enhance soil fertility.<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture offers a holistic approach to farming that actively restores soil health while improving farm productivity. It emphasizes the use of natural inputs like biofertilizers and biopesticides, local indigenous seed varieties that are more climate-resilient and nutrient-rich than high-yielding varieties (HYVs), and innovative processing tools. Techniques such as multi-layer cropping allow farmers to grow two or more crops on the same plot simultaneously.<br/><br/>A central goal of regenerative agriculture is to build Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), which is crucial for maintaining soil fertility. This is achieved through composting organic waste like kitchen scraps, crop residues, and livestock manure and applying mulch to protect the soil surface. These practices improve the soil\u2019s texture, enhance its water-holding capacity, and support the growth of beneficial microbes, which contribute to long-term soil productivity.<br/><br/>Another core principle is diversifying crop cycles. Rotating crops or integrating pulses, vegetables, and traditional grains enriches both the soil and the diet. These crops, especially the pulses, return essential nutrients to the land, reduce pest pressure, and break disease cycles. Many farmers are also reviving traditional soil-friendly methods, such as using cow dung, plant-based solutions, and homemade biofertilizers. These natural practices not only reduce dependency on synthetic chemicals but also allow the soil to heal slowly but surely restoring its vitality for future generations.<br/><br/>The connection between soil health and food security is both critical and urgent. With a majority of the Indian workforce being employed in agriculture and the sector contributing to the country\u2019s GDP, the degradation of soil quality threatens not only national food production but also the livelihoods of millions of farmers.<br/><br/>Adopting techniques of Regenerative Agriculture leads to healthy soil, improving crop productivity. Practices like cover cropping, minimal tillage, and organic inputs restore soil organic carbon, fertility, and reduce the need for chemical inputs. As a result, they lead to ecological balance, resilient farming systems and improve the nutrient content of the produce. Securing nutritional food for India\u2019s 1.4 billion people requires urgent focus on sustainable soil management.

With raw materials accounting for nearly a quarter of Carlsberg's total emissions, the move is a strategic step to cut CO output and enhance soil health. The company's regenerative framework-built around crop rotation, soil cover, low inputs, and biodiversity-was developed with agricultural advisors and industry collaborations. By working closely with farmers and maltsters, Carlsberg scaled up regenerative barley production to 14,800 tonnes. The pilot beer Grobund received a strong consumer response, reinforcing the brand's sustainability-driven innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What inspired Carlsberg to take this step toward using 100 per cent regeneratively grown barley malt?</p><p>Our decision to brew a beer using 100 per cent regeneratively grown barley malt was driven by the urgent need to reduce agricultural emissions and improve soil health-two critical levers in our broader climate strategy. Approximately 24 per cent of our total value chain COe emissions on the Group level stem from raw materials, with malt accounting for about half of that. Transitioning to regenerative practices is, therefore, a strategic imperative to decrease our footprint and support biodiversity.</p><p>What does regenerative agriculture mean within Carlsberg's strategy, and how was your definition developed?</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is central to our ambition of sourcing 100 per cent of our raw materials from regenerative practices by 2040. Recognising the absence of a universal definition, we developed our framework in collaboration with agricultural advisors and inspirations from SAI Platform's \"Regenerating Together\" working group. Our definition is grounded in these core principles: crop rotation, year-round soil cover, minimal soil disturbance, minimal input use, and a strict ban on insecticides. These principles are designed to enhance soil health, reduce emissions, and promote biodiversity. We also encourage voluntary practices such as agroforestry, organic matter addition, and precision farming to further strengthen outcomes.</p><p>What were the key challenges in scaling from 500 to 14,800 tonnes of regenerative barley malt, and how were they addressed?</p><p>Scaling regenerative barley production from 500 to 14,800 tonnes-equivalent to approximately 100 million liters of beer-required close collaboration across our value chain and with our supply chain partners. Interestingly, the transition has been less challenging than one might expect. The Danish agricultural sector has responded swiftly and constructively to our demand for regeneratively grown barley and found around 50 new farmers who live up to our principles.</p><p>What role do maltsters like Fuglsang and Viking Malt play in this transformation?</p><p>Our partners have been agile in supporting our transition to regenerative barley. They responded quickly to our ambitions, enabling us to scale up supply efficiently and without delay. Their ability to deliver high-quality regenerative malt at short notice has been crucial to the success of this initiative.</p><p>How have consumers responded to Grobund, and is sustainability influencing preferences or loyalty?</p><p>The initial response to Grobund has been very positive. Launched at Folkemoedet and available exclusively at the Home of Carlsberg, the beer has sparked meaningful conversations about the future of agriculture and climate action. While Grobund was produced in limited quantities, it serves as a symbol of what is possible. We are indeed observing a growing segment of consumers who prioritise sustainability in their purchasing decisions, and initiatives like this help reinforce brand trust and loyalty among consumers.</p><p>What are the next milestones on Carlsberg's path to 100 per cent regenerative grain by 2040?</p><p>Looking ahead, our key milestones include reaching 30 per cent regenerative raw material sourcing globally by 2030.

A company purchases those CCs to offset its emissions and proudly announces carbon neutrality. Between these, lies a labyrinth of hope, hypocrisy and opportunity. </p><p><br/><br/>CCs depict a story of environmental accounting, balancing growth with climate vulnerabilities. Like currencies, CCs carry hidden costs and contradictions. <br/><br/>There are two types of carbon markets: mandatory and voluntary. They are about $800 billion and $3 billion, respectively, and expected to reach $1.88 trillion and $24 billion by 2030. One CC represents one tonne of CO\u2082 equivalent reduced, avoided, or removed from the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The Kyoto Protocol (1997) laid the foundation for mandatory carbon markets, where companies are legally expected to limit their GHG emissions and permitted to operate under \u2018cap-and-trade\u2019 system. There is a cap on their emissions but entities can purchase CCs to negate their emissions to the set cap. Voluntary markets evolved later (2000), driven by socially conscious action. <br/><br/>The journey starts with a \u2018Developer\u2019 designing emission reduction projects following acceptable and specific technologies or takes existing projects under her/his wings. The project (reforestation, regenerative-agriculture, renewable-energy, methane-capture etcetera) is then registered with one of the carbon standards (Gold Standard/ VCS/Climate Action Reserve/Plan Vivo). \u2018Independent third-party auditors\u2019 assess, evaluate and monitor emission reductions. Verified emission reductions are converted into CCs. Companies/individuals buy these CCs. They are then \u2018retired\u2019 and taken off markets by \u2018Registries\u2019. The quality of CCs and integrity of the system is monitored by \u2018watch-dogs\u2019. <br/><br/>First, CC trade is a sort of \u2018Faustian bargain\u2019, reducing Earth\u2019s complexity to a spreadsheet. In India, forestry projects use satellite algorithms to predict deforestation rates, while agricultural initiatives extrapolate soil carbon samples, but the margin of error is vast. A Nature article (2024) exposed systemic overestimates in carbon projects. <br/><br/>Second, additionality in carbon markets refers to the principle, that a carbon offset project should result in emission reductions that would not have occurred without the project or the revenue from selling CC (like wind-farms generating millions of CC by displacing coal-fired electricity). But additionality is a hall of mirrors. A report (2024) on world\u2019s largest carbon offset projects found that over 47.7 million carbon credits were problematic, meaning projects are unlikely to deliver real emission reductions, aka greenwashing. <br/><br/>Third, India is the second-largest supplier of carbon offset projects (afforestation, biogas plants). But benefits from these projects often don\u2019t reach communities. A World Rural Forum (2023) study found that only 0.3 per cent of climate change funding reaches communities. A 2025 investigation by the Nature found that half of the forestry projects in India have failed/ discontinued due to lack of community rights and benefit sharing. <br/><br/>Fourth, \u2018permanence\u2019 is not guaranteed if/when forests get burned/removed, or farmers stop regenerative-agriculture practices. We can\u2019t sell certainty in an uncertain world. In 2021, Cyclone Tauktae devastated forests of Gujarat, releasing centuries of stored carbon, erasing CCs sold. Registries usually withhold 20 per cent as buffer, but these safeguards crumble, in climate-amplified disasters. <br/><br/>Environmentalists aver CC is a responsibility and not a commodity to be traded. An afforestation project might have restored 10,000 acres of degraded land. But down the road, a coal-power plant purchases those CC, delaying its own transition to renewables. This duality is the essence of CC. It is a tool that can heal or harm, depending on hands that wield it. <br/><br/>India\u2019s voluntary carbon market is about $500 million and operates with minimal oversight, where almost 90 per cent of the value is lost/consumed in the supply chain. But opportunities exist to set fair norms. Start-ups like C-GEM are endeavouring to provide negotiating platforms to communities. Mitti Labs and Varaha use AI/ML to analyse data, exposing inflated baselines in real time. <br/><br/>Hopefully, the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (2024), will show its regulatory teeth and enforce integrity. <br/><br/>As India prepares to embrace its net-zero targets, the question should be, what we seek from CCs, should be of transforming them from offsets to instruments of justice, serving communities and markets. <br/><br/>Gupta is Co-Founder C-GEM and Suryakumar is former Deputy Managing Director, NABARD.

A quick look at the subtle differences in meaning would help. <br/><br/>Organic agriculture avoids synthetic chemicals and GMOs. Regenerative agriculture (RA) improves soil health by promoting biodiversity, carbon sequestration, restoring entire agricultural ecosystems, and thus goes beyond sustainability. Natural farming (NF) is a sub-set of RA and is an Indian expression. Philosophically NF is minimalist in nature \u2014 reaching a stage of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, where natural processes are established. Sustainable agriculture balances environmental responsibility with productivity, encompassing both RA and NF. </p><p><br/><br/>An overarching expression, agroecology, defined by FAO, provides a 13-principles framework to usher in agriculture which balances local ecology with local economy. RA is a widely used expression globally. <br/><br/>The macro and micro picture for agriculture does not look comfortable. Mean surface air temperature in 2024 was 1.54 \u00b0C above the pre-industrial average. A recent study (IPE Global and Esri India), indicates 85 per cent of districts are prone to extreme weather events. Agri-input subsidies for energy-intensive farming are about 3 per cent of GDP, a concern to the government. <br/><br/>According to NAFIS (Nabard All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey) report (2021-22), average monthly income of agricultural households was \u20b913,661, debt \u20b991,231 and only one-third of the income comes from agriculture. Yet, 57 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture, indicating its importance and the necessity to make it resilient. Spread of RA through transformative processes is crucial. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Many successful RA farms exist across the country, despite Green Revolution. They have demonstrated resilience to erratic weather patterns. These are promoted by champion farmers, civil society and philanthropies. Each parcel is of a few acres. Exact numbers are not known, as the produce is used for personal consumption, and a little is sold in local markets. These are exemplars, despite their small size, because of their signalling effect. <br/><br/>Of late, \u2018natural shops\u2019 are mushrooming in urban areas, selling trust-based agriculture products with no/less chemicals. For example, Indore based, Kamdar\u2019s Organic Farmers\u2019 Producer Company sells chemical-free staples, under a brand \u2018Satvik\u2019 through 300 local stores. Its gross revenue was \u20b91 crore in FY2024. <br/><br/>Likewise, turnover of Bengaluru-based Sahaja Samrudha Organic Producer\u2019s Company was \u20b918 crore and Anantapur based Dharani Farming and Marketing Cooperative (Timbacktu Collective) was \u20b95.2 crore. <br/><br/>These exemplars should be transitioned to the next level. Politically changing entrenched agriculture practices is not easy. Hence, Indian philanthropies have a big role to play, through coalitions, pooling resources and reprioritization of investments. <br/><br/>Exemplars must be enhanced, in their depth, breadth and coverage, establishing a scientific basis for RA and creating a critical mass for transformation. A ballpark requirement for this programme is \u20b92,500 crore (50 NGOs/4 different locations per NGO/2500 hectares per location/\u20b950,000 per hectare for 5 years). This is a very small investment in relation to \u20b91.2 lakh crore invested by the private philanthropy in FY2023 (India Philanthropy Report: 2024). <br/><br/>Fifty civil society organisations, which have successfully demonstrated RA across geographies, may be invited to submit project proposals. Each project should be comprehensive, designed as per local ecology, requirements, saturating entire landscape, as per RA principles. <br/><br/>The programme must work on all three aspects of agriculture; cost reduction, productivity enhancement and managing markets. Existing community institutions like SHGs/FPOs/cooperatives may be involved. <br/><br/>The writer is former deputy managing director, NABARD.

Achieve Upcycling by Using Manufacturing Byproducts as Ingredients to Create High-Performance Biochar</p><p>Agricultural waste, such as food loss and crop residues, is said to account for approximately one-fifth[*2] of Japan's total industrial waste each year. Many of this waste is incinerated or landfilled, causing concerns due to its increasing environmental impact and the wasting of valuable resources.</p><p>In this pilot, a biochar was produced by carbonizing beverage residues (used green tea leaves) from Suntory Group's manufacturing processes. This was then combined with TOWING's multifunctional microbial groups, such as microbes that accelerate the decomposition of organic fertilizers, to create high-performance biochar.</p><p>In the future, the two companies plan to produce high-performance biochar from other manufacturing byproducts generated within its supply chain, thereby expanding and promoting upcycling.</p><p>2. Using High-performance Biochar in Regenerative Agriculture[*3] to Balance Crop Efficiency Improvements and Agricultural GHG Emissions Reductions</p><p>Agriculture and forestry account for approximately 13%[*4] of global GHG emissions, with chemical fertilizers, which require large amounts of fossil-derived raw materials to produce, being a significant contributor. While the use of organic fertilizers, one of the regenerative agriculture methods, is said to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the use of chemical fertilizers, it faces challenges of low fertilizer efficiency and reduced yields compared to the use of conventional chemical fertilizers.</p><p>The use of high-performance biochar together with organic fertilizers on agricultural land is expected to improve fertilizer efficiency, leading to improved crop quality and yield. Additionally, this approach is anticipated to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions by suppressing the use of chemical fertilizers.<br/><br/>In this pilot program, the two companies plan to study and compare the effects of conventional organic fertilizers with organic fertilizers treated with high-performance biochar at Suntory Group's contract farm where tea plants[*5] are grown. The first harvest has already been completed where results show that crops grown in soil treated with high-performance biochar maintained the same quality while improving the yield compared to the use of conventional organic fertilizers. Based on these outcomes, the two companies will continue to conduct this pilot program to verify the effects of high-performance biochar and the various conditions necessary to improve crop efficiency. The goal is to establish a regenerative agriculture method that can achieve the same yield rate as the conventional farming methods.</p><p>Suntory Group has long supported regenerative agriculture as one way to reduce GHG emissions in the agricultural sector. The group collaborates with suppliers and contract farmers to transition to sustainable farming practices, such as cover cropping[*6], organic fertilization, and no-till farming. Notable projects include barley cultivation in the UK (2022) and sugarcane cultivation in Thailand (2024). Led by Suntory Global Innovation Center in collaboration with TOWING, this pilot program is attracting attention because it has the potential to establish a regenerative agriculture process through improved efficiency in the use of organic fertilizers and to build a new resource recycling model that utilizes unused biomass resources.

Anchored in regenerative agriculture and climate-smart practices, the Carbon Standards for Incentivizing Farmers for Regenerative Agricultural Practices (CSIFRA) project is being rolled out across the districts of Sambalpur, Bargarh, and Subarnapur.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project, spearheaded by Odisha's Directorate of Agriculture and Farmers' Empowerment (DAFE) in partnership with ICRISAT, is establishing India's first integrated, scientifically validated, farmer-centric carbon market framework. With a strong focus on paddy systems-the backbone of Odisha's agri-economy-the initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enhance soil health, and generate verifiable carbon credits that can unlock new revenue streams for farmers.</p><p>\"Agriculture is often seen as a major emitter, but our food systems bear the brunt of climate impacts. Carbon credits can flip this narrative-turning farmers into climate stewards and strengthening rural incomes,\" said Dr Himanshu Pathak, Director General, ICRISAT.</p><p>As India operationalizes its Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, launched in 2023, the CSIFRA pilot aligns seamlessly with national priorities. The voluntary carbon market in India is poised to become one of the largest in the world by 2030-yet its success hinges on scalable, scientifically sound, and socially inclusive implementation models. \"As the Government of India rolls out its carbon trading framework, projects like CSIFRA provide critical, field-tested insights. With proper incentives and practical tools, farmers are showing that sustainable practices are not only viable but preferred,\" noted Dr Stanford Blade, Deputy Director General for Research and Innovation at ICRISAT.</p><p>Odisha has emerged as a national leader in climate-resilient farming, from rice-fallow intensification and millet processing to now carbon farming. The CSIFRA project represents a major leap in this trajectory. \"Our partnership with ICRISAT is strengthening the implementation of India's Voluntary Carbon Market for agriculture. By developing a robust MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Validation) framework, we're building the technical backbone needed to reward farmers for regenerative practices,\" said Dr Arabinda Kumar Padhee, Principal Secretary, Department of Agriculture and Farmers' Empowerment, Government of Odisha.</p><p>Core practices include Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR), Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), integrated nutrient management, green manuring, and composting-each proven to reduce emissions and enhance soil carbon sequestration. \"Switching from continuous flooding to AWD or applying optimized nitrogen has real emission-reduction value-what we're doing now is capturing that value in a measurable, verifiable way,\" said Dr Mukund Patil, Senior Scientist, ICRISAT.</p><p>To translate climate finance into grassroots change, ICRISAT's field teams are conducting awareness programs and capacity-building sessions at the district and block levels. These include hands-on demonstrations, farmer testimonials, and vernacular video modules to demystify complex carbon concepts. Guru Govind Padhan of Bargarh credited green manuring with reducing his fertilizer dependence. Ramesh Behera from Subarnapur observed fewer irrigation cycles and input costs under DSR, with no loss in yield. \"My water use dropped by 30 per cent and yield increased by 5 per cent after switching to DSR and AWD. I even earned extra income by selling crop residue instead of burning it,\" shared Santosh Budek, a farmer from Sambalpur.</p><p>Among 50+ stakeholders attending the sessions, over 40 per cent expressed readiness to adopt carbon farming practices. Participants also urged the formation of carbon farming cooperatives and integration into existing agricultural support schemes.</p><p>ICRISAT's efforts extend beyond field practices. As a technical partner to the Government of India's Voluntary Carbon Market, the institute is developing India-specific carbon standard protocols for rice ecologies. These protocols will be fundamental to scaling carbon farming within the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. A digital MRV platform-currently under development-is poised to revolutionize data collection, certification, and market access for farmers.</p><p>By integrating geotagging, satellite imagery, and sensor-based data capture, the system promises enhanced transparency, reduced transaction costs, and faster onboarding for smallholders. \"We're turning what was once a complex, opaque process into a farmer-friendly gateway to global carbon markets.

Roger Marshall, R-Kan., has styled himself as an early adopter of the Make America Healthy Again movement, a political slogan born on the 2024 campaign trail that has since seen major companies tweak their products to nix artificial additives.</p><p>But Marshall sees the initiative, commonly known as MAHA, as one that can start sooner than switching the oil in deep friers or swapping out high-fructose corn syrup for cane sugar in soda.</p><p>He has his own four pillars of MAHA, which include dialing up efficiency in agriculture; healthier, more nutrient-rich food; affordable access to primary care healthcare; and addressing mental health challenges among young people.</p><p>But it all starts below the surface with soil health.</p><p>Soil is a dirty topic, you know, pun intended, Marshall told Fox News Digital in an interview.</p><p>MAHA diehards and farmers are, at a surface level, at odds with one another, he said. For example, returning to an entirely organic food production process devoid of fertilizers would create healthier food, but also crank up the costs on consumers and strain farmland.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Marshall held a roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to try and bridge that gap.</p><p>Soil health seems to be the common ground, he said. So healthy soil meets healthy food meets healthy people. Rather than MAHA telling these farmers what you can and cant do, we wanted to say, Whats our goal here? If we have the same goals, then were going to figure this out. Well, the goal is healthy soil.</p><p>Getting those two in a room together, along with experts on regenerative agriculture, which is a more holistic approach to farming that targets soil health by restoring and enhancing ecosystems, is just a part of his plan.</p><p>He also intends to drop a massive package of bills that is divided up into categories that echo his four pillars, including legislation geared toward health care, mental health, nutrition and agriculture.</p><p>Among the nearly 30 bills and amendments in the package is one Marshall is particularly keen to see codified. The Plant Biostimulant Act would spur usage of organisms that can be placed into the soil and that latch onto the roots of plants that absorb nitrates and more water, he said.</p><p>The bill ties in directly with his passion for regenerative agriculture, which uses fewer fertilizers, water and other status-quo farming techniques to produce healthier foods on more sustainable farmland, which, in turn, would yield a cheaper, more nutritious diet for Americans.</p><p>Its growing more with less, he said.</p><p>Among the various, bipartisan pieces of legislation from both chambers are bills that would push mobile cancer screenings with grant funding, add mental health warnings for kids scrolling through social media, require more transparency in food ingredients, expansion of employer healthcare coverage for chronic diseases, and measures that would allow bleeding edge soil health technology and processes to be considered conservation practices and eligible for Farm Bill funding, among others.</p><p>Most bills need to get 60 votes to pass in the Senate, Marshall noted, and that led to a desire to incorporate as many bipartisan measures in the package as possible. Its also a topic that, in spite of the political polarization in Washington, unites us, rather than divides us.</p><p>Still, with President Donald Trump in office, he sees the chance for the measures to pass as a kind of now or never moment.</p><p>Were seeing a time in our lives where the incidence of cancer, the age of cancer, is growing younger and younger, the age of Alzheimers onset is growing younger and younger, and we believe its an inflammatory reaction to the food that were eating that leads to all that, he said.</p><p>We think heart disease, hypertension, is really an inflammatory reaction to the food were eating and the constantly high sugar levels in our blood system, he continued.

He explained that these mineral losses in soils also manifest in the food we consume, playing a decisive role in the emergence of hidden hunger, which is so prevalent in people today (especially in children).</p><p>akmak continued: \"If the soil is poor in minerals, so is the food, and so is the human being... With this in mind, we sought to find a rapid and effective solution to this mineral deficiency problem through this collaboration with lker. While still in the field, the wheat was nourished with zinc and selenium applied to its leaves, and then it transferred these valuable minerals to its grain. Thus, the wheat regained the mineral richness it had gradually lost over the years. In other words, nothing external was added; it simply replenished the minerals it had lost over time.</p><p>The Sakliky biscuit, produced with this fortified wheat flour, will be a fine example of the \"farm to table\" approach. Furthermore, the Sakliky story will serve as an example that can be applied to many other staple foods, from bread and pasta to milk and tea. This will not only provide new income opportunities for our farmers but also pave the way for more nutritious food for our people. akmak also stated that this fortification study conducted with lker was carried out in light of the knowledge and experience gained from an international project led by Sabanci University, which ran for 12 years in 15 countries.</p><p>What is hidden hunger?</p><p>According to FAO, hidden hunger is a situation where people do not get enough of the essential vitamins and minerals needed for growth and development because the nutritional quality of the food they consume is inadequate. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/about/meetings/icn2/news-archive/news-detail/en/c/265240/\">https://www.fao.org/about/meetings/icn2/news-archive/news-detail/en/c/265240/</url></p><p>Sakliky Field Enriched Grain Biscuits are only available at Migros.</p><p>Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated</p><p>[Category: Packaged Foods &amp; Meats, Agricultural Products, Agriculture, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Yildiz Holding</p>", "publisher": "Contify Retail News", "instances": ["lker's limited number of Sakliky Field Enriched Cereal, Milk Chocolate, Rice Crisp, Orange and Coconut biscuits, produced with flour obtained from mineral-enriched wheat through field application, were offered to consumers. lker CEO zgr Klkfaki stated that the sustainability of wheat, which ranks first among the raw materials they use at 39%, is of great importance to lker.
