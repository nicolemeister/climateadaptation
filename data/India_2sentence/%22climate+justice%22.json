This year's theme- \"Strengthening Global Solidarity and Empowering Local Communities\"-feels especially urgent as Brazil prepares to host the 30th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in November 2025. The summit will address the global challenge of climate change, calling for stronger international cooperation while empowering local communities to build resilience.</p><p>The COP30 agenda will focus on six interconnected priorities. Energy, industry, and transport transition towards renewable sources; protection and restoration of ecosystems-forests, oceans, and biodiversity-while tackling deforestation; sustainable agriculture and resilient food systems with equitable food access; climate-resilient cities and infrastructure, including water management; human and social development to reduce climate change's social impacts and cross-cutting enablers such as climate finance and technology transfer.</p><p>The inter-linkage between these priorities is starkly evident in Kendrapada, Odisha, one of 11 Indian districts identified at \"Very High\" risk for both flood and drought in the District-level Climate Risk Assessment for India. Similar patterns of vulnerability exist across India and beyond.</p><p>In Kendrapada, coastal erosion forces families into nearby villages without adequate rehabilitation, or to migrate to far-off cities. Rehabilitation sites often flood during the monsoon, submerging roads and isolating homes. Many displaced families have not received compensation, leaving them without farmland, legal ownership of new homes, or access to forests and kitchen gardens they once relied on.</p><p>Each week, buses carry young migrants nearly 2,000 km to cities like Ernakulam, Kerala, where they work long hours for low wages and send meagre remittances home. The COVID-19 pandemic deepened this hardship-many lost jobs overnight, had no shelter, and walked home in desperation-only to return to the same urban precarity.</p><p>Deforestation is accelerating agricultural decline. Small farms are abandoned or absorbed into large farms, industrial projects, and infrastructure like the proposed Mahanadi Riverine Port, which will require 300 hectares of land. Disasters are becoming more frequent and intense, worsening ecological degradation. Villages with healthy mangrove cover, however, fared far better during Cyclone Dana (2024), underscoring the protective power of green infrastructure.</p><p>India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commit to reducing emissions intensity by 45 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving 50 per cent of installed power capacity from non-fossil sources. Yet without robust climate justice policies-focused on resilience, preparedness, and adequate loss-and-damage compensation-such achievements risk being unsustainable.</p><p>Insights from community consultations highlight several urgent priorities for negotiators at COP30. There is a pressing need to activate international climate finance for loss and damage in the most vulnerable regions and to expedite rehabilitation efforts. Climate action must recognise the interdependence of environmental, social, and economic issues, while placing people-particularly the poor and marginalised-at the centre of solutions. Local leadership should be elevated, with special emphasis on women as ecological defenders, acknowledging the critical value of the habitat services they safeguard. Disaster-affected communities require comprehensive compensation that includes sustainable livelihood support, alongside robust social security measures such as pensions, housing, healthcare, and employment guarantees for climate-affected informal workers, facilitated through worker support centres. Expanding green cover is equally vital, both to arrest coastal erosion and biodiversity loss and to strengthen natural defences against cyclones and floods. The establishment of climate commissions at both national and state levels with people's participation can facilitate the monitoring of climate action plans and ensure compliance from the private sector while addressing the concerns of affected community.</p><p>On this World Humanitarian Day, let us uphold the spirit of global solidarity and local empowerment-not just in words, but through concrete climate action. Let us honour humanitarian workers who have lost their lives in disaster and conflict response. And let us commit to protecting both vulnerable communities and the ecosystems they safeguard-before it is too late.</p><p>Debabrat Patra is Associate Director and Humanitarian Lead, ActionAid Association</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

On 23 July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN's principal judicial body, delivered its long-awaited (though non-binding) advisory opinion on climate change, transforming what was once considered policy discretion into a legal duty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recognising the grave and far-reaching impacts of climate change, the ICJ affirmed that states must treat it as an \"existential threat\", adopt targets of the \"highest possible ambition\", and cooperate to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5C goal. This historic moment followed a 2023 UN General Assembly request for the Court's guidance on two key questions: What legal obligations do states have to protect the climate system for present and future generations? And what are the legal consequences for states causing significant climate harm, especially to vulnerable small island nations?</p><p>The ICJ's advisory opinion is the result of years of advocacy led by visionary law students from Pacific Island nations who refused to let their futures sink in political inaction. In 2019, they convinced their governments to pursue an ICJ opinion on climate obligations. Vanuatu - a small, low-lying Pacific nation literally fighting for survival against rising seas - elevated their campaign globally, ultimately rallying 132 countries behind a historic UN General Assembly resolution. Adopted unanimously on 29 March 2023, it called on the ICJ to clarify states' legal duties in addressing the climate crisis.</p><p>The ICJ held public hearings from December 2 to 13, 2024 in The Hague, drawing unprecedented global engagement. By the March deadline 22, it had received 91 written statements - the most in its advisory history - along with 62 written comments and oral submissions from 96 states and 11 international organisations. Parallel to the proceedings, youth campaigners from the Pacific and beyond led powerful mobilisations, amplifying the voices of those most impacted and calling for urgent climate justice.</p><p>During the hearings, major polluters like the US, UK, Germany, and Russia sought to deflect responsibility - downplaying obligations, exaggerating complexities, and sidestepping their historical emissions. In contrast, small island states and other climate-vulnerable nations from the Global South invoked the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), arguing that developed countries - having contributed most to the climate crisis-must bear a greater share of the burden in mitigation and finance.</p><p>Acknowledging that rising temperatures are melting ice sheets and raising sea levels, the ICJ unanimously affirmed that states must \"take all necessary measures\" to prevent significant climate harm under international law. Crucially, it found that existing treaties - including the UN Charter and human rights covenants - implicitly require climate action, cutting off common excuses from laggard states. The Court also ruled that the Kyoto Protocol's emission targets (1997-2020) remain legally relevant despite the Paris Agreement, empowering vulnerable nations with new tools for litigation. States may now seek compensation for pre-2020 harms, anchoring a 30-year continuum of responsibility - from Kyoto to Paris to the present.</p><p>The ICJ held that the duty to prevent environmental harm - first articulated in its Nuclear Weapons opinion - extends beyond direct cross-border damage to encompass global threats like climate change. This duty requires \"stringent\" due diligence and \"heightened vigilance\", tailored to each state's context and the scale of risk. In the face of escalating climate dangers, the obligation intensifies: it is not enough to adopt laws - states must enforce them rigorously and consistently.</p><p>The ICJ reaffirmed the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\", recognising that climate obligations must reflect historical emissions and present capacities. While it did not create new legal duties, this principle offers a vital lens for interpreting existing law. Crucially, the Court stressed that uncertainty cannot justify delaying urgent climate action.</p><p>Though the ICJ did not impose penalties, it made clear that breaches of climate obligations carry serious legal consequences - from halting harmful practices and ensuring non-repetition to mandatory emission cuts and reparations. Failure to meet Paris commitments or regulate emissions now constitutes an \"internationally wrongful act\", even if the damage is not immediately visible.</p><p>The ICJ's ruling signals a new era of climate justice, placing the prospect of climate reparations firmly on the horizon. While measuring damages remains complex, the decision opens legal pathways - from ecological restoration and financial compensation to court-ordered emission cuts and climate restitution funds. States may also seek symbolic remedies, such as mandatory apologies or compelling fossil fuel companies to fund public climate education. The framework redefines accountability, merging legal, financial, and moral dimensions of redress.</p><p>Alongside recent advisory opinions from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (July 3, 2025) and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (May 21, 2024), the ICJ's opinion marks a pivotal moment in defining states' climate obligations under international law. Though non-binding, these rulings are far from symbolic - they could shift the legal landscape from voluntary pledges to enforceable duties. They offer vulnerable nations a framework to demand accountability and provide climate advocates with fresh legal tools. These are not mere legal texts; they are signals of hope for climate justice.</p><p>Yet key questions remain. Will major emitters respect these obligations, or continue to hide behind legal ambiguity? Can small and vulnerable states marshal the resources to pursue claims against powerful polluters? The opinion arms the climate justice movement with strong legal arguments, but their impact now depends on political will, judicial creativity, and global pressure.

Historically, this day has focused on legal rights, social equity, and political freedoms. However, in the contemporary world today, increasingly influenced by the effects of climate change, it is time to expand the meaning of justice to one of the most urgent and yet frequently neglected elements - climate justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The repercussions of climate change are no longer mere future threats. Catastrophic heatwaves, floods, droughts, forest fires, and intense storms and cyclones have become more frequent and destructive. These calamities result in loss and devastation, but they also reveal a more profound injustice: the unequal impact on different populations. The most impoverished and vulnerable - those who have contributed the least to global warming - are the ones who bear the brunt of these effects. Communities in developing nations, small island nations, indigenous groups, and marginalised populations are losing their homes, livelihoods, and even their lives. Furthermore, they often lack the necessary resources or systems to recover and adapt.</p><p>This is why climate justice matters. It is not just merely reducing carbon emissions or transitioning to renewable energy sources. It is fundamentally about equity. While climate change represents a global crisis, its burdens are not distributed evenly. Climate justice insists that those who have historically contributed the most to pollution must assume greater responsibility, while those who are most at risk should receive the necessary support to endure, rebuild, and flourish. It also emphasises that low-income communities and people of colour - both in developing and developed nations - are disproportionately affected by climate change, despite having played a minimal role in its causation.</p><p>Climate justice necessitates solutions that extend beyond mere environmental policies; it must address the social, economic, and racial disparities that render communities more vulnerable to climate shocks. This approach emphasises placing individuals at the core of climate initiatives, ensuring that no one is overlooked.</p><p>Acknowledging the significance and moral imperative of climate justice, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his speech at the BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 7, 2025, firmly reiterated India's dedication to this cause. He proclaimed that for India, climate justice is no alternative but a moral duty. He emphasised that climate action should be driven by compassion, equity, and accountability. Drawing inspiration from India's ancient principles that honour nature as sacred, the Prime Minister reminded the global community that safeguarding the environment is integral to the nation's cultural and ethical identity. He underscored that India's approach to climate issues is centred on people and seeks to maintain a balance between advancement and conservation, growth and accountability.</p><p>The Prime Minister's remarks are particularly timely as the world gears up for COP-30, the international climate summit scheduled to take place later this year in Brazil. While agreements such as the Paris Climate Accord establish clear objectives, the reality is that numerous commitments remain unfulfilled, particularly regarding assistance for developing nations to adapt. A major shortcoming lies in climate finance. Wealthier nations had pledged to allocate $100 billion annually to aid developing countries. However, this promise has largely gone unfulfilled. For many nations, this represents not just a lack of funding - it signifies a deficit in justice. Without accessible financing, poorer countries are unable to develop clean energy infrastructures, invest in climate-resilient facilities, or recover from disasters. Fulfilling this commitment is not an act of benevolence - it is a responsibility.</p><p>Technology represents another vital element. Clean and green technologies - such as solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, and climate-resilient crops - are frequently costly and inaccessible for numerous countries that require them the most. Prime Minister Modi appropriately highlighted that access to these technologies must be equitable and inclusive. In the absence of this, the fight against climate change will remain one-sided and ineffective.</p><p>Another important aspect of climate change is the recognition of loss and damage. Certain climate impacts are irreversible - rising sea levels, lost homes, and ruined harvests constitute permanent losses. The establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund at the last climate summit was a positive development, yet genuine progress will necessitate making it fully functional and readily available to the nations and individuals who need it the most.</p><p>India, as a leading developing country, has undertaken bold and significant actions regarding climate initiatives, both domestically and internationally. The Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) encourages sustainable practices in daily life - such as conserving electricity, minimising plastic consumption, and preserving water - empowering individuals to become advocates for climate action. Additionally, India has spearheaded the formation of global collaborations like the International Solar Alliance, which facilitates clean energy access in developing countries, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which assists nations in constructing infrastructure capable of withstanding natural disasters. Over the past decade, India has augmented its solar capacity by 4000 percent and has met its Paris climate commitments ahead of schedule. With a long-term objective of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, India continues to demonstrate that responsible growth is achievable.</p><p>The Prime Minister also connected climate justice with public health, emphasising that \"viruses do not require passports\" and that global health systems should be inclusive and equitable. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that disparities in health infrastructure can exacerbate the effects of global crises. India's One Earth, One Health initiative, its digital health systems, and the Ayushman Bharat scheme - the largest health insurance programme in the world - provide examples of how to integrate environmental and health justice.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, when India will take on the presidency of BRICS, the Prime Minister reiterated that the voices and concerns of the Global South will remain paramount. He suggested reimagining BRICS as a platform for Building Resilience, Innovation, Cooperation, and Sustainability, adopting a people-first approach that connects ambition with action, technology with equity, and policy with progress.</p><p>On this International Day of Justice, the world must redefine the true meaning of justice. It encompasses not only legal systems and human rights but also the right to a safe, clean, and secure environment. A child born in a Himalayan village, a Pacific island, or an African desert should have the same entitlement to breathe clean air, drink safe water, and live free from the fear of climate disasters as a child in the wealthiest cities.</p><p>Climate justice is no longer optional - it is essential. It serves as the link between survival and dignity, between commitments and fulfilment. As citizens, we must advocate for just and sustainable policies. As nations, we must forge partnerships grounded in trust and equity. And as a global community, we must ensure that climate action includes everyone, leaves no one behind, and delivers justice to all.</p><p>On this International Justice Day, let us remember that real justice cannot be achieved without climate justice. The time to act is now. The world must rise to this moral call with urgency, compassion, and determination.</p><p>(Satendra Singh is Former Executive Director, National Institute of Disaster Management and Tanushree is Doctoral Fellow at Amity University, Gurugram.)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Hailed globally as historic, a landmark, and a watershed, it recognised that continuing fossil consumption, production, and exploration was harmful and endorsed the view that states could seek action and reparation over climate damages.</p><p><br/><br/>The ICJ called on states to not only fulfil their obligations under the Paris Agreement but to apply stringent due diligence standards in formulating their national targets, which have to constitute the highest possible ambition, under the Nationally Determined Contributions. Importantly, it stated that the failure of the state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions through continuing use of fossil fuels, granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses, or the provision of subsidies may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is liable to be compensated. Significantly, the advisory opinion said that climate harm can be addressed under customary laws as well as the UN human rights law,\u00a0the biodiversity and desertification conventions, and was not constrained by climate treaties alone, as argued by some of the chief polluting countries during the hearings at the ICJ.<br/><br/>The long-anticipated opinion came seven months after over 100 countries and organisations made oral and written presentations in a fortnight-long hearing in December 2024 at the Peace Palace. The campaign for this advisory opinion began six years\u00a0ago, in a classroom in Emalus, Vanuatu, and 29-year-old Vishal Prasad, campaign director at the Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said\u00a0young people dared to take on the impossible\u2014taking \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest problem to the world\u2019s highest court\u201d. This germ of an idea in a law university led to mobilising over 1,700 civil society organisations globally, led by Vanuatu and other Pacific Island nations, to demand climate justice and\u00a0present oral and written testimonies to the court.<br/><br/>In his testimony to the ICJ, Prasad,\u00a0who emerged as a global youth leader, narrated stories of devastation and loss to drive home the point of a grave imbalance among the countries that suffered devastation and those who perpetrated climate harm. Prasad told the Court about women in Tuvalu who recounted\u00a0harrowing experiences of graves being unearthed by coastal erosion, and of mothers who cried out to the moana [ocean] searching for their children.\u00a0He quoted Isabella Teuea from Kiribati, who said,\u00a0\u201cThe ocean, once a nurturing mother, has become a vengeful giant, swallowing the land it once cradled. It no longer only gives life\u2014it now takes it, inch by inch.\u201d<br/><br/>Also Read | The solution to climate anxiety is climate action: Jagadish Shukla<br/><br/>These voices and testimonies paved the way for the ICJ to word the climate threat as an existential crisis facing the planet\u2014and a self-inflicted one at that\u2014which needs to be redressed with due diligence and strong climate targets. The presiding judge of the ICJ, Iwasawa Yuji, who read out the opinion, described climate change as a concern of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life. It was no longer possible to merely set targets for the sake of meeting obligations but to ensure that climate harm is mitigated, he said.<br/><br/>After the opinion, governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities, said Prasad. Apart from the world\u2019s smallest countries making history, he said: \u201cThe opinion affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\u201d<br/><br/>Countries of the South Pacific that contribute minuscule amounts of greenhouse gas emissions are battered by storms and cyclones, which wreck lives and livelihoods, as Prasad testified. The government of Vanuatu said that despite emitting less than 0.02 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, the Pacific islands face the brunt of the impact of rising sea levels. Their average elevation above the waves is between 1 and 2 metres, and 90 per cent of the islands\u2019 population lives within 5 km of the coastline. Vanuatu is projected to lose 25 per cent of its GDP every year due to climate disasters.<br/><br/>The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), which engaged in the ICJ process through\u00a0legal submissions and by providing various inputs, applauded the court\u2019s historic affirmation, which declares the era of fossil fuel impunity over and sets a new global standard for urgent action and accountability on climate justice.\u00a0Importantly, CIEL noted that the Court defined what justice means in the face of climate breakdown while ruling that countries must act with urgency, cooperate in good faith, and repair the damage already done. In doing so, the Court has set the stage for accountability and real action worldwide.<br/><br/>While the advisory opinion is not binding, it constitutes authoritative statements of binding international law and carries substantial legal weight. This opinion will guide climate litigation at the local, regional, and national courts, and provide a foundation for climate policymaking, grounding local legislation and global negotiations in legal obligation, CIEL pointed out. Rebecca Brown,\u00a0CIEL\u00a0president and CEO, said the ruling represents a groundbreaking legal decision in reaffirming the role of international law and global governance in demanding climate justice.<br/><br/>The case before the ICJ must rank among the biggest in human history, with 96 states and 11 intergovernmental organisations making presentations. These proceedings were held in the wake of the failure of the climate summit at Baku to advance the cause of climate justice with poor commitments on finance or any serious ambitions to reduce the use of fossil fuels. The hope that the annual UN climate summit would deliver any concrete plan with financial backing and ambition has faded over the years, and Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s climate envoy, was not optimistic about any positive outcomes from that quarter. For him, the ICJ advisory opinion was on unexpected lines as it identified those committing climate harm as offenders who can be legally prosecuted and took a position on the continuing use, exploration, and production of fossil fuels.<br/><br/>The global campaign for climate justice led to the United Nations requesting the ICJ\u2019s advisory opinion on two key questions in 2023, namely, \u201cWhat are the obligations of States under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generations; (b) What are the legal consequences under these obligations for States where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to: (i) States, including, in particular, small island developing States, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change? (ii) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change?\u201d1<br/><br/>Also Read | Frontline Explains: India\u2019s climate emergency<br/><br/>Twenty days before the ICJ opinion, on July 3, 2025, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued a significant advisory opinion affirming that\u00a0states and corporations have binding legal obligations to address the climate crisis as a human rights emergency, according to CIEL. This advisory opinion was requested by the governments of Chile and Colombia, which also declared the climate crisis a human rights emergency, threatening life, dignity, and democracy itself, and dwelt on the responsibility of states to prevent irreversible environmental harm. It blamed the continuing use of fossil fuels and called on states to regulate its use.<br/><br/>According to the Vanuatu Climate Diplomacy Program, the ICJ is one of three international tribunals that were asked to issue guidance on states\u2019 legal obligations to address climate change. In May 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea delivered the first-ever\u00a0advisory opinion on climate from an international court, which stated that countries must cut greenhouse gas emissions to protect the oceans.2\u00a0All these opinions set the bar for future court judgments and policy decisions on climate action. It remains to be seen how the climate negotiations are impacted by these significant advisory opinions and whether the historically polluting countries are prompted to reduce or more importantly pay for \u00a0their climate damage.<br/><br/>Meena Menon is a freelance journalist and visiting postdoctoral fellow at Leeds Arts and Humanities Research Institute, University of Leeds.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Frontline", "instances": ["The long-anticipated opinion came seven months after over 100 countries and organisations made oral and written presentations in a fortnight-long hearing in December 2024 at the Peace Palace.

The legal questions posed before the ICJ reflect the collective anxiety of a planet grappling with existential threats posed by climate change. For major maritime nations like India, and other developing nations including the low-lying island-states, this moment is critical in shaping a survival strategy. Furthermore, delivering a futuristic legal judgment that will re-define the future of international climate governance on today\u2019s commitment. Key questions before the ICJ include:</p><p><br/><br/>What are states\u2019\u00a0obligations under international law to protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions for present and future generations?<br/><br/>What are the legal\u00a0consequences for states that have significantly harmed the climate system, particularly affecting the small island developing states? Over 90 states and organisations participated in the proceedings submitting written statements. India clearly emphasised its commitment towards climate action while asserting its sovereign right to development and the need for continued fossil fuel subsidies for ensuring energy security and sustainability (ICJ AOP India, 2024).<br/><br/>A similar advisory opinion on climate change delivered by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) (Case No. 31) emphasises the importance of robust emissions reduction policies, environmental impact assessments, and international cooperation. However, it did not address state\u2019s responsibility for climate change impacts (ITLOS AO, 2024).<br/><br/>For small island developing states, these advisory opinions are important for their development and survival. Facing existential threats from rising sea levels, they seek legal recognition of the disproportionate harm they suffer.<br/><br/>The ITLOS and ICJ\u2019s opinion will influence future climate litigation and policy. Though non-binding, they will shape the discourse on global climate governance, setting precedents for international cooperation, accountability, and respect for sovereign rights.

With the visionary announcement by Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah to institutionalise three new Multistate Cooperative Societies for cow dung management, carbon credit valuation and compressed biogas (CBG) production within the cooperative framework, India has moved beyond mere climate rhetoric. We are entering an era of grassroots-led green revolution, and this time, it is not about food alone, it is about energy, ecology, and equity.</p><p>This bold shift isn't just administrative, it is civilisational. It marks a new model for climate governance rooted in the soil of Bharat, powered by its villages, and held together by the time-tested values of Sahuarita (cooperation). For decades, the climate debate was dominated by distant capitals, high-level negotiations, and top-down frameworks. But India has flipped the script. Through the Cooperative Economic Framework, we are building a decentralised climate economy from the ground up, starting from Primary Agricultural Co-op Societies (PACS) and scaling to national-level apex cooperative institutions. This isn't just a new economic model, it is a new democratic environmentalism, where the farmer becomes the financier of a greener future, and the village becomes the vanguard of net-zero ambition.</p><p>Every PACS has a potential climate command centre. These grassroots institutions, long associated, are now being repositioned as gateways to carbon markets and bio-energy hubs.</p><p>Imagine decentralised biogas sprouting in every block, feeding clean energy into the rural economy, generating carbon credits that can be monetised globally, and creating a new stream of income for farmers, especially in rain-fed, tribal, and hilly regions. From the cow shed to the carbon exchange, the entire value chain can now be organised, monitored, and scaled through the cooperative economic framework.</p><p>Integral to this transformation is the restructuring of rural resource cycles, especially around fodder management, water governance, and dead cattle economics. Millions of farmers struggle due to erratic fodder availability and mismanaged water resources, which in turn affect livestock productivity and rural resilience. Simultaneously, dead cattle markets, often a source of environmental decay and social tension, remain underutilised economic zones. By creating a multistate cooperative dedicated to integrated livestock resource management, India can formalise and monetise these neglected rural streams. Fodder banks, decentralised water recharge systems, and organised carcass processing units can provide dignified employment, biofertilizers, organic leather, and feedstock for CBG plants. Such a cooperative would not only uplift rural livelihoods but create a closed-loop bio-economy - fueling agriculture, improving nutrition, restoring ecology, and generating revenue across multiple layers of rural society. It is not merely a reform - it is a rural renaissance waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>And the beauty of this approach lies in its inclusivity. The PACS-to-Apex structure ensures that no region is left behind - not the snowbound villages of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, not the fragile communities of the Northeast, and certainly not the border settlements of Ladakh or Arunachal. In these places, traditional economic activities are constrained by geography, but the bioeconomy of cow dung and carbon offers a rare opportunity - one that aligns with the region's cultural values, ecological needs, and national priorities. When farmers in these areas gain the ability to generate income from climate stewardship, they are not just contributing to GDP - they are also strengthening national security. A prosperous border village is a stable border village. When livelihoods are secure, migration is reduced, local pride is restored, and external threats are diminished. The World Cooperation Economic Framework offers the architecture to take this model to scale. It ensures that financing, training, policy guidance, and market access do not remain siloed. It connects the micro to the macro. It allows the smallest PACS in a tribal hamlet to link with global climate finance and ESG funds. It transforms cow dung - a symbol of rural India's ignored potential - into a goldmine for clean energy, carbon credits, organic farming, and rural employment. Through this, India isn't just creating a circular economy - it is building a circular civilisation.</p><p>This is more than a Government scheme - it is a spiritual call to action. A call to revive our ancient ethos of living in harmony with nature now rearmed with modern science, blockchain traceability, and global carbon accounting. It is a call to stand tall on the world stage - not as climate victims begging for compensation, but as climate victors offering solutions. This is our surgical strike - not through bullets, but through biogas, not with missiles, but with methane management, not by harming - but by healing the Earth through cooperation.</p><p>We are witnessing a new economic independence movement - this time against carbon dependency and global climate injustice. As the world watches, India rises. And it rises not from the skyscrapers, but from its soil, its villages, and its unyielding cooperative spirit.From Sahkarita se Samriddhi to Sahkarita se Sanrakshan, the cooperative model is no longer just about managing credit - it is now India's frontline defence in the fight for global climate equity and national unity.</p><p>Let the world take note \"When Bharat's villages rise, the Earth heals - and the Nation stands stronger\". Let us remember that this journey is not just economic or environmental; it is deeply spiritual. This is the Vedic economics meeting of 21st-century governance. This is Yajna - a collective</p><p>sacrifice and contribution, where every farmer, every cow, every drop of water, and every seed of cooperation becomes part of a sacred offering to protect the Earth and uplift the Nation.</p><p>Let the world understand this clearly, India's climate action is not born of compulsion, but of conviction rooted in consciousness. And as Bharat's villages rise once again in the light of Sahkarita, the prayers of our ancestor's echo in unison,May all be happy, may all be healthy, may all see auspiciousness, and may none suffer.\" This is the dharma of cooperation.

He questioned whether the environment department or allied agencies had ever carried out comprehensive surveys to safeguard pilgrimage routes and shrine areas frequented by thousands of devotees each year.</p><p>While praising the volunteers and local communities for their \"heroic role\" during rescue efforts, Tarigami demanded a time-bound probe into the disaster. He accused authorities of negligence, pointing out that precautionary measures were not taken despite advance warnings of heavy rainfall and possible cloudbursts by the Meteorological Department.</p><p>The senior leader stressed that disasters were being aggravated by rampant deforestation, unregulated stone crushing, and unchecked commercialization of land.

Citing frequent cloudbursts in Pahalgam, Bandipora, Shangus and Ladakh, he said nature itself was \"crying out for justice.\"</p><p>Tarigami urged the government to involve local communities, NGOs and activists in shaping climate adaptation policies.

They grow crops, store carbon, filter water and sustain wildlife. Yet a major global study has found that soil health research is concentrated in a handful of nations, while the countries most at risk from degradation receive the least scientific attention.</p><p><br/><br/>Researchers from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and international collaborators analysed 31,999 scientific papers published between 1947 and 2024 on soil health and quality.<br/><br/>Their findings, published in the journal\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Communications Earth &amp; Environment</emphasis>\u00a0on August 9, 2025, reveal that just 10 countries account for 70 per cent of all global soil health research, with China, the United States, India, Brazil and Spain topping the list.<br/><br/>By contrast, vast swathes of Africa, south-east Asia, central and South America (excluding Brazil) and the Middle East remain \u201cblind spots\u201d for soil science.<br/>Global research concentrated in a handful of nations<br/>These regions are home to millions of farmers and rich biodiversity but face severe threats, including deforestation, erosion, nutrient loss and climate change. Without robust local research, they cannot develop soil management strategies suited to their conditions.<br/><br/>The gaps become even clearer when you look through a climate justice lens. Many neglected regions of Africa and Asia have extremely low per capita food-related carbon footprints.<br/><br/>Sub-Saharan African countries, for example, produce only a fraction of the emissions of high-income nations, yet suffer some of the highest land-use change emissions from deforestation and farmland expansion.<br/><br/>In southeast Asia, rapid forest loss in Indonesia, Myanmar and Cambodia is releasing huge quantities of carbon from soils, despite these countries having little historical responsibility for global warming. These same regions also have the lowest capacity for soil research, with few dedicated institutions and limited funding.<br/>Climate justice blind spots<br/>Many of these neglected areas are among the world\u2019s most important biodiversity hotspots. In the Amazon basin outside Brazil, soil ecosystems are barely studied, even as deforestation accelerates in parts of Peru and Bolivia.<br/><br/>In sub-Saharan Africa, countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Cameroon have unique tropical soils that support rare species, but there is little scientific data on them.<br/><br/>The lack of research poses a clear danger to food security. The steepest declines in crop yields from rising temperatures are expected in Africa, south-east Asia and Latin America, precisely the places with the least soil data.<br/><br/>In south-east Asia, tropical peat soils in Malaysia and Indonesia, home to specialised microbial and plant communities, are being degraded by oil palm plantations. Once lost, the carbon and biodiversity stored in these soils are extremely difficult to restore.<br/><br/>Soil health research has expanded rapidly \u2014 more than half of all papers have been published in the past five years \u2014 but most focus on increasing crop yields through chemical and physical interventions.<br/><br/>Only 40 per cent of studies link soil health to global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and food insecurity. This policy gap is evident in countries like India, where much research centres on boosting yields with fertilisers, but far fewer studies examine long-term soil carbon storage or biodiversity impacts.<br/><br/>In China, large datasets exist on soil nutrients, yet relatively few papers connect these findings to climate adaptation or ecological restoration strategies. The authors warned that such disconnects make it harder for governments to use science to meet the United Nations-mandated Sustainable Development Goals.<br/><br/>Many of these regions also have abandoned croplands, left fallow due to poor soil and rural poverty. Restoring these lands could increase food supply and cut greenhouse gas emissions, but doing so requires detailed local soil knowledge.<br/><br/>The lack of research poses a clear danger to food security.

Restoring these lands could increase food supply and cut greenhouse gas emissions, but doing so requires detailed local soil knowledge.<br/>Bridging the gap with affordable tools<br/>The study pointed to affordable technologies that could help fill the gap. In Brazil, the SOHMA KIT developed at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, lets farmers measure seven key soil health indicators, including pH, organic matter and microbial activity, directly on their farms.<br/><br/>In the Netherlands, the Open Soil Index uses simple farm data, such as crop history and basic soil tests, to generate a soil health score and practical advice. These portable, low-cost tools are especially suited to smallholder farmers in areas without advanced laboratories.<br/><br/>The paper noted that such models could be adapted for Africa and south-east Asia to rapidly expand soil monitoring. Some initiatives are already under way. The Global Soil Partnership brings together governments, research institutes and communities to share data and practices.<br/><br/>The\u00a0Living Soils of the Americas project, led by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture and Ohio State University, has been expanded to Africa in partnership with the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.

This followed a case brought by Vanuatu, a tiny South Pacific island nation threatened by rising sea levels, supported by 131 other countries - the biggest case the court had ever heard. The opinion sets out what all governments need to do to limit greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further global warming. Climate law specialist Zunaida Moosa Wadiwala explains how the advisory opinion sets a powerful precedent for global climate accountability.</p><p>What did the International Court of Justice find?</p><p>The court's advisory opinion confirmed that states have binding obligations under international law to protect the climate from human-caused climate change.</p><p>Judge Dire Tladi, also the first ever South African judge at the International Court of Justice, described this as one of the most consequential matters ever brought before the court. He emphasised that climate change is an existential crisis that potentially threatens the future of humanity.</p><p>Read more: Historic ruling finds climate change 'imperils all forms of life' and puts laggard nations on notice</p><p>Unanimously, the court issued the opinion that States have binding legal obligations to prevent further global warming. These obligations are grounded in climate treaties, international human rights law and customary international law. They are also grounded in global agreements to protect specific parts of the environment (like the Ozone Convention, Biodiversity Convention, Desertification Convention, and the United Nations law of the sea).</p><p>The advisory opinion said governments must take appropriate measures to prevent environmental harm. This means that states are obliged to implement programmes to adapt their countries to climate change. They also need to show that they are reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Read more: Historic climate change advisory: what the case before the International Court of Justice might mean</p><p>The court also stated that breaching these obligations is an internationally wrongful act. As such, the government responsible will have to stop the harmful conduct. They'll also need to guarantee that they'll never repeat the wrongful act and make full reparation to whoever was affected.</p><p>The advisory opinion is poised to reshape international climate litigation and domestic policy.</p><p>Is this a victory for African nations who provided evidence?</p><p>Yes. Kenya, Ghana, Madagascar, South Africa, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Mauritius, Burkina Faso, and Egypt made submissions about climate change damage. The Court accepted their arguments that developing countries have contributed minimally to greenhouse gas emissions globally, yet suffer the effects of climate change more than developed nations.</p><p>The advisory opinion also highlighted that a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is necessary if people are to enjoy their rights to access to water, food and housing. These were key issues raised by African States.</p><p>Read more: Climate justice for Africa: 3 legal routes for countries that suffer the most harm</p><p>The court also specifically responded to the arguments of African nations by affirming that developed countries must support developing States to adapt to climate change. Developed States are obliged to provide financial support, make new adaptation technologies available and assist vulnerable nations to build capacity to cope with global warming.</p><p>The Court endorsed a rights-based approach, particularly the rights to life, health and a clean, sustainable environment and said climate change obligations are erga omnes (a responsibility for all States). This also vindicates African nations longstanding calls for climate justice, legal clarity and recognition of the unequal burden they bear.</p><p>Will it help African countries sue for reparations for climate damage they didn't cause?</p><p>Yes. African countries now have tools to pursue reparations for climate-related harm. They will need to establish causation between the wrongful act of one or more states and damage suffered. In other words, they will need to prove that the damage was factually and legally caused by a certain country or countries.</p><p>One challenge in enforcing this is that the International Court of Justice does not issue binding judgements in advisory opinions. So, to claim reparations, African states would need to initiate contentious proceedings in the court against high-emitting countries. The consent of the countries concerned, indicating their acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is required.</p><p>Given the global and cumulative nature of emissions, causation and damages are complex. It could be difficult to prove that specific damages, such as floods, mudslides, drought and heatwaves, are caused by one or more specific countries.</p><p>Read more: Polluters must pay: how COP29 can make this a reality</p><p>Another option for affected countries is domestic or transnational climate litigation. This means that countries affected by climate-caused disasters could sue fossil fuel companies in foreign courts.</p><p>The International Court of Justice advisory opinion is strong backing for arguments based on the law of delict (tort). This is where a wrongful act causes damage for which the person harmed can claim compensation. The opinion also backs arguments that greenhouse gas emissions amount legally to nuisance (interference with the use and enjoyments of another's property) and or unjust enrichment (when one person unfairly benefits at the expense of another).</p><p>What does this mean for African countries still exploring for - and using - fossil fuels?</p><p>The advisory opinion is very specific on how fossil fuels like gas, oil and coal must be approached. It says that if a State continues fossil fuel extraction, and fails to take appropriate climate action, it may be violating international law. Continuing to produce and consume fuels, giving out licences to mining companies to explore for fossil fuels and subsidising the fossil fuel industry may also violate international law.</p><p>Within the context of State responsibility, this has serious legal implications for the 48 African countries who are still involved in these fossil fuel activities.</p><p>Read more: Fossil fuels are still subsidised: G20 could push for the funds to be shifted to cleaner energy</p><p>The advisory opinion has placed these countries at a crossroads. They cannot advocate for climate justice abroad whilst expanding fossil fuels at home. A State could also be held responsible for not passing regulations to limit emissions caused by private companies under its jurisdiction.</p><p>This is a step forward. For example, in South African climate cases that have already been ruled on, they mainly relied on procedural, constitutional or climate risk-based legal strategies. In other words, they argued that communities had not been consulted properly before a coal mine licence was granted, or that the mine would interfere with the human right to water.</p><p>But now, fossil fuel activities themselves are restricted.</p><p>Read more: South African court said no to new coal-fired power: what's behind the ruling</p><p>In South Africa, this is aligned with the Climate Change Act.

He is abstaining from meat this year. \"Considering that meat production causes 43 percent of the food industry's greenhouse gas emissions, that's a significant aspect and an important contribution we can make in this direction,\" the State Councilor stated.</p><p>\"There are so many ways we can make a positive contribution through fasting,\" emphasized Deputy Governor Haider-Wallner. \"If we consciously avoid eating meat for a few weeks and buy local food, it reduces our CO2 emissions, and in South America, less land is cleared for animal feed. Thus, our local actions have an impact all the way to Colombia and the rest of the world. It's much easier for us to act than for these women in Colombia.

Sapan recently organised an online discussion event \u2018Beyond COP 29: Southasia\u2019s climate challenges \u2013 a call for Southasian solidarity\u2019, which unanimously endorsed a resolution in solidarity with the people of the region seeking relief and justice from the adverse impacts of climate change. Sapan passed a resolution calling for the $300 billion per year falls short of $1.3 trillion needed, shared solutions for floods, heatwaves and polluters must honour commitments to support Southasia\u2019 transition to clean energy. </p><p> The Resolution noted that Southasia, home to a quarter of the globe\u2019s population, faces disproportionate climate shocks, including rising sea levels, devastating floods, heatwaves, and droughts. Despite being one of the most vulnerable regions, Southasia bears an inequitable share of the costs of climate mitigation and adaptation. Sapan called on historical emitters to fulfil their equity-based commitments for emissions cuts and provide adequate financing for vulnerable regions like Southasia, declared the resolution. The 29th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP, agreed in November to deliver at least $300 billion per year by 2035 to developing and vulnerable countries, a climate financing target that is three times more than the $100 billion-per-year goal countries first set 15 years ago, but far less than the $1.3 trillion per year that the vulnerable countries have sought. Sapan also urged regional stakeholders to adopt a collaborative transboundary approach to address shared challenges like air and water pollution, ensuring climate justice through collective action, says the resolution, urging regional stakeholders to embrace collaborative solutions for issues like air and water pollution, floods, and heatwaves. To this region climate change is not only a future threat, the devastating impacts to lives, livestock, infrastructure, economy, and habitat are in keeping with the triple planetary crisis.  The developing and underdeveloped countries of the region are disproportionately burdened with the cost of dealing with these impacts. Given the environmental and financial challenges faced by South Asia, Sapan calls upon the polluters, the historical emitters and perpetrators of climate change, to make good on their emissions cut commitments, based on equity and fair shares.  Experts have shown that this goal can be met without requiring any significant additional budgetary allocation from developed nations, beyond their already pledged increases. Sapan calls upon governments to negotiate an equitable access to finances and technology to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives.  Since climate change knows no borders, shared solutions to shared problems will have to be worked out by taking a regional cooperative, collaborative approach. This includes issues related to climate change, like floods and heatwaves, as well as environmental pollution in the water bodies and air pollution. Sapan called on the governments and people of the region to work towards soft borders, engage in economic cooperation, knowledge and technical skills sharing and collaboration on all issues including climate change.

The Global South, which represents much of the developing world, is facing disproportionate climate-related challenges despite being historically responsible for a relatively small portion of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet they are being drawn into crafting solutions that are equitable, sustainable, and impactful for global climate policy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Global South - encompassing regions like Africa, Latin America, South and Southeast Asia, and small island nations - is home to some of the most vulnerable populations when it comes to the effects of climate change. COP29 provides a critical platform for these countries to influence the global climate agenda. Here is an assertive agenda for the Global South when the summit opens on November 11 in Baku, Azerbaijan.</p><p>Assert the climate justice narrative: It is time to place climate justice at the forefront of the agenda. Historically, the majority of carbon emissions have come from developed countries, but the consequences disproportionately affect developing nations. A 2021 study by Oxfam revealed that the wealthiest 10% of the global population are responsible for over 50% of emissions, while the poorest 50% contribute less than 10%. This inequality in responsibility should be emphasised to ensure that the burden of mitigation and adaptation does not fall unduly on the most vulnerable.</p><p>It's also time to call for a recognition of these inequalities in climate action. This means ensuring that developed nations live up to their financial commitments, including the $100 billion per year in climate finance that was promised under the Paris Agreement. In 2023, reports indicated that this target had still not been fully met. The Global South must push for clear pathways to secure this finance, including mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in climate finance flows.</p><p>Enhance climate diplomacy through regional blocs: The power of collective action through regional blocs like the African Union, the Caribbean Community, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is critical.</p><p>At COP29, the Global South should use these platforms to negotiate the following with a united voice, which will amplify their bargaining power:</p><p>Shared climate adaptation plans such as creating cross-border systems for early warning and disaster response.</p><p>Common positions on climate finance to ensure that the funds are accessible and address regional priorities.</p><p>Joint advocacy for loss and damage, building on the landmark decision made at COP27 to establish a fund for vulnerable countries. This must have clear governance structures and funding streams.</p><p>Strengthen nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with local adaptation: A key commitment under the Paris Agreement is the submission of NDCs, which are national plans outlining climate actions. The Global South must ensure that their NDCs are ambitious and grounded in sustainable local realities. For instance, several African nations have committed to increasing their renewable energy capacities, with Kenya and Ethiopia leading the way in wind, solar, and geothermal energy production. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Kenya generated over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2022.</p><p>In the Global South, sustainable agriculture and water management are other critical areas for adaptation. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization highlights that climate-resilient agriculture could improve yields by up to 30% by 2030, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Include these data-driven adaptations in their NDCs, backed by clear funding mechanisms.</p><p>Leverage green finance and investment: Accessing finance for climate mitigation and adaptation is a big challenge for Global South. The developed world has not met its promised climate finance targets, and much of the money that has been pledged remains inaccessible due to bureaucratic hurdles. The Global South should look towards diversifying its sources of finance by tapping into green bonds, carbon markets, and private investment in renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>South Africa's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, supported by a multi-billion-dollar international investment, aims to transition the country away from coal to renewable energy. Such a plan could be a model for others in the Global South. According to the World Bank, the global market for green bonds exceeded $1 trillion in 2023, signalling a growing appetite for climate-friendly investments. Explore mechanisms to attract this type of capital to finance projects like clean energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable agriculture.</p><p>Harness technology: Technology transfer is a critical issue, particularly when it comes to renewable energy and early warning systems for natural disasters. Developed countries must honour their commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Technology Mechanism to support developing nations in acquiring clean technologies. However, the Global South should also take proactive steps to harness indigenous technologies and knowledge systems that have proven effective in addressing climate challenges. For example, water harvesting techniques that have been used for centuries in arid regions like Rajasthan and the Sahel in Africa can be scaled up.</p><p>The Global South must take advantage of the digital revolution to better monitor climate risks and manage resources. Satellite technology, mobile applications for farmers, and artificial intelligence-driven climate models are all critical tools. Governments should invest in technological infrastructure that facilitates climate adaptation.</p><p>Promote South-South cooperation: While global North-South cooperation remains essential, developing nations should also deepen South-South cooperation. These partnerships have the potential to be transformative, enabling shared expertise, technologies, and financial resources. Brazil has been a global leader in sustainable agriculture and biofuels, and its innovations in these fields can be shared with other developing nations. Similarly, China has made significant investments in solar technology, which could be transferred to African nations looking to diversify their energy mix.</p><p>The Global South should push for the creation of more robust frameworks for South-South cooperation on climate action at the COP29 - joint funding mechanisms, technology-sharing platforms, and the exchange of best practices in climate adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>For the Global South, COP29 represents a crucial opportunity to not only call for climate justice but also assert leadership in shaping the global climate response.

Assam is known for its biodiversity and experiencing nature was part of our everyday lives. I grew up in a period of civil unrest due to a mass students-led agitation against illegal infiltration of people into my native state. We missed over a year of school, spending months at home doing nothing. It was very frustrating, and I always wondered why people would want to leave their own countries and cause trouble in other lands.</p><p>Years later, I quit my government job to begin a lifelong engagement with nature. My projects used to be on the conservation of birds and on the coexistence of humans and elephants - Assam is probably the area in the world with the maximum number of casualties due to human-elephant conflicts. Then I got exposed to the potential of climate change aggravating many of the environmental issues prevalent on northeast India.</p><p>The documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" was my eye-opener as it answered a lot of questions that had lingered in my mind since childhood. It opened my eyes to the fact that our region was one of the early climate-change impacted regions of the world.</p><p>I wanted to do something about it, but I had limited options with my different educational background. Travelling to Antarctica in 2013 was life changing in many ways. Besides first-hand experience of warming impacts on the fragile ecosystems of the remote continent, I learnt more about the consequences of polar melting on the planet. Just a few months later, I was trained as a Climate Reality Leader at Istanbul by former US Vice President Al Gore, the man who won the Nobel Prize for \"An Inconvenient Truth.\"</p><p>Attending the UN climate negotiations and other international events has been an eye opener for me. I was shocked that the indigenous people populated Eastern Himalayan did not have representatives in these forums, despite being one of the early impacted and most vulnerable regions, confirmed by several studies in the past decade. This is not right, and we need to ensure that the negotiations address the needs and concerns of the people of our region. We must have access to the adaptation and loss and damage funds, having had to sacrifice our development aspirations for decades.</p><p>At the same time, I realized that the global realization that the traditional wisdom and knowledge systems of indigenous people presents a great opportunity to mainstream the age-old indigenous way of life, and motivate the youth to embrace and preserve these traditions which always prioritized sustainable coexistence with nature. The Indigenous People's Climate Justice Forum aims to ensure that the global community recognizes the challenges and delivers climate justice to the people of the Eastern Himalayas.</p><p>How, when and why did you become a climate activist?</p><p>On the 2nd of March, 2013, citizens of 15 Pacific Islands nations urged the world community to take action before it is too late for them; these countries face complete annihilation by rising sea levels. The 350.org organized Pacific Warrior Day of Action had asked for solidarity from the global community in support of their theme - \"We are not drowning. We are fighting against climate change. Will you stand with us?\"</p><p>I was in Antarctica on a climate change expedition at that time. I am proud to have had the opportunity to hold up a solidarity banner and stand with the people of Fiji, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Is, Vanuatu, Tokelau, Niue, Cook Is, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu, and Kiribati as the only activist from the entire continent.</p><p>Three months later, in June, I went to get trained as a Climate Reality Leader in Istanbul. The city was in turmoil over the decision to hack down trees in Gezi Park for a new development project, and things got out of hand during the training with violent attempts to suppress the protests. Over the next few days, I was caught in the whirlpool of police and public action amidst escalating tensions. To cut a long story short, a group of us from the training were hounded into a shelter as riots erupted all around us. I learnt my lesson the hard way- to fight for environmental rights was never going to be easy. I graduated as a Climate Reality Leader in the same week that I discovered that there was an effective antidote for tear gas burn. But that's a story for another day.</p><p>Tell us about your polar expeditions and how did they shape your journey as an activist?</p><p>I was a member of the International Antarctic Expedition 2013 led by Robert Swan, the first man to have walked to both the poles. We were on a mission to gain firsthand experience of climate change impacts on the fragile Antarctic ecosystems.</p><p>I will never forget the moments from the 9th of March, when we were summoned to the top deck at 7 AM for the Iceberg Ceremony at Antarctic Sound. We saw us the large tabular icebergs that had floated north from the collapsed Larsen B ice shelf 11 years earlier.</p><p>I still remember what Robert Swan said and I quote him- \"Back in 2002, most people did not believe in climate change. When it started to collapse, scientists said it will take a long time to collapse, but after the cracks were first noticed, it went very fast and collapsed in less than 4 weeks. Now, you have seen climate change impacts already happening here, you must help spread the word and ensure the world leaders take decisive action before it is too late.\"</p><p>Another highlight was the visit to the 'E-Base' on King George Island, which runs entirely on renewable energy. It is also the only private base on Antarctica set up by Robert Swan several years earlier.</p><p>In 2015, I spent two weeks at the Churchill Northern Studies Centre in the Canadian Arctic. It opened my eyes to the cascading consequences of warming on the ecosystems of the arctic, observe the unfolding impacts on biodiversity ranging from polar bears to fishes, birds and amphibians, permafrost melting and the struggles of the human communities.</p><p>Four years later, I was thrilled when Robert Swan himself invited me to be a part of the Climate Force Arctic Expedition in 2019. The expedition team comprising of 86 scientists, naturalists, corporate leaders, writers, filmmakers, civil society leaders and other experts from 27 countries.</p><p>I was also invited to deliver an audio-visual presentation about the proposed Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary for all marine areas north of the Arctic Circle. I also talked about the impending water crisis in the northeastern region and the vulnerabilities and resilience of the Eastern Himalayas.</p><p>We flew to Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, which is located at only 800 miles from the North Pole. We visited the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world's most precious seeds from any global disaster, is located at Longyearbyen. However, in the summer of 2017, meltwater permeated the seemingly invincible structure, and it was closed for repairs during our visit.</p><p>It was disconcerting to learn that parts of Svalbard, including Longyearbyen had warmed by over 5 degrees Celsius in the past 20 years, threatening the lifestyles of the people and biodiversity of the region. We learnt about the changing dynamics of predator and prey interactions in the warming arctic ecosystems from wildlife biologists with decades of ongoing research in the polar regions. Animals like the seals, walrus and polar bears were facing survival threats because of the loss of sea ice.</p><p>The National Geographic Explorer expedition ship that took us further north. After several days exploring the remote islands of the high Arctic, our route was blocked by an endless expanse of sea ice at 820 North. The loss of sea ice has implications for global weather and is vital for the survival of animals like seals and polar bears. Our ship turned back without disturbing the sea ice, even though it is an ice-strengthened vessel capable of breaking through sea ice.</p><p>My third Arctic expedition was by public transport across Lapland, engaging with activists and indigenous communities in the four countries of the region.</p><p>What do you think are the biggest environmental threat for Assam in particular and North East India?</p><p>The Eastern Himalayan region is one of the biologically richest areas on Earth, with an abundance of endemic and rare species inhabiting the diverse landscapes. This region is also home to many indigenous communities with unique cultures and traditions that are steeped in nature. We celebrate our biological diversity in art and music. Although blessed with natural largesse, our region is vulnerable to natural disasters and sits on the cusp of an impending climate and ecological crisis.</p><p>Across the region, the loss of forest cover, invasive vegetation and disappearance of native biodiversity have emerged as direct threats to the food security of millions. The impact of climate change on native biodiversity used as food and medicine by indigenous communities is an unknown but an expected consequence.

Swaminathan Centenary International Conference at ICAR PUSA, New Delhi, and described the renowned agricultural scientist as a visionary whose legacy will guide India's agricultural policies for generations.</p><p><br/><br/>Addressing scientists, policymakers, and global delegates, Prime Minister said Dr. Swaminathan\u2019s pioneering work not only ensured food security for the nation but also laid the foundation for sustainable and inclusive farming practices.<br/><br/>The international conference, themed \u201cEvergreen Revolution: The Pathway to Biohappiness,\u201d aims to carry forward the values and scientific vision of the father of India\u2019s Green Revolution. Scheduled from August 7 to 9, the event focuses on sustainable agriculture, biodiversity conservation, climate resilience, and inclusive rural development.<br/><br/>Recalling his long-standing association with Dr. Swaminathan, PM Modi spoke about the scientist\u2019s deep interest in Gujarat\u2019s agricultural reforms, especially his valuable suggestions for the\u00a0Soil Health Card\u00a0initiative. He also shared memories of visiting the MSSRF Centre in Tamil Nadu nearly two decades ago, releasing Dr. Swaminathan\u2019s book\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u201cThe Quest for a World Without Hunger\u201d</emphasis>\u00a0in 2017, and interacting with him during the 2018 inauguration of the IRRI Regional Centre in Varanasi.<br/><br/>\u201cDr. Swaminathan believed that science is not just about discovery, but delivery,\u201d said Prime Minister, highlighting the scientist\u2019s focus on field-level transformation. He praised Swaminathan\u2019s early advocacy for millets (Shri Anna), bio-villages, and community seed banks, innovations that now shape India\u2019s agricultural landscape and global sustainability goals.<br/><br/>PM Modi also highlighted India's current agricultural achievements. \u201cIndia ranks first in the production of milk, pulses, and jute, and second in rice, wheat, cotton, fruits, vegetables, and fish,\u201d he noted. He added that the country achieved its highest-ever foodgrain production last year, with oilseeds like soybean, mustard, and groundnut also recording all-time highs.<br/><br/>During the event, M.S.

He also spoke about the recently approved PM Dhan Dhanya Yojana, which aims to uplift 100 districts where agriculture has lagged behind.<br/><br/>Looking to the future, PM Modi called for a national shift from food security to nutritional security. He advocated for the promotion of bio-fortified and nutrition-rich crops, reduction in chemical usage, and widespread adoption of natural farming. He emphasized the urgent need for\u00a0climate-resilient agriculture, focusing on drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, and flood-adaptive crop varieties, crop rotation, and soil-specific crop planning.<br/><br/>PM Modi stressed expanding solar-powered micro-irrigation, drip systems, and precision agriculture, and called for integrating AI, machine learning, and satellite data into a real-time agricultural decision-support system that could reach every district. He urged continuous expert guidance for agri-tech startups, whose innovations could benefit from experienced mentorship.<br/><br/>PM Modi also applauded the success of the \u201cViksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan\u201d, which connected over 1.25 crore farmers with more than 2,200 scientists across 700 districts, with over 60,000 programmes conducted during May\u2013June 2025. He called it a commendable example of taking technology from lab to land.<br/><br/>Concluding his address, PM Modi said that Dr. Swaminathan\u2019s vision, humility, and values continue to inspire India. \u201cHe taught us that agriculture is not just about growing crops, it\u2019s about growing life,\u201d Prime Minister said, urging a renewed national focus on empowering small farmers, women, and rural communities.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Indian Agriculture News", "instances": ["S.

Oxfam climate change policy lead Nafkote Dabi said:  \"Oxfam is proud to have supported young climate defenders from the Pacific and elsewhere who bravely took their fight for justice from a classroom in Vanuatu to the world's highest court. They won the world a tremendous victory today.  This ruling elevates national climate commitments everywhere by confirming that countries must reduce emissions enough to protect the universal rights to life, food, health and a clean environment. All countries, particularly rich ones, now have to cut their emissions faster and phase out fossil fuels. Rich countries have to increase their financing to Global South countries to help them reduce emissions and protect their people from past and future harm. This is not a wish-list - it is international law.  We now have a powerful tool for holding countries to account for their obligations, especially in protecting the world's most marginalised people and future generations of humanity. The ICJ rejected arguments by the likes of the US and UK that governments are bound only by climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement and did not have stronger obligations under international law. This ruling will inject new impetus into negotiations at the COP30 Summit in Brazil this November.\"  Oxfam Aotearoa climate justice lead Nick Henry said:  \"Today's ruling is a stunning rebuke to the rich countries, including New Zealand, who are failing to stop harm to our climate. It is a victory for a people-powered campaign started by Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, gaining support from Pacific leaders and allies around the world.  The New Zealand government provided early support to the campaign and co-sponsored the UN resolution that referred the case to the ICJ. But in its submissions to the court, New Zealand argued that human rights law is not relevant to climate change and that governments don't have climate obligations beyond the existing Paris Agreement.  The world's highest court has rejected the New Zealand government's arguments and ruled that the international treaties on human rights and the environment create binding obligations to prevent harm to the climate.  This means that New Zealand must do more to reduce emissions and increase funding for climate action in the Pacific.\"    Oxfam has been supporting the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change's lawsuit since 2022, joining in advocacy for the UN General Assembly to refer the case to the Court.
