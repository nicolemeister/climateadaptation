During this pivotal moment, Commonwealth leaders pledged to take concerted action, both independently and collectively, through a program focused on environmental initiatives and addressing the challenges of climate change.\u00a0</p><p>Climate action plays a vital role in the resilience and prosperity of small island developing states (SIDS), particularly within the Commonwealth. SIDS, despite their diversity, face significant vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, posing existential threats to their economies and ecosystems. </p><p>The Commonwealth actively supports SIDS in advocating for increased climate action, recognizing the unique challenges they confront in the face of climate change. The commitment of the Commonwealth heads of government to various goals, including climate action, underscores the interconnectedness of health, education, gender equality, and climate resilience for SIDS.\u00a0</p><p>Access to electricity is essential for economic progress and poverty reduction. However, many less developed nations in the Commonwealth face limited power availability, which hampers such social services as health and education. Additionally, it is crucial to decarbonize the energy sector and ensure climate equity to promote sustainable development objectives.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Thank you for registering!</p><p/><p>An account was already registered with this email.

African Commonwealth nations, in particular, require significant electricity availability development despite being leading renewable energy producers. </p><p>Bridging these disparities is essential to fulfill the objectives of\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7\">Sustainable Development Goal 7</url>\u00a0(SDG 7), which aims to achieve universal access to affordable and reliable energy services.</p><p>The\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://thecommonwealth.org/our-work/commonwealth-sustainable-energy-transition-agenda#:~:text=The%20CSET%20Agenda%20encourages%20and,Goals%20in%20particular%20SDG%207.\">Commonwealth Sustainable Energy Transition (CSET)</url>\u00a0Agenda is a collaborative platform for concerted efforts among member countries to expedite the shift toward low-carbon energy systems and attain SDG 7. This initiative is grounded in three fundamental pillars: inclusive transitions, technology and innovation, and enabling frameworks. </p><p>It champions actions led by members to accelerate inclusive and equitable energy transitions, ultimately realizing the objectives of SDG 7. The CSET Agenda has introduced three new member-led action groups focusing on energy literacy, geothermal energy, and a crosscutting youth action group.\u00a0</p><p>Transitioning to a low-carbon economy is vital for achieving decarbonization targets and addressing climate change. However, this transformation poses challenges due to the historical reliance on hydrocarbon energy sources. </p><p>Moreover, the shift toward decarbonization may lead to stranded hydrocarbon assets, affecting not only their owners, but suppliers, staff, entire communities and regions. A comprehensive and inclusive policy framework is necessary to guide member nations in aligning their efforts with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the COP21 Paris Agreement.</p><p>While policy frameworks and climate targets are essential, they must be accompanied by binding rules and regulations. Legislation can enforce energy-efficiency standards, promote the adoption of renewable energy, and phase out carbon-intensive practices. As already done in the UK and Canada, prohibiting internal-combustion engines or coal-fired electricity generation can expedite the energy transition and propel positive climate action.</p><p>Climate injustice is a significant concern within the Global South, where poorer nations often contribute more to combating climate change than wealthier countries. Evaluating national emissions capabilities and historical emissions reveals stark disparities, emphasising the need for fair burden-sharing. </p><p>Wealthier nations have an opportunity to address climate injustice by supporting renewable energy projects in Commonwealth countries, thereby reducing energy poverty.</p><p>To this end, the Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub (<url normalizedValue=\"https://thecommonwealth.org/our-work/Commonwealth-Climate-Change-Programme\">CCFAH</url>) facilitates unlocking climate finance for small and vulnerable member states. This initiative assists countries in bidding for and gaining increased access to climate finance by supporting the development of grant proposals and project pipelines. </p><p/><h>Sign up for one of our free newsletters</h><p/><p>The process also involves building human and institutional capacity, providing technical advisory services, and fostering cross-Commonwealth cooperation. Commonwealth national climate finance advisers, deployed and embedded in relevant government ministry departments, play a key role in facilitating sharing of experiences and expertise among member states.\u00a0</p><p>Examining how energy is generated, delivered, and utilized is essential to achieving decarbonization goals and fostering socioeconomic growth. Accelerating the energy transition requires strong political will, technological advancements, and cost reductions. Finally, ensuring inclusive processes during this transition is crucial for achieving sustainable and people-centered social development.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIAEN-751163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIAEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69R4-D9V1-DY3S-K000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470004</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><timeReceived>3:54 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Asia Times (Hong Kong) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia Times-English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16105\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 26, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Commonwealth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pacific Islands</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paris Agreement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>UN Sustainable Development Goals</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

The analysis showed established climate disclosures, with a focus on near-term targets over long-term goals. Organizational resilience to climate change is a significant challenge for the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p>* SEMI released a report on the maturity of the semiconductor sector corporate climate disclosures.</p><p>* Semiconductor industry-level climate disclosures are in the Established phase.</p><p>* Companies prioritize near-term climate targets over long-term net zero goals.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>MILPITAS, California, May 8 -- SEMI technology communities issued the following news release:</p><p>SEMI today released the report A Rising Tide: Building a Climate-Resilient Semiconductor Value Chain that spotlights the maturity of the semiconductor value chain as it strives toward greater climate resilience and develops climate risk mitigation strategies. Led by the SEMI Sustainability Initiative Environmental Risk Mitigation and Reporting (ERMR) working group, the study identifies strengths, gaps and challenges faced by the industry in implementing recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The report also offers recommendations on industry best practices to enhance climate disclosure maturity. Download the report.<br/><br/>The report leveraged Nasdaq Sustainable Lens(TM), an AI-powered ESG intelligence platform, to analyze and assess the maturity level of each segment of the semiconductor value chain based on publicly available sustainability and climate information of 100 leading semiconductor companies against TCFD recommendations. Nasdaq Sustainable Lens(TM) reviewed over 2,200 corporate annual financial reports, sustainability reports, low-carbon transition and climate action plans and other sustainability and climate information released between 2021 and 2023. The platform uncovered five key takeaways:<br/><br/>1. Maturity of semiconductor industry-level climate disclosures are in the Established phase as defined by Nasdaq. The semiconductor companies included in the assessment showed 40% higher TCFD alignment than the market average, represented by over 9,000 global companies across all industries beyond semiconductors.</p><p>2. Corporate climate reporting varies by semiconductor value chain segment largely due to different stakeholder expectations, jurisdiction-level reporting requirements, the level of resources dedicated to corporate climate work, as well as board- and executive-level engagement in climate initiatives.</p><p>3. Companies prioritize near-term climate targets, though only some have set long-term net zero goals. On average, value chain segments demonstrated the most comprehensive TCFD alignment with the Metrics &amp; Targets pillar, particularly as it relates to near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets.</p><p>4. Addressing organizational resilience to climate change appears to be the biggest industry-level challenge. The most underreported categories included climate scenario analysis, quantitative physical and transition climate risk assessments, and setting an internal carbon price. This indicates that the core question of how a company's business strategy will perform under various climate scenarios remains a major gap across all semiconductor value chain segments.</p><p>5. Ensuring climate resilience of the value chain is a business imperative for semiconductor companies. Industry-level recognition of the vulnerability of the semiconductor value chain to existing and potential climate-related risks and proactively building a path towards climate resilience are crucial for long-term business continuity.<br/><br/>\"Our study aims to raise awareness of climate risk as a key business risk and demonstrate an important role that climate resilience plays in ensuring business continuity and long-term resilience of the semiconductor value chain,\" said Alua Suleimenova, Senior Sustainability Program Manager at Marvell and leader of the ERMR working group. \"This analysis will inform business leaders' decisions around measuring and reporting on corporate climate action. Further, this study can help SEMI members enhance transparency of their climate disclosures in alignment with emerging reporting requirements, including the TCFD recommendations, which are now housed within the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\"<br/><br/>\"The analysis made possible by Nasdaq Sustainable Lens(TM) is a key step forward in understanding and improving sustainability risk assessment and reporting across the semiconductor value chain,\" said Dr. Mousumi Bhat, Vice President of Global Sustainability Programs at SEMI. \"Marvell's leadership and the companies that provided case studies were crucial to delivering these important insights.\"<br/><br/>Webinar on Report<br/><br/>SEMI and Nasdaq will host a webinar titled Climate Risk as a Business Risk on May 23, 2024, at 9:00am PT that will highlight key takeaways from the A Rising Tide: Building a Climate-Resilient Semiconductor Value Chain report. Registration is open.</p><p>About the SEMI Sustainability Initiative</p><p>The SEMI Sustainability Initiative works to accelerate the development of climate solutions for the semiconductor value chain through collaboration, communications, alignment and guidelines development. The Initiative consists of Working Groups collaborating on topics such as materiality, risk mitigation and reporting, climate equity, social justice, carbon markets and circularity. It also includes the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), whose members collaborate to help their organizations set and pursue net zero goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>About SEMI</p><p>SEMI is the global industry association connecting over 3,000 member companies and 1.5 million professionals worldwide across the semiconductor and electronics design and manufacturing supply chain.

These are the two data series most bandied about by China bears \u2013 both long-term and short-term. And ugly they do look.</p><p>In the first chart, we see that China\u2019s births have been cut in half since 2016. Though below the replacement rate of 2.1, China\u2019s birth rate had been running at a tolerable 1.6 to 1.8 for decades. We\u2019ll be okay; it\u2019s higher than Japan\u2019s 1.3, Chinese demographers surely told themselves.</p><p>Any such confidence should have evaporated in the past five years as the birthrate plummeted to a shockingly low 1.1 (still above South Korea, said some flunky demographer).</p><p>In the second chart, China\u2019s youth unemployment, a data series introduced in early 2018, has climbed steadily from the low teens to over 20%. It got so embarrassing that the series was \u201ctemporarily\u201d suspended in July because \u201cthe economy and society are constantly developing and changing. Statistical work needs continuous improvement.\u201d This proved to be even more embarrassing.</p><p>Demographics is destiny and the depressing future laid bare by annual births is surely causing aneurysms in Beijing. And then there\u2019s the pressing emergency. Looks like the slowdown is taking an increasing toll on China\u2019s youth with unemployment hitting 21.3% in June, the last available data point. According to these two charts, China\u2019s future and present are melting down concurrently.</p><p>But what if? What if\u2026 what if there are different charts. Charts that address both the future and present meltdown in less fraught terms. Charts that are just as revealing but which present a different \u2013 yet related \u2013 demographic story and, perhaps, an altogether different destiny. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In tension with a declining birth rate has been China\u2019s rapidly rising college enrollment. At the turn of the century, China produced one million college graduates. This represented 6% of the age cohort which we calculate by dividing graduates by births 24 years prior (the average age at college graduation is 23.7 in China). This has increased dramatically to 11.6 million graduates for the class of 2023, 63% of the age cohort.</p><p>Over this time period, college graduates in the workforce increased from low single-digit percentages to 25%. With the working-age population peaking in 2011, upgrading the labor force has become a necessity.</p><p>Happily, the investments have been made, and, barring a sudden collapse of the education system, China\u2019s blue-collar workforce will transition to a white-collar one as retiring migrant workers are replaced by their college-educated children. College graduates in China\u2019s workforce should exceed 70% by 2050.</p><p/><p>Thank you for registering!</p><p/><p>An account was already registered with this email.

This compares to 18% in the US, 35% in Germany, and 26% in the OECD. Given the rapid increase in graduates, these STEM majors have taken China from a standing start to topping science and technology metrics like the Nature Index, the top 1% of cited papers, the top 10% of cited papers and WIPO PCT patents in recent years.</p><p>In real-world terms, China\u2019s technically proficient workforce has given it the industrial output of the US and EU combined. Dozens of electric vehicle (EV) companies have emerged from nowhere with product cycles half as long as established car companies.</p><p>China has cornered the market on batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. China\u2019s National Space Administration and defense industry have made significant technological leaps with their legions of fresh-faced engineers.</p><p>This trend should have another 20 years to run, at which point China\u2019s workforce will have more STEM grads than the rest of the world combined. All of this is more or less written in stone until 2043. The college grads and STEM majors China\u2019s needs by then have already been born.</p><p>The problem is what comes after the post-2017 baby bust cohort graduates from college. Without a baby bounce or \u2013 horror \u2013 continued decline, China\u2019s future starts winding down pretty quickly.</p><p>The government has rolled out various policies designed to raise birthrates from reducing academic pressures by eliminating the tutoring industry to reducing home prices by kneecapping property speculation to promoting family time by restricting video games.</p><p>More natalist policies are sure to come. We reserve judgment on their effectiveness beyond, \u201cWe\u2019ll believe it when we see it.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Two anomalies strongly suggest a bounce in birth rates in the coming years. Covid\u2019s effect on births from 2020 to 2023 should be fairly obvious. We expect a spike in births starting in late 2023 from couples who put off conceiving during the Covid crisis. \u00a0</p><p>The less obvious factor is the surge in college graduates starting in 2022. This was the result of intensive investment in university expansion in the mid-2010\u2019s. These new university spaces started enrolling students in 2018 taking an additional 1.7 million young people for the class of 2022 and 2.5 million for the class of 2023.</p><p>While we await graduation statistics for 2024 and beyond, we believe recent university expansions have enrolled an additional 3 million students per year since 2017, taking them out of both the job and family formation market until graduation. This just so happens to coincide with both the sudden decline in births and the increase in youth unemployment.</p><p>We believe family formation for the college-educated is delayed past 23.7 years of age, the average age at graduation. Educated young people often put off having children for graduate school, to establish professional careers, to play the field, to travel, to be young and hip in the city, etc. And some prolong their adolescence for so long that they entirely skip the biological imperative.</p><p>What this all boils down to is that part of the collapse in births can be attributed to delayed family formation from increasing university enrollment. While we expect many delayed births to show up in future years, they will likely come gradually with some births forever lost to Peter Pan syndrome, dating apps, gym obsession, boss girl lifestyles, and other civilization-wrecking ills of modernity.</p><p>If we had to guess, we would say China\u2019s birthrate should partially recover to around 1.5 in five years. Any further increase will need to come from effective natalist policies which we will leave to fate and the powers that be.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The recent surge in college enrollment increased graduates from 35% of the 2017 age cohort to 63% in 2023, a 28 percentage point increase. We believe an increase of such magnitude in such a short period of time completely confounds \u201cyouth unemployment\u201d data, which only started to be reported in 2018.</p><p>We do not know the precise methodology the National Bureau of Statistics used to calculate China\u2019s short-lived youth unemployment, but it has been a wild ride of a continuous upward trend from 10% to over 20%, overlaid with massive seasonal swings and completely at odds with overall unemployment which has rarely stepped outside a narrow band of between 5% and 6% since 2018. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Like births, we believe youth unemployment has been upended by the surge in college enrollment. Since 2017, we calculate that employable youths (16 to 24-year-olds not in school) have fallen 43% \u2013 from 65% of the age cohort to 37% \u2013 due to increased college enrollment. We believe a proportion \u2013 say 5% \u2013 of these young people are neither employable nor educable in their youthful abandon.</p><p/><h>Sign up for one of our free newsletters</h><p/><p>These are the slackers, deadbeats, dropouts, dreamers, gaming addicts, marginally talented musicians, etc. They are not in school and contribute to the unemployment rate with their lackadaisical attitude toward finding and/or maintaining employment.</p><p>While this numerator of young slackers may remain largely constant, the denominator of employable youths has been dramatically reduced due to university enrollment of their more conscientious peers, pushing up the youth unemployment rate. We calculate that this could account for 6 percentage points of a roughly 10 percentage point increase in youth unemployment since 2018.</p><p>While highly suspicious to some, we do not doubt that \u201cthe economy and society are constantly developing and changing\u201d and \u201cstatistical work needs continuous improvement\u201d given the surge in college enrollment. Based on our calculations, 60% of the increase in youth unemployment since 2018 is simply a data artifact resulting from this surge.</p><p>We wonder whether much of the narrative surrounding youth unemployment is a media concoction based on a data artifact. The media, both domestic and foreign, is filled with stories of college students graduating into a hopeless job market.</p><p>While this may be true for some, or even many, it should not be a primary driver of the youth unemployment numbers given the youth cut-off age of 24 is just marginally higher than the average age at graduation of 23.7.</p><p>If new graduates are indeed unemployed at very high rates, that should drive the overall unemployment figure more than the youth figure, which does not seem to be the case. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Similarly, we wonder how much of China\u2019s deteriorating demographic story is actually an artifact of a much more promising demographic story. A better-educated workforce was always the key to offsetting falling birthrates.</p><p>However, a sudden increase in college enrollment may have resulted in the temporary statistical illusion of collapsing birthrates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Han Feizi is a Beijing-based financial industry veteran.</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIAEN-751442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIAEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RB-CG51-JBMP-W000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470004</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1640\"/><timeReceived>4:21 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Asia Times (Hong Kong) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia Times-English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16105\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 27, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Block 1</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Birthrate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China demographics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China National Bureau of Statistics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China STEM Graduates</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China University Graduates</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Youth Unemployment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Labor &amp;

As 2022 marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the African Union, China is willing to work with Africa to address the challenges of climate change and take China's relations with the AU to a new level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the world moves toward a carbon-neutral era, climate change has become a geopolitical and geo-economic battleground. Geopolitical competition on climate actions will stimulate green investment, green industrial technology development and promote global climate change action. Africa, the focus of global climate geopolitical cooperation, is the region most vulnerable to climate change, and the combined economic and climate risks of the COVID-19 pandemic are hitting Africa hard.</p><p>The United States' Green New Deal, the European Green Deal and China-Africa cooperation have all referred to support for climate change adaptation and green infrastructure in Africa. The climate cooperation between the major powers in Africa will have an impact on the evolution of the global climate geographical cooperation landscape.</p><p>Africa suffers from the long-term effects of the global climate security deficit. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world, and African countries contribute a small and slow-growing share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Since the 21st century, Africa's carbon dioxide emissions have slowly increased in line with its economic and social development, accounting for approximately 3.7 percent of the world's carbon emissions in 2019.However, due to factors such as geography and stage of development, African countries are the most vulnerable regions affected by climate change, with Africa's least developed countries and small island states all facing increasing threats to their security in the face of climate change. Food security, sustainable water supply and extreme weather phenomena are major issues that need to be addressed jointly by Africa and the world.</p><p>Due to geographical factors and economic underdevelopment, African countries lack the capacity to cope with climate change, are suffering more than other regions and are likely to bear more losses in the future. This is why African countries are particularly looking for climate equity and climate justice.</p><p>Over the past few decades, China-Africa cooperation has been broadening its scope, among which strengthening cooperation in addressing climate change is a new highlight. With the release of the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation on Combating Climate Change in 2021, China-Africa cooperation will continue to build on the past and raise the cooperation between the two sides to a deeper and more practical level. China, the largest developing country, and Africa, the most environmentally vulnerable region, have compatible sustainable development strategies and complementary development advantages, making China-Africa cooperation a pioneer in international cooperation with Africa, which can drive the development of the global climate governance process. China and Africa need to advocate green and low-carbon development, actively promote solar, wind and other sources of renewable energy, work for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change and keep strengthening the capacity for sustainable development.</p><p>In terms of strategy and policy dovetailing, China and the African countries have converging interests in the geopolitical cooperation among the major powers, and both sides have emphasized solidarity in the multilateral framework to address climate change issues. With regard to the construction of mechanisms and the promotion of exchanges, China and Africa should focus on information interaction and exchange of development experiences. Since 2012, China and Africa have jointly organized the Seminar on China-Africa Green Cooperation to Guide the Future Economy and China-Africa Ministerial Dialogue on Environmental Cooperation to promote enhanced communication and coordination on environmental governance policies.</p><p>The China-Africa Environment Cooperation Centre was launched in 2020, building an important platform for the participation of China and Africa, as well as relevant international organizations, research institutions and enterprises. As of September 2021, seven African countries, including Angola and Kenya, have joined the Belt and Road International Alliance for Green Development, making a positive contribution to the construction of the Green Silk Road.</p><p>Based on the actual needs of China-Africa cooperation, deepening China-Africa climate cooperation is on the official agenda for China-Africa cooperation. On November 30,2021, the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation on Combating Climate Change adopted at the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation announced that the heads of delegations of the People's Republic of China, 53 African countries and the AU Commission have jointly decided to establish a China-Africa partnership of strategic cooperation of the new era to fight climate change.</p><p>China and Africa are both developing entities, and since African countries are far different from the developed countries in terms of historical responsibility, level of development, stage of development and capacity, China should continue to support the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities \"and Africa's \"development first, climate balanced\" right to equitable development in the global climate negotiations. In the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the G77+China should continue to seek funding and the transfer of technology from developed countries for development and adaptation to climate change in Africa.</p><p>China has accumulated a wealth of experience applicable to Africa in the field of ecological civilization construction and low-carbon development, and the knowledge-sharing of Chinese best practices will help African countries in their green recovery process. Transnational and inter-regional cooperation on clean and low-carbon energy technology innovation and green recovery needs to be strengthened.</p><p>Also, China-Africa joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative will contribute to the ecological and environmental governance in Africa by strengthening infrastructure construction in Africa, especially clean energy projects such as photovoltaic and hydroelectric power stations, promoting the construction of the Green Belt and Road, strengthening ecological and environmental governance along the Belt and Road, and enhancing international cooperation on climate security.</p><p>Yu Hongyuan is a professor and director of the Institute for Comparative Politics and Public Policy at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.

It went into effect last November.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINHUA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINHUA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NM7-FTV1-JBTY-T3SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8078</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><timeReceived>4:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Xinhua News Agency</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua General News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 23, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paris Agreement</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N519110MM</classCode><className>NEWS SYNDICATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX121</classCode><className>BERLIN, GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
