According to news reporting out of Kanagawa, Japan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Urbanization in Jaipur, India, has led to a 42% decline in green cover over the past two decades, exacerbating urban heat, air pollution, groundwater depletion, and reduced livability. Green Infrastructure (GI) offers a sustainable solution, but effective implementation requires robust, data-driven strategies.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, \"This study employs geospatial technologies-GIS, remote sensing, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)-to develop a suitability model for Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) planning. Using an entropy-based weighting approach, the model integrates environmental factors, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which fell by 18% between 2000 and 2020; Land Surface Temperature (LST), which increased by 1.8 degrees C; soil moisture; precipitation; slope; and land use/land cover (LULC). Proximity to water bodies was found to be a critical determinant of suitability, whereas land surface temperature and soil moisture played significant roles in determining UGI feasibility. The results were validated using NDVI trends and comparative analysis with prior studies so as to ensure accuracy and robustness. The suitability analysis reveals that 35% of Jaipur's urban area, particularly peri-urban regions and river corridors, is highly suitable for UGI interventions, thereby presenting significant opportunities for urban cooling, flood mitigation, and enhanced ecosystem services. These findings align with India's National Urban Policy Framework (2018) and the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11, supporting climate resilience and sustainable urban development.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This geospatial approach provides a scalable methodology for integrating green spaces into urban planning frameworks across rapidly urbanizing cities.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Urban Green Infrastructure Planning In Jaipur, India: a Gis-based Suitability Model for Semi-arid Cities.

According to news reporting originating in Kyoto, Japan, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Environmental change drivers (ECDs) impact ecological communities in various ways, from enrichment that increases species' performance and abundance, to stressors that reduce their reproduction and growth. These effects can affect species coexistence as well as impact ecosystem functioning and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF).\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Kyoto University, \"Predicting the impact of ECDs on communities and BEF relationships requires understanding how ECDs affect fundamental population parameters, including intrinsic rate of increase (r), carrying capacity (K), and interspecific interactions ( ). Here, we use numerical simulations based on theoretical models to show the explicit links between these parameters and the nature of BEF relationships. Depending on the mean and variance of the effects of ECDs on community members, BEF relationships increase or decrease in both their intercept and slope. We further derive hypotheses about how BEF relationships will be affected by multiple ECDs or when we consider multiple ecosystem functions.

Nevertheless, a number of OBOR member nations are located in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The infrastructure developments linked to the OBOR program have prompted several Western countries to express concern that these nations may become even more vulnerable to the effects of climate variability. The impact of Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) on climate change risks in OBOR member nations is explored in this article, which also analyzes the processes at work. Examining panel data from 65 partner countries spanning 2004\u20132020, this research examines how China's FDI affects host countries\u2019 capacity to handle climate change risks, with a particular emphasis on each country's vulnerability risk. Important results from the research comprise: China's direct investment in OBOR regions strengthens the climate resilience of partner countries by reducing their vulnerability to climate change. Countries with lower or medium incomes, those in close proximity to China, and those that have free trade agreements with China feel the benefits of Chinese investments more acutely. Consistent with OBOR's guiding philosophy of sharing development outcomes and promoting global governance, the positive impacts of OBOR investments can be explained in part by rising incomes and stable governments. Contrary to claims of \u201ccarbon emissions transfer\u201d and evidence that environmental sustainability is central to the OBOR project, investments made under the OBOR have decreased climate vulnerability without increasing local carbon emissions. The research findings and policy suggestions in this article provide light on the current function of China's OBOR program and suggest ways to ensure its long-term viability.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><h>Introduction</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In order to promote high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and to build a community with a shared future for humanity, China is focusing on enhancing the ability and effectiveness of participating nations to address climate change risks. Launched in 2013, the BRI is a plan to build infrastructure and promote economic growth across continents by connecting land and sea routes across Asia, Europe, and Africa. To combat climate change, promote green development, and encourage peaceful cohabitation between humans and nature, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China stressed the necessity of active engagement in global governance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several nations that are part of the BRI are situated in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including more frequent and severe weather events, higher sea levels, and altered patterns of precipitation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The possibility for negative social and economic impacts on local ecosystems and climate is a common source of concern for these nations. But the BRI opens doors for partner nations to high-tech infrastructure and resources, so they can better withstand the effects of climate variability.</p><p>Several Western nations are skeptical of the BRI's joint development initiatives, arguing that the infrastructure projects could make participating nations more vulnerable to climate change and that China's investments in the BRI cause partner countries to transfer carbon emissions. This is despite the fact that the BRI has the potential to bring about positive changes. This mistrust has made certain countries, areas, and UN agencies reluctant to participate in the BRI.</p><p>The purpose of this research is to find out how vulnerable the BRI nations are to climate change and to determine if the investments made by China in the BRI have helped at all. New viewpoints and scientific facts bolstering the BRI's function in battling climate variability are offered by the study, which delves into the beneficial externalities of China's BRI initiatives. In addition, the report analyzes how China's BRI investments have affected carbon emissions, refuting assertions made by certain Western nations over the \u201ccarbon emissions transfer\u201d linked to BRI projects. This research helps fill gaps in our knowledge about the BRI's sustainable development potential and its role in tackling global concerns by delving into these issues.</p><h>Literature review and research hypotheses</h><h>Literature review</h><p>Economic and social growth, as well as possible environmental implications, are all part of the literature on how China's BRI investments have helped partner nations reduce their climate risk. Myint (2019) found that participating nations can experience growth and development thanks to BRI investments, which enhance infrastructure, trade, and connectivity. Concerns over the potential direct and indirect impacts on the environment, especially in light of climate change, have been voiced in response to the breadth and depth of the project (Hameiri et al., 2018; Jones and Zeng, 2019; Myint, 2019).</p><p>There is a risk that some BRI projects will increase carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, while others will encourage sustainable infrastructure and clean energy development in partner nations (McCarthy, 2020). According to Jones and Zeng (2019), the BRI has the ability to help reduce climate risk through its investments in renewable energy projects across different regions. Investments in conventional energy projects, including those using coal or oil, have significant negative impacts on the environment due to their enormous carbon footprints and other negative aspects (Wei, 2022).</p><p>The influence of the BRI on climate hazards is highly dependent on how the initiative interacts with environmental regulations in the countries that are partners. Social and environmental problems might worsen in partner nations with inadequate governance and lax regulatory systems (Gardner et al., 2020: 2). Problems with land acquisition, insufficient community involvement, and insufficient environmental impact assessments are just a few examples of the obstacles that BRI investments may encounter (Gelpern et al., 2021). To keep social and environmental standards intact, project funding and decision-making processes must be open and transparent (Gonzalez-Vicente, 2019: 509).</p><p>In this context, it is essential to address governance models and international cooperation frameworks underpinning the BRI . Julien Chaisse's (2023) study on US development finance elucidates the competitive dynamics between US and Chinese development strategies, highlighting how governance models influence international cooperation. This comparative perspective underscores the distinct approaches taken by different countries in fostering global development and economic partnerships. Moreover, Jean-Michel Marcoux and Julien Sylvestre-Fleury's (2022) work on state-owned enterprises and government procurement sheds light on the regulatory complexities and strategic behaviors of state-owned enterprises within the BRI framework, emphasizing the importance of transparent procurement processes and robust regulatory oversight (Marcoux and Sylvestre-Fleury, 2022). Additionally, the study by Chaisse and Jamieson Kirkwood (2020) on BRI-related investment treaties provides a comprehensive analysis of the legal and institutional arrangements that facilitate international investments under the BRI, stressing the need for coherent and consistent legal frameworks to enhance investor confidence and ensure sustainable development. Incorporating these insights enriches the article\u2019s governance analysis, offering a more holistic view of the BRI's operational environment and its implications for global governance and international cooperation.</p><p>Ecological disruptions caused by BRI projects, such as habitat destruction and biodiversity loss, are critical for assessing climate resilience. To address these shortcomings, the article will incorporate a broader range of data sources, including international databases and independent environmental assessments. Engaging with non-Chinese sources will help mitigate potential state bias, providing a balanced view of the BRI's environmental impact. Additionally, Yan's (2023) study on labor rights in Asia-Pacific trade agreements highlights how labor clauses in free trade agreements influence labor policies and sustainable development. Chaisse's (2023) research on corruption in foreign investment explores how international investment tribunals address corruption, informing the analysis of governance and climate finance in the context of foreign investments and Sustainable Development Goals. Qian's (2022) article on investment treaties and sustainable development provides insights into how international investment law affects climate financing, and Denolf's (2008) study on corruption's impact on foreign direct investment (FDI) explores the relationship between corruption, governance, and economic growth. These studies will significantly broaden the article's scope and depth, offering a richer analysis of the governance factors influencing climate finance in the context of sustainable development and corruption.</p><p>The complex impacts of the BRI on climate risk reduction are shown by case studies of individual initiatives in various locations. Chinese investments in renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia have helped diversify energy sources and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. These projects include hydropower, solar electricity, and wind farms (Alami and Dixon, 2022; Alami et al., 2021). Traditional energy projects, such as coal plants, can raise carbon emissions and add to air pollution; thus, there are worries about the possible detrimental effects of investing in these projects (Alami et al., 2021). Clean energy projects and better regional energy connectivity could be fostered by BRI investments in Central Asia (Lenton et al., 2008, 2019). But there are certain initiatives that could impede the shift to low-carbon economies and clash with global climate goals, such as building fossil fuel infrastructure (Kulp and Strauss, 2019). The BRI has backed massive hydropower projects in South Asia, which could lead to increased economic activity and cleaner energy. But there are worries that these initiatives will harm river ecosystems and the people who live nearby (Schindler et al., 2023).</p><p>Chinese investments in solar and hydroelectric projects in Africa have shown promise for facilitating economic development and expanding access to renewable energy (Osei-Kyei and Chan, 2016: 170\u2013171). However, deforestation and habitat disruption are just two examples of the long-term environmental repercussions that large-scale operations can cause (Pettis, 2022). The BRI has the potential to improve trade and economic growth in Africa by investing in trains and roads; nevertheless, there is a risk that these projects would increase emissions and cause other environmental problems (Taylor and Zajontz, 2020).</p><p>Solar farms and other renewable energy projects funded by the BRI have the ability to lessen the region's reliance on a single energy source and increase resilience to climate variability. But spending money on gas and oil infrastructure could make us rely on fossil fuels for a long time and sabotage our attempts to switch to greener energy (Carmody et al., 2022).</p><p>According to the research, the effects of the BRI on the environment and climate change risk can differ between regions, project types, and partner nations\u2019 governance systems. Projects can have varying impacts on environmental problems and the ability to achieve global climate targets. Some projects help reduce climate risk and promote sustainable development, while others can make things worse.</p><p>Through in-depth case studies and longitudinal analyses, future research should strive to offer more thorough and nuanced evaluations of the environmental implications of BRI investments, with a focus on climate risks. To make sure that China's investments assist in fighting climate variability and build resilience in partner countries, BRI projects should prioritize sustainable development and follow social and environmental norms (Clowes and Kavanagh, 2022).</p><p>Incorporating insights from Chaisse and Mitsuo Matsushita's (2018) work on the normative and strategic implications of the BRI highlights the geopolitical strategies of China, emphasizing how the BRI shapes global trade dynamics and economic cooperation. Additionally, examining the regional dynamics of BRI through the lens of Chaisse and Pasha L Hsieh's (2023) study on Asia-Pacific regionalism provides a detailed analysis of the BRI's impact on regional trade and governance. Analyzing EU-BRI interactions through Burnay and Raube's (2023) work on the European Union's strategic responses to the BRI enriches the understanding of the initiative's global implications. These studies collectively underscore the critical role of the BRI in shaping the future landscape of global trade liberalization and economic cooperation.</p><h>Proposed hypothesis</h><p>According to the research evaluation, socioeconomic factors and local natural conditions both impact the dangers associated with climate change. There is much evidence that FDI affects local socioeconomic dynamics, which implies that the inflow of foreign money has the potential to alter the social and governmental landscape of the host nation. For example, research has demonstrated that FDI boosts host countries\u2019 capacity for good governance and overall development. Construction of infrastructure, project management, industrial clustering, and cultural interchange are just a few ways in which the nations that are co-building the BRI are impacted by investments, which are a type of FDI. By creating jobs, promoting urbanization, and impacting local customs and lifestyle choices, these endeavors have the potential to mold the social fabric of a nation.</p><p>In addition, co-building countries can tackle issues like insufficient funding and outdated technologies with BRI investments. Better social and governance capacities that follow allow for better local reactions to climate hazards. Therefore, BRI investments may help co-building nations become more resilient to climate variability by enhancing their capacity to handle climate risks. Therefore, we postulate the following: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hypothesis 1:</emphasis> Financial investments from China's Belt and Road Initiative can help nations that are co-building mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p>Increases in both GDP and per capita income are mostly attributable to FDI. People in co-building nations, particularly those with lower incomes, stand to benefit economically from China's direct investments in BRI projects because of the jobs they generate, the knowledge they transfer, and the speed with which they industrialize. Greater financial resources allow locals to take stronger measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, making them less susceptible to its negative effects.</p><p>Theoretically, the nations that are part of the BRI could see an increase in income and public funds as a result of the investments made by China. This fiscal base lessens the likelihood of vulnerability by bolstering the ability of governments and citizens to adjust to climate change. Living circumstances stabilize and response capabilities grow as wages rise and infrastructure is strengthened, mitigating the impact of climate change disasters. This leads us to offer the following hypothesis: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hypothesis 2:</emphasis> Countries that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative can increase their revenue and so be less vulnerable to the effects of climate variability.</p><p>Co-building countries can benefit from China's investments through the BRI in terms of social and economic development as well as political stability. Embracing traditional cultural principles like \u201charmony without uniformity\u201d and \u201cseeking common ground while reserving differences\u201d helps partner nations maintain calm societal atmospheres. Governments are able to devote more funds to adaptation efforts to climate variability as a result of the decrease in social and political disputes brought about by these cultural exchanges.</p><p>Hence, the following theory is put forth: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hypothesis 3:</emphasis> Countries that are part of China's Belt and Road Initiative may see a decrease in their vulnerability to climate shifts as a result of investments that strengthen their governments.</p><p>Some have argued that the investments in energy-intensive businesses that are part of China's BRI will cause partner countries to produce more carbon emissions. Nevertheless, both previous studies and the actual implementation of BRI green development efforts indicate that these investments do not substantially increase carbon emissions. Actually, green development and reductions in carbon emissions intensity are common outcomes of China's investments in areas where the two countries are working together to construct.</p><p>Hence, the following theory is put forth: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hypothesis 4:</emphasis> Investments under China's Belt and Road Initiative have not significantly contributed to the carbon emissions levels of co-building countries.</p><h>Research design</h><h>Data sources and variable construction</h><h>Data sources</h><p>The research mandates that 65 member nations of the BRI serve as the study's sample. The scale of China's FDI in these partner nations is the main explanatory variable, using data obtained from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Statistical Bulletin of China's Overseas Direct Investment</emphasis> published by the Ministry of Commerce and made available through the Guotai\u2019an database.</p><p>The susceptibility risk of the 65 partner countries to climate change, as determined by the Global Adaptation Initiative's Country susceptibility Index (ND-GAIN), is the main dependent variable. There are two primary aspects of adaptation that make up the ND-GAIN index: vulnerability and preparation. There are three ways to measure vulnerability: sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. Food, water, health, ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure are the six pillars of life that this method takes into account when assessing a nation's susceptibility to the detrimental effects of climate change. As a result, the 34 ND-GAIN climate change vulnerability indices provide a reliable assessment of the degree to which a nation is at danger of experiencing climate change catastrophes.</p><p>World Bank and World Governance Indicators (WGIs) Global Governance Data databases provide national-level control variable data. The research only covers the years 2004\u20132020 because before that year China's investments in the BRI were relatively small. First, we removed data points that were missing information. Second, to reduce the impact of outliers, we applied a winsorization technique to the continuous variables at the 1% level. This means that the extreme values (top and bottom 1%) of the data were adjusted to the nearest value within the 1\u201399% range, a common practice in the literature to mitigate the influence of extreme data points. The final dataset is an imbalanced panel suitable for empirical analysis.</p><h>Variable construction</h><p>The research takes into account factors including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capability to conduct a thorough evaluation of the hazards associated with climate shift susceptibility in various nations. By taking into account factors such as exposure to physical risks, sensitivity due to dependence on climate-sensitive sectors, and adaptive capacity to mitigate potential losses, the study assesses the susceptibility of nations to climate-related disruptions and disasters using the ND-GAIN Vulnerability Index, which was developed by the University of Notre Dame (Chen and Chen, 2017). Countries involved in the BRI might use this data to assess their vulnerability to climate variability. A consistent format is used to convey the index data, with a base value of 100.</p><p>Chinese foreign direct investment (CFDI) is the stock of Chinese direct investments in the BRI partner nations and is the major explanatory variable. For a more nuanced understanding of how China's direct investment has affected climate change vulnerability, the study normalizes the data by each country's total economic production (Li and Zhang, 2020). This helps to account for variations in economic size.</p><p>Growth in wealth and political stability are two potential mediating processes that are also examined in the analysis (Mu et al., 2020). Wei et al. (2022) found a positive correlation between national income levels and climate shift vulnerability risks, suggesting that an increase in income may help mitigate these risks. This contradicts the existing research, which often emphasizes the poverty reduction effects of BRI investments on income levels in partner countries. The research uses GDP per capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity) as a measure of income growth.</p><p>This study uses the political stability index from the WGIs database to measure the level of political stability in countries participating in the BRI. This index is commonly used in existing research and acts as a control variable (Graham et al., 2018).</p><p>In addition, the study takes into consideration a number of control variables that help to account for different factors that influence a country's susceptibility to climate change risks. These variables include economic aggregate (log of gross domestic product [LGDP]), the quadratic term of economic aggregate (GDP2), population density (Popdensity), urbanization rate (Urbanrate), forest area coverage (Forestrate), government efficiency (GovernE) as measured by the index from the WGIs database, agricultural land area (Agricul), and the frequency of climate-related natural disasters (Disasters) as measured by the EMDAT Global Disaster Database.</p><h>Research model</h><p>The proposed model to test Hypothesis 1 examines the impact of direct investment under China's One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative on the climate change vulnerability risk of partner countries. The model can be represented as follows:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Equation (1):</emphasis>VULNERi,t=\u03b20+\u03b21CFDIi,t\u22121+\u03b22LGDPi,t\u22121+\u03b23GDPi,t\u221212+\u03b24Popdensityi,t\u22121+\u03b25Urbanratei,t\u22121+\u03b26Forestratei,t\u22121+\u03b27GovernEi,t\u22121+\u03b28Agriculi,t\u22121+\u03b29Disastersi,t\u22121+Nationi+Yeart+\u03f5itGiven that annual climate change vulnerability indicators are assessed at the end of each calendar year, the potential impact of the explanatory and control variables is subject to a certain temporal lag. To mitigate potential endogeneity concerns and to accurately capture the causal relationships, all explanatory and control variables in the model are lagged by one period. The empirical model incorporates both country-specific and time-specific dummy variables, denoted as Nationi and Yeart respectively, to control for any unobserved heterogeneity within countries and years. 0\u03b20 represents the constant term, while \u03b21\u2212\u03b29 are the regression coefficients corresponding to the explanatory and control variables. The subscripts i and t denote the country and year, respectively, and \u025bit represents the error term. A significantly negative coefficient for \u03b21 would lend support to Hypothesis 1.</p><p>To examine Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3, the intermediary effects of direct investment within China's OBOR initiative are explored through a mediation analysis. This analysis will elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which direct investment influences the outcomes of interest.

Equation (2) examines the impact of this investment on two mediating variables\u2014income levels and political stability in partner countries. Then, equation (3) integrates these mediating variables into equation (1) to assess their role in influencing the climate change vulnerability risks of partner countries involved in the BRI. If the coefficient \u03b21 in equations (2) and (3) is significant, and \u03b3j in equation (3) is also significant, this would suggest the presence of a mediating effect.</p><h>Empirical results and discussion</h><h>Descriptive analysis</h><p>The descriptive statistical results of the study's primary variables are presented in the upper half of Table 1. Over the course of the decade from 2004 to 2020, the BRI member nations\u2019 average climate change vulnerability risk ranged from 29.368 to 60.625. A low of about 25.5 was recorded in the 2020 Global ND-GAIN Climate Vulnerability Index. According to these descriptive statistics, the nations that are part of the BRI are relatively vulnerable to climate change, and there are large differences between them.</p><h>Table 1.</h><p>Descriptive statistics and collinearity test.</p><p>While the average stock of Chinese FDI across all nations was a meager 0.273, the wide range of values (more than 18) shows that the size of China's BRI investments fluctuated significantly throughout the time period under consideration. This diversity indicates that beneficiary nations will experience vastly different social and economic effects from these investments.</p><p>Also, the nations that are part of the BRI have very different degrees of economic development (LGDP), population density (Popdensity), and urbanization rate (Urbanrate). This indicates that the BRI includes countries in different developmental stages and from different parts of the world. In addition, the average levels of forest coverage (Forestrate) and government effectiveness (GovernE) were shown to be low, indicating that there is plenty of opportunity for BRI partner nations to enhance ecological protection and government capacity building.</p><p>It was necessary to perform a thorough multicollinearity study because the econometric model has numerous mediating factors and control variables. The results of the variance inflation factor (VIF) are shown in the second portion of Table 1. Income, the amount of income in the host country, had the largest VIF among the independent variables at 6.89, which is still below the multicollinearity criterion of 10. An average VIF of 2.57 was recorded for all variables. Therefore, multicollinearity is not anticipated to have a major impact on the following empirical results.</p><h>Baseline regression</h><p>The results of the baseline regression are displayed in Table 2. First, as shown in column 2, there is a strong negative association between the climate change vulnerability risk of partner countries and the direct impact of China's BRI investments, even after controlling for year-specific and country-specific fixed variables. This lends preliminary credence to Hypothesis 1, which states that a country's susceptibility to climate change decreases in correlation with the amount of direct investment from China.</p><h>Table 2.</h><p>Baseline regression results.</p><p>*p\u2009&lt;\u20090.10, **p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01; the values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>Column 3 of Table 2 introduces four economic development control variables: economic aggregate (LGDP), economic aggregate quadratic term (GDP2), population density (Popdensity), and urbanization rate (Urbanrate).

Introducing this adjusted variable into equation (1), as displayed in column 5 of Table 2, produces a CFDI coefficient of \u22120.140, with a significance level of 1%, thereby reinforcing the earlier findings.</p><p>Column 3 of Table 2 introduces four economic development control variables: economic aggregate (LGDP), economic aggregate quadratic term (GDP2), population density (Popdensity), and urbanization rate (Urbanrate).

A change was made to the measurement approach to test robustness initially, in recognition of potential bias in using stock data to measure China's BRI investment. Using the same variable structure, we developed the explanatory variable CFDII and substituted flow data for the stock data of China's direct investment in BRI partner nations. The effects of the adjusted explanatory variable on the vulnerability risk of climate change and GDP-adjusted vulnerability risk of BRI partner countries are shown in Columns 2 and 3 of Table 3. The results show that CFDII's coefficient is consistently negative and statistically significant at the 1% level, which means that the main conclusion holds up even when the explanatory variable's measurement varies. In order to test for robustness, we also looked at additional climate change risk indices as potential markers of climatic vulnerability. Equation (1) now uses Germanwatch's Climate Risk Index instead of VULNER. The index ranks the countries according to the degree of damage caused by climate and meteorological loss events (such as storms, floods, and heat waves) from 2005 to 2019. Values below 1 indicate modest levels of climate change risk, whereas values above 1 indicate increased economic and demographic losses owing to such catastrophes. We added the Climate Risk Index's one-period lag as a control variable because the total number of countries has an effect on the rankings of individual countries. As anticipated, the results (column 4 of Table 3) demonstrate a CFDI coefficient that is statistically significant at the 10% level. Supporting the robustness of the primary results are the moderate degree of significance, which may be attributable to a limited sample size.</p><h>Table 3.</h><p>Robustness test regression results.</p><p>*p\u2009&lt;\u20090.10, **p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01; Values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>Lastly, the results from the last two columns of Table 2 were recalculated, since China's FDI in the BRI started late, with low investment before 2005. Therefore, the sample period was limited to 2006\u20132020. Regression results for the same variables are shown in columns 5 and 6 of Table 3. The CFDI coefficient is still significantly negative, as it was in Table 2, which supports the robustness of Hypothesis 1.</p><h>Endogeneity treatment</h><p>Concerns concerning reverse causality arise from the fact that climate change vulnerability risks are highly correlated with nations\u2019 natural and socioeconomic characteristics. As a result, these risks may impact the attractiveness of BRI partner countries to Chinese investors. The research uses an instrumental variable strategy to deal with this possible endogeneity. In particular, counts of Chinese expatriates participating in economic collaboration with BRI nations and number of terrorist acts per country were used as instrumental variables in a two-stage least squares regression. Table 4 shows the regression findings. As with the last two columns of Table 2, columns 2 and 3 employ the quantity of terrorist activity in each country as an instrumental variable. At the 1% level of significance, the coefficient for CFDI is negative; as an instrumental variable, columns 4 and 5 use the number of Chinese expatriates involved in economic collaboration with BRI nations. Despite a decreased significance level, the CFDI coefficient is still negative.</p><h>Table 4.</h><p>Instrumental variable regression results.</p><p>*p\u2009&lt;\u20090. 10, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090. 01; the values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>Both instrumental variables were found to be valid after passing the weak instrument test, as seen in the last two rows of Table 4. Therefore, the instrumental factors that were chosen are suitable for the study. The results show that China's BRI investment considerably reduces the risks of climate change vulnerability in partner nations, confirming Hypothesis 1, even after accounting for possible endogeneity difficulties caused by reverse causation.</p><h>Mechanism analysis</h><p>Theoretically, the countries that are part of China's BRI may become less susceptible to the effects of climate change if the investments made by China in these countries raise their incomes and make them more resilient. These countries would be even less vulnerable to the effects of climate change if these investments reduced political and social instability, which in turn reduced the severity of losses caused by natural disasters. The effects of income growth and political stability, which are both attributed to BRI investments, are mirrored by these two impact paths.</p><p>Using regression analysis with equations (2) and (3), we explore the roles of the political stability index and per capita gross national income as proxy variables for the two mechanisms discussed earlier. Table 5 displays the outcomes of this analysis of mechanisms: column 2 shows that the income levels of partner nations have been positively affected by China's BRI investments, implying that the host country's income levels have been enhanced by direct investment from China. Column 4 shows that the political stability of partner nations is positively impacted by BRI investments, further proving that FDI from China helps to improve the political stability of host countries.</p><h>Table 5.</h><p>Mechanism analysis regression results.</p><p>**p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01; the values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>The results of equation (3) with the two mediating variables included are shown in columns 3 and 5 of Table 5. The coefficients for Income and PoliticsS are both substantially negative at the 1% level, but CFDI's coefficient is still significantly negative. When considering the effects of BRI investments on partner nations\u2019 vulnerability risks to climate change, our results emphasize the critical roles played by levels of political stability and per capita national income. Hypotheses 2 and 3 are confirmed by these partial mediating effects.</p><h>Heterogeneity analysis</h><p>To look at how the baseline regression findings varied, we ran a heterogeneity analysis. The classification of BRI partner nations into developing and developed categories was the first step in the analysis. Developing countries were defined as having a per capita GDP below US$20,000, while developed countries were defined as having a GDP above US$50,000.</p><p>Firsrtly, more than two-thirds of the sample, or lower-income countries, show a negative correlation between Chinese FDI and climate change susceptibility risks (at the 1% level), according to the results shown in columns 2\u20133 of Table 6. While rich nations also feel the effects, the coefficient's lower significance level indicates that developing nations are more vulnerable to the dangers associated with climate change as a result of BRI investment. This result is in line with the mechanism analysis, since developing nations are more susceptible to the income growth benefits of CFDI due to their higher poverty rates, worse socioeconomic conditions, and greater vulnerability to climate change.</p><h>Table 6.</h><p>Regression results of heterogeneity analysis.</p><p>*p\u2009&lt;\u20090.10, **p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01; the values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>Secondly, the effect of direct investment may be affected by the proximity of the two countries, which in turn shapes their foreign investment policies. The nations that are members of the BRI were categorized into two groups: those that are neighbors of China (both geographically and in terms of maritime proximity) and those that are not. The results of the regression for these subsamples are shown in columns 4 and 5 of Table 6. At the 5% level of significance, BRI investment has a strongly negative effect on neighboring countries but no effect on non-neighboring countries. This suggests that the lowered investment risk, transaction costs, and overall impact of BRI investments on lowering climate change sensitivity risks in adjacent countries are more noticeable.</p><p>Thirdly, the research took into account the strength of friendly and trade links between the two countries, which might affect the amount and impact of FDI. Countries that are part of the BRI were categorized as either having or not having signed a free trade area agreement with China. As a result of improved business climates, stronger political mutual trust, reduced communication costs between the two countries, and closer economic linkages, China's FDI tends to rise in countries that have signed free trade area agreements. Consequently, BRI investment may have a greater impact on climate change vulnerability risks in such countries. Columns 6 and 7 of Table 6 display the regression results for these two groups. The findings demonstrate that countries with free trade agreements experience more significant effects from Chinese investment, supporting the study's conjecture.</p><h>Analysis of dimensional indicators of climate change vulnerability</h><p>Three important aspects of a country's vulnerability to climate change are its exposure to hazards, its sensitivity to disasters caused by climate change, and its adaptive capability to handle the consequences of climate change. These dimensions are evaluated by the ND-GAIN Vulnerability Index. The exposure component gauges the susceptibility of ecological and environmental systems worldwide to catastrophic climate change disasters, with the main drivers being the inherent and stable environmental circumstances of each nation. Adjustments to the ND-GAIN assessment framework are brought about by changes in the sensitivity dimension, which takes into account a nation's dependence on sectors hit hard by climate-related disasters, including the percentage of impacts caused by climate change and the responsiveness of the economic sector to these kinds of occurrences. A country's social adaptation to climate change is a reflection of its ability to respond to the harm that climate change disasters inflict by mobilizing social resources, which can vary over time.</p><p>We examine the effect of China's BRI investments on the three categories of climate change vulnerability in partner nations by breaking down the ND-GAIN Vulnerability Index into these three dimensions (Table 7). As shown in Columns 2 and 3, the nations that are co-building the BRI with China can greatly mitigate the dangers associated with climate change.</p><h>Table 7.</h><p>Dimensional impacts of climate change vulnerability risk.</p><p>**p\u2009&lt;\u20090. 05, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090. 01; the values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>Three important aspects of a country's vulnerability to climate change are its exposure to hazards, its sensitivity to disasters caused by climate change, and its adaptive capability to handle the consequences of climate change.

As shown in columns 2 and 3, the nations that are co-building the BRI with China can greatly mitigate the dangers associated with climate change.</p><p>Column 4 shows that the societal adaptive capacity to climate change in co-building nations is not considerably improved by China's BRI investments, which increases risk exposure and disaster susceptibility. For this reason, China's BRI expenditures mainly help partner nations become less vulnerable to risks and disasters, rather than more adaptable to climate change. The main reason for this is that the BRI is more concerned with promoting economic development and enjoying its fruits than with combating climate change head-on. One unintended consequence of China's FDI is the mitigation of climate change sensitivity issues in other countries. The nations\u2019 adaptive capacities to climate change are not, however, targeted or improved by these investments.</p><p>Both the CFDI and AllFDI coefficients are positive, according to the dependent variable analysis. However, only the AllFDI coefficient is significant at the 1% level. Results like these show that China's BRI investments do not have the same impact as total FDI, which can raise carbon emissions per capita in nations along the route. To rephrase, the \u201cemissions transfer\u201d problem has not worsened as a result of China's investments in the BRI. Since the over-reliance on fossil fuels is a major contributor to the world's carbon emissions problem, measuring a country's energy intensity can tell us a lot about its energy transition and its attempts to cut carbon emissions. To further support the absence of a emissions transfer issue, columns 4 and 5 analyze the effect of China's BRI investments on energy intensity levels in co-building countries. The results demonstrate that neither total FDI nor the BRI investments have a significant impact on these levels.</p><p>Table 8\u2019s last two columns provide a direct evaluation of the carbon emissions and FDI levels of BRI nations. Both the CFDI and AllFDI coefficients are statistically significant at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. Therefore, carbon emissions in co-building countries are substantially increased by total FDI, but they can be somewhat reduced by the resources of China's FDI. Investments made as part of China's BRI have not worsened the emissions transfer problem, as this result shows.</p><h>Table 8.</h><p>Supplementary analysis.</p><p>*p\u2009&lt;\u20090.10, **p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05, ***p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01; the values in parentheses are robust standard errors.</p><p>Investments in China's BRI can, in a nutshell, make co-building nations less susceptible to climate change concerns without substantially increasing their carbon emissions levels, and they can even help reduce those emissions. Green investment methods, the notion of sharing development outcomes, and active investments in green infrastructure, renewable energy, and bioenergy initiatives are largely responsible for this. Investment projects\u2019 profitability and sustainability are taken into account in this strategy. This discovery provides strong evidence in favor of the study's fourth hypothesis and, in response to Western media's baseless critiques, highlights the environmentally friendly basis of China's BRI.</p><h>Supplementary analysis</h><p>The investments made by China as part of its BRI have long been the target of criticism from some Western nations, which claim that they enable \u201cpollution transfer.\u201d The positive effects of lowering partner countries\u2019 climate vulnerability might be diminished by this unflattering depiction. Moreover, these claims may be part of a larger effort to delegitimize the BRI by implying that, in return for reducing the risks associated with climate change, the initiative causes partner states to raise their carbon emissions.</p><p>We must give facts to refute these accusations and show that China's BRI investments can be beneficial without producing \u201cemissions leakage.\u201d This study seeks to prove that the investments made by China through the BRI successfully reduce vulnerability to climate change without increasing carbon emissions. Three linked variables were evaluated to estimate the impact of BRI investments on carbon emissions: total carbon emissions, energy intensity, and per capita carbon emissions. In addition, the research contrasts the results of AllFDI in partner nations with those of CFDI. The outcomes of the regression analysis are displayed in Table 8. The correlation between BRI funding and carbon emissions per capita in participating nations is discussed in columns 2 and 3. While the AllFDI coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% level, the CFDI coefficient is positive as well, according to the results. As a result, it appears that China's BRI investments have not worsened emissions transfer, even though total FDI can raise per capita carbon emissions levels. The main reason for global carbon emissions is the excessive consumption of fossil fuels. A country's energy intensity can tell us how much energy it relies on for economic development and whether or not it is considering switching to cleaner energy sources. Energy intensity in partner nations is unaffected by either CFDI or AllFDI, according to columns 4 and 5, which analyze the effect of BRI investments on this metric. This lends credence to the idea that China's BRI investments do not involve any emissions transfer problem.</p><p>Total carbon emissions in partner countries and their connection with FDI are evaluated in the final two columns of Table 8. At the 5% level, the AllFDI coefficient is strongly positive, meaning that carbon emissions are going up. However, at the 10% level, the CFDI coefficient is significantly negative, meaning that direct investment from China can only go down in emissions by a certain amount.</p><p>Finally, without substantially raising carbon emission levels in partner nations, China's BRI investments can lessen climate vulnerability concerns and might possibly help bring about reductions in carbon emissions. This result is in line with the sustainable development goals and green investment principles of China's BRI. While disproving baseless assertions made by Western media about China's BRI, this finding provides strong support for the study's fourth hypothesis.</p><h>Conclusions and policy recommendations</h><p>Focusing on the effects of income growth and political stability, this study uses econometric approaches to examine how China's BRI investments affect the susceptibility risks of climate change in participating nations. This study takes a more holistic view, based on the idea of a shared human destiny, as opposed to earlier work that mostly focused on the economic effects of BRI. In doing so, it hopes to fill a knowledge vacuum about BRI's beneficial impact on combating global climate change and improve comprehension of its accomplishments. The study debunks Western nations\u2019 unfounded claims of emissions leakage and highlights the environmentally friendly nature of China's BRI projects by offering proof.</p><p>There are multiple major takeaways from the research. First, the degree to which partner nations are vulnerable to climate change and their capacity to respond to it have both been significantly diminished by China's BRI investments. Second, partner nations\u2019 economic development levels, closeness to China, and trade links with China determine the extent to which BRI investments reduce risk. Particularly affected are emerging nations, those bordering China, and those that have free trade agreements with China. Lastly, investments in the BRI boost political stability and economic growth in partner nations, which in turn decreases the likelihood of climate change-related losses and increases resilience. In addition to reducing climate change sensitivity risks, the fourth benefit of China's BRI investments is that they have no influence on the overall, per capita, or energy intensity of carbon emissions in the partner nations. An international effort is required to combat climate change, which is a critical issue on a global scale. Promoting global governance on climate change is an important aspect of the BRI mission to create a global community that shares a common future with all people. Several policy proposals are made to advance this goal throughout the report. Prioritizing the BRI's function as a \u201cgreen path\u201d and \u201cpath to solving global climate issues,\u201d raising consciousness about the need for green transformation and low-carbon growth, should be the first step in whatever comes next. This involves reassuring partner nations about the BRI's ability to improve global climate governance and encouraging them to work together more closely by addressing their concerns. The BRI should also act in accordance with the win-win cooperation principle, ensuring that partner nations benefit from high-quality development while also concentrating on project sustainability and profitability. Economic development, higher incomes, and more political stability can be achieved by coordinating BRI projects with the investment requirements of partner nations and China's industrial capabilities. This will increase their ability to combat climate change.</p><p>Contrary to what some Western countries have said, China's investment in the BRI not only mitigates the dangers of climate change vulnerability for partner countries but also avoids the emissions transfer problem. In the future, China's business investments in the BRI should keep focusing on green and growing industries in the countries that are partners. In order to help partner nations with their energy transitions and industrial transformations, BRI investments can tap into China's advanced renewable energy and new energy vehicle industries. In pursuit of carbon neutrality and the larger goals of the BRI, this will be crucial.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link to PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"10117720578911251326144\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"61903\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Alami I, Dixon AD,  (2022) \u2018Expropriation of capitalist by state capitalist\u2019: Organizational change and the centralization of capital as state property.

According to news reporting originating from Kitakyushu, Japan, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In the context of climate change, urban blue-green infrastructure (UBGI), consisting of water and vegetation, has received extensive attention for urban microclimate improvement. However, the detailed quantification of spatial relationships between blue and green infrastructure elements has not been conducted about the thermal environment.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), China Scholarship Council, Opening Fund of State Key Laboratory of Green Building in Western China. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Kitakyushu, \"To study the synergistic effect of water and vegetation, this paper conducted the field measurement and questionnaire on typical UBGI in Tianjin, China. The spatial characteristics and the current situation of the thermal environment of UBGI were obtained, and the thermal demands of UBGI users were established based on the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and heat index (HI). The results of the study indicated that the synergistic effect of the water body and vegetation was the most significant at a distance of 6 m from the water body. In the condition of light airflow (wind speed &amp; LE;1.5 m/s), the different orientations relative to the water body had no significant difference in the thermal environment. Based on the quantification of spatial relationships, the conversion factors (cT and cRH) of the synergistic effect at different locations in UBGI were obtained. Furthermore, synergistic effect (SE) models of the thermal environment of UBGI were established according to the conversion factors. Meanwhile, the thermal comfort benchmarks for SE models were quantified (WBGT: 25.76-27.96 degrees C and HI: 24.98-27.25 degrees C).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study provides scientific guidance and reference for the planning and redevelopment of UBGI.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: A New Method for Evaluating the Synergistic Effect of Urban Water Body and Vegetation In the Summer Outdoor Thermal Environment.

(hereinafter Misawa Homes) today announced the start of joint trials to personalize shared spaces using authentication technology developed by Fujitsu. Through their trials, Fujitsu and Misawa aim to explore how to offer families and visitors alike comfortable, personalized, secure new ways to experience life at home. Trials started on June 2023 and are scheduled to continue until January 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fujitsu and Misawa Homes installed a facial recognition sensor at the reception area and cameras in the common space of a model house (1) built by Misawa Homes in 2021 to showcase Fujitsu's technology for continuous authentication, which identifies residents and visitors through cues like their clothing or posture. By continuously identifying people and their movements in the surrounding environment, the technology can help to detect emergency situations including falls and possible injuries of residents or visitors as well as unidentified intruders, to ultimately contribute to the realization of safer housing.</p><p>The two companies are further conducting trials leveraging this technique to realize personalized living spaces tailored to residents' personal preferences and needs.</p><p>Fujitsu and Misawa plan to explore further use cases for the technology, including in contexts where safety is paramount, including nursing homes and hospitals.</p><p>Background</p><p>Misawa Homes has been focusing on the development of housing models that contribute to the solution of various societal issues. In 2021, Misawa Homes constructed the \"Green Infrastructure Model,\" a model house that aims to achieve sustainability in the three areas life, health, and the environment. Misawa Homes is further engaged in a wide range of initiatives to solve societal issues through innovation, including the development of housing solutions and demonstration trials across industries.</p><p>As part of its vision for \"Trusted Society,\" one of its key focus areas under \"Fujitsu Uvance,\" Fujitsu is promoting various initiatives to contribute to the realization of a prosperous and sustainable society. Fujitsu in the 1980s started R&amp;D in biometric technologies, creating new technologies not only for managing access to personal devices including PCs and smartphones, but also solutions for use in emergency situations.</p><p>Under the concept \"living in 2030,\" Fujitsu and Misawa Homes since 2021 have been focusing on the future of housing, where innovations like AI and biometric technologies will seamlessly integrate with living spaces to support and sustain society.</p><p>About the new technology</p><p>Fujitsu's technology for continuous authentication combines Fujitsu's biometric authentication and Actlyzer technology for sensing and analyzing the movement and actions of people. By linking the results of biometric identification with camera images of a specific person, the technology enables real time estimation of the position of that person while continuously authenticating them. The tracking of a person across multiple cameras remains difficult for conventional technologies because of variations caused by the positioning of cameras. To resolve this challenge, the newly developed technology enables identification of a person from multiple images based on features like clothing and a person's posture regardless of other variations in lighting, etc. All authentication processes run in the cloud, and results are sent to devices installed in a certain area.</p><p>In addition to application in living spaces, Fujitsu further aims to apply this technology to various solutions in public spaces including real time detection of emergency situations such as people falling or smooth cashless payments triggered by a person's specific movement or behavior.</p><p>Outline of the joint trials</p><p>1. Period</p><p>June 1, 2023 to January 31, 2024</p><p>2. Location</p><p>Model house \"Green Infrastructure Model\" at Misawa Park Tokyo, Japan</p><p>(The model house is a combination of public space and living space that is rented out as a shared office; the verification site is located at the shared office on the first floor)</p><p>3. Contents</p><p>Demonstration of technology for continuous authentication:</p><p>Identification of residents and visitors using equipment that does not interfere with the housing environment and design</p><p>Trials for personalized living spaces:</p><p>Motion detection for increased living comfort</p><p>Verification trials of secure living spaces:</p><p>Detection of abnormal activities and behavior including visitors entering without biometric authentication or visitors falling</p><p>Fujitsu and Misawa Homes are further testing the authentication technology at the shared office area for personalization of living/working spaces. Employees and business partners of Fujitsu and Misawa Homes authenticated by a sensor and camera installed in the share office can register their various preferences in the system, to automatically adjust settings in the room including lighting or speaker sounds (2).</p><p>Moving forward, the two companies will continue to contribute to the realization of secure and personalized living spaces that fit the needs of people's lives.</p><p>(1) Location: 2 -4 -5 Takaido-higashi, Suginami Ward, Tokyo, Japan (Within \"Misawa Park Tokyo\", access only with reservation)</p><p>(2) Personal information including biometrics, hobbies and preferences provided in a questionnaire will be deleted upon leaving the model house. Video data relating to movements within the area is strictly managed and used for anonymous verification, and deleted after the demonstration trials. Regarding the handling of personal information, visitors will have to sign a written agreement including information about the facial recognition registration application before participation in the trials.</p><p>About Fujitsu</p><p>Fujitsu's purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.

According to news originating from Tokyo, Japan, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"We investigated the power loss reduction of an n-channel 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with a blocking voltage of 10 kV by utilizing a box cell layout, which can enhance the conductivity modulation, instead of a conventional string cell layout. The box cell layout significantly reduced the on voltage of SiC IGBTs, which are a 35% and 29% reduction in the specific differential on-resistance at 25 degrees C and 150 degrees C, respectively.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Innovative Science and Technology Initiative for Security, Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ATLA), Japan. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Hitachi Ltd., \"Although enhancing the conductivity modulation should increase the turn-off loss, it has increased slightly, by 10% at 25 degrees C and by 5% at 150 degrees C with a load current of 250 A/cm(2) because the box cell layout can enhance the stored carrier, particularly near the emitter in the on-state. In contrast to the turn-off loss, turn-on loss was reduced by the box cell layout due to the enhancement of electron injection from the emitter, resulting in a lower total switching loss in comparison to a string-layout device.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"A lower on-voltage and switching loss of SiC IGBTs have both been achieved as a result of the box cell layout enhancing conductivity modulation enhancement.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Power Loss Reduction of N-channel 10-kv Sic Igbts With Box Cell Layout.

However, the direction of the US energy sector will also depend on underlying business trends, market tailwinds, technology headwinds, and, of course, the US Congress and court system. Just as container ships change course slowly over time, the US energy sector evolves gradually based on a mixture of industry, market, technology, and policy forces. Under the administration of President Donald Trump, the US ceded leadership on international and domestic climate change discussions. Under his 'Energy Dominance' platform, Trump tried to steer the energy sector in a direction that maximized US fossil fuel production and exports. </p><p>Now, as the administration of new President Joe Biden takes shape, the US energy sector will take another direction as the federal government undergoes a dramatic shift in its approach to energy and environmental policy. Following a broad consensus in the scientific community, Biden's climate platform seeks to set the US on a path toward economy-wide net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Biden's 'whole of government' approach tries to incorporate climate considerations across the entire US government. Biden will try to 'steer' the US energy sector toward his midcentury decarbonization goal, with supportive 'tailwinds' from a Democratic-controlled Congress. However, the Biden administration will need to navigate the opposing 'headwinds' of high costs of new clean technologies, lowpriced natural gas, and continued underlying US reliance on gasoline. Energy Trends in the US Over the last 50 years, oil, natural gas, and coal have fueled the US economy. Changes in the US energy mix have been gradual and driven in large part by external market factors - such as the oil shocks in the 1970s that led to greater use of coal and nuclear energy and the sustained high oil prices in the mid-2000s that sparked the so-called 'US Shale Revolution'. Only over the past decade has the US energy sector started to slowly change direction toward a decarbonized future. This is especially apparent in the power sector, which has experienced sharp declines in coal-fired power generation as natural gas and renewable energy offer lower-cost alternatives. In addition to economic factors, state and local policy, customer preferences, and investor demands are steering the US electricity sector away from carbon-heavy sources like coal. In other sectors, like transportation and the manufacturing industry, oil and natural gas continue to dominate as primary energy sources.</p><p>These sectors continue to favor low priced natural gasfueled processes and gasoline-powered technologies. For instance, despite years of federal and state incentives to promote alternative fuels in the transportation sector, sustained low gasoline prices have encouraged greater purchases of larger gas-powered vehicles and hindered the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EV) (Chart 1). Steering the Ship Unlike some other countries, the US federal government lacks the centralized authority to set a national energy mix. Federal laws tend to provide individual state governments with jurisdiction over their energy choices. Still, there are several policy 'tools' that the US federal government can use to steer the energy sector in a certain direction.</p><p>These policy tools primarily aim to guide the energy industry's business decisions by impacting the cost of operating and adopting certain energy technologies. 1. Environmental regulation: Environmental rules can increase or decrease a company's costs in utilizing various energy sources. For example, mercury regulations in the power sector led to the early retirement of dozens of coal-fired power plants that could not afford to implement emissions control technologies. 2. Research and development spending: The US federal government spends billions of dollars every year on RandD activities designed to decrease the costs of new technologies.</p><p>The purpose of energyrelated RandD is to drive down the capital and operating costs of new energy technologies so that utilities and energy companies can adopt these technologies on a business and cost-driven basis. 3. Tax policy: Both the federal and state governments use tax policy to incentivize the use of certain energy technologies. For example, companies can receive a federal income tax credit for building renewable energy projects.</p><p>The use of these policy tools differs across political party lines in the US. Specifically, Democrats tend to favor a larger federal government role that supports a combination of regulation and technology promotion - endorsing top-down regulation and increasing RandD funding for clean energy technologies. In contrast, Republicans tend to favor technology innovation solutions and market forces over regulation - generally promoting looser regulations and RandD funding that supports an 'all-of-the-above' energy solution perspective. Trump's 'Energy Dominance' Platform and Evolving Democratic Party Thinking When Trump assumed office in January 2017, his 'Energy Dominance' policy platform marked a sharp turn away from the 'Clean Energy Agenda' of the administration of President Barack Obama. Over the course of its four years in office, the Trump administration pursued policies that attempted to 'steer the ship' of the US energy sector toward energy 'independence' versus decarbonization. On the one hand, Trump promoted a traditional Republican approach to influencing the energy sector. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Department of Interior (DOI) ushered in an unprecedented rollback of environmental regulations impacting oil and gas production, transportation, and energy efficiency rules. Internationally, the Trump administration rejected the Paris Climate Agreement - a crowning achievement of the Obama administration - pulling the US out of the accord, and instead focused government attention on the promotion of US natural gas and coal exports. On the other, Trump had his own 'personal approach' to energy policy oftentimes directly contradicting the pro-market views of many Republicans. For example, the Trump Department of Energy (DOE) in 2017 urged federal electricity regulators to prop up economically struggling coal-fired power plants in competitive US wholesale electricity markets. This effort, eventually unsuccessful, argued that the early retirement of coal-fired power plants would erode US grid reliability and that out-of-market payments were needed to support these plants. However, US grid operators, researchers, and reliability watchdogs rejected this idea. Was Trump able to impact the energy sector and fundamentally shift the direction of the ship? From one perspective, Trump's policies did support continued oil and natural gas consumption in the transportation and industrial sectors. However, this trend was driven by low energy prices as a result of the Shale Revolution as much as by federal policy. From another perspective, Trump's 'Energy Dominance' agenda failed to 'turn the ship' away from underlying decarbonization trends in the US power sector (Charts 2 and 3). Perhaps an even greater consequence of Trump's pro-fossil fuel policies was on the Democratic Party's approach to climate change.</p><p>The 2018 midterm elections, generally considered a 'referendum' on Trump's first two years in office, sparked an evolution in mainstream Democratic climate thinking to incorporate more progressive policy positions. Frustrated with the Trump administration's policies, Democrats in Congress integrated their social and economic perspectives into their energy policy - to include the Democrats' 'Green New Deal' resolution introduced in February 2019. This proposal initiated an 18 month-long consensus-building mission within the Democratic Party to offer a counter proposal to Trump's 'Energy Dominance' platform. During the Democratic presidential primaries in early 2020, it was clear that the party was increasingly divided between moderates (focused on 'blue collar' and labor issues) and progressives (focused on environmental justice and social issues). On the moderate side, candidates such as Biden argued that the US should reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 through a wide variety of energy technologies, to include nuclear energy as well as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). On the progressive side, candidates such as Bernie Sanders, advocated for stricter policies, to include 100% renewable energy in the power sector by 2030 and a nationwide fracking ban. Biden's Climate Change Platform Immediately after Biden secured the Democratic nomination, party members worked to build a consensus between the moderate and progressive camps. In May 2020, Biden and Sanders jointly launched a series of 'Unity Task Forces' aimed at unifying the party ahead of the November elections.</p><p>The Climate Change Task Force, which issued a set of recommendations to the Biden campaign to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, was chaired by progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) and former Secretary of State John Kerry, a prominent 'establishment' member of the party who had been a top US negotiator for the Paris Climate Agreement under Obama. In Congress, Democrats in both chambers also introduced recommendations to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. In fact, in the US House of Representatives, the Democratic-controlled majority even passed several bills that incorporated other legislative interests into energy policy discussions, such as clean infrastructure and environmental justice issues.</p><p>These discussions within the Democratic Party resulted in the most comprehensive and ambitious climate change platform put forth by any presidential candidate from a major party. In July 2020, Biden released his platform, which incorporated clean energy, green infrastructure, and environmental justice goals. Biden's energy platform took a 'whole of government' approach to reaching netzero GHG emissions by 2050, incorporating climate considerations across US government programs, projects, and processes (Chart 4). Today, with the support of a narrow Democratic majority in both houses of Congress, Biden has the potential to enact significant policy and regulatory changes.</p><p>At the same time, however, he will also face the same market forces and political limitations as Obama and Trump before him in shaping the US energy sector.</p><p>The Biden Energy 'Team' Moving into the first year of the Biden administration, the Cabinet will play a crucial role in translating the Biden campaign platform into actionable policy items. Overall, the people he has asked to join his administration reflect the 'mainstream' of the Democratic Party and will support him in addressing his four major priorities: recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, rebuilding the US economy (with a focus on US manufacturing and job creation), enhancing racial equity and social justice in the US, and addressing climate change. Biden's energy and environment team includes several influential figures in and outside of the 'Washington circle', covering a variety of interests across the Democratic Party from manufacturing and labor to environmental justice. In the White House, Biden's top two energy and environment advisors hail from the Obama administration. Kerry, special presidential envoy for climate and a National Security Council member, heads international climate engagement efforts. Kerry will likely initially focus on reentering the Paris Agreement and later leading energy financing discussions at federal agencies like the US Export-Import Bank, the US International Development Finance Corporation, and US Agency for International Development, among others. On the domestic front, Gina McCarthy serves as the domestic climate policy coordinator in the White House, working to harmonize federal efforts on climate change and ensuring the entire government is working to reduce GHG emissions. McCarthy, who led the EPA in the Obama administration, will work across agencies like the EPA, DOE, and DOI. In contrast to Washington insiders Kerry and McCarthy, Biden's picks to lead to the DOE and EPA bring extensive state-level policymaking experience. Jennifer Grandholm, as secretary of energy, is well-known for her support of clean energy in both the power and transportation sectors to support US manufacturing and labor.</p><p>As the former Democratic governor of Michigan, Grandholm is also recognized for leading the state's automotive industry through the 2008 financial crisis - making her a natural fit to promote Biden's EV policies.</p><p>At the EPA, Biden chose Michael Regan to lead the federal agency responsible for regulating emissions from the power, transportation, and industrial sectors. Regan, who served as the top environmental regulator in North Carolina, brings to the EPA years of experience in public engagement with historically underserved and marginalized communities. Working with Congress Biden's ability to steer the US energy sector and implement his climate agenda will depend in part on his support in the 117th Congress. On the one hand, the Democrats' slim majority in Congress will allow Biden to confirm his Cabinet members and initiate efforts in the first few months in office.</p><p>Additionally, Biden is inheriting a congressional environment that recently approved billions of dollars in funding for clean energy and zero-emission technologies.</p><p>As one of its last major efforts in 2020, the 116th Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a massive omnibus bill that increased funding for clean energy RandD. Included in the omnibus bill are several clean energy provisions to support renewables, energy storage, nuclear energy, and CCUS/ direct air capture (DAC) technologies. In addition to expanding federal tax credits for solar, wind, and CCUS projects, the omnibus package also establishes demonstration programs and test centers to scale low-carbon energy technologies. On the other hand, despite narrow majorities in Congress, full legislative support for Biden's goals is not assured. During his first year in office, for example, Obama failed to pass a bill through the Democratic-controlled Congress that would have established emissions reduction requirements in the US energy sector.</p><p>The Waxman-Markey bill, as it was known, would have created a national cap-and-trade system for GHG emissions and required electric utilities to meet 20% of demand with renewable energy.</p><p>The bill narrowly passed the House of Representatives (219-212) in June 2009 but was never voted on in the Senate due to two main factors: (1) Republicans gained an extra seat in January 2010 following the death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, ending the Democrat's filibuster-proof majority in the Senate; and (2) Obama was pursuing another key legislative priority at the same time, the Affordable Care Act, which took the political focus away from Waxman-Markey. Biden will certainly face similar legislative 'headwinds' in Congress for his more ambitious policy proposals. Indeed, his legislative successes will depend on the posture of Republicans in Congress and whether they can attract moderate Democrats to disagree with Biden's bold policies. Republicans will certainly oppose any efforts to dramatically change federal powers, such as setting a national clean energy standard (CES).</p><p>As such, Biden will need to be strategic and deliberate in his legislative agenda during his first year. He will need to balance his climate change efforts with other legislative priorities, such as passing another Covid-19 stimulus package, and focus on areas of bipartisan consensus that align with his climate platform. Examples may include efforts to boost the US battery manufacturing supply chain, support for EVs, and funding for CCUS, hydrogen, and energy storage technologies. Potential Executive Actions As Biden works to solidify his legislative agenda, there are several near-term executive actions that he can take without the support of Congress. On his first day in office, Biden took steps to rejoin the Paris Agreement, sending a letter to the United Nations announcing the US intent on reentering.</p><p>After a 30-day waiting period, the US will officially be able to rejoin the agreement. Moving forward, Kerry will lead international climate efforts, acting as the US climate 'spokesperson'. Within his first few months in office, Biden will also incorporate climate considerations into US whole-of-government processes. Biden will direct the federal bureaucracy to examine how climate change can be addressed across US regulatory, program, procurement, and permitting processes.</p><p>A key agency in this regard will be the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Topics of discussion at the CEQ will include incorporating the social cost of carbon into government decision-making. Moving forward, Biden is likely to issue a set of Executive Orders aimed at initiating his regulatory agenda over the next several years.</p><p>The purpose of these Executive Orders will be to direct federal agencies to begin the necessary processes to propose new regulations. Initial efforts will likely focus on reversing the environmental rollbacks of the Trump administration, such as fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles, emissions limits for existing power plants, and targeting methane emissions from oil and gas production.</p><p>These near-term actions will not have an immediate impact, but rather they will serve to initiate many executive policies to support Biden's climate agenda. In the power sector, Biden aims to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2035. Without the explicit approval of Congress, however, it is unlikely that Biden would be able to implement a policy to achieve that goal. Indeed, the president alone does not have the legal authority to set a national CES. Under current law, power generation policy (and specifically a 'portfolio approach' to the power sector) is set by the individual states, not the federal government. Several state governments such as California, New York, and Hawaii have already set their own CES policies. Instead, Biden will likely issue an Executive Order directing federal agencies to examine rules and regulations to reach net-zero power sector emissions by 2035. It is likely that the EPA will be the primary agency behind new power sector regulations - though, again, history shows this may prove to be more difficult to implement in practice.</p><p>The Obama administration's 2015 Clean Power Plan, which set carbon dioxide (CO2) regulations for power plants, faced several legal challenges regarding the EPA's authority to change the US energy mix.</p><p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is also likely to play a role in implementing Biden's power sector policies, though to a lesser extent.</p><p>Although the president cannot direct FERC to finalize specific orders, the White House does have the power to influence certain issues that FERC may examine as well as influence the composition of FERC's commissioners. For instance, under a Biden administration, future FERC commissioners may in fact be open to examining the role of carbon pricing in US wholesale electricity markets. In the transportation sector, Biden aims to develop new regulations promoting EV sales and reducing vehicle emissions. Biden will likely direct the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop stricter corporate average fuel economy standards than currently set by the Trump administration. Biden will work with states like California to set vehicle emissions standards that gradually increase over time. Indeed, the Biden EPA will likely develop vehicle regulations similar to - if not stricter than - those set by the Obama EPA in 2013. 'Oh Captain, My Captain': Biden's Energy and Environment Policy Outlook Without a doubt, the Biden administration will usher in a new approach to energy and environmental policy in Washington. Biden's 'whole of government' approach to addressing climate change and inclusion of environmental justice initiatives mark a considerable shift away from the 'Energy Dominance' agenda of the past four years under Trump. Yet Biden has also promised to work as hard for those who did not vote for him as those who did.</p><p>As Biden attempts to 'govern from the middle', he will need to balance the differing priorities of moderates and progressives within his own party as well as work with Republicans who may not agree with his 2050 decarbonization goals. Despite his bold policies and narrow majorities in Congress, Biden will not be able to rapidly steer the US energy sector toward decarbonization.</p><p>The decentralized nature of the US energy sector does not allow for complete control by any one person or branch of government. But maybe, with enough support in Congress and the right market tailwinds, Biden - as 'captain' of this complex and vast energy and environment sector enterprise - will be able to put in place the requisite policies that will point the ship in the right direction towards an energy mix that is both responsible and worthy of the new administration's ambitious goals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAPNEC-JEF300420210007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAPNEC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62JR-R5H1-JCH9-G1XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Japan Economic Foundation (JEF) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Japan Economic Foundation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35387\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 40</volume><issueNumber>No. 02</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 30, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Its forecast for advanced economies for 2020 is -5.8% and that for 2021 is 3.9%, while the forecasts for emerging market and developing countries (excluding China) are -5.7% in 2020 and 5.0% in 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forecast for the Chinese economy is 1.9% in 2020 and 8.2% in 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The IMF sees a growing divergence in recovery between China and other nations and also between developing economies excluding China and advanced economies (Table). By the end of 2021, the loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected level for emerging and developing economies excluding China is -8.1%, much larger than the loss for advanced economies of -4.7% (Chart). It would take a long time for economies that have suffered from such a great loss to recover. Employment will remain below pre-pandemic levels and investment will be held back by uncertainty and balance sheet problems, with lost schooling impairing human capital.</p><p>After 2021, the IMF predicts global growth to be around 3.5%, a gradual slowdown but still steady growth over the mid-term, but the cumulative loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected path is predicted to grow from $11 trillion over 2020-2021 to $28 trillion over 2020-2025. This means large output losses and a severe setback to the improvement in living standards in the long term. In this regard, the recovery process will be long and tough. Divergence is seen not only among nations and regions but also among people in each economy.</p><p>As low-income workers, youth and women are harder hit by the pandemic crisis, the poor are getting poorer, with close to 90 million people in the world expected to fall into extreme deprivation in 2020. But tremendous uncertainty remains around the outlook with both downside and upside risks.</p><p>The virus is resurging with localized lockdowns being re-instituted. If this worsens and prospects for treatments and vaccines deteriorate, the toll on economic activity would be severe and likely amplified by severe financial market turmoil. Growing restrictions on trade and investment and rising geopolitical uncertainty could harm the recovery. On the upside, faster and more widespread availability of tests, treatments, vaccines and additional policy stimulus can significantly improve outcomes. Thus, overall, the recovery process for the global economy in 2021 can be characterized as 'a long, uneven and uncertain ascent'.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential that fiscal and monetary policy support is not prematurely withdrawn. Considerable fiscal support and loose monetary policy overall has prevented the global economy from falling into catastrophe so far.</p><p>There is still much to be done to ensure a sustained recovery, including greater international collaboration to achieve enough production and widespread distribution of vaccines to all parts of the world, continuing to provide income support, wage subsidies and unemployment insurance, and policies supporting reallocation of workers from shrinking sectors to growing sectors. Emerging market and developing economies will need to prioritize critical spending on health and on the poor, and ensure maximum efficiency as well as continued support such as international grants and concessional financing. Policies should be also designed with an eye toward placing economies on paths of stronger, equitable and sustainable growth.</p><p>For example, the global easing of monetary policy, while essential for the recovery, should be complemented by measures to prevent the build-up of financial risks over the medium term. Investments in health, digital infrastructure, green infrastructure and education can help achieve productive, inclusive and sustainable growth. Expanding the safety net where gaps exist can ensure the most vulnerable are protected while supporting near-term activity. In the light of the worst crisis since the Great Depression, it will take significant innovation on the policy front, at both the national and international levels, to recover from this calamity. Questions on Some Major Economies and Assumptions on the Pandemic The press conference mentioned above produced some interesting observations on the major economies, and also on assumptions about how long the pandemic would continue.</p><p>A QandA with these points highlighted follows. 1) The US economy and other hard-hit economies Q: The new forecast is for a decline of 4.3% in US GDP in 2020, a shift of 3.7 percentage points from the IMF forecast in June 2020 of an 8.0% decline. Why has there been such a big turnaround in the forecast for the United States? Gopinath: For the US we do have a significant upgrade for the forecast this year.</p><p>And it comes from a couple of factors. One is that in the second quarter, the recovery came about sooner than we expected, and continuing into Q3 the indicators have been strong. Part of the challenge in forecasting in this crisis is that we have to rely on high-frequency indicators like mobility to be able to project where economies are headed. That relationship between mobility and economic activity has changed quite a bit since April and March when there was a severe lockdown as opposed to what we are seeing right now. Milesi-Ferretti: One factor is that we had a stronger performance in the second quarter than what we were anticipating.</p><p>There is more of a recovery in the third quarter. We were thinking that the increase in the number of infections could imply some decline in mobility and activity, but that has not really materialized during the third quarter and that has been one of the factors. Q: When do you expect some of the hardest-hit countries including the US, European nations, and Latin America to rebound to pre-pandemic levels of output? Gopinath: If you exclude China from our 2020 numbers, cumulative growth between 2020 and 2021 is going to be negative for the global economy. For many countries, we are seeing a return to 2019 levels - not in per capita terms - by 2022 but there are some regions of the world where it is projected to take even longer, and Latin America, for instance, we have returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2023.</p><p>There is variation - China is already exceeding 2019 levels in 2020 and continuing to grow cumulatively by 10% between 2020 and 2021, but for many other countries around the world the return is gradual - by 2022 or 2023. 2) Indian economy Q: India has been badly hit by the pandemic. What is your view of the government's response so far? Has enough be done? What other measures are needed to support the economy and help it get back on track? Gopinath: We do have a significant downgrade for India's growth for FY 2021: it is minus 10.3%.</p><p>The hit to the economy has been large and broad-based, and you saw that in the April/May/June period. In terms of what can be done going forward, on the fiscal side we believe there is more that can be done to provide support to households who have been affected by this, and to provide support to firms that have been affected, and to tilt the composition of support towards more of the direct spending and tax relief measures, and to rely slightly less on the liquidity support measures and guarantees, which are clearly important to support the provision of credit in the economy. But if you look at the approach that was taken, there was more of an emphasis on that kind of measure, and we think there is room to recalibrate and to provide more direct relief and spending support which could have a first-order impact on preventing even worse outcomes. On the monetary policy side, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had come in very aggressively early on. It has paused recently with its interest rate cuts, looking through this spike in inflation that it has had recently. But we believe there is more that the RBI can do too, if there is room to cut\u2026if needed\u2026and we think that should be done once this inflation spike is more under control.</p><p>And together with these efforts both on the fiscal side and the monetary side, we think that would put India on a path to recovery.</p><p>There have also been efforts recently on the structural side to improve medium-term growth prospects. We have had progress on labor reform bills and we think this will advance the structural reform agenda in an important way, remove supply-side constraints in the agricultural sector and in the labor market also allow for a better matching of workers with firms, provide firms with a bit more flexibility in terms of hiring options, and also provide more social security and safety net options for workers as well. So with those structural elements in place as well to reinforce cyclical support, the Indian economy will be well-placed to recover from this horrible crisis that it is experiencing right now. 3) Impact of the failure of a EU-UK trade deal on the European Union and United Kingdom Q: What would be the impact of the failure of the EU and the UK to agree on a trade deal? Gopinath: We are obviously in the final 100 meters of these negotiations, and we are hoping that there will be an agreement. We had said that the lack of a deal would further reduce GDP by 3.5% to 4.5% over a two-year period after a no-deal Brexit, which would be a significant hit to growth for the UK and also for some of the smaller economies in the EU.</p><p>A baseline assumption is that there will be some kind of agreement. 4) Japanese economy Q: Japan has one of the lowest rates of Covid cases, but economic growth is said to be minus 5%. This is worse than the US and other countries, and recovery next year could be slower than in other countries. Could you explain the reason for this? Gopinath: In the case of Japan, I would say that compared to other advanced economies Japan is not among the worst hit just in terms of GDP numbers. It has been able to control the pandemic quite well and has provided extraordinary amounts in terms of fiscal and monetary support. So we are seeing slow signs of recovery. Of course, Japan does depend on external demand, and as long as that remains subdued it is going to weigh on the economy. Over the medium term, it does make a big difference what the pre-trends are for a country in terms of where it is headed with regard to an aging population and low productivity growth. That explains the numbers that we have. 5) Brazilian economy Q: Could you give more details as to why the IMF reduced the drop in Brazil's GDP in 2020 and reduced the projection for the country's growth in 2021, compared with your June outlook? Gopinath: We do have an upgrade for Brazil since our June numbers, and this reflects the fact that recoveries after re-openings came about a little bit faster.</p><p>Again, these are pretty tough recessions but the recovery was a little bit faster over there partly because of the extension of some fiscal support measures.</p><p>There has been a big expansion this year in terms of fiscal support but then there is going to be a negative impact coming because of the pulling back of that support likely to be implemented. Milesi-Ferretti: Let me just add that we really have to look at what we are projecting for the level of economic activity in 2021 and not just the growth rate. We are seeing a less deep recession this year than we were anticipating and that is also because of very substantial fiscal and monetary support that was absolutely essential to preserve livelihoods, together with the health policy response. But when you lift the level of activity in 2020, the growth rate in 2021 is going to be relative to a higher base and hence will look lower. But overall activity in 2021 is a lot stronger than we were anticipating in June. Still, we would like to see a stronger recovery and it is very important to make sure that support is well-targeted but not withdrawn too early. 6) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies Q: How can the MENA region countries work to improve their macroeconomic signs amid the ongoing crisis, especially with the expected second wave of the virus? Gopinath: The MENA regions are being hit by the pandemic quite severely, and you can see that in our projections in terms of contractions of 4% in 2020.</p><p>There are, of course, very different regions in MENA countries.</p><p>There are oil exporters that are being hit by oil production cuts.</p><p>Then you have countries that are oil importers but tend to rely on tourism and remittances and they are getting hit on that front too, and you also have fragile states in that area. So what we have learned from international experience is that dealing with further waves of the virus will require more smart and targeted lockdowns, localized as much as possible, and also people relying very heavily on wearing masks and social distancing and hygiene. Measures of that kind made the second wave of the virus that we saw in many parts of the world in the summer have a much smaller negative impact than what we saw in the spring. Milesi-Ferretti: Let me just add that it has been a tragic crisis across the globe but the pandemic has hit countries in the MENA region very severely, the second most severely after Latin America. It is a big challenge because of the impact of the pandemic and the impact of declining oil prices for exporters, and some countries like Egypt that rely heavily on tourism are also hit by that.</p><p>So really, containing the pandemic and maintaining the policy support that is needed to protect the most vulnerable is essential. 7) Assumptions on the pandemic in the forecast Q: What is the baseline for when the virus will be brought under control as of now? Gopinath: We are assuming, based on our consultations with public health officials, that it will take until the end of 2022 to bring local transmissions down to low levels pretty much everywhere in the world. So this is going to take some time, even though there is the prospect of vaccines and treatments.</p><p>The lags that there will be in terms of production and delivery are other factors, and also the effectiveness of these measures is another reason why we believe it will take a couple of years before we come down to low levels of local transmission. JEF Interview with Dr. Gian Maria MilesiFerretti for Further Thoughts 1) Consumption growth JS: I would like to ask your opinion about pent-up demand. Consumption growth would be a key to economic growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021. Lockdown policies should create pent-up demand, but how do you think this will contribute to growth? Milesi-Ferretti: I think pent-up demand is clearly important for things like consumer durables or potentially investment goods if the news on recovery is positive. Those are things that you can postpone during a downturn and then buy later. We have seen this since the trough in April; we have seen consumption and retail sales recover in a number of countries.</p><p>The problem is that a lot of the hit to consumption comes from a decline in consumption of services provided in contact-intensive sectors. For sure we would all love to go to restaurants if everything turned out to be fine, but it is not as if we will have five times more meals at restaurants if things turn out better than we would have had otherwise, so some of the loss in activity is permanent. We cannot travel 11 months a year because we have not travelled for a while. Clearly, there will be a pickup, there is a bit of pent-up demand in some sectors, but it is not the same as going to buy a car, for example. 2) Labor market JS: In Japan now, the unemployment rate is increasing due to the pandemic, as it is in the US and other countries. What is your view regarding the prospect for employment rates overall?</p><p>Milesi-Ferretti: This is one of the reasons why this is such an awful crisis. It affects the contact-intensive services sectors that by their own nature have high employment.</p><p>They typical employ relatively lower-skilled people, a lot of young people, a lot of women, and unfortunately the hit to employment is very severe. We may not see it so much in the official unemployment figures because of all the schemes to protect employment and subsidize part-time work and the like, but ultimately we do have a very sharp decline in working hours because these sectors are operating at only a fraction of their capacity. It is a big challenge for countries because there is a lot of uncertainty going forward as to the extent and timing of these jobs coming back. We don't know whether we have to think about a massive reallocation of resources for sectors, or whether we have to wait it out until science comes to the rescue and allows us to go back to an almost normal pace of contact-intensive activity. For now, unfortunately that prospect is not there, and we need to think actively about labor force reallocation. JS: In thinking about labor force reallocation, technology might be key. Thanks to digital technology, economies may not necessarily be falling into more serious situations. However, digital technology is labor-saving and so in the long run a digital economy, which would expand after the pandemic, might have a negative impact upon employment. Milesi-Ferretti: You raise a point that many people were grappling with before the crisis.</p><p>There was a big discussion on automation and its likely impact on employment. We are thinking a lot about remote work - it is not a priori obvious to me why that would have a negative impact on employment. If anything, where it is feasible, it may allow people who are distant from places of work to join the labor force. What we are worried about is the future of contactintensive sectors because I think that due to the way societies and economic activities have evolved, the demand for contact-intensive services has gone up extensively and it goes up with the aging of populations as well. So it is important to fundamentally get the pandemic under control, get transmissions under control, and then we can hope that scientific research will yield those improved therapies and vaccines that will allow those sectors to come back.</p><p>If that does not happen, it is going to be a long and painful road because of the number of people employed by these sectors and the difficulty of doing labor reallocation on that scale. JS: At the same time, we are facing aging societies. We need to raise our labor productivity as much as possible, and I suppose the pandemic should reinforce that need. In that regard, perhaps digital technology would be a key to restoring the economy. Milesi-Ferretti: There are clearly some underlying trends in the way production is organized that will be enhanced by this crisis, and some of them will be good for productivity. We still need to have a holistic view of what is happening across the economy, and there are many other sectors that have started re-operating but under reduced productivity and reduced production costs. Think of medical care and all the additional precautions and filters and things that a normal dentist visit or therapist visit entails, or in a store. In the short run, there is clearly a severe hit to productivity.</p><p>There will be productivity gains from the ease of remote communication and digital technology for sure, but we have to recognize that this crisis is also bringing a number of additional costs, and we really need to concentrate our efforts on coming out of the medical emergency. 3) Concerns about inflation JS: The outlook emphasized the need for a loose monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, and the need to continue such macro policy in order to restore the economy. But there are concerns that this would lead to inflation afterwards. Milesi-Ferretti: I think that at the moment it is important to fight the war, and you really need to keep the connective tissue of the economy alive. It is essential for economic activity to allow firms to restart when restrictions are lifted, otherwise there will be no firms to re-open or it will be very costly and slow to restart activity. It is important, of course, to retain the institutional strength of central banks, so that you don't lose that credibility that anchors inflation expectations. But so far, if anything, the problems that we have in advanced economies are with inflation expectations being too low compared to what we would like, so I don't think that at the moment we should be primarily worried about potential price pressures.</p><p>Again, 'never say never' is something that needs to be on our radar screen, but in the current context supporting activity and the possibility of having deficient demand are much bigger challenges than having excess demand. 4) Concerns about trade protectionism JS: Turning to world trade, in the press briefing there was a question about the outcome of a late EU-UK FTA, and the environment surrounding world trade is very severe, due in part to rising protectionism. World trade has been significantly declining according WTO reports recently. How do you see the impact of this decline upon the world economy? Milesi-Ferretti: I would separate the two aspects of this. One is what has happened to global trade with this crisis. Because this crisis has been concentrated in contact-intensive services, this has had a very severe impact on trade in services, particularly tourism and transportation. However, the decline in trade in goods has been severe, but less so than one could have imagined given the size of the global GDP contraction. We have a falling global trade which is roughly the same order of magnitude as the one in 2009. Yet the decline in GDP in 2009 was minus 0.3%, and this time it is minus 4.4%.</p><p>The reason why this is happening is that a normal recession involves a collapse in manufacturing activity, in investment, in purchases of consumer durables, while in this crisis the main collapse has to been to services that are less traded than other goods. But there is a second part to your question - what about trade further down the road? What about the medium term? What about trade tensions and trade barriers? All those are very important threats to economic activity across countries, and clearly it is important for the international community to come together and address grievances and differences in order to minimize the impacts of those factors on trade, because trade has been an engine of growth and rising living standards for the last 30 years. 5) Macro policy international cooperation JS: The need for international cooperation is emphasized in your report. I am thinking about possible macro policy coordination.</p><p>All countries are now involved in an active fiscal policy and also suffer from fiscal debt that will impede growth in the future. What do you think of the idea of a new tax on financial assets adopted by all countries globally in order to share the burden of debt? Milesi-Ferretti: Once the emergency is over, countries will have a higher stock of public debt, and that higher stock has been incurred over the past year for very good reasons. You need to keep economic activity alive; you need to keep livelihoods going for people who lost their earnings to the extent possible. But there will be a challenge for governments to deal with this higher stock. Progressive taxation is clearly important on that score, particularly because you are facing a crisis that is taking a disproportionate hit on lower-skilled workers and is increasing inequality.</p><p>So there has to be an element of progressivity in tax measures on the personal side. Coming to something a bit closer to what you were exactly asking me - there is clearly an issue of having a system of international corporate taxation where everybody pays their fair share. It is clearly a very complex issue as well as a controversial one. But, you know, we need to have an international corporate taxation system that deals with the innovations in production and geographical allocation of production entailed by digital technology in an effective way, so that countries get their share of revenues and firms pay their fair share of revenues regardless of the type of economic activity they created. 6) Questions on long-term prospects JS: Looking at more long-term questions, one is about the nature of capitalism. In global supply chains, efficiency is a key concept for setting up supply chains. With the pandemic, efficiency is no longer a key concept; rather risk resilience or the redundancy of global supply chains might be the answer. Could this change the nature of capitalism or marketoriented economies? Milesi-Ferretti: I think that your point about resilience is very important. But I don't think that the implication of that is necessarily that you need a short supply chain, or something that is more domestically sourced. It is just a different set of risks, but you face risks anyway. It could be a domestic disruption as opposed to a cross-border one. I think that firms are actively engaged in trying to find ways to ensure the resilience of their supply chains. How this will pan out, we don't know.</p><p>A lot will depend on what happens to geopolitical tensions and whether we see a world with more fragmented technological standards, or more or less polarized, and what is going to happen to trade barriers and geopolitical relations more generally. Our hope is that the spirit of international cooperation prevails, and this goes well beyond economics and extends to things that are more important than the efficiency of supply chains. JS: Does the IMF have any plans to issue mid-term or long-term outlooks for the global economy? Milesi-Ferretti: For the first time, we are putting out a forecast over a five-year horizon. We have alternative scenarios and uncertainty is very high. My hope is that by April 2021 we will have better news on vaccines, and will have a better idea about the persistence of the shock and the ability of the economy to cope with this increase in cases in the past few weeks. Hopefully that will be done effectively and in a much less costly fashion than was the case during the big lockdowns in March, April and May. But uncertainty is very high and the best we can do is scenarios.</p><p>We have to be honest about the margins of uncertainty, which are very, very large, including on the third quarter just ended. Even with all the high-frequency indicators, with respect to normal circumstances, uncertainty is three times larger at least. We need to think through in a consistent fashion what alternative scenarios could look like, and think about policy options. We have to be ready to change our numbers and views and policies as the reality on the ground shifts. We have learned a lot, but we still face many difficulties posed by the pandemic to economic activities and there is a lot that we don't know.</p><p>Aggressive response is super important for economic activity and social reasons also, but also we need to be very flexible and be ready to adapt as the reality on the ground changes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAPNEC-JEF2802202100003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAPNEC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6232-9JF1-JCH9-G45N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Japan Economic Foundation (JEF) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Japan Economic Foundation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35387\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 40</volume><issueNumber>No. 01</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 28, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Its forecast for advanced economies for 2020 is -5.8% and that for 2021 is 3.9%, while the forecasts for emerging market and developing countries (excluding China) are -5.7% in 2020 and 5.0% in 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forecast for the Chinese economy is 1.9% in 2020 and 8.2% in 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The IMF sees a growing divergence in recovery between China and other nations and also between developing economies excluding China and advanced economies (Table). By the end of 2021, the loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected level for emerging and developing economies excluding China is -8.1%, much larger than the loss for advanced economies of -4.7% (Chart). It would take a long time for economies that have suffered from such a great loss to recover. Employment will remain below pre-pandemic levels and investment will be held back by uncertainty and balance sheet problems, with lost schooling impairing human capital.</p><p>After 2021, the IMF predicts global growth to be around 3.5%, a gradual slowdown but still steady growth over the mid-term, but the cumulative loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected path is predicted to grow from $11 trillion over 2020-2021 to $28 trillion over 2020-2025. This means large output losses and a severe setback to the improvement in living standards in the long term. In this regard, the recovery process will be long and tough. Divergence is seen not only among nations and regions but also among people in each economy.</p><p>As low-income workers, youth and women are harder hit by the pandemic crisis, the poor are getting poorer, with close to 90 million people in the world expected to fall into extreme deprivation in 2020. But tremendous uncertainty remains around the outlook with both downside and upside risks.</p><p>The virus is resurging with localized lockdowns being re-instituted. If this worsens and prospects for treatments and vaccines deteriorate, the toll on economic activity would be severe and likely amplified by severe financial market turmoil. Growing restrictions on trade and investment and rising geopolitical uncertainty could harm the recovery. On the upside, faster and more widespread availability of tests, treatments, vaccines and additional policy stimulus can significantly improve outcomes. Thus, overall, the recovery process for the global economy in 2021 can be characterized as 'a long, uneven and uncertain ascent'.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential that fiscal and monetary policy support is not prematurely withdrawn. Considerable fiscal support and loose monetary policy overall has prevented the global economy from falling into catastrophe so far.</p><p>There is still much to be done to ensure a sustained recovery, including greater international collaboration to achieve enough production and widespread distribution of vaccines to all parts of the world, continuing to provide income support, wage subsidies and unemployment insurance, and policies supporting reallocation of workers from shrinking sectors to growing sectors. Emerging market and developing economies will need to prioritize critical spending on health and on the poor, and ensure maximum efficiency as well as continued support such as international grants and concessional financing. Policies should be also designed with an eye toward placing economies on paths of stronger, equitable and sustainable growth. For example, the global easing of monetary policy, while essential for the recovery, should be complemented by measures to prevent the build-up of financial risks over the medium term. Investments in health, digital infrastructure, green infrastructure and education can help achieve productive, inclusive and sustainable growth. Expanding the safety net where gaps exist can ensure the most vulnerable are protected while supporting near-term activity. In the light of the worst crisis since the Great Depression, it will take significant innovation on the policy front, at both the national and international levels, to recover from this calamity. Questions on Some Major Economies and Assumptions on the Pandemic The press conference mentioned above produced some interesting observations on the major economies, and also on assumptions about how long the pandemic would continue.</p><p>A QandA with these points highlighted follows. 1) The US economy and other hard-hit economies Q: The new forecast is for a decline of 4.3% in US GDP in 2020, a shift of 3.7 percentage points from the IMF forecast in June 2020 of an 8.0% decline. Why has there been such a big turnaround in the forecast for the United States? Gopinath: For the US we do have a significant upgrade for the forecast this year.</p><p>And it comes from a couple of factors. One is that in the second quarter, the recovery came about sooner than we expected, and continuing into Q3 the indicators have been strong. Part of the challenge in forecasting in this crisis is that we have to rely on high-frequency indicators like mobility to be able to project where economies are headed. That relationship between mobility and economic activity has changed quite a bit since April and March when there was a severe lockdown as opposed to what we are seeing right now. Milesi-Ferretti: One factor is that we had a stronger performance in the second quarter than what we were anticipating.</p><p>There is more of a recovery in the third quarter. We were thinking that the increase in the number of infections could imply some decline in mobility and activity, but that has not really materialized during the third quarter and that has been one of the factors. Q: When do you expect some of the hardest-hit countries including the US, European nations, and Latin America to rebound to pre-pandemic levels of output? Gopinath: If you exclude China from our 2020 numbers, cumulative growth between 2020 and 2021 is going to be negative for the global economy. For many countries, we are seeing a return to 2019 levels - not in per capita terms - by 2022 but there are some regions of the world where it is projected to take even longer, and Latin America, for instance, we have returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2023.</p><p>There is variation - China is already exceeding 2019 levels in 2020 and continuing to grow cumulatively by 10% between 2020 and 2021, but for many other countries around the world the return is gradual - by 2022 or 2023. 2) Indian economy Q: India has been badly hit by the pandemic. What is your view of the government's response so far? Has enough be done? What other measures are needed to support the economy and help it get back on track? Gopinath: We do have a significant downgrade for India's growth for FY 2021: it is minus 10.3%.</p><p>The hit to the economy has been large and broad-based, and you saw that in the April/May/June period. In terms of what can be done going forward, on the fiscal side we believe there is more that can be done to provide support to households who have been affected by this, and to provide support to firms that have been affected, and to tilt the composition of support towards more of the direct spending and tax relief measures, and to rely slightly less on the liquidity support measures and guarantees, which are clearly important to support the provision of credit in the economy. But if you look at the approach that was taken, there was more of an emphasis on that kind of measure, and we think there is room to recalibrate and to provide more direct relief and spending support which could have a first-order impact on preventing even worse outcomes. On the monetary policy side, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had come in very aggressively early on. It has paused recently with its interest rate cuts, looking through this spike in inflation that it has had recently. But we believe there is more that the RBI can do too, if there is room to cut\u2026if needed\u2026and we think that should be done once this inflation spike is more under control.</p><p>And together with these efforts both on the fiscal side and the monetary side, we think that would put India on a path to recovery.</p><p>There have also been efforts recently on the structural side to improve medium-term growth prospects. We have had progress on labor reform bills and we think this will advance the structural reform agenda in an important way, remove supply-side constraints in the agricultural sector and in the labor market also allow for a better matching of workers with firms, provide firms with a bit more flexibility in terms of hiring options, and also provide more social security and safety net options for workers as well. So with those structural elements in place as well to reinforce cyclical support, the Indian economy will be well-placed to recover from this horrible crisis that it is experiencing right now. 3) Impact of the failure of a EU-UK trade deal on the European Union and United Kingdom Q: What would be the impact of the failure of the EU and the UK to agree on a trade deal? Gopinath: We are obviously in the final 100 meters of these negotiations, and we are hoping that there will be an agreement. We had said that the lack of a deal would further reduce GDP by 3.5% to 4.5% over a two-year period after a no-deal Brexit, which would be a significant hit to growth for the UK and also for some of the smaller economies in the EU.</p><p>A baseline assumption is that there will be some kind of agreement. 4) Japanese economy Q: Japan has one of the lowest rates of Covid cases, but economic growth is said to be minus 5%. This is worse than the US and other countries, and recovery next year could be slower than in other countries. Could you explain the reason for this? Gopinath: In the case of Japan, I would say that compared to other advanced economies Japan is not among the worst hit just in terms of GDP numbers. It has been able to control the pandemic quite well and has provided extraordinary amounts in terms of fiscal and monetary support. So we are seeing slow signs of recovery. Of course, Japan does depend on external demand, and as long as that remains subdued it is going to weigh on the economy. Over the medium term, it does make a big difference what the pre-trends are for a country in terms of where it is headed with regard to an aging population and low productivity growth. That explains the numbers that we have. 5) Brazilian economy Q: Could you give more details as to why the IMF reduced the drop in Brazil's GDP in 2020 and reduced 6 Japan SPOTLIGHT  January / February 2021 the projection for the country's growth in 2021, compared with your June outlook? Gopinath: We do have an upgrade for Brazil since our June numbers, and this reflects the fact that recoveries after re-openings came about a little bit faster.</p><p>Again, these are pretty tough recessions but the recovery was a little bit faster over there partly because of the extension of some fiscal support measures.</p><p>There has been a big expansion this year in terms of fiscal support but then there is going to be a negative impact coming because of the pulling back of that support likely to be implemented. Milesi-Ferretti: Let me just add that we really have to look at what we are projecting for the level of economic activity in 2021 and not just the growth rate. We are seeing a less deep recession this year than we were anticipating and that is also because of very substantial fiscal and monetary support that was absolutely essential to preserve livelihoods, together with the health policy response. But when you lift the level of activity in 2020, the growth rate in 2021 is going to be relative to a higher base and hence will look lower. But overall activity in 2021 is a lot stronger than we were anticipating in June. Still, we would like to see a stronger recovery and it is very important to make sure that support is well-targeted but not withdrawn too early. 6) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies Q: How can the MENA region countries work to improve their macroeconomic signs amid the ongoing crisis, especially with the expected second wave of the virus? Gopinath: The MENA regions are being hit by the pandemic quite severely, and you can see that in our projections in terms of contractions of 4% in 2020.</p><p>There are, of course, very different regions in MENA countries.</p><p>There are oil exporters that are being hit by oil production cuts.</p><p>Then you have countries that are oil importers but tend to rely on tourism and remittances and they are getting hit on that front too, and you also have fragile states in that area. So what we have learned from international experience is that dealing with further waves of the virus will require more smart and targeted lockdowns, localized as much as possible, and also people relying very heavily on wearing masks and social distancing and hygiene. Measures of that kind made the second wave of the virus that we saw in many parts of the world in the summer have a much smaller negative impact than what we saw in the spring. Milesi-Ferretti: Let me just add that it has been a tragic crisis across the globe but the pandemic has hit countries in the MENA region very severely, the second most severely after Latin America. It is a big challenge because of the impact of the pandemic and the impact of declining oil prices for exporters, and some countries like Egypt that rely heavily on tourism are also hit by that. So really, containing the pandemic and maintaining the policy support that is needed to protect the most vulnerable is essential. 7) Assumptions on the pandemic in the forecast Q: What is the baseline for when the virus will be brought under control as of now? Gopinath: We are assuming, based on our consultations with public health officials, that it will take until the end of 2022 to bring local transmissions down to low levels pretty much everywhere in the world. So this is going to take some time, even though there is the prospect of vaccines and treatments.</p><p>The lags that there will be in terms of production and delivery are other factors, and also the effectiveness of these measures is another reason why we believe it will take a couple of years before we come down to low levels of local transmission. JEF Interview with Dr. Gian Maria MilesiFerretti for Further Thoughts 1) Consumption growth JS: I would like to ask your opinion about pent-up demand. Consumption growth would be a key to economic growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021. Lockdown policies should create pent-up demand, but how do you think this will contribute to growth? Milesi-Ferretti: I think pent-up demand is clearly important for things like consumer durables or potentially investment goods if the news on recovery is positive. Those are things that you can postpone during a downturn and then buy later. We have seen this since the trough in April; we have seen consumption and retail sales recover in a number of countries.</p><p>The problem is that a lot of the hit to consumption comes from a decline in consumption of services provided in contact-intensive sectors. For sure we would all love to go to restaurants if everything turned out to be fine, but it is not as if we will have five times more meals at restaurants if things turn out better than we would have had otherwise, so some of the loss in activity is permanent. We cannot travel 11 months a year because we have not travelled for a while. Clearly, there will be a pickup, there is a bit of pent-up demand in some sectors, but it is not the same as going to buy a car, for example. 2) Labor market JS: In Japan now, the unemployment rate is increasing due to the pandemic, as it is in the US and other countries. What is your view regarding the prospect for employment rates overall? Milesi-Ferretti: This is one of the reasons why this is such an awful crisis. It affects the contact-intensive services sectors that by their own nature have high employment.</p><p>They typical employ relatively lower-skilled people, a lot of young people, a lot of women, and unfortunately the hit to employment is very severe. We may not see it so much in the official unemployment figures because of all the schemes to protect employment and subsidize part-time work and the like, but ultimately we do have a very sharp decline in working hours because these sectors are operating at only a fraction of their capacity. It is a big challenge for countries because there is a lot of uncertainty going forward as to the extent and timing of these jobs coming back. We don't know whether we have to think about a massive reallocation of resources for sectors, or whether we have to wait it out until science comes to the rescue and allows us to go back to an almost normal pace of contact-intensive activity. For now, unfortunately that prospect is not there, and we need to think actively about labor force reallocation. JS: In thinking about labor force reallocation, technology might be key. Thanks to digital technology, economies may not necessarily be falling into more serious situations. However, digital technology is labor-saving and so in the long run a digital economy, which would expand after the pandemic, might have a negative impact upon employment. Milesi-Ferretti: You raise a point that many people were grappling with before the crisis.</p><p>There was a big discussion on automation and its likely impact on employment. We are thinking a lot about remote work - it is not a priori obvious to me why that would have a negative impact on employment. If anything, where it is feasible, it may allow people who are distant from places of work to join the labor force. What we are worried about is the future of contactintensive sectors because I think that due to the way societies and economic activities have evolved, the demand for contact-intensive services has gone up extensively and it goes up with the aging of populations as well. So it is important to fundamentally get the pandemic under control, get transmissions under control, and then we can hope that scientific research will yield those improved therapies and vaccines that will allow those sectors to come back. If that does not happen, it is going to be a long and painful road because of the number of people employed by these sectors and the difficulty of doing labor reallocation on that scale. JS: At the same time, we are facing aging societies. We need to raise our labor productivity as much as possible, and I suppose the pandemic should reinforce that need. In that regard, perhaps digital technology would be a key to restoring the economy. Milesi-Ferretti: There are clearly some underlying trends in the way production is organized that will be enhanced by this crisis, and some of them will be good for productivity. We still need to have a holistic view of what is happening across the economy, and there are many other sectors that have started re-operating but under reduced productivity and reduced production costs. Think of medical care and all the additional precautions and filters and things that a normal dentist visit or therapist visit entails, or in a store. In the short run, there is clearly a severe hit to productivity.</p><p>There will be productivity gains from the ease of remote communication and digital technology for sure, but we have to recognize that this crisis is also bringing a number of additional costs, and we really need to concentrate our efforts on coming out of the medical emergency. 3) Concerns about inflation JS: The outlook emphasized the need for a loose monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, and the need to continue such macro policy in order to restore the economy. But there are concerns that this would lead to inflation afterwards. Milesi-Ferretti: I think that at the moment it is important to fight the war, and you really need to keep the connective tissue of the economy alive. It is essential for economic activity to allow firms to restart when restrictions are lifted, otherwise there will be no firms to re-open or it will be very costly and slow to restart activity. It is important, of course, to retain the institutional strength of central banks, so that you don't lose that credibility that anchors inflation expectations. But so far, if anything, the problems that we have in advanced economies are with inflation expectations being too low compared to what we would like, so I don't think that at the moment we should be primarily worried about potential price pressures.</p><p>Again, 'never say never' is something that needs to be on our radar screen, but in the current context supporting activity and the possibility of having deficient demand are much bigger challenges than having excess demand. 4) Concerns about trade protectionism JS: Turning to world trade, in the press briefing there was a question about the outcome of a late EU-UK FTA, and the environment surrounding world trade is very severe, due in part to rising protectionism. World trade has been significantly declining according WTO reports recently. How do you see the impact of this decline upon the world economy? Milesi-Ferretti: I would separate the two aspects of this. One is what has happened to global trade with this crisis. Because this crisis has been concentrated in contact-intensive services, this has had a very severe impact on trade in services, particularly tourism and transportation. However, the decline in trade in goods has been severe, but less so than one could have imagined given the size of the global GDP contraction. We have a falling global trade which is roughly the same order of magnitude as the one in 2009. Yet the decline in GDP in 2009 was minus 0.3%, and this time it is minus 4.4%.</p><p>The reason why this is happening is that a normal recession involves a collapse in manufacturing activity, in investment, in purchases of consumer durables, while in this crisis the main collapse has to been to services that are less traded than other goods. But there is a second part to your question - what about trade further down the road? What about the medium term? What about trade tensions and trade barriers? All those are very important threats to economic activity across countries, and clearly it is important for the international community to come together and address grievances and differences in order to minimize the impacts of those factors on trade, because trade has been an engine of growth and rising living standards for the last 30 years. 5) Macro policy international cooperation JS: The need for international cooperation is emphasized in your report. I am thinking about possible macro policy coordination.</p><p>All countries are now involved in an active fiscal policy and also suffer from fiscal debt that will impede growth in the future. What do you think of the idea of a new tax on financial assets adopted by all countries globally in order to share the burden of debt? Milesi-Ferretti: Once the emergency is over, countries will have a higher stock of public debt, and that higher stock has been incurred over the past year for very good reasons. You need to keep economic activity alive; you need to keep livelihoods going for people who lost their earnings to the extent possible. But there will be a challenge for governments to deal with this higher stock. Progressive taxation is clearly important on that score, particularly because you are facing a crisis that is taking a disproportionate hit on lower-skilled workers and is increasing inequality. So there has to be an element of progressivity in tax measures on the personal side. Coming to something a bit closer to what you were exactly asking me - there is clearly an issue of having a system of international corporate taxation where everybody pays their fair share. It is clearly a very complex issue as well as a controversial one. But, you know, we need to have an international corporate taxation system that deals with the innovations in production and geographical allocation of production entailed by digital technology in an effective way, so that countries get their share of revenues and firms pay their fair share of revenues regardless of the type of economic activity they created. 6) Questions on long-term prospects JS: Looking at more long-term questions, one is about the nature of capitalism. In global supply chains, efficiency is a key concept for setting up supply chains. With the pandemic, efficiency is no longer a key concept; rather risk resilience or the redundancy of global supply chains might be the answer. Could this change the nature of capitalism or marketoriented economies? Milesi-Ferretti: I think that your point about resilience is very important. But I don't think that the implication of that is necessarily that you need a short supply chain, or something that is more domestically sourced. It is just a different set of risks, but you face risks anyway. It could be a domestic disruption as opposed to a cross-border one. I think that firms are actively engaged in trying to find ways to ensure the resilience of their supply chains. How this will pan out, we don't know.</p><p>A lot will depend on what happens to geopolitical tensions and whether we see a world with more fragmented technological standards, or more or less polarized, and what is going to happen to trade barriers and geopolitical relations more generally. Our hope is that the spirit of international cooperation prevails, and this goes well beyond economics and extends to things that are more important than the efficiency of supply chains. JS: Does the IMF have any plans to issue mid-term or long-term outlooks for the global economy? Milesi-Ferretti: For the first time, we are putting out a forecast over a five-year horizon. We have alternative scenarios and uncertainty is very high. My hope is that by April 2021 we will have better news on vaccines, and will have a better idea about the persistence of the shock and the ability of the economy to cope with this increase in cases in the past few weeks. Hopefully that will be done effectively and in a much less costly fashion than was the case during the big lockdowns in March, April and May. But uncertainty is very high and the best we can do is scenarios. We have to be honest about the margins of uncertainty, which are very, very large, including on the third quarter just ended. Even with all the high-frequency indicators, with respect to normal circumstances, uncertainty is three times larger at least. We need to think through in a consistent fashion what alternative scenarios could look like, and think about policy options. We have to be ready to change our numbers and views and policies as the reality on the ground shifts. We have learned a lot, but we still face many difficulties posed by the pandemic to economic activities and there is a lot that we don't know.</p><p>Aggressive response is super important for economic activity and social reasons also, but also we need to be very flexible and be ready to adapt as the reality on the ground changes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAPNEC-JEF3112202000003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAPNEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61R3-33T1-F00C-60VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4505\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Japan Economic Foundation (JEF) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Japan Economic Foundation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35387\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 39</volume><issueNumber>No. 06</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 31, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Company will leverage this expertise to provide customers with consulting, design, deployment, and operation services aimed at building highly energy-efficient IT facilities. In order to optimize energy efficiency, Fujitsu Architects &amp; Engineers[1], a group of Fujitsu specialists with expertise in both IT and construction, will assist customers with the planning, design, deployment, and operation of their IT facilities.</p><p>By making IT facilities more energy efficient and reducing their power costs and environmental burden, Green Infrastructure Solution services will contribute toward lessening the environmental impact not only of Fujitsu customers but of society on the whole.</p><p>In recent years, IT has played an increasingly important role within corporations, and customers have gradually expanded their IT investments accordingly. While the strengthening of a company's IT infrastructure improves competitiveness, it also gives rise to a variety of problems, including increased power consumption and electric power costs, as well as a higher environmental burden. In particular, the increase in CO2 emissions has become an urgent problem, and addressing this issue is a high priority for management. In addition, due to the growth in the integration and scale of IT systems along with their longer running hours, IT departments are now confronted with inadequate power supplies and the burdens of augmenting and maintaining additional power equipment.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Fujitsu today begins providing Green Infrastructure Solutions designed to offer its customers IT facilities optimized for energy-efficiency. Based on the energy efficiency know-how Fujitsu has accumulated from deploying and operating 50 data centers throughout Japan, the Green Infrastructure Solution assists customers with the planning, design, deployment, and operation of their IT facilities from the comprehensive viewpoint of lifecycle management.</p><p>This solution aims to reduce customers' power consumption and CO2 emissions by as much as 50 percent of their current levels[2]. Moreover, it will enable IT systems to be expanded flexibly, unconstrained by power capacity, and gradually optimized in accordance with IT budgets. In addition, it will reduce the burdens associated with maintenance and renovation of IT facilities.</p><p>The Green Infrastructure Solution is positioned as one link in Fujitsu's Green Policy Innovation project for lessening customers' total environmental burden, and by extension, the environmental impact of society as a whole.</p><p>About the Green Infrastructure Solution</p><p>Fujitsu Architects &amp; Engineers, which possesses a high level of expertise in both the construction and IT fields, will take the lead in promoting and delivering solutions that optimize the energy efficiency of customers' entire IT facilities, including buildings, power supplies, and cooling equipment.</p><p>Specifically, Fujitsu will provide facility consulting ranging from the diagnosis of facility conditions to preparation of optimization plans; facility services that optimize the energy efficiency of customers' machine rooms and data centers, from design and construction through the operation stage; and outsourcing services that support, from design and deployment through operation, the energy efficiency and overall efficiency of customer IT facilities housed in Fujitsu data centers.</p><p>Main Features of the Green Infrastructure Solution</p><p>1) Utilizing specialized expertise to provide optimal energy efficiency</p><p>Fujitsu Architects &amp; Engineers will select various types of advanced technology relating to cooling, electric power, and machine room equipment and, giving careful consideration to suitability for the customer's IT assets and operational policies, will then optimize the energy efficiency of the entire facility.</p><p>2) Solutions that leverage accumulated experience in data centers</p><p>In the Fujitsu Tokyo Secondary System Center, which opened in December 2007, Fujitsu offers services driven by advanced technologies, including layout design using heat flow simulation[3], specially designed racks for data centers[4] with temperature monitoring capability. Fujitsu has accumulated energy efficiency know-how from deploying and operating 50 data centers throughout Japan. Based on this practical experience, the Company will optimize customers' machine rooms and data center facilities.</p><p>3) Technical strengths and facilities management methods only a total IT vendor can offer</p><p>Fujitsu will enhance the visualization, efficiency, and optimization of customers' IT facilities by leveraging its cutting-edge technologies, including IT facilities cost analysis systems and energy monitoring systems, along with facilities management methods the company has gained from management of such facilities. Using its technical strengths as a leading IT vendor, Fujitsu will verify the compatibility of servers, storage systems, and other types of IT equipment for the customer's IT facility from the viewpoint of cost and operation, and promote the optimization of the customer's overall IT environment.</p><p>Sales targets</p><p>40 companies adopting the service within three years and 5 billion yen in orders.</p><p>[1] Fujitsu Architects &amp; Engineers: Tokyo governor's registration number: 36599 (established December 16, 1987) Location: Ohta-ku, Tokyo</p><p>[2] 50 percent reduction in power consumption and CO2 emissions: Figure excludes power saving from IT products themselves, such as servers and storage systems.</p><p>[3] Layout design using heat flow simulation: Methods to prevent heat accumulation or recirculation by taking heat flow into account when installing cooling equipment and designing blower vents.</p><p>[4] Specially designed racks for data centers: Special racks developed by Fujitsu equipped with LED monitoring sensors that report irregularities in temperature or electric current.</p><p>About Fujitsu Ltd</p><p>Fujitsu Limited (TSE: 6702; ADR: FJTSY) is a leading provider of customer-focused IT and communications solutions for the global marketplace.

These technologies promise to reduce CO2 emissions by 40%(1) for IT facilities, including buildings, machine rooms, power supplies and air conditioners, which collectively account for over half of datacenter energy consumption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two companies plan to employ these technologies as the basis for an eco-friendly datacenter solutions business. Fujitsu Limited is currently applying these technologies at the new wing of its Tatebayashi System Center facility, in Tatebayashi, Gunma Prefecture, due to open in November 2009.</p><p>The technologies will be exhibited at the Fujitsu booth at CEATEC Japan 2009 from October 6-10 at Makuhari Messe.</p><p>About the Technologies</p><p>1. Energy-saving datacenter operations management system</p><p>Fujitsu and Fuji Electric Systems have developed technology to visualize energy consumption, from extra high voltage power supplies to server racks, as well as the temperature and air conditioning conditions of a datacenter. Based on this data, the system can enhance datacenter energy efficiency and air conditioning control. This system comprises several key technologies, which are explained below.</p><p>- Environment-monitoring sensor network</p><p>The system incorporates an environment-monitoring sensor network featuring compact, energy-efficient temperature and airflow sensors, developed by Fujitsu Laboratories Limited(2), in combination with Fujitsu's proprietary wired ad-hoc networking technology(3). This makes possible a self-configuring network that requires no special design or configuration, which keeps both deployment and operating costs low while allowing for large-scale, fine-grained environmental sensing with tens of thousands of sensors.</p><p>- Intelligent power distribution panel</p><p>Using newly developed branch breakers with built-in current sensors and high-precision multipoint power-collection equipment, the power distribution panel can monitor in detail each server load. The panel installation areas have been reduced to meet the smaller space requirements of compact server racks.</p><p>- Power supply optimization and facilities design guidance for datacenter expansion</p><p>When expanding IT resources, the system will automatically calculate the most efficient method to run electric wiring from the power distribution panel and breakers, where to install equipment, how to balance three-phase power, and what the air-conditioning requirements will be. This enables optimized cable routing and layout, helping make full use of power distribution panel, uninterruptable power supply systems, and air-conditioning equipment capacity for more efficient facility utilization.</p><p>- Rack-mounted step down transformer boxes</p><p>The management system utilizes a newly developed compact rack-mounted (2U) step down transformer (capacity: 2 kVA, input: 200 V, output: 100 V) for more efficient cabling designs.</p><p>2. Spot air conditioning system</p><p>The spot air conditioning system was developed as a way to eliminate hot spots within a datacenter. The air conditioning system, which uses the headroom above each server rack, employs Fuji Electric Systems technology used in refrigerated showcases for compact, efficient cooling. The system monitors the utilization of IT hardware and operates at an optimal balance of spot and systemic air conditioning to reduce the cooling system's energy demands by roughly 25% over previous systems(4).</p><p>3. Solar cells mounted to vertical noise baffles</p><p>Solar cells have been mounted on vertical noise baffles, something that was difficult to accomplish in the past. This takes advantage of lightweight film substrate solar cells from Fuji Electric Systems, and when used in combination with newly developed high-efficiency power conditioners, significant power savings can be achieved.</p><p>In addition to these jointly developed technologies, the new wing of the Tatebayashi System Center will benefit from a facility cooling design that uses outside air, common-area heating utilizing exhaust heat, and thermal flow simulations, all to conserve energy.</p><p>The two companies are each offering eco-friendly datacenter design solutions. Fujitsu is offering its Green Infrastructure Solution(5), and Fuji Electric Systems is offering Green IDC(6). Both companies expect that these technologies will be able to rapidly reduce the power consumption, electrical costs, and environmental footprints of the IT facilities at datacenters, and contribute to a reduced environmental footprint for society as a whole.</p><p>(1) Reducing CO2 emissions of IT facilities by roughly 40%: Comparison based on Fujitsu's own existing datacenter with comparable computing power as of 2007.</p><p>(2) Fujitsu Laboratories Limited: Headquarters: Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture. President: Kazuo Murano</p><p>(3) Wired ad-hoc networking technology: Communications devices automatically establish a network, using packet relay to deliver data to its destination. Applications are being researched for wireless networks. Fujitsu's proprietary ad-hoc technology was successfully applied in wired sensor networks.</p><p>(4) The cooling system's energy demands by roughly 25% over previous systems: Compared with an air conditioning system with spout below the floor set in a 1000m2 server room.</p><p>(5) Green Infrastructure Solutions: Building on the energy-saving expertise accumulated by the Fujitsu Group from the more than 50 datacenters it operates throughout Japan, Fujitsu's top-tier facilities construction team can evaluate, design, build and provide operational support for customer facilities.</p><p>(6) Green IDC: With its specialization in power electronics that freely control and convert electricity, Fuji Electric Systems offers high-efficiency UPS units that prevent servers from going down due to electrical outages, along with energy-saving equipment and high-efficiency air conditioners.</p><p>About Fujitsu Ltd</p><p>Fujitsu is a leading provider of IT-based business solutions for the global marketplace.
