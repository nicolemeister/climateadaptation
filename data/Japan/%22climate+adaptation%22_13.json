In this project, ClimateAi's long-term climate change forecasting technology, which models both the impact of climatic factors on agricultural production and the effectiveness of adaptation measures, was combined with NEC's expertise in agricultural technology (agritech) to successfully quantify the impact of climate change on agriculture and clarify the return on investment for adaptation measures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This achievement will be showcased at the TICAD Business Expo &amp; Conference (Japan Fair), one of the thematic events of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD 9) to be held in Yokohama, Japan, in August 2025, conveying the significance of utilizing digital technology to address the challenges facing African agriculture (*1).</p><p>Background and purpose</p><p>Globally, while greenhouse gas emission reductions and credit trading are actively being conducted to mitigate the effects of climate change, the implementation of adaptation measures to prevent or reduce damage caused by climate change has not yet progressed. This is due in part to the difficulties involved in assessing the investment cost-effectiveness of implementing adaptation measures.</p><p>Notably, although the agricultural sector is an industry highly susceptible to climate change, estimating the return on investment for adaptation measures, such as the introduction of irrigation facilities or changes in crop varieties, has thus far proven difficult due to the wide range of factors affecting crop growth, including temperature, water, and soil.</p><p>NEC and ClimateAi have developed a conceptual model that analyzes various factors affecting agricultural growth using AI and calculates the economic return on investment for adaptation measures. Utilizing this model enables the implementation of adaptation measures that focus on areas where positive effects are expected, promoting local agriculture efficiently and sustainably.</p><p>Overview</p><p>This newly developed conceptual model was used to analyze adaptation measures targeting the cultivation of cocoa and rice in various locations in Africa. Africa is the world's largest cocoa producer, with agriculture being one of its major industries. However, due to the impacts of climate change, the cultivation environment for cocoa and rice is expected to change significantly in the coming decades. This initiative focused on the following three adaptation measures to examine their ability to maintain and enhance yields and create economic value in a changing climate.</p><p>- Introduction of irrigation facilities</p><p>- Changing to climate-adapted varieties</p><p>- Changing of planting time for traditionally cultivated varieties</p><p>Some of the analysis results can be verified through interactive demonstrations. As an example of potential applications for this conceptual model, it is envisioned that international organizations and development banks providing local agricultural support will utilize it to explore farmland in recipient areas and estimate the effects of implementing adaptation measures.</p><p>Beyond this example, the system is designed to cater to the needs of various stakeholders involved in agriculture, enabling them to make data-driven decisions.</p><p>Results and future prospects</p><p>The utilization of AI made it possible to analyze the cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures, such as the introduction of irrigation facilities and changes in cultivation varieties in rice farming across various regions, as well as effective adaptation strategies for cacao cultivation.</p><p>Significant funding is required to advance climate change adaptation in agriculture. It has been pointed out that in addition to the need for financial support from international organizations, development banks, and governments, the mobilization of private investment is necessary. To provide continuous funding, it is essential to quantify the investment returns from adaptation measures and to conduct proper monitoring and intervention following their implementation.</p><p>While exploring opportunities for collaborations with businesses that provide irrigation equipment and seedlings, NEC and ClimateAi aim to leverage digital technology use cases to promote financing for climate change adaptation and expand data-driven agritech businesses.</p><p>- Adaptation finance business</p><p>Support for understanding risks to agricultural yields to reduce entry barriers for the private sector / Support for evaluating business feasibility for financing</p><p>- Agritech business</p><p>Support for agricultural producers and managers of climate change adaptation / Support for climate change adaptation in the upstream (seed and agricultural material businesses) and downstream (processing businesses, etc.) of the agricultural supply chain</p><p>- Other business</p><p>Support for climate change adaptation in the infrastructure industry and manufacturing supply chains</p><p>The results of this initiative will be announced at the TICAD Business Expo &amp; Conference (Japan Fair) and other events to gather feedback from the market and proceed with discussions toward commercialization. Going forward, NEC and ClimateAi will work together to scientifically assess the impact of climate change on agriculture and present concrete solutions to achieve sustainable agriculture and food security. Both companies will continue striving to solve global agricultural challenges through technological innovation and data utilization.</p><p>NEC's new business development, under the key message \"The future is ours to shape,\" is advancing NEC Open Innovation (*2) through diverse co-creation with a wide range of startups and partner companies. NEC's collaboration with ClimateAi is one such initiative. By uniting innovative technologies with cross-domain collaboration, NEC continues to create new social value and shape the future.</p><p>(*1)NEC to participate in \"TICAD Business Expo and Conference\" and thematic events for TICAD 9 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nec.com/en/press/202508/global_20250805_03.html\">https://www.nec.com/en/press/202508/global_20250805_03.html</url></p><p>(*2)NEC Open Innovation</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nec.com/en/global/innovation/index.html\">https://www.nec.com/en/global/innovation/index.html</url></p><p>About ClimateAi, Inc.</p><p>ClimateAi is a climate adaptation and resilience platform purpose-built for the agriculture, food, and consumer goods sectors.

According to news originating from Kanagawa, Japan, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Exploring the trends of sustainability science research is vital for advancing our understanding of creating a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet and society. This overview article explores a segment of the sustainability science research landscape from 2006 to 2023 by examining articles published in the Sustainability Science journal.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include JST e-ASIA JRP, Japan Science &amp; Technology Agency (JST), Integration of Traditional and Modern Bioproduction System for a Sustainable and Resilient Future under Climate and Ecosystem Changes (ITMoB). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, \"The initial step involved categorizing articles into four distinct periods, each representing a phase in the journal and field's evolution. The changing research topics and their interconnectedness were investigated by involving natural language processing, non-negative matrix factorization topic modeling, and Jaccard similarity analysis in Python. The study reveals shifting emphases over these periods: 2006-2010 focused on human-environment links; 2011-2015 shifted to practical solutions, such as climate adaptation; 2016-2020 focused on the integration of transdisciplinary knowledge, SDGs, and sustainability transitions; and 2021-2023 centered on transformative changes in sustainability. Based on the Sustainability Science journal publications, the field has evolved from foundational principles to current priorities such as transdisciplinary approaches, deep sustainability transformations, bioeconomy, and intergenerational narratives. The evolving landscape responds to environmental, societal, cultural, and technological changes. While the Sustainability Science journal has played an essential role, there remains potential to further concentrate on emerging topics and transformative methodologies.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study offers valuable insights into propelling sustainability science forward to address global challenges and pave the way for a sustainable and equitable future.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping the Evolving Research Landscape of Sustainability Science From 2006 To 2023: Unveiling Its Transformation.

According to news reporting out of Tsukuba, Japan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"This paper presents an in-depth city profile analyzing Martil-an emerging coastal satellite urban center in northern Morocco. Situated within a rapidly urbanizing context, Martil exemplifies organic satellite city dynamics in the Global South.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Tsukuba, \"The analysis tracks Martil's demographic, spatial, economic, social, environmental, and planning transformations since the 1970s. Accelerated rural-urban migration fueled unstructured peripheral expansion, straining infrastructure and producing socioeconomic disparities. Unregulated construction encroached on floodplains and coastal habitats, increasing climate risks and environmental degradation. Recent urban development plans aim to balance growth priorities with sustainability concerns through zoning, partnerships, and critical projects. However, persisting governance gaps between ambitions and on-ground outcomes continue to hinder equitable development and ecological resilience. The study situates Martil locally and comparatively, underscoring mismatches between prevailing models and satellites' distinct realities. Satellite urbanism's complexities validate calls for fundamental paradigm shifts prioritizing social welfare, climate adaptation, economic diversity, and participatory planning essential for sustainable urban development.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This multi-dimensional analysis of a rapidly evolving coastal satellite city on the Mediterranean contributes an original perspective to urban studies scholarship while offering integrated recommendations for practitioners and policymakers.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Coastal Satellite Urbanization In the Global South: Dynamics, Sustainability Dilemmas, and Pathways for Martil, Morocco.

Development Program, World Bank and African Union Commission.</p><p> \"TICAD8 will be a very important occasion to highlight the concept of human security as well as international solidarity toward the goal of world peace,\" said JICA Vice President Ryuichi Kato at a media roundtable in Tokyo in May.</p><p> Earlier this year, the Foreign Ministry held a virtual TICAD ministerial meeting joined by delegates from African countries.</p><p> On the issue of human security, the participants affirmed the importance of promoting efforts on environmental issues including climate change to ensure African development will be sustainable.</p><p> In other words, the approach to promote climate action in African countries should contribute both to climate benefits and development benefits, the ministry indicated.</p><p> People in the continent are facing the risk of income loss and food insecurity as many of the activities essential to African economies are weather-sensitive. These include things such as agriculture, herding and fishing, according to JICA.</p><p> \"Declines in agricultural productivity due to climate change are increasing malnutrition,\" said Kato.</p><p> JICA's climate efforts in the continent include the development of geothermal energy in Kenya, a project designed to meet electricity demand through renewable energy sources.</p><p> In addition to taking mitigation measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions, measures for adapting to climate change are also considered an important approach to reduce the current impact and prepare for potential risks, according to climate experts.</p><p> The U.N. Environment Program estimates a potential market size of the climate adaptation business to reach up to 50 trillion yen ($387 billion) as of 2050, if the world succeeds in containing the increase in global average temperature at 2 C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p> The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has been soliciting the participation of the private sector in adaptation activities overseas including Africa.</p><p> These include Panasonic Corp.'s solar lanterns project in Uganda and Sumitomo Chemical Co.'s mesh screen with insecticide agent to prevent the spread of malaria and other infectious disease associated with climate change in Tanzania, according to METI.</p><p> A METI official said the government is eyeing shedding light on some good adaptation projects conducted in Africa by Japanese companies through seminars and other events in the run up to TICAD8 in the hope of heightening the business momentum in the region.</p><p> With climate change seen as a major factor in threatening human security in Africa and world peace due to the increase in natural disasters and food insecurity, Kato said cross-sectional adaptation efforts are essential in numerous fields, including agriculture, infrastructure, water resources, eco-systems and disaster prevention.</p><p> Although the share of greenhouse gas emissions is relatively small in African countries compared to other regions, emission reductions and other climate actions are required in Africa as well under the Paris climate agreement.</p><p> It is crucial to deepen mutual understanding on what developed nations should do and what developing nations can do in terms of tackling climate change, Kato said.</p><p>==Kyodo</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JEN-ba12eee25497449db4d9a6f93854e9d920220612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APJEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65NN-5FK1-JC5B-G55X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><timeReceived>12:36 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Kyodo News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Japan Economic Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 12, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Its Port Victoria lands and transships the most tuna in the Indian Ocean. In its bid to diversify, the Seychelles pioneered the \"Blue Economy\" concept. The Seychelles was one of the first member countries of the African Union to be graduated to high-income economy status by the Bretton Woods institutions. Its similarities with a number of small island economies in the Pacific present opportunities for closer ties and cooperation within the Indo-Pacific region. This article highlights some areas where a large oceanic state has set examples that can be replicated to ensure the sustainable growth of independent, integral and peaceful islands and coastal states operating as free as possible from foreign forces for the benefit of all countries with interests in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Indo-Pacific Region</p><p>The Indo-Pacific region consists of two highly strategic, contested and trafficked segments of oceans on our planet. These are the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The increasing importance of the Indo-Pacific region is due to the emergence of the Indian Ocean as an increasing epicenter of global trade and commerce. It caters for a significant amount of hydrocarbons, fishing activities, and leisure tourism traffic, as well as container shipping from and for multiple stakeholders.</p><p>Following a long period of focus on the Pacific Ocean, the Commander of the US Pacific Command (PACOM), Adm. Samuel Locklear, started to refer to the extended region as the \"Indo-Asia-Pacific\". By 2018, PACOM was renamed the Indo-Pacific Command. The vision for Washington and its allies (Japan, Australia, India and others) for the Indo-Pacific region is a \"free and open Indo-Pacific region\" (\"The Indian Ocean's Key Role in the Indo-Pacific Rules-Based International Order\" by Nilanthi Samaranayake, The Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs, Dec. 7, 2020). Central to this vision is to maintain this geographical space as one where the rule of law, democratic norms and human rights are nurtured, promoted and defended if and when necessary.</p><p>As a country that depends on importation for more than 90% of its essential commodities and was the most affected by the Somali piracy debacle, the Republic of Seychelles has and remains very conscious and concerned about maritime safety and security in the region. Its past and present existence, as well as its future aspirations, depends on it. That, for example, is why it went the extra mile to play an active role in resolving the piracy tragedy.</p><p>The Republic of Seychelles</p><p>The Republic of Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands and islets that are strategically located around 4 degrees southwest of the Indian Ocean segment of the wider Indo-Pacific region (Image 1). Uninhabited until its first settlement in 1770, the Seychelles has traditionally served as a strategic resting, replenishment and repairs stopover for seafarers discovering and transacting in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>Custodians to a maritime jurisdiction over 1.37 million square kilometers of ocean (more than twice the size of France), the Seychelles' vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) overwhelms the totality of only 455 square km of its landmass (Image 2). Slightly more than 50% of its landmass is protected as national parks and reserves. Amongst its multiple responsibilities, the Seychelles has played and continues to play a number of critical and exemplary roles in the Indo-Pacific region. They include the following:</p><p>(i) To continue voicing the existential threats to low-lying Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and lobby for greater use of the \"Vulnerability Index\" in this era of increasing adverse effects of climate change</p><p>Since independence in 1976, the Republic's successive governments have consistently lobbied for and promoted the greater use of the \"Vulnerability Index\" for island economies. At the recent COP26 in Scotland, the president of the Seychelles made another appeal for the greater use of the index especially for SIDS.</p><p>However, the world remains steadfastly focused on gross national products (GNP) and GNP per capita as measurements of wealth, barring eligibility and access to concessional financing and grants for graduated countries to pursue their conservation, adaptation and sustainable development efforts.</p><p>Being the first African island state to graduate to high-income economy status, the Seychelles reverted to innovative financing mechanisms to continue its ambitious and traditional environment conservation and protection projects and programs to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 14 - \"life under water\" - after launching its Blue Economy concept.</p><p>(ii) Assume leadership in the protection and conservation of its environment</p><p>Even prior to its independence, the natural beauty of the islands prompted its colonizers to enact some environmental protective and conservation measures for some of the unique natural assets of the archipelago. The Seychelles was amongst the first countries to roll out its \"Environment Management Plan for Seychelles (EMPS) 1990-2000\". The document was presented at the first UN Sustainable Development Conference of Small Island Developing States held in 1992 in Barbados. Even at that time, the Republic of Seychelles had just over 50% of its landmass designated as protected special reserves and national parks.</p><p>In 2020, the Seychelles was once again ranked first in the Sub-Saharan region and 38th out of 180 countries globally in the Environmental Performance Index. This marks the country's commitment and its continuous efforts to improve environment protection, nature conservation and waste management (an area where it requires the most effort). It is hoped that the long consultative process to legislate the Republic's \"National Land-Use Plan\" does see the light of day soon.</p><p>The Seychelles is home to two World Heritage sites. First, the Vallee de Mai on Praslin Island, home to the unique and exotic coco-de-mer, the world's heaviest nut growing wild in what Britain's Major-General George Gordon dubbed the planet's \"Garden of Eden\". Second, is the Aldabra Atoll which is highly protected and still uninhabited by man but home to multiple unique endemic species, including over 100,000 giant land tortoises. It has been previously referred to as the \"Galapagos of the Indian Ocean\".</p><p>On environmental conservation, the Seychelles is a reference country in the Indo-Pacific region and can inspire other islands and coastal states to exchange and replicate strategies and pathways to sustainable development in multiple areas where it has succeeded</p><p>(iii) Pioneering and promoting the Blue Economy concept</p><p>The Blue Economy concept pioneered by the then President James Alix Michel was being vigorously promoted by the Seychelles as far back as November 2009 when Dr. Keiichiro Komatsu, principal of Komatsu Research and Advisory, visited the country. Michel explained the concept to him and his delegation, emphasising its critical relevance in how to better manage the oceans, to uphold maritime security and prevent conflicts and disruptions, and to promote research and sustainable use of the seabed and fisheries resources, as well as highlighting the importance of promoting the strategic concept globally in our common planet that is more than 70% oceanic.</p><p>The Seychelles delegation took the opportunity at the 2012 Rio+20 Conference to introduce and promote the concept amongst its peers. In September 2014 a large Seychellois delegation participated in Blue Economy debates during the United Nations' Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States in Apia, Samoa. On their return, the Seychelles government was amongst the first to establish a Blue Economy Department.</p><p>With the support of the Commonwealth, it produced its \"National Blue Economy Strategic Policy Framework and Roadmap\". By January 2014, together with the United Arab Emirates, it co-hosted the first Blue Economy Summit during the \"Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week\". Desperate to act on its Strategic Policy Framework, it was necessary to mobilize and secure seed funding. That is when innovative fund-mobilization mechanisms were conceived and realized.</p><p>In 2015, the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SEYCCAT) Board was set up. The Board was a critical vehicle to realize the innovative $21.4 million debt-swap that the government of the Seychelles was successful in securing to decrease its national debt by the aforementioned amount against its Paris Club creditors. The innovative arrangement is known as a \"debt-for-adaptation\" or \"debt-for-nature swap\". It was achieved in partnership with The Nature Conservancy and the support of Oceans 5, an international collaboration of philanthropists, which includes the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, that provided a concessionary loan and grants to SEYCCAT to successfully facilitate the debt-swap (\"Debt for dolphins: Seychelles creates huge marine parks in world-first finance scheme\" by Damian Carrington, The Guardian, Feb. 22, 2018).</p><p>In return, a firm commitment to protect 30% of its EEZ and enhance its marine conservation status was agreed and implemented through the formulation of the first Maritime Spatial Plan (MSP) in the Indian Ocean (\"Seychelles buys back $21 million in debt from Paris Club\" by Betymie Bonnelame, Seychelles News Agency, March 9, 2016).</p><p>Having successfully secured the debt-for-nature swap, the Seychelles also mobilized funding through the sale of sovereign Blue Bonds (\"Seychelles Launches World's First Sovereign Blue Bond\", World Bank, 2018). The Blue Bonds replicate the Green Bond model that governments, development banks and corporations use to fund projects with environmental and climate benefits. The proceeds from selling Blue Bonds were earmarked for the \"Mahe Plateau fisheries management plan of the Seychelles' (\"Blue Bond initiative to protect marine resources launched\", International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2016). Given that the Seychelles is one of the highest per capita fish consumers, the judicious management of its main natural wild stock supply of fish is deemed critical having detected signs of over-fishing in some popularly consumed fish species.</p><p>After successfully demonstrating its ability to come up with innovative solutions in funding mobilization, this large oceanic state has also punched above its weight to effectively be at the center of a series of major multinational operations to eliminate piracy threats to critical maritime security, especially during the Somali piracy threat.</p><p>(iv) Multilateral collaboration and cooperation to uphold maritime safety and security</p><p>The islands and other coastal nations of the Indo-Pacific region have long been conscious that maritime stability, peace and security are vital for their sustainable development. This is evident in the Declaration of the \"Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace\" initiated by Sri Lanka at the 26th United Nations General Assembly in 1971 - \"The General Assembly adopted resolution 2832 (XXVI), by which the Indian Ocean, within limits to be determined, together with the airspace above and the ocean floor subjacent thereto, was designated for all time as a zone of peace\" (United Nations Disarmament Yearbook, 1983, pp. 375-389).</p><p>During the Somalia piracy era, trade routes in the western Indian Ocean were no longer safe. The Seychelles' fisheries industry, as well as its burgeoning maritime and cruise ship sub-sectors, were threatened and almost brought to a halt. Being one of the most affected due to its proximity, the Seychelles called for assistance from the whole world. Since all major nations, including China, India, Russia and the United States, were affected, the call was heeded and actions ensued. The successful counterinsurgency against the piracy threat through multilateral collaboration between nations can be referred to one as of the most effective multilateral efforts in recent history. Joint multilateral efforts resumed secure and safe traffic, trade and other maritime activities in the western Indian Ocean.</p><p>The Republic of Seychelles was the first country in the sub-region that modified and introduced new legislations to be able to receive, prosecute and incarcerate pirates found guilty in its courts (Photos 1 and 2). As its prisons filled up, it went on to secure agreements for the repatriation of deserving prisoners back to Somalia. It also pleaded with all multilateral partners to provide assistance to the returning young men with opportunities to earn a decent living so that they do not return to piracy.</p><p>The Seychelles has since hosted the multilateral Regional Maritime Centre for Operational Coordination (RMCOC) in Port Victoria. A number of protocols and agreements were drafted, proposed and signed to ensure that participants in the multilateral efforts continue to share information to keep stakeholders alert to quickly enable reaction in case of a resurgence of similar threats.</p><p>The Seychelles' longstanding \"friends to all and enemies to none\" diplomatic strategy that served it well during the Cold War continues to serve it as a pillar of its diplomatic policy. In an emerging era of major tectonic shifts in the global balance of power, small economies like the Seychelles have no option but to navigate precariously. However, as testimony of its conviction, the Seychelles continues to turn down multiple offers to host any foreign military bases on any part of its territory.</p><p>(v) Upholding a Seychelles free from permanent foreign military presence</p><p>From its early days of struggle for independence, the Seychelles successfully averted the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) concept being applied to any part of its archipelago - unlike Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago. It then said goodbye to a US tracking station that lost its use-value. Ever since, the Seychelles has successfully fended off different offers for the installation of a permanent foreign military presence within its territorial waters from multiple countries. Thus far, the answer has been a resounding \"Thank you, but no thank you.\"</p><p>However, in 2021 speculation about a Seychelles-Indian military base on the island of Assumption was rife. Concerned Seychellois, even prominent politicians and supporters of the newly elected government voiced their objections (\"Not in favour of any foreign military base\": Interview with Seychelles' first Hindu MP Sathya Naidu, The Wire, Dec. 16, 2020).</p><p>All were relieved to finally hear the incumbent head of state put the issue to rest in his last press conference in December 2021, where he categorically dismissed all speculation. Responding to a journalist, he said: \"If you do not hear anything about Assumption Island, it is because there is nothing further to hear on the matter. Assumption will not host any military base.\"</p><p>The Republic of Seychelles has a tradition of opting for peaceful resolutions, as demonstrated by resolving a potential territorial dispute with its sister island and neighbor Mauritius, as elaborated below.</p><p>(vi) The first joint management of any disputed maritime area - the Mascarene Plateau in the Indian Ocean between the Seychelles and Mauritius</p><p>The Mascarene Plateau is an oceanic submarine plateau in the Indian Ocean located northeast of Madagascar. It covers an area of over 115,000 square km of shallow water, with depths ranging from 8-150 meters, and to over 4,000 meters at its edges. It is the second-largest oceanic plateau in the Indian Ocean after the Kerguelen Plateau (Image 3). The potentially resourceful plateau could easily have ended as a hotly disputed area brought to arbitration, as is the case with multiple islands and islets in the Pacific. However, the sister islands decided to take a much more practical and pacific approach.</p><p>Both parties discussed and agreed on a 50/50 sharing of all revenues collected as well as a taxation code to apply to the area. They appointed their respective teams of dedicated professionals to interface and manage the plateau. Their successive negotiations resulted in a first-of-its-kind treaty for joint management of an ocean space, signed between the two island nations in 2012. As a result, both secured additional seabed rights and the underlying sub-soil in the Indian Ocean to add to their respective EEZ jurisdictions.</p><p>This approach could be the solution to multiple similar territorial disputes in the Indo-Pacific region where there are a number of similar disagreements that seem never-ending and unsettled. The Seychelles and Mauritius have shown that it is possible to agree on win-win compromises and peaceful solutions.</p><p>The tendencies of the superpowers, whether it be the US or China, to practice the \"might is right\" principle, as in the case of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, continues to persist. Mauritius has won its claim for the return of the archipelago in all courts including the International Court of Justice and overriding support at the United Nations. But all their efforts have to date fallen on the deaf ears of Britain and the US. They continue to operate one of the most equipped and strategically important military bases on Diego Garcia despite Mauritius' willingness to enact a 99-year lease to keep the base operational.</p><p>(vii) Sharing the Blue Economy and eco-tourism experiences for sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific region</p><p>In December 2021, former President Michel and former Minister of Tourism Alain St Ange were invited to address the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at EXPO 2020 in the United Arab Emirates (which had been postponed due to the Covid pandemic). Following the presentations, the Seychelles was the first country to host the ASEAN delegation on its African tour, led by its Secretary General Dato Lim Jock Hoi from Brunei. He and the delegation paid a call on President Wavel Ramkalawan at State House in Victoria where they discussed future areas for enhanced cooperation and where the Blue Economy and eco-tourism featured prominently. They then exchanged gifts to reinforce existing ties and growing friendship (Photo 3).</p><p>This landmark official visit heralds possibilities for enhanced cooperation between the Pacific and Indian Ocean coastal and island states to promote sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific region and across the entire world. As a rapid action-oriented follow-up, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Tourism of Seychelles Sylvestre Radegonde has agreed to jointly host the ASEAN-Africa Forum this year, to primarily explore potentials for economic growth (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Tourism - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nation.sc\">https://www.nation.sc</url> - Jan. 13, 2022).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In 2015, Sir James R. Mancham, the first president of the Seychelles after independence, published a book entitled Seychelles: The Saga of a Small Nation Navigating the Cross-Currents of a Big World. It sums up perfectly the predicament of SIDS that are usually custodians to large EEZs. They must continuously be alert to strategic maneuvers. The reintroduction of multiparty politics in the Seychelles in 1992 after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was one such significant, timely and strategic readjustment.</p><p>In this era of increasing rivalries, the two sister islands of the Seychelles and Mauritius compromised to offer a peaceful and reconciliatory way forward by agreeing to joint management of the Mascarene Plateau. It is an example with potential for replication and win-win resolutions for multiple maritime territorial disagreements.</p><p>The Republic of Seychelles does not shy away from the vital role it plays in ensuring a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" for its own survival in one of the epicenters of global trade and superpower rivalries. It is aware that it is only in a peaceful, safe, and secure maritime environment that it will be able to successfully implement its sustainable Blue Economy aspirations.</p><p>The country does not hesitate to learn and share its experiences with the fastest growing region of the world. Most of its commendable efforts range from innovative funding mobilization and its peaceful resolution of potential conflicts to playing active roles in facilitating the elimination of multinational threats close to home.</p><p>Finally, its \"friends to all and enemies to none\" diplomacy ensures its wider reach and ability to independently approach all partners around the globe. Free from foreign military bases, the Republic of Seychelles stands poised to ensure that all stakeholders can partake in mutually beneficial multilateral efforts to ensure that the Indo-Pacific region remains safe and secure.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAPNEC-JEF3004202200011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAPNEC2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65F8-T431-F00C-62M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Japan Economic Foundation (JEF) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Japan Economic Foundation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35387\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 41</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 30, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Philippine government has anchored its strategic agenda on the alliance since its independence in 1946. The election of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as the 16th president of the Philippines, however, generated uncertainties on whether this continues to hold. Under President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines appears to be in the process of a major foreign policy shift characterized by leaning closer to Beijing while putting more distance between Manila and Washington. However, the Philippines\u2019 security establishment remains a very close partner of the US military given the long history of joint training and professional exchanges between the two militaries.</p><p>The challenges facing the long-standing security and treaty alliance between the United States and the Philippines have evolved since the end of World War 2, from the spectre of Cold War conflicts, terrorism, China's assertiveness, to include humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. With the rising intensity of disasters that regularly hit the Philippines and the worsening humanitarian impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US-Philippines cooperation helps address the gaps, not just in responding to disasters, but more importantly, in terms of disaster preparedness, risk mitigation and local/community resilience in vulnerable Philippine communities. This shift illustrates an evolution towards a more comprehensive alliance framework building on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities by American and Filipino humanitarian groups and grassroots actors.</p><p>Humanitarian norms and frameworks in the Philippines now focus on disaster preparedness, multistakeholder participation at the local level and community resilience. The US-Philippines alliance has moved beyond US military's participation in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in recent years to activities that do not require military assets and massive military participation. In the aftermath of the 2017 Marawi Conflict, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) led and launched the Marawi Response Project, a humanitarian initiative that involved collaborating with American NGOs and local civilian actors such as NGOs, the private sector and local government executives and aimed at addressing the vulnerabilities of affected residents and enhancing their socioeconomic resilience (USAID, 2020a).</p><p>This article fills a key knowledge gap in contemporary studies on the US-Philippines security alliance by focussing on the evolution of US\u2019 humanitarian activities in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and engagement at the local level. It analyses the impact of deepening and broadening US humanitarian activities in the Philippines on their security alliance through the initiatives of USAID, the private sector and humanitarian NGOs. This article argues that the non-traditional aspect of the US-Philippines bilateral alliance, particularly in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, is not intended to underplay the role of the US military, but highlights the importance of the private sector, humanitarian NGOs, and USAID in deepening and broadening the security alliance. This article is divided into four sections. First, it explains the significance of foreign humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the Philippines. Second, it presents the analytical framework on delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and its role in deepening alliances. Third, it reviews literature on the US-Philippines security alliance in the context of cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and briefly examines military and civilian frameworks that facilitate US\u2019 humanitarian activities with the Philippines. And fourth, it explores the evolving humanitarian norms in the Philippines and how the US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief helps plug the gaps.</p><p>This article is based on a qualitative systematic review of related literature, reports by humanitarian organisations, as well as official documents and reports from US and Philippine government agencies. The author also conducted semi-structured interviews with representatives from the Philippine military, humanitarian organisations, government agencies and the private sector in July 2016 in Manila, the Philippines. These interviews were done to determine the key lessons from the country's major disasters, such as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and changing humanitarian norms.</p><h>Why is foreign humanitarian assistance and disaster relief needed in the Philippines?</h><p>The Philippines is among the top 5 most disaster-prone countries in the world. Every year, the country experiences almost all forms of disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions with numerous complex emergencies due to armed conflict. Multiple hazards are a common occurrence in the Philippines (Institute for International Law for Peace and Armed Conflict, 2018). At least 60% of the country's total land area is exposed to multiple hazards, and 74% of the population is susceptible to their impact (ADPC and UNDRR, 2019). From a wider perspective, the Philippines does not only deal with geological or hydro-meteorological hazards but also human-induced hazards such as low-intensity armed conflicts due to the communist insurgency and presence of terrorist groups in Mindanao as well as the multifaceted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conflict-affected communities in the Philippines are mostly vulnerable to natural disasters, complicating the delivery of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to those in need. Recent disasters that hit the country in 2020 were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic which generated complex humanitarian issues in impoverished communities. The Philippines is among the worst-hit countries in Asia with 2.7 million cases as of October 27, 2021 (Department of Health, 2021).</p><p>The PhilippineCongress passed the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 which provides a preparedness framework that is community-based, multi-sectoral and inter-agency. It calls for the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in infrastructure building, budget, education, health and housing sectors. It also mandates the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) in all local government units. Additionally, it provides for a calamity fund to be used in the need for prevention, mitigation and response activities (Congress of the Philippines, 2010).</p><p>Despite credible efforts towards preparedness, the Philippines\u2019 vulnerable nature makes the international community a crucial part of humanitarian affairs in the country. The Philippines has always been welcoming towards accepting assistance from international actors (states, multilateral and regional organisations, and humanitarian organisations) and has even included them in sensitive internal issues such as conflict resolution in Mindanao. The US, in particular, provided the Philippines with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 and the Marawi Conflict in 2017. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the humanitarian assistance of the US to the Philippines has been responsive, timely and impactful.</p><h>Framework of analysis: delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to deepen the security alliance</h><p>Walt (1987) defines alliances as formal or informal types of security cooperation between two or more sovereign states. A meaningful alliance is anchored on the joint commitment of involved states or allies for mutual support against external actors (Walt, 2009). Whether through military agreements or formal treaties, alliances explicitly or implicitly stipulate the conditions under which allies combine their security efforts, capabilities, tools and resources in their joint pursuit of mutual security interests, particularly mutual defence (Lake, 1996; Wight, 1979). Initially, alliances are primarily built for defensive and/or offensive military purposes encompassing joint exercises, the provision of military assistance, and hosting foreign bases and/or troops (De Castro, 2020). However, in recent years, alliances have gradually expanded their remit to collaboratively address non-traditional security issues, such as delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</p><p>In the context of building and deepening alliances, the increasing involvement of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief can be explained by the rise in relevance and recognition of non-traditional security issues. Non-traditional security, as a concept, does not limit the coverage of security to traditional, state-centric threats which can be seen as military in nature. Security threats, issues, and challenges that confront nations and societies can no longer be defined and addressed in military and statist terms. Non-traditional security effectively broadens and deepens the understanding of security. Multiple actors, both state and non-state, can provide and guarantee security. Neither the state nor individuals are the exclusive focus of non-traditional security; both are main security referents. Both security referents need to feel secure since a state that is insecure will not be able to guarantee the well-being and security of its people. With non-traditional security, the security lexicon has been expanded to encapsulate a variety of issues such as climate security, food security, environmental security, pandemic threats, disasters, trafficking in persons, economic security, and energy security (Caballero-Anthony and Gong, 2020; Elliott, 2012). Therefore, security alliances have also expanded their threat horizon to include non-traditional security threats. Alliance-building needs to become more relevant to the current security environment by being responsive to growing non-traditional security threats such as the increasing frequency of disasters and complex humanitarian emergencies brought about by a pandemic. Capie (2015) argues that in the context of US alliances in the Asia-Pacific, evolving threat perceptions and a new understanding of the international security environment have driven the new interest in non-traditional security engagements like delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</p><p>A study on the Australia-New Zealand-US alliance concludes that building the alliance relationship around humanitarian assistance and disaster relief may entail the blending of both traditional and non-traditional security threats in new formulations of a security agreement. The convergence of hard and soft power in delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief suggests that non-traditional security is increasingly regarded as crucial as traditional security (Newby, 2020). Non-traditional security issues provide cooperative opportunities, as they reflect many areas of common interest within the alliance structure and can generate less sensitivity. Delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief even serves as an additional platform for collaboration among allies, where their relationships and trust can be sustained and harnessed along with their joint capabilities and understanding towards a common good (Dormandy, 2012). Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief is an excellent example of the confluence of hard and soft power: it simultaneously utilises military and civilian components, harnessing resources not just from militaries but also from development aid agencies such as the USAID (Capie, 2015).</p><p>Instrumental benefits from the inclusion of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, in terms of alliance-building by the US and its Asia-Pacific allies, include stronger joint commitments for action, facilitating access for US military presence, projecting capabilities, and more importantly, opening opportunities for coalition-building and engagement with new partners (Capie, 2015). These new partners should not just be limited with multinational militaries but robust grassroots engagements with local actors, vulnerable communities and the private sector. One concrete example of this partnership is the US-Japan NGO partnerships on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The study made by Gannon (2015) on their partnerships after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011 is critical to assessing the evolving nature of US-Japan alliance. The successes that Japanese and American NGOs had in collaborating after the Fukushima disaster demonstrate that there is much to gain by supporting them to boost their joint capability to respond to disasters.</p><p>Apart from supporting US-Japan joint response, their humanitarian NGO partnerships would better equip them to execute more efficient humanitarian projects in third countries. This was vividly showed in their joint response to call for humanitarian aid in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. By institutionalising patterns of cooperation, Japanese and American NGOs can help them jointly prepare and respond the next time a mega-disaster like Fukushima requires them to scale up activities quickly (Gannon, 2015). In this regard, alliance activities in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief are not just about military deployment but include sustainable capacity building projects from development aid agencies and their humanitarian partners. These alliance activities can encompass disaster risk reduction, preparedness, building community resilience and rehabilitation, which do not require the deployment of foreign military assets.</p><h>US-Philippines security alliance and delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief</h><p>This article builds on comprehensive studies on bilateral security alliance between the Philippines and the US and its role in addressing non-traditional security issues, specifically, in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the Philippines. Their bilateral relations in recent years have been driven by two key factors: their common perception on China as an existential threat in the South China Sea and the need for cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The vast majority of the literature on US humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the Philippines has been largely focused on the extent and modalities of participation of the US military with its assets in the context of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations or case studies of major disasters in the Philippines (Avila and Goldman, 2015; De Castro, 2019; Hall and Cular, 2010; Kelman, Gaillard and Orillos, 2009).</p><p>Military involvement in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to affected communities is viewed as an effective method to generate goodwill and exhibit that a foreign ally's military is a necessary force and humanitarian partner (Canyo, Ryan and Burkle, 2020; Leahy 2013). For some security scholars (Brattberg, 2013; Canyon et al., 2020; Yamada, 2017), the participation of the US military in several large-scale disaster relief operations in the Asia-Pacific, such as the 2011 Operation <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tomodachi</emphasis> (Friend) in Japan and the 2013 Operation <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Damayan</emphasis> (mutual aid) in the Philippines highlighted US\u2019 positive image and the usefulness of its military presence, tempering negative public perceptions of its presence in Philippine territory. Boosting soft power diplomacy in this manner cannot be under-estimated especially in the context of challenging China's assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. As one scholar puts it, it is America's soft power diplomacy (US military conducting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations) to further hard power goals, e.g., maintaining America's security presence and influence in the Philippines and in the broader region (Yamada, 2017).</p><p>The massive deployment of US military resources for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief can positively influence public opinion and policy in foreign countries. In the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan (2013), humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the Philippines by the US government boosted favourable public opinion of the US among Filipinos. Within six months after the typhoon, the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement, allowing the US military access to facilities in the Philippines, stationing of troops, and prepositioning of military assets, purportedly for disaster relief was signed (Canyon et al., 2020; Brattberg, 2013; Yamada, 2017; Government of the Republic of the Philippines and Government of the United States of America, 2014). The advancement of US security goals through humanitarian and disaster relief assistance is indeed evident.</p><p>Previous and even more recent studies mostly focus on the disaster response aspect of US humanitarian assistance and disaster relief as facilitated by the US military. Canyon et al. (2020), for instance, accentuate in their article that two years before Typhoon Haiyan, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Balikatan</emphasis> joint exercises between the Philippines and US militaries had focused much on disaster scenarios with planning for the rapid deployment of US military assets.</p><p>From a Philippine strategic perspective, the massive humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operation of the US military in the aftermath of Haiyan provided tangible benefits for the bilateral alliance\u2014the ability to operate in remote, isolated island-provinces, boost military-to- military relations, and application of their years of first-hand training on interoperability. All of these benefits can be applied in the alliances\u2019 primary mission\u2014fighting and winning wars (De Castro, 2019).</p><p>With its small and obsolete armed forces, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) benefits from the regular and short-term visits of US forces that conduct military training as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. The Philippines also hopes that the construction of vital military facilities and the storage and prepositioning of defence and disaster response equipment by the US military in agreed locations can lower the cost of the AFP modernisation program as these buildings and equipment can be shared and utilised jointly by American and Philippine armed forces (De Castro, 2017; Heydarian, 2020).</p><p>A Filipino scholar De Castro (2019) argues that the reliability of America's and its allies\u2019 humanitarian efforts to the thousands of affected communities by Typhoon Haiyan was a remarkable show of support to US alliance with the Philippines, and an impressive demonstration of the hub-and-spokes system's cohesion and ability to respond even to a crisis. The two allies\u2019 combined efforts are indicative of how their bilateral alliance can operate in peacetime, and possibly, even in a humanitarian emergency. From the Philippines\u2019 perspective, the involvement of the US affirmed the latter's commitment to its security partners and the reliability of its alliances (De Castro, 2019).</p><p>Hall and Cular (2010) discuss how the US and Philippines began developing a collaborative framework on disaster response since a landslide in a province in eastern Philippines in 2006. The essential element that the two allies developed was a coordination centre, which would be crucial in facilitating the smooth entry and participation of the US military in other large-scale disasters after the 2006 landslide, notably Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.</p><p>In the years prior to Typhoon Haiyan, the Philippine and the US militaries, working under the terms of the Visiting Forces Agreement, created the Combined Coordination Center (CCC) framework to facilitate the latter's involvement in disaster response in the Philippines. Eventually, the CCC framework would later be used as a foundation to the much wider Multinational Coordination Centre (MNCC) involving other foreign militaries, in use since Typhoon Haiyan affected the Philippines (Hall and Cular, 2010; AFP General, 2016. Interview with author. July 22).</p><p>Scholars have argued that joint military exercises between the two countries have included trainings for their coordinated disaster response and interoperability in humanitarian affairs. For some, the primary aim of the exercises is to increase the disaster response capability of the Philippines alongside the goal of territorial defence (Avila and Goldman, 2015). The annual <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Balikatan</emphasis> exercises, for instance, focus on the training of both armed forces for disasters and other humanitarian crises that threaten public health and safety. The exercises also develop a high-level of interoperability between the US military and the Philippine military as they deliver humanitarian and civic assistance projects in various parts of the Philippines (De Castro, 2019).</p><p>One evident gap in these studies on the US-Philippines security alliance is the lack of discussion on US\u2019 contributions to disaster preparedness, community resilience and localisation through US partnership with Philippine local and grassroots actors. A glance at existing academic literature on US-Philippines cooperation, as cited in this section, reveals a scarcity of scholarly discussion and analysis on the collaboration among American and Philippine humanitarian organisations, civil society organisation, USAID, and local government agencies. There have been existing operational reports, however, that clearly demonstrate this type of collaboration which makes the bilateral alliance more comprehensive (Pacific Disaster Center, 2019; Plan InternationalUSA, 2018). For example, one of the implementing organisations of the USAID's Marawi Response Project is Plan InternationalUSA, an American NGO, which partners with Philippine NGOs namely, Ecosystems Work for Essential Benefits and Maranao People Development Center as well as with Souktel Inc., a U.S.-based firm (Plan InternationalUSA, 2018).</p><p>As this article shows, US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the Philippines is not limited to joint exercises on disaster response and US military deployment in the aftermath of a disaster. After Typhoon Haiyan, the Philippine government realised the need to recalibrate its framework from merely reactive disaster response to more proactive disaster mitigation and preparedness. The evolving humanitarian norms in the Philippines have vastly influenced US humanitarian work as well.</p><h>Evolving humanitarian norms in the Philippines and their interaction with US humanitarian work</h><p>The comprehensive US-Philippines partnership on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief is very evident in two known cases: Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 and the Marawi Conflict in 2017. In the first hours of Typhoon Haiyan, the U.S. military, collaborating with the Philippine military counterparts, was able to respond quickly due to prepositioned military assets based in facilities near the Philippines (Lum and Margesson, 2014).</p><p>USAID launched the Marawi Response Project in 2018, which aims to improve economic and social conditions of communities affected by the conflict, and most recently, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of the project is to assist vulnerable populations restore their livelihoods, improve food access and equip their local health workers involved in COVID-19 response. As of 2020, the total funding commitment of the US to Marawi humanitarian response reached nearly US$65 million (U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, 2020)</p><p>Meanwhile, a key civilian arrangement is the cooperation between USAID and the Philippine government on disaster risk reduction programmes. Since 1990, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) has responded to 50 disasters in the Philippines through comprehensive disaster risk reduction programs that build the capacity of local communities, government agencies and NGOs (USAID, 2018). Since 2010, the USAID has provided US$340 million in humanitarian and disaster risk reduction assistance to Philippine communities (USAID, 2020b).</p><p>This section demonstrates how the US-Philippines security alliance, especially pertaining to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, has evolved from being military-oriented to an alliance that comprehensively features the active engagements among civilian actors, humanitarian organisations and businesses from both the Philippines and the US. The US-Philippines alliance is better evaluated in terms of its work on non-traditional security, particularly in specific areas of disaster preparedness and localisation of humanitarian work.</p><p>Due to the frequency of disasters, humanitarian work in the Philippines has been comprehensive, dynamic and follows global standards of response and aid administration. This article accentuates two major humanitarian norms that have emerged in the Philippines in recent years, in which the US\u2019 humanitarian work is filling the gaps through capacity-building as well as financial and technical assistance. They are the (i) disaster preparedness through pre-disaster risk assessment and mitigation as well as the (ii) localisation and building community resilience with multi-stakeholder participation. Localisation and enhancing community resilience are also very much evident in the way the US has provided COVID-19 assistance to Philippine local actors and communities as discussed later in this section. It must be noted that the emergent humanitarian norms and frameworks, focusing on disaster preparedness and multi-stakeholder participation at the local level and community resilience, along with the US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in recent years do not obviously require military assets and massive military participation, either from the AFP or the US military.</p><h>1.</h><h>Disaster preparedness through pre-disaster risk assessment and mitigation</h><p>One important organic innovation developed by Filipino humanitarian actors is the Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment (PDRA) to avoid repeating Haiyan-like devastation. It was institutionalised in August 2014 by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council or NDRRMC (OCD, NDRRMC, 2014). PDRA is a process to assess a hazard's level of risk given the degree of exposure and vulnerability in a specific area. PDRA is a context specific and time-bound risk assessment tool that focuses on a particular hazard and associated risks in a particular area given a certain time. Information is derived and action plans are carried out using the tool. Through the PDRA, questions such as, but are not limited to: \u201cwhat is the potential hazard?\u201d \u201cWhere are the areas that will be affected?\u201d \u201cWhat is the potential impact?\u201d and, \u201cwhere are the safe areas for evacuation?\u201d can be answered (Pama, Alexander, 2016. Interview with author. July 20). As such, it is the primary tool used by the government and military to evacuate populations they consider can be in harm's way. Learning from Typhoon Haiyan, the Office of Civil Defence (OCD) argued that a system was needed to synergise the activities of all agencies working on the four thematic areas on humanitarian affairs to achieve a common vision; hence, OCD came up with the PDRA. The thematic areas \u201cmay overlap each other to attain our vision of safer, adaptive and resilient country\u201d (OCD, NDRRMC, 2014).</p><p>The PDRA, indeed, became a baseline for cluster response operations and communications. For the first time, the government achieved a nationwide consensus on the operating environment (Jumamil-Mercado et al., 2015). PDRA has changed the disaster risk management approach of the government from being reactive to be more prepared and proactive. As the pre-disaster risk assessment is essentially a scientific tool that is now being used by the government and NGOs, the role of scientists in strengthening disaster management has indeed become critical, particularly in the areas of prevention and mitigation as well as preparation. They are involved in \u201cpre-disaster science\u201d, which entails scientific research on prevention and mitigation that hopefully will help minimise the need for relief. Even some NGOs also subscribe to the concept of pre-disaster risk assessment but, unlike the government, they have been doing this assessment even before Typhoon Haiyan.</p><p>Through their assessment measures as to the possible impact of a hazard on towns and villages would be affected, humanitarian NGOs can approximate how many households would be affected, how many livelihoods would be disrupted so that they can immediately get and deploy relief resources. Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief needs to be science-based and systematic and this can only be realised with appropriate pre-disaster risk assessment (Dercilla Dator, Jessica, 2016. Interview with author. July 22).</p><p>A major gap in the Philippines\u2019 preparedness and risk assessment framework is the weak capability of communities and local governments to conduct such assessment and reduce their vulnerabilities. This is one area US\u2019 humanitarian work tries to plug the gaps through helping the local humanitarian actors in addressing the vulnerabilities of disaster-prone communities. There is likewise a lack of social protection for disaster-prone communities which makes their vulnerabilities incessant. Local actors must identify the types of social protection that certain communities need, based on their environmental and geophysical settings. Another key area for humanitarian work is building disaster-resilient infrastructure, such as evacuation centres, mass housing projects, hospitals, airports, roads and bridges. In this area, the US military and its relations with the Philippine military are not the major players. Instead, the proactive participation and collaboration among USAID-supported American and Philippine humanitarian organisations, civilian agencies and</p><p>The Centre for Disaster Preparedness Foundation, along with USAID, is working towards helping vulnerable communities, such as in the Zamboanga Peninsula, southern Philippines, to protect themselves from the adverse situations causes by disasters. The Centre for Disaster Preparedness Foundation helps local actors from town authorities down to families with safety protocol and also assists in capacity building in key urban centres. The organisation promotes investment in risk reduction planning and establishing early warning systems. It assists local actors in disaster preparedness through advocacy and by disseminating knowledge. Its efforts have had a significant impact on how communities in Zamboanga have utilised what they learned related to disaster risk reduction and preparedness (Rosete, 2019; Oyanib, 2019; USAID, 2018).</p><p>USAID/OFDA supported Plan InternationalUSA (Plan USA) with funding to continue implementing a multi-year program designed to strengthen disaster preparedness and response capacity in communities affected by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines\u2019 Eastern Visayas Region, including in vulnerable coastal areas of Eastern Samar, Leyte, and Samar provinces. Plan USA supported the creation of village-level DRR committees; conducted trainings focused on mapping disaster risks and identifying vulnerable populations; and organised, trained, and equipped emergency response teams to act as first responders at the community level (USAID, 2018).</p><p>In view of the PDRA framework adopted by Filipino humanitarian actors, the USAID funded the World Food Program (WFP)'s Technical Support for Disaster Preparedness and Response, targeted local governments, academic institutions, and NGOs across 37 provinces to enhance their logistics response capabilities to improve their vulnerability assessment and risk mapping techniques. The programme, which ended in March 2018, also strengthened national and local disaster preparedness and mitigation plans by incorporating climate adaptation activities into risk reduction planning (USAID, 2018; World Food Programme, 2016).</p><p>The disaster-risk reduction activities in the Philippines are being supplemented by Incident Command Systems (ICS) training provided by the U.S Forest Service in association with USAID/OFDA (USAID, 2018). They train community-based disaster risk reduction and response teams, national disaster response officials, and incident management teams of various Philippines\u2019 civilian agencies together with the Philippines military. ICS has been recognised globally as the gold standard for disaster response which includes organisational and structural plans to make response efficient and fast ICS organises personnel from various Philippine agencies to support a management structure that determines planning and allocates resources in the event of an emergency (United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, 2014).</p><h>2.</h><h>Localisation and building community resilience with multi-stakeholder participation</h><p>Another important norm in post-Haiyan Philippines is the localisation of disaster preparedness and response. Central to the critical need to empower communities and make them disaster resilient is strengthening the local governments\u2019 disaster risk reduction and preparation management. Local government units (LGUs) are expected to play a critical role in disaster response, particularly in preparedness as specified in the National Disaster Response Plan but capabilities at the local level and coordination between local governments and national government agencies still face a big challenge. The gap between institutional responsibilities and capacities at the local level has been identified as a major impediment to effective disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) implementation (AFP General., 2016. Interview with author. July 22). There is a significant imbalance between the risk exposure of poor, disaster vulnerable LGUs and their available resources to prevent and cope with the impact of disasters. LGUs in poorer and island provinces for example, are at a disadvantage as they have lower revenues and thus, less available resources for their calamity fund. As for prevention and mitigation, foresight and pro-activeness are still not present in many DRRM plans of local governments (Commission on Audit, 2014). Major planning documents by local governments like the Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUPs) and the Comprehensive Development Plans (CDPs), if present at all, do not incorporate the mandatory climate and disaster risk assessment enhancements (Domingo and Manejar, 2018).</p><p>Several humanitarian NGOs in the Philippines have already been conducting locally-led humanitarian operations and disaster preparedness, giving space for communities to be the lead actors in delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (Dercilla Dator, Jessica, 2016. Interview with author. July 22). For instance, the PhilippineRed Cross (PRC) was among the first responders which got access to Haiyan-devastated communities primarily because of the presence of its local chapters in nine provinces affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan.</p><p>The localisation of its humanitarian operations and disaster preparedness initiatives allows the PRC to reach the remote communities primarily through promoting volunteerism. The PRC not only works with local volunteers but also advances the proactive participation and empowerment of its beneficiaries with the aim of building community resilience and the inclusion of multiple stakeholders in the communities. Through the humanitarian projects of its local chapters, the PRC empowers beneficiaries to own their disaster preparedness and mitigation as well as recovery projects for sustainability purposes. As claimed by its officers, the localisation of PRC's humanitarian initiatives promotes community resilience and sustainability because there is always an acceptance and empowerment with the local community (Enriquez, Brian, 2016. Interview with author. July 19).</p><p>In this regard, how does the US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief help strengthen localisation and community resilience norms? It is evident that the military component of the alliance is irrelevant in this area. The collaborative work of American and Philippine civil society organisations, the private sector and local officials has contributed to the localisation and community resilience norms, leading to a more comprehensive bilateral alliance. Since 2014, the USAID has also been partnering with American humanitarian organisation Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in helping local governments\u2019 disaster management councils promote community-based disaster risk reduction programmes. The USAID-CRS disaster resilience project has also generated sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable communities so they can attain income diversification and savings strategies and heighten their resilience to disasters (USAID, 2019).</p><p>The CRS has also empowered homeowners\u2019 associations in flood-prone communities in some provinces to implement a multisectoral recovery and disaster risk recovery project. By doing this, the homeowners\u2019 associations began to feel a sense of ownership over the flood risk reduction project and played an increasingly active role, leading to much cleaner community streets, drains and waterways, which reduced the incidence of flooding in the area (Catholic Relief Services Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) and Caritas Australia, 2017). In the aftermath of the Marawi Siege, Plan USA implements the USAID-funded Marawi Response Project in cooperation with its local partners to increase the self-reliance of internally displaced persons and their host communities.</p><p>In this modality of US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, American humanitarian organisations, which is the CRS and Plan USA, are plugging the gaps in fostering multistakeholder participation at the community level and localised capacity building in risk reduction. Their deep local presence in Philippine communities is a testament of US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and alliance with the Philippines penetrating the grassroots level and without the use of military presence.</p><p>In the context of US\u2019 COVID-19 assistance to the Philippines, USAID likewise helped boost local capacity and community resilience. USAID's robust engagements with local and grassroots actors facilitated targeted and impactful US\u2019 COVID-19 assistance to vulnerable communities. In monetary terms, many of USAID's ongoing development projects valued at more than US$100 million have been deployed to address the multifaceted impact of the pandemic, basically non-traditional security issues, on local communities. US assistance goes beyond donating much needed medical supplies and hospital equipment. Local governments in hardest-hit areas have received technical assistance from USAID to strengthen their crisis management, communication and response strategies. USAID partners with the private sector and civil society to help sustain livelihoods amid the economic downturn. For instance, USAID and its partner organisations from the private sector have provided key digital solutions to enhance supply chains of medical products, food, and other necessary goods as well as cash relief to vulnerable communities (USAID, 2021).</p><p>Related to this, the private sector is indeed a key actor at the local level disaster preparedness and community resilience. The participation of the private sector is facilitated primarily by the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF). PDRF is the country's major private sector vehicle and coordinator for disaster management. Backed by the country's largest conglomerates, industrial and top corporate leaders, it is the critical link of the private sector with the government, military and civil society. After Typhoon Haiyan, PDRF began focusing on response and recovery programmes. Then a few years later, the PDRF realised that it must be able to help the business community respond to and prepare for disasters.</p><p>Through the PDRF's activities and paradigm shift from response to disaster preparedness and mitigation, the private sector can indeed be an active partner of government in humanitarian affairs given its financial resources and expertise. Due to the failure in disaster risk governance by national and local governments, the private sector is stepping up. The private sector is not just delivering relief as it also addresses intractable socio-economic development issues in order to reduce the vulnerabilities of poor communities including community-based entrepreneurs. Evidently, the government and NGOs would need the private sector to jointly address inherent vulnerabilities and to restore sources of livelihoods in affected communities (Interview with an official of Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, 22 July 2016).</p><p>Nonetheless, the Philippine government recognises that the private sector can significantly contribute to disaster preparedness and economic recovery that the government itself cannot sufficiently fulfil due to its limited fiscal and logistical resources; the USAID acknowledges this too by providing fiscal support to PDRF in advancing private sector's involvement in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, economic recovery and disaster preparedness at the local/grassroots level. This is another modality of US\u2019 humanitarian work and alliance-building, with special emphasis on the private sector. In particular, the USAID provides support to the private sector \u2013 American companies alongside Philippine companies \u2013 being mobilised to address urgent needs of communities and local entrepreneurs through the collaborative platform institutionalised by PDRF (USAID, 2020c).</p><p>US\u2019 humanitarian work aimed at boosting local capacities could be viewed as more cost effective with higher impact, than the actual deployment of US personnel and assets in the aftermath of a disaster, as these projects help prepare communities minimise the impact of natural catastrophes that could hit them. It is imperative that local humanitarian capacities are built in the context of the Philippines, which is both a disaster-prone country and an archipelago. In more centralised humanitarian action, responders would not easily get access to most affected areas due to challenging physical geography as well as lack of efficient and disaster-resilient transport system. While national government is still needed in large-scale-disasters, the massive and systematic preparations, including pre-disaster risk assessment that local government and grassroots actors, including communities, would make their constituents more aware of the risks involved and with timely evacuations, potential casualties will be avoided.</p><p>President Duterte had frequently made threats to abrogate the Philippines-US Visiting Forces Agreement which had raised concerns over the termination's severe impact on the collaboration between the two allies, though he already withdrew his threats and restored the bilateral pact in July 2021. Concerning its impact on US\u2019 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the Philippines, the robust assistance being given by the US, through USAID and other American humanitarian NGOs, to local and community-based actors in the field of disaster preparedness and risk reduction might be insulated from such abrupt termination. Assistance projects funded by the USAID, as shown in the abovementioned examples, do not require the large-scale deployment of US military troops and assets. Such USAID projects require only working with its Filipino humanitarian partners and community-based civil society organisations. This type of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief would also help the US avoid the politically sensitive issue of stationing American troops in the country, while deepening the people-to-people relations with Filipinos through it high impact community-based projects. The COVID-19 assistance is the most recent evidence of how US-Philippines alliance works without the need to utilise the military component. It vividly shows that whether it is in the context of disasters or global pandemic, the longstanding US\u2019 partnerships with grassroots and local actors, through USAID and its partner organisations, have significantly deepened and broadened the bilateral security alliance, even beyond military-led engagements</p><h>Conclusion</h><p>Since the 2013 Haiyan onslaught, the humanitarian norms and framework of the Philippines, as comprehensively discussed in this article, have evolved. From merely enhancing response measures to bolstering localised disaster preparedness and risk reduction capabilities, the country has been trying to integrate the lessons learnt from major humanitarian emergencies that had happened in the past decade. In this regard, the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief strategy of the US for the Philippines has likewise evolved, putting further emphasis on the role of USAID and American humanitarian NGOs in enhancing disaster risk reduction, preparedness and local capability in Philippine communities.</p><p>The US has been one of Philippines\u2019 most involved partners in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, with the logistical support it has provided to the country. But US humanitarian assistance and disaster relief is not just about US military delivering aid to the Philippines; it has become more comprehensive, deeper, and reflective of what is happening in the Philippines\u2019 humanitarian norms on the ground. Analysing the non-traditional security collaboration between the US and the Philippines shows how their work on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief has benefitted vulnerable communities and even strengthened the bilateral alliance. The increasing roles and comprehensive humanitarian activities of USAID, American humanitarian organisations, local NGOs receiving support from USAID, as well as the private sector involving PDRF and American companies clearly demonstrate the multifaceted nature of US-Philippines alliance. However, their impactful roles in deepening the bilateral alliance have not been analysed in the literature. Furthermore, this type of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief-driven alliance is not without Philippine local impetus. The Philippines\u2019 humanitarian actors, from national to local levels, from state to non-state stakeholders, have pushed the evolution of the humanitarian norms and frameworks forward, reflecting the lessons from previous disasters. These norms and frameworks have broadly reshaped America's humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the Philippines.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>ADPC and UNDRR (2019) Disaster Risk Reduction in the Philippines, Status Report.

The guideline, which the body calls \"guidance,\" will be the first international standard in the field of corporate social responsibility.</p><p>\"Every organization is encouraged to become more socially responsible by using this standard, engaging with stakeholders, complying with applicable national laws, and respecting the principles of internationally recognized conventions and other authoritative intergovernmental instruments,\" the ISO said.</p><p>The draft guideline is for voluntary use and is not intended for certification purposes, but it is expected to serve as a reference for companies and other entities to undertake activities linked to social responsibility.</p><p>Similarly, the public are likely to use the guidance as a yardstick to gauge organizations' seriousness about such activities.</p><p>According to the draft guideline, organizations are encouraged to develop and implement energy efficiency programs to reduce energy needs and expand the use of renewable energy as a way of addressing climate change.</p><p>The draft also urges them to specify targets and report on pollution prevention performance, while requesting that they promote environmental technology development and transfer.</p><p>\"Every organization is responsible for some greenhouse gas emissions (either directly or indirectly) and is impacted in some way by climate change,\" it says.</p><p>\"An organization should recognize its responsibility to both minimize its own impact (mitigation) and to plan for a changing climate (adaptation).\"</p><p>The draft also stresses the importance of protecting biodiversity to curb environmental degradation, urging organizations to adopt measures to preserve endangered species and their habitats.</p><p>The draft calls for companies and other organizations to establish a system to trace products through the production and distribution chain so that they can recall products when necessary.</p><p>\"An organization should provide consumers with information about the conditions under which products and services are produced and/or delivered and about the effects of the product or service on consumer health and the environment,\" it says.</p><p>The draft calls for minimized packing and production of recyclable goods to achieve a sustainable consumption cycle.</p><p>On labor practices, the draft urges employers to provide the best possible wages and other conditions of work such as hours of work and holidays \"in accordance with national law and practice.\"</p><p>It calls for employers to confirm that the conditions of work comply with national laws and regulations and are consistent with relevant international labor standards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JEN-Guideline Companies</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JEN2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4RY5-Y600-TWB6-G0NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><timeReceived>7:17 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Kyodo News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Japan Economic Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>February 28, 2008 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
