Centuries of plowing, cutting, and overgrazing has made land less fertile. This has also released billions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HeavyFinance pays farmers to put some of this carbon back into the ground.</p><p>Specifically, the company issues loans to encourage the switch to regenerative farming practices. This includes rotating crops, growing cover crops during the off season, or plowing less often. These processes can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil to arrive at a number.</p><p>TNW Conference - Are you an investor?

But some critics question the science behind it.</p><p>Issuing soil carbon credits relies on broad estimates of how much carbon has been stored. While technologies like satellites and drones are improving coverage, it's still unfeasible to take measurements of every single field or patch of soil. What's more, researchers still don't fully understand the science of how soils store and release carbon.</p><p>Nevertheless, buyers of soil carbon credits see them as a safer bet compared to forest offset credits, issued in exchange for protecting forests at risk of destruction. Issuers have come under mounting scrutiny for overinflating the value of these credits, causing many companies to stop purchasing them.</p><p>HeavyFinance estimates that applying regenerative practices across Ukraine's entire agricultural estate can reduce 757.7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. This is equivalent to the total annual carbon output of Germany.</p><p>One of the themes of this year's TNW Conference is Sustainable Futures.
