[{"relevance_score": 65, "title": "Nature-based solution to address climate change", "published": "2025-08-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dhaka, Aug. 19 -- Climate change is an existential threat to mankind, particularly to affected states. Among other options, Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognised as vital to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. According to IUCN (2016) \"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other words, NbS involves protecting our natural ecosystems such as forests peatlands, wetlands, grasslands, fisheries, timberlands and marine habitats through locally led projects that support communities. Healthy mangroves absorb and store large amounts of carbon. Sea grasses and tidal marshes also act as first line of defence against coastal hazards such as storms/cyclones. When hurricane hits coastal areas, mangroves are the first line of plant communities that take all wind impacts, absorb all storm surges and divert the storm surge away. Everglades Mangrove Forest (South Florida) is of the significant examples of perfect NbS to fight climate change as it takes the first hit from storm surge, capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it (mangroves store nearly four times more carbonthan other forests).</p><p>The Everglades mangroves, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America, home to nearly 550 square miles of mangrove forests, form a strong natural infrastructure against large waves and storm surges; it also stabilises the shores against erosion.</p><p>SIGNIFICANCE: Nature-based solutions i.e., restoration and protection of nature could not only safeguard biodiversity but also help people adapt to the effects of climate change. NbS in urban areas bring varied benefits and ecosystem services such as flood management, cooling effects and recreational values. The mangroves and seagrasses, are among the most efficient carbon sinks available. These ecosystems can absorb more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests, resulting in mitigation of carbon. When properly managed, NbS acts as a dual solution of mitigation and adaptation (enhancing climate resilience). River restoration and protection is another NbS that highly benefits residents and communities. Planting grass and trees along the riverbank, river cleaning through the removal of solid wastes helps restoration of rivers. It also helps us not to get infected with malaria or any other waterborne disease. The significance of NbS is manifested in the Youth4Nature's mission of mobilising youth to advocate for political leaders to deliver up to 30 per cent of climate solutions needed by 2030 through NbS.</p><p>Bangladesh has been a pioneer in promoting NbS by coastal afforestation. The mangrove plantation at the Mukdara and Chokatoli Mouja areas carried out under the Sustainable Forests and Livelihoods (SUFAL) project, implemented in selected sites in 147 upazilas of 28 districts during 2018 to 2023 resulted in collaborative forest management, a protection for coastal people against storms and floods; it also created alternative livelihoods for forest-dependent communities in targeted sites.</p><p>ENGINEERED SOLUTION VS NBS: In many parts of the world, the dominant approach to dealing with the hazards of climate change has been static engineered interventions such as sea walls, wells, and irrigation infrastructure. These can be very expensive, but very effective, at least in the short term. NbS in many situations, can provide a more affordable long-term solution.</p><p>RELEVANCE OF NBS FOR BANGLADESH: National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh (2022) outlined the main climate induced challenges of the country, and its urban areas. These challenges are flash floods and waterlogging, drought, riverbank erosion, urban flood, sea level rise and storm surges, salinity intrusion, extreme heat, heatwave, landslides, sea surface temperature increase and ocean acidification.</p><p>The following case of Kudalichora Canal, Moulvibazar presents an example of NbS that addresses urban challenges of climate change.</p><p>The Kudalichora canal is an example of how restoring natural waterways can significantly enhance climate resilience and urban living. Flowing through the centre of Moulvibazar Municipality, the canal, serves as the area's primary drainage system. Due to flooding, waterlogging, and severe pollution, it was once known as the \"curse of Moulvibazar\". The Canal underwent a transformation through a restoration project led by the municipality and funded by LGRD. This initiative not only improved its drainage capacity but also turned it into a functional and eye-catching urban waterway. The project has also addressed the urban challenges such as indiscriminate waste-dumping and odour pollution, waterlogging in the city and illegal encroachment on both sides of the canal. Boosting urban ecology through the canal and canalside plantation, and better navigability in canal are the other major co-benefits reaped with the implementation of the project.</p><p>NBS FOR SALINITY INTRUSION: The southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh is frequently impacted by tropical cyclones and storm surges. Such cyclones and storm surges inundate the area with saline water. When tidal water gets trapped within embankments or polders, it results in long-lasting salinity that severely hampers crop productivity. It also adversely affects infrastructure, water supplies, soil quality, ecology, and biodiversity. Nature-based solutions such as rainwater harvesting offers an effective way to address water scarcity and reduce reliance on saline groundwater, although on a short-term basis.</p><p>URBAN RAINWATER HARVESTING AS AN NBS: The water treatment project in Mongla City serves as a prime example of nature-based solutions addressing salinity in daily water use. The project features two large rainwater harvesting ponds; the objective of these ponds is to reduce the salinity of river water collected from the Mongla river. Moreover, two overhead tanks store the treated water before the same is distributed throughout the city. This sustainable approach ensures a reliable and safe water supply for the community, showcasing an effective adaptation to the region's environment challenges in addition to its role of mitigation of salinity.</p><p>BLUE CARBON AS A NATURAL CARBON SOLUTION: Blue carbon, known as the greenhouse gases (GHZs) captured and sequestered by coastal and marine ecosystems such as seagrasses, mangroves, salt marsh and other tidal wetlands is recognised as a vital NbS. It is therefore necessary to scale up Nature-based Solutions (NbS) aiming to address the impacts and risk of climate change and environmental degradation. In this process, forming local level action plans aiming to cope with adverse impacts of climate change is imperative.</p><p>Regarding NbS, the Environment, Forest and Climate Change questioned the global push for NbSs without sincere commitments to GHG emission reductions. She observed that it has become fashionable to talk about NbS. Substantiating her observation, she rightly mentioned that if commitment for mitigation is not demonstrated and improved, adaptation will always remain a challenge. According to her, NbS is protecting the natural resource bases that will help adaptation better. She accepts NbS \"as a value that you protect your natural resource bases so that the water logging that persists in Noakhali after a given flood can be addressed.\"</p><p>Her observation also concurs with the observation that \"an NBCS approach can draw upon aspects of the Rights of Nature (RoN) paradigm through exploring the competing concerns of the 'use' of nature by humans, as a tool to mitigate climate change, against the intrinsic value of the environment and the needs of non-human species - all of this while retaining control of climate change\" made by Deane and Bell-James (2025).</p><p>The most significant message we can get from the adviser (who is also an environmental and climate change specialist and a front-line activist for environmental justice) is that NbS is learning from our communities. A Nature-based Solution uses the tools that nature already provides. NbS is not something that should be imposed from the top. Rather, it should be the other way round (Frugal Innovation Forum, 2025). NbS can only be sustained if they are designed and implemented by local communities showing respect to the indigenous knowledge, local needs and management, cultural traditions and human rights.</p><p>To conclude, nature-based solutions are a critical tool for any country's climate action, offering both mitigation and adaptation benefits. NbS is not just about conserving nature in its current state, it is also about integrating nature solutions with all of our climate actions.</p><p>Dr Mohammad Abu Yusuf is a climate analyst and Additional Secretary, Finance Division, Ministry of Finance.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:yusuflotus@gmail.com\">yusuflotus@gmail.com</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

In contrast, urban planners say that in South Asian countries, especially Bangladesh, no such initiatives in Dhaka amount to a suicidal approach. In Copenhagen's Frederiksberg, a similar pilot project has been undertaken. According to the Frederiksberg Municipality's 2024 data, its initial goal is for every resident to be able to see at least one large tree from any window. The project also includes planting trees along footpaths and road dividers. In Asia, Singapore aims to increase greeneries by 30% through similar initiatives, according to the Nature-Based Solutions Institute. Struggling to SurviveWhile smart cities across the world aim for 30% greenery, Dhaka's forest cover remains at just 1%, a figure that experts say threatens residents' very survival. President of the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP) Adil Muhammed Khan said, 'From the very beginning, Dhaka's urbanisation has been unplanned. Buildings have been constructed haphazardly without any plan. Most areas of Dhaka lack playgrounds or parks and there is no arrangement for planting trees around buildings.

Fifty-four per cent of the global population is currently living in cities. By 2050, almost 70pc or close to seven billion people will be living in an urban environment: either in new towns or in the sprawl of existing cities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban growth puts pressure on the land, on natural resources, and on human infrastructure, a situation likely to worsen if not planned for. Already more than 70pc of global CO2 emissions come from cities.</p><p>In the Global South, a combination of demographic compulsions and rural-to-urban migration triggered by economic hope, climate despair and extreme weather events is contributing to urban sprawl. By the end of this decade, there may be as many as 44 megacities, with 10m inhabitants or more, most of them in developing countries. Such a rapid swell by mid-century will have a significant environmental footprint.</p><p>Unlike the Global North, where urbanisation takes place in a systematic manner that generally respects environmental considerations, in developing countries irregular urban sprawl is creeping into agricultural lands, forests and wetlands. This is a recipe for catastrophe. When unfettered urban development spills over into the very ecosystems that sustain life, it leaves cities, particularly their most vulnerable residents, susceptible to large-scale clima\u00ac-te disasters like floods, mudslides, avalan-ches, and dangerously high temperatures.</p><p>Conversion of fertile lands around cities and in the mofussil into housing estates is another dimension of unplanned urbanisation and improper land-use management. It also puts food security at risk. Illegal construction along riverbanks and seasonal streams that obstructs or diverts the water flow from its natural course has led to flash flooding.</p><p>South Asia \u2014 home to more than a quarter of the global population \u2014 is faced with alarming urban challenges. Rising temperatures, which also put city dwellers at greater risk, are partly attributable to receding green cover, which provides shade and lower ambient temperatures, and to excessive concretisation around cities, which contributes to intense heating known as the 'urban heat island' effect. The World Meteorological Organisation reported in June that Asia is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.</p><p>The long-term impact of climate change on water and agriculture productivity is pushing rural populations to shift to cities. When displaced by disasters, rural communities quickly relocate to nearby cities where they are forced to reside in shanty conditions. Such urban spread harms the environment and threatens public health through untreated municipal and industrial waste, and water and air pollution.</p><p>Pakistan has the highest rate of urbanisation in South Asia. Inadequate civic support and lack of industrial infrastructure diminish economic opportunities in rural areas, thus becoming a major driver of the rural-to-urban shift. Currently about 50pc of the population in Pakistan's major cities is reported to live in slums and squatter settlements. Investing in rural development can prevent villages from becoming disorderly pockets of pollution, waste and destitution, often devoid of basic facilities.</p><p>With an increase in population from 150m in 2000 to 250m plus today, Pakistan faces a huge housing deficit. Securing a safe, healthy environment and investing in affordable, climate-resilient urbanisation will not be easy in financially challenging times. But neglecting these issues will have even graver consequences. Any delay in prioritising climate-resilient housing solutions will impair the productive capacity of Pakistani cities. The 2025 Climate Risk Index report by Germanwatch has placed Pakis-tan first on the Climate Risk Index as the country's economy suffered a GDP loss of 4pc between 1993 and 2022.</p><p>The sheer scale of forthcoming urbanisation in Pakistan demands a holistic approach, which takes all factors \u2014 land-use management, nature loss, climate risks, healthcare, human rights etc \u2014 into account.

A belt of below-average SCE extends from western to eastern Asia, with negative anomalies dominating the central region and middle Himalayas.</p><p>Pakistan recorded its wettest April on record, while heavy rainfall in September and October in Nepal triggered floods and landslides. In August, 130 people lost their homes, school, and health facilities due to a glacial lake outburst flood in Thame, Nepal.</p><p>The WMO report notes that in 2024, Myanmar recorded a new national maximum temperature of 48.2\u00b0C, while several parts of India experienced intense heatwaves, with 450 fatalities reported. Lightning strikes killed 72 people in northern India on 10 July and 1,300 people across the year.</p><p>Droughts were also widespread. China's Yunnan and southern Sichuan Provinces faced winter and spring droughts, and by August, drought in the Yangtze River and Chongqing areas had intensified, resulting in economic losses of 2.89 billion yuan.</p><p>\"These observations largely coincide with what is being seen across the HKH region as well,\" said Sher Muhammad, Remote Sensing Specialist at ICIMOD.</p><p>He said that seasonal snowmelt contributes around 25 percent of annual river flows on average across the HKH, rising even higher in western basins. However, continual snow deficits are eroding this critical source, triggering early-summer water shortages, heat stress, and worry among downstream communities.</p><p>In Bhutan, while the last monsoon season was categorised as \"normal\" in terms of rainfall and temperature, the impacts were far from ordinary. The country received an average of 1,161.08 mm of rainfall during the monsoon, against a normal baseline of 1,269 mm. The average temperature recorded was 22.8\u00b0C, compared to the normal of 21.8\u00b0C.</p><p>The monsoon brought challenges and disruptions, including roadblocks, landslides, and flash floods. The flood following incessant rainfall in Dechencholing, Thimphu on August 10, 2024, severely impacted 49 households and displaced 158 residents.</p><p>The National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology (NCHM) reported that the 2024 monsoon began with average rainfall in early June, which increased until mid-July. Rainfall dropped below the climatological norm in late July but returned to normal levels in early August. Temperatures, initially typical, rose from late July through early August.</p><p>Between July and August, extreme weather events were reported across the country. These included a flash flood at Begana Guru Lhakhang stream in Thimphu on July 15, another at Bumthang Lamay Monastery stream on August 5, and heavy rainfall on August 17 affecting Isuna, Paro, and Gidakom.

Wildfires consuming entire communities, floods displacing millions of people, and heat waves claiming hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such extreme weather events are no longer anomalies; they are the new normal, threatening lives and livelihoods in the world's most climate-vulnerable regions - especially in the Global South.</p><p>With traditional responses proving inadequate to this escalating threat, innovative finance must take center stage. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as many as 3.6 billion people currently live in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Between 2010 and 2020, deaths caused by floods, droughts, and storms in those areas were 15 times more frequent than in low-vulnerability regions, underscoring the severe and unequal toll of the climate crisis.</p><p>Conventional wisdom holds that for resource-dependent economies, climate action is a matter of economic survival, while for developing economies, it offers a pathway to sustainable growth and development. But many economies fall into both categories - developing and resource-dependent - compounding the challenge of designing and implementing effective climate strategies.</p><p>While a comprehensive strategy for building climate resilience is essential to strengthening developing economies' ability to withstand shocks, resilience and adaptation must go hand in hand. For vulnerable countries, this may involve reinforcing infrastructure to protect against flooding, investing in drought-resistant crops, and diversifying income sources to reduce dependence on climate-sensitive sectors.</p><p>But conventional modes of resilience financing remain constrained, both in terms of sources and delivery mechanisms. As a result, vital social safeguards and support systems are often underfunded or insufficient. The problem is made worse by growing uncertainty over the availability of concessional financing from developed countries.</p><p>Given this reality, financial innovation must become a central pillar of climate resilience. To that end, financial institutions, governments, and other stakeholders must work together to develop new financing mechanisms aimed at protecting climate-vulnerable regions.</p><p>Encouragingly, several innovative financing funds and mechanisms have emerged to support resilience and adaptation efforts.</p><p>These include the Green Climate Fund, which provides financial assistance to developing countries; the Climate Bonds Initiative, which promotes the growth of the climate bond market; climate insurance, which helps manage and reduce climate-related risks; community-based adaptation, which enables local communities to design and implement their own adaptation strategies; and nature-based solutions, which focus on restoring and protecting natural ecosystems. Even so, such financing falls far short of demand.</p><p>Multilateral development banks play a pivotal role in delivering the financing necessary for vulnerable countries to reduce emissions and invest in adaptation projects. According to the most recent Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks' Climate Finance, MDBs provided a record $125 billion in public climate finance in 2023. Notably, 60% of that total - $74.7 billion - was directed to low- and middle-income countries, highlighting MDBs' commitment to supporting those most exposed to climate risks.</p><p>The IsDB is a notable example. In November 2024, the IsDB approved $1.15 billion in financing to bolster food and water security in Kazakhstan by sustainably irrigating 350,000 hectares of land. The project aims to boost average crop yields by 30%, thereby strengthening community resilience to climate-related disasters and improving the economic well-being of 1.3 million vulnerable people.</p><p>Like other MDBs, the IsDB is grappling with the challenge of strengthening climate resilience across its 57 member countries, more than half of which are more vulnerable to climate change than the global average.</p><p>Addressing such vulnerabilities requires an estimated $75-90 billion annually through 2030 for sustainable agriculture, water, and infrastructure projects. Adaptation-related financial flows to these countries average $23.9 billion per year, leaving a 68% funding gap that the IsDB is actively working to close.</p><p>The growing supply of adaptation financing illustrates MDBs' indispensable contribution to global climate efforts. But success should not be measured only by the amount of money disbursed; instead, it must be judged by tangible, real-world outcomes. While climate finance is growing, its effectiveness hinges on rigorous monitoring and impact assessment.</p><p>Establishing robust reporting frameworks is therefore critical to building stakeholders' confidence and channeling more financing toward adaptation projects. To enhance their impact, MDBs should also adopt targeted results-based and policy-based financing models. Beyond bolstering borrowers' institutional capacity and expanding targeted financing, MDBs also have an opportunity to boost resource mobilization by attracting capital from non-conventional sources.</p><p>The IsDB's sustainability framework is a prime example. Under this scheme, the IsDB has mobilized more than $6 billion by issuing Islamic bonds (Sukuk), attracting both Muslim and non-Muslim investors.</p><p>Rooted in asset-backing and risk-sharing, Islamic finance is inherently aligned with sustainability principles. In recent years, instruments like cooperative insurance (takaful), charitable endowments (waqf), and faith-based crowdfunding platforms have emerged as alternative sources of climate financing across the Muslim world.</p><p>Recognizing the need for targeted climate-funding solutions, the IsDB has actively promoted and supported these mechanisms. By tapping into the $4.5 trillion Islamic finance industry and adopting its asset-backed, risk-sharing model, other MDBs could expand and diversify their funding sources, enabling them to support adaptation and mitigation initiatives in the world's most vulnerable regions.</p><p>But the time for pilot projects and piecemeal interventions is over. To build a sustainable, climate-resilient future, MDBs must urgently scale high-impact solutions, embrace financial innovation, and foster global cooperation. Drawing on more than a half-century of experience, the IsDB is ready to do its part.</p><p>(Muhammad Al Jasser is Chairman of the Islamic Development Bank Group.

Notably, 60% of that total - $74. 7 billion - was directed to low- and middle-income countries, highlighting MDBs' commitment to supporting those most exposed to climate risks."]}, {"relevance_score": 64, "title": "To Mitigate Climate Change, NBS can play a Significant Role", "published": "2025-03-17", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dhaka, March 17 -- Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have gained significant attention in recent years as a means to address environmental degradation, water and food insecurity, natural disasters, and climate crises. The concept of NBS stems from the ecosystem approach. In 2016, the European Commission defined NBS as \"nature-inspired and nature-supported solutions.\" These solutions encompass actions aimed at tackling societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management, and restoration of ecosystems, ultimately benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being. In essence, when we harness nature to address social issues, we are actively implementing NBS.The rapid growth of the world population has led to an increase in daily needs. </p><p>To meet these demands, people are excessively consuming natural resources, which results in resource depletion, significant environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, and disruption of the ecological balance. Consequently, our habitable planet is moving towards a potential catastrophe. It has become crucial to develop innovative methods and technologies that can restore the environment, conserve nature, and address social needs and challenges. NBS can contribute up to 37 percent of the climate change mitigation needed in this area (Cohen-Shacham, 2009).This global framework pushed countries that signed the Paris Agreement 2015 to adopt NBS as part of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). At COP26, NBS received significant attention, with over 137 countries pledging to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030.One example of NBS obligation is the protection of the Sundarbans. This unique ecosystem offers protection against cyclones and tidal waves, creates livelihood opportunities, provides an abundance of fish and honey, serves as an eco-tourism site, absorbs carbon from the atmosphere, and shelters a rich biodiversity. Bangladesh earns approximately USD 1.56 billion annually from the Sundarbans. Similarly, the 18,000-hectare Halaluki Haor, a special wetland, is home to various endangered species of animals and plants. This area produces a significant amount of fish, serves as a vital habitat for migratory birds, and is also an attractive eco-tourism destination. It directly and indirectly supports the livelihoods of about 200,000 people. Migratory birds, and is an eco-tourism site. It directly and indirectly provides livelihood to about 200,000 people.NBS have been in practice in Bangladesh for a long time. According to the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD), the country has been establishing green belts through coastal afforestation since 1960 to protect itself from cyclones and tidal waves. To date, approximately 209,140 hectares of land have been afforested, with more than 93 percent of the trees being mangroves. Another example of NBS is floating agriculture, particularly in Pirojpur, Barisal, and Gopalganj, where farmers grow crops on floating beds made of water hyacinths. This method helps ensure food security even during flooding. In 2013, the Government of Bangladesh allocated USD 1.6 million under the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF).Approximately 40,000 hectares of seven distinct wetlands in Bangladesh were designated as ecologically critical areas in 1999. Along with the Eighth Five-Year Plan (2020-2025), Bangladesh has already prepared Delta Plan 2100, which priorities ecosystem-based approaches. Furthermore, the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy Action Plan (BCCSAP) and the National Adaptation Program (NAPA) have been created which served as the foundation for the roadmap created by the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). It is important to note that the combined budget of the 25 ministries about climate change for FY 2024-2025 is approximately USD 4181.61 billion, or 52.47 percent of the national budget. From FY2020-21 to FY2024-25, there was a 75.31 percent increase in climate allocation.Besides the government, various donor agencies are playing a significant role in the implementation of NBS in Bangladesh, such as the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) and the University of Oxford, who are working on capacity building and policy advocacy. DANIDA International, CARE Bangladesh, and RUPANTAR are working together to build a climate-resilient community in the Bagerhat district through the (CLIMB) program. This initiative focuses on community capacity building and implements climate-adaptive agricultural practices, mangrove afforestation, canal re-excavation, and the planting of salt-tolerant trees. Additionally, the program aims to integrate Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) into the mainstream of development through networking and advocacy at both national and international levels. Moreover, IUCN has given Bangladesh a thorough framework for designing, implementing, and assessing NBS.It is noteworthy that fish farming, agriculture, tree plantations, construction of fences, animal husbandry, and pond digging are not direct NbS but are important components of NBS. All initiatives and strategies that can directly benefit both people and biodiversity are NBS. For example, sustainable management of haor areas, hilly lands, or the Sundarbans by involving local communities. Restoration of extinct forests, mangrove afforestation on chars or islands that arise in rivers or seas, creating green roofs, urban green spaces, and wetlands to combat urban heat. Extensive afforestation of hills with the participation of local communities to prevent landslides, river dredging or restoration of river banks to protect against floods, etc. The main conditions for implementing NBS are: 1. precisely identifying local problems; 2. using nature to solve problems; 3. involving community people in solving problems; and 4. providing long-term benefits to people and biodiversity.The use of NBS in the wider context has increased over the past two decades, which is similar to the conceptual development of other types of interventions, such as ecosystem restoration (SER, 2004), ecosystem-based adaptation (CBD, 2009), ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (FEDRR, 2010), and ecosystem engineering (ODUM, 2003). 2021-2030 has been declared as the UN's Decade of Ecosystem Restoration.In reality, NBS is not a traditional project for several years of implementation, but rather if implemented, it is possible to get the benefits for many years, even from generation to generation. If mangrove forests alone are managed healthily and sustainably, up to 57 billion USD in flood losses can be avoided every year in China, India, Mexico, the USA and Vietnam (Reguero et al., 2018). A study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) found that many NBS can be more cost-effective than traditional social engineering solutions. The 2030 SDG timeframe makes it clear that the ecosystem-based adaptation (CBD) mission is a milestone on the way to the 2050 vision of \"living in harmony with nature.\"Finally, NbS can be considered as an umbrella that addresses multiple social challenges (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016). Despite being a developing country, Bangladesh faces population growth, employment constraints, and inadequate health and education. So our country's strategy and development philosophy should be to address significant social problems by utilizing NbS as much as possible.</p><p>(The author writes on environmental issues [emailprotected] )</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

With countries set to submit early next year their updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world has an opportunity, and a responsibility, to take transformative action to address the climate crisis. The ocean must be central to this effort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody understands this better than small island developing states (SIDS) like Palau. For us, climate policy is not some abstract debate about hypothetical future risks; it is a fight for survival. Already, coral reefs are undergoing bleaching; storms are becoming increasingly frequent and destructive; and droughts are undermining food security. Rising sea levels threaten not just our land, but also our culture, our way of life, and our very existence.</p><p>To date, international support for climate action has fallen far short of meeting developing countries\u2019 needs. SIDS collectively receive less than 2 percent of global climate finance, even as they oversee 30 percent of the world\u2019s territorial waters.

The BEFF aims to unlock financing for ocean-based solutions, particularly biodiversity-positive investments that simultaneously support economic development and climate goals. But, as we saw at COP29, public budgets are already stretched thin. Mobilizing private capital alongside public investment is thus essential to drive meaningful change.</p><p>To understand why, look no further than the shipping industry, which emits more carbon than all but six countries. Critical pieces of the net-zero puzzle are already in place for the industry. Shipping companies are planning their low-carbon transitions. The technologies they need, in particular, \u201cgreen fuels\u201d like green methanol and ammonia, have been developed. And producers are ready to increase output, while continuing to innovate. And yet scaling up production has proved difficult, because investors still view crucial green technologies as too risky.</p><p>This mismatch between ambition and funding underscores the need for creative financing solutions, such as government-backed guarantees or blended-finance instruments. Fortunately, the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance, agreed at COP29, offers an opportunity to set ambitious targets and leverage innovative mechanisms to unlock private investment at scale.</p><p>Despite its disappointments, COP29 delivered another reason for cautious optimism: the discussions taken there reflected growing recognition that ocean action is climate action. This idea, which began gaining traction in 2019 during the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue at COP25, has evolved into a powerful movement. As a result, momentum is building behind ocean-based climate solutions.</p><p>But harnessing this momentum to deliver measurable action, such as the introduction of more marine protected areas covering mangroves and seagrass meadows or scaling up the decarbonization of the shipping industry, will require collaboration across sectors and borders. And it will require far more financing.

On the other, farmers are being driven further from their livelihoods. How can we justify this?\" questions WWF-P's Hammad Naqi Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among the crowd of students gathered on the Indus Highway on March 4, Saqlain Sindhi's voice was the loudest. \"Darya-e-Sindh par daaka dala jaraha hai (Indus River is being robbed),\" he bellowed. As president of the Jeay Sindh Students Federation (JSSF), Sindhi has spent years rallying students, farmers, and labourers, organising protests against policies that threaten the River Indus. But the fight had never been as urgent as it was now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Green Pakistan Initiative is an assault on our river which is vital to our identity, culture, and very existence. This is about our land, our generations to come, and our survival,\" Sindhi asserted, speaking to Dawn.com.</p><p>Diljan Laghari, vice-president of JSSF-Arisar, also protesting the scheme which aims to construct canals on the Indus river, expanded on this sentiment: \"Sindh thrives on agriculture \u2014 our economy depends on it. If the Indus river is drained and our water disappears, so does our livelihood. We refuse to let that happen.\"</p><p>Their words reflect the collective frustration simmering among the youth in Sindh.</p><p>The protest was organised weeks after the inauguration of the Cholistan project by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir on February 15, with thousands of protesters marching along the Indus Highway on March 4. Sindhi and Laghari were among the many who took to the streets in Jamshoro, joining students and activists from nationalist student groups.</p><p>What began as a peaceful protest soon spiralled into chaos as security forces baton-charged and lobbed teargas shells to disperse the demonstrators, turning it into yet another battle for the river unfolding on its own soil.</p><p>Launched last month with three business franchises in Cholistan, the Green Pakistan initiative, Sindhi argued, \"masks the systemic erosion of our heritage under the guise of progress and development\".</p><p>What's the project all about?</p><p>The Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI), spearheaded by the federal government, hinges on a network of six newly developed canals that will channel water from the Indus river to irrigate Punjab's Cholistan region. It is being touted as a bold step towards food security and rural upliftment, transforming barren lands through modern farming techniques.</p><p>With a three-pronged approach \u2014 a Green Agri Mall, a Smart Agri Farm, and an Agri Research and Facilitation Centre \u2014 the plan promises farmers cutting-edge support and aims to maximise crop productivity.</p><p>As per the scheme, the 176km-long Cholistan canal, which is a core element of the project, will draw water from Punjab's existing Rasul-Qadirabad, Qadirabad-Balloki and Balloki-Sulemanki (RQBS) link canals at a staggering cost of Rs211.34 billion. The aim is to cultivate a new command area in southern Punjab by irrigating 1.2 million acres in two phases \u2014 455,000 acres in Phase I and 744,000 acres in Phase II.</p><p>But what is being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab has triggered an uproar in Sindh, where stakeholders fear the project will siphon away their water rights.</p><p>At the centre of the debate is the Sukkur Barrage, a critical component of Sindh's irrigation system, which supplies water to 8.2 million acres of farmland through seven main canals spanning over 5,800 kilometres. Among them, the Nara Canal (592.7 km) and Rohri Canal (334.26 km) extend deep into Sindh, reaching districts like Badin and Mirpurkhas. The barrage also supplies water to Balochistan via the North Western Canal (NWC), which is reflective of its regional significance.</p><p>As the lower riparian province, Sindh contends that these allocations are already extensive and further diversions could cripple its existing irrigation system. Its largest Nara canal's designed discharge is 13,649 cusecs \u2014 almost half of what RQBS existing capacity is. Given Punjab's RQBS will inevitably receive more water than the largest canal in Sindh ever could \u2014 why draw from Sindh's share at all?</p><p>Sindh also points out that the plan, reliant on flows from the Sutlej River \u2014 a tributary of the Indus that feeds the Cholistan Canal \u2014 depends entirely on surplus releases from India, since the river was surrendered under the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. However, with the Sutlej virtually dry, authorities have resorted to an extraordinary measure: manually pumping water from other rivers to sustain the diversion. This spells trouble ahead.</p><p>How much of Sindh's irrigation supply will be compromised? Even a modest reduction in Sukkur's discharge could disrupt this balance, threatening water availability in tail-end regions already facing acute shortages.</p><p>Consequently, Sindh has expressed reservations over the project's reliance on the Indus river. In January 2024, Sindh's caretaker Chief Minister Maqbool Baqar questioned the issuance of its certification, voicing concerns to the then caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar.</p><p>In November last year, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah opposed the plan as well, arguing that the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) lacks the mandate to approve it, given that it has no allocation under the 1991 Water Accord and that the project threatens Sindh's already limited water supply. The contentious water project, challenged by Sindh to protect its permanent water interests, was presented before the Council of Common Interests (CCI) in 2023 and 2024. However, a final decision on the matter remains pending.</p><p>Today, opposition to the project has intensified. Just last week, heated debates erupted in the Sindh Assembly as lawmakers clashed over the project before unanimously passing a resolution demanding \"an immediate halt to all plans and activities related to the construction of the canals.\" CM Murad called for a dialogue among provincial stakeholders to ensure inter-provincial water justice and warned against unilateral diversions. \"Sindh's people have a rightful claim over these rivers,\" he stressed.</p><p>Many activists, lawyers, farmers, and students have also joined the chorus of concern, cautioning against the far-reaching repercussions of the plan.</p><p>With tensions at their peak, critical questions emerge: Why the outrage? What is it about the initiative that has set ablaze such resistance? Who truly benefits from this move and at what cost to those who have relied on the Indus for sustenance for centuries?</p><p>The scare of water scarcity</p><p>Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr, an environmentalist who refers to the Indus river as the \"Maa\" (mother) of Sindhis, has disparaged the very premise of the project, terming it reckless in the face of worsening water scarcity. He said that the Indus is running dry and Sukkur Barrage is witnessing one of the driest years on record, warning that diverting the Indus' water through these new canals suggests draining nearly 20,000 cusecs of water when only 18,000 cusecs remain after Sukkur Barrage. \"This means we will go into a minus,\" he told Dawn.com.</p><p>According to Zulfikar Jr, the very authorities driving the plan forward are the ones sounding the alarm on an impending drought. \"They are fully aware that Sindh is on the brink of a severe water crisis, yet they continue to authorise diversions that will only accelerate depletion,\" said Zulfikar Jr.</p><p>Naseer Memon, a consultant on climate change induced natural disasters, echoed this sentiment, saying the government's indifference to water shortage was evident. \"To put it in perspective: Guddu Barrage can sustain about two million acres of land. Given that over six million acres in Cholistan are to be irrigated in the future, the water requirement would be three times what the barrage can supply. The question is \u2014 where will this water come from?\" he said.</p><p>\"We simply don't have enough water,\" he highlighted. \"Canals remain in drought phases, the dams are steadily shrinking, and for over two decades, Irsa has consistently declared water shortages. The numbers don't lie either. The average discharge downstream of Kotri has plummeted from 40.69 million acre-feet (MAF) between 1976-1998 to just 14.035 MAF from 1999-2023.\"</p><p>As of Saturday, Dawn.com reported that Mangla Dam had officially hit its dead level of 1,050 feet, reducing its ability to supply irrigation water to Punjab and Sindh. Tarbela Dam is not far behind, with its water level dangerously close to its dead level of 1,402ft, standing at 1,405.10ft. The Chashma Reservoir, too, is on the verge of depletion, sitting at 639.20ft, a mere inch away from its dead level of 638.15ft.</p><p>This acute shortage threatens millions of acres of farmland, putting crops like wheat and sugarcane at severe risk. Consequently, Irsa has warned the two provinces \u2014 the country's main breadbaskets \u2014 to prepare for up to a 35 per cent water shortage for the remainder of the Rabi season.</p><p>As upstream diversions intensify, they will starve the Indus Delta \u2014 the region where the river meets the sea \u2014 hastening seawater intrusion and decimating fragile ecosystems. Beyond this, the controversial project carries a dangerous ripple effect, exacerbating water woes in Sindh's parched cities.</p><p>With urban populations swelling, the demand for municipal, industrial, and commercial water is increasing at an equal pace. Karachi alone depends on the Indus for 85pc of its water primarily sourced from Keenjhar Lake, which is fed by the Indus, while Hyderabad, Larkana, and Sukkur rely on it entirely.</p><p>However, the worsening scarcity isn't just an issue of supply \u2014 it's also a public health disaster waiting to unfold. Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur \u2014 already crippled by chronic shortages \u2014 face a spike in pollution levels as drinking water becomes increasingly toxic.</p><p>According to the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), Hyderabad's water carries 790 milligrams per litre of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), exceeding the World Health Organisation's (WHO) 500mg/l threshold. This is a result of shrinking faucet flows in the Indus and unchecked pollution.</p><p>Environmental expert Memon explained that as natural river water shrinks, the river loses its ability to cleanse itself, leading to a surge in contamination levels. Constructing more canals upstream will further deprive Kotri Barrage \u2014 the source of drinking water in urban centres \u2014 of the water needed to dilute contaminants, risking a full-blown health crisis in Karachi, Hyderabad, Tando Mohammad Khan, and Badin.</p><p>The dangers of toxic water are tragically familiar. In 2004, Hyderabad saw a devastating outbreak when as many as 55 people lost their lives, and around 6,000 were hospitalised after consuming contaminated water. With worsening water shortages, the risk of another public health disaster looms large.</p><p>The Ravi and Sutlej, overloaded with agriculture runoff and industrial waste, are on the verge of becoming entirely unfit for human consumption. \"Millions in Karachi and Hyderabad will be forced to drink poisoned water,\" he cautioned.</p><p>'Anti-people project?'</p><p>The crisis threatens to dismantle entire ways of life. As rivers dry up and land becomes unsuitable for farming, communities that have depended on these waters for generations find themselves at risk of losing their cultural identity.</p><p>\"Initially, the government was championing the plan as 'cooperative farming', presenting it as an inclusive approach to agriculture. They have now tactfully altered their language, terming it 'corporate farming' \u2014 because that is exactly what it is \u2014 a profit-driven, exploitative model of agriculture,\" said Zulfikar Jr. He alleged that the federal government is actively seizing lands from farmers in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan, to integrate them into these irrigation networks.</p><p>According to Zulfikar Jr, farmers, zamindars, and labourers rely on the existing local system which, as imperfect as it may be, manages to sustain the local population. \"Now, instead of feeding our own people, this water will irrigate cash crops that can be exported to countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. This project is not for Pakistanis. Let's be absolutely clear about that,\" he stated.</p><p>Zulfikar Jr was referring to reports that Pakistan is courting $6 billion from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain over the next three to five years to revolutionise its agriculture sector. The aim is to bring 1.5 million acres of unused land under cultivation and upgrade 50 million acres with advanced mechanisation to usher in a new era of corporate farming.</p><p>In November 2024, the federal government revealed that only 8.2 million acres of land in Sindh is cultivated compared to more than 30 million acres in Punjab. Against this backdrop, it is important to note that as 18 million acres of land in Sindh remain uncultivated, its water is diverted to irrigate just 1.2 million acres in Punjab.</p><p>Eighteen million acres left barren \u2014 to water just one. Let that sink in.</p><p>\"What do you think will happen then? Farmers will be pushed off their ancestral lands \u2014 in southern Punjab, in Sindh, in my hometown, Larkana. And this is not simply a default consequence of the plan; it is deliberate, engineered dislocation,\" said Zulfikar Jr.</p><p>He added that the displaced haris (farmers) will have no choice but to migrate to urban slums, where they will struggle to find employment. Their traditional way of life will be erased. \"This is cultural genocide of a people,\" he said.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the slow death of Sindh's fertile lands began several years ago. Seawater intrusion has ravaged Thatta and Badin, regions once renowned for rice and wheat cultivation. They have now turned barren due to increased soil salinity. Over 1.2 million people \u2014 mostly small-scale farmers and fisherfolk \u2014 have been uprooted as their lands turn uninhabitable. A study by the Sindh Development Institute estimates that 70pc of the delta's agricultural land is no longer viable for conventional farming.</p><p>\"They want zamindars to abandon their lands and lease new land at a minimum of 5,000 acres. That's the size of the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) in Karachi. But most zamindars own 500-600 acres \u2014 even the wealthiest waderas do not have 5,000 acres,\" he explained. Their goal is to force traditional landowners out of the picture and turn poor farmers into migrant labourers working on land that has been made foreign to them, he claimed.</p><p>In a similar vein, Dr Riaz Shaikh, dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Szabist, questioned the true intent behind such grand infrastructure projects. His concern underscores a pattern seen elsewhere: land development projects initially presented as solutions for local populations often end up displacing them instead.</p><p>\"Today, we're talking about irrigating the land, tomorrow it could easily morph into something else \u2014 perhaps a highway slicing through the desert, followed by commercial ventures and farmhouses,\" he warned.</p><p>Shaikh sees this as yet another \"anti-people project\" with no input from those most affected. \"At the very least, follow international standards. At the very least, ask the people of Cholistan if they agree. But they're absent from this debate. We are at the mercy of those in power,\" he lamented.</p><p>Hammad Naqi Khan, director general of WWF-Pakistan (WWF-P), also criticising the blind embrace of corporate farming, said that everything ultimately boils down to elite capture. \"On one hand, fertile farmland is being swallowed up by luxury housing schemes, golf courses, and weekend retreats. On the other, farmers are being driven further from their livelihoods. Both, direct consequences of the plan. How can we justify this?\" he said, pointing out the misplaced priorities of the decision-makers.</p><p>The land, the rivers, and the traditions tied to them are now collateral damage in the pursuit of an elaborate scheme that will pick profit over people each time, he reinstated.</p><p>Memon focused on the aspect of deepening poverty as projects with corporate interests at the expense of those at the margins are pushed forward. \"The Indus Delta is already on its last breath. This will be the final nail in its coffin. Visit the region, observe the conditions people live in and you'd think you have stepped into the 16th century.\"</p><p>A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) survey on multidimensional poverty reported that in districts such as Sujawal, Thatta, and Badin, nearly 80pc of people live in extreme poverty.</p><p>\"Their livelihoods are gone. Their health is deteriorating. There is no life for them. And now, this scheme will take away even the last drops of water they rely on.\" He called it a great human tragedy.</p><p>The collapse of an entire ecosystem</p><p>\"Almost half of the water comes from glacier melt, and the rest from the rains, primarily monsoon rains. But both lifelines are becoming dangerously unreliable,\" WWF-P's Khan explained, adding that glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate, unleashing floods in one season and leaving parched riverbeds the next. Meanwhile, erratic monsoons swing between extremes \u2014 bringing either heavy downpours or droughts. \"We are a water-stressed country, yet we continue to mismanage our most precious resource,\" he warned.</p><p>\"At WWF-P, we say 'no river stretch should run dry.' That is a basic environmental principle,\" he asserted. But the Indus is being choked at its source. With reduced freshwater flows, the sea will further creep inland, swallowing fertile land and poisoning what remains, he stated.</p><p>As a consequence, Khan mentioned that there is potential for further loss of mangrove forests \u2014 Pakistan's natural coastal defenders and a breeding ground for marine life. \"It's scientifically established that mangroves require estuaries, the junction where both freshwater and seawater mix, to grow. But with the Indus running dry and failing to replenish these critical ecosystems, the forests will inevitably wither. As they die out, coastal erosion will accelerate, leaving communities vulnerable to tsunamis, storms, and cyclones,\" he emphasised.</p><p>Equally concerned about the increasing threat of climate change-induced disasters, Shaikh said that mangroves, which produce 10 times more oxygen than an average tree, are vanishing. \"Without them, we are exposed\". He added that Sindh's coastal agriculture, once abundant with premium papayas, bananas, and chikoos, is already in decline.</p><p>Moreover, said Shaikh, fishermen along the delta cast their nets into waters that no longer breathe. The river's flow has weakened, and with it, the oxygen that sustains marine life. As the fish disappear and the nets come up empty, centuries-old coastal communities are forced to abandon their homes and relocate, in pursuit of water that no longer reaches them, he lamented.</p><p>Memon concurred. \"There are numerous species that depend on mangrove forests as nurseries. Because of the shortage of freshwater flows, the fish species, and the whole aquatic ecosystem, will collapse along with the mangroves.\"</p><p>Zulfikar Jr, also the founder of Bulhan Bachao, an organisation which works on wildlife conservation through community engagement, cautioned that we'll be staring at an ecological disaster of unimaginable scale, especially when it comes to the extinction of species like the Indus River dolphin.</p><p>The Indus River dolphin, found nowhere else in the world, could be among the first to disappear if the project moves forward. Around 90pc of its population thrives in the very waters that will be siphoned away, he explained. \"Over the years, these creatures have navigated the river despite the perils they've faced. But they cannot navigate a world without water.\"</p><p>What could've been...</p><p>As a water engineer and environmentalist working in the field for around 30 years, Khan said that it saddens him to see decision-makers prioritising such costly infrastructure ventures, rather than addressing the underlying issues within the existing system. \"Instead of moving ahead, let's take a step back,\" he suggested.</p><p>\"Take our agricultural yields \u2014 whether it's cotton, rice, or wheat. We don't even need to compare our output with superpower countries like China or the US; let's simply take India's example. The geographical location is the same, the land is the same, yet we lag far behind. So, if the land itself isn't the limiting factor, what systemic inefficiencies are holding us back?\" Advocating for a glass-half-full outlook, he stressed that this is a reflection of our untapped potential \u2014 proof that there is still potential.</p><p>He stated that provincial agricultural departments, which should be guiding farmers on best practices, conducting research, and ensuring sustainable land use, remain underperforming and unaccountable. According to him, without strict oversight and reforms, even the most ambitious projects will fail to deliver meaningful, tangible results.</p><p>Khan emphasised that policymakers must reassess cropping patterns, tailor decisions based on those assessments, and hold those in charge responsible. \"But all we do is throw around buzzwords like 'corporate farming' and pursue projects that do more harm than good\".</p><p>For him, the discussion needs to shift to overlooked nature-based solutions and alternatives, which offer far more sustainable and cost-effective results. He builds on three key points: strategic land-use planning, innovative water management, and maximising existing resources.</p><p>Proper land-use planning, he said, is the foundation of responsible development. \"We need to define clear zones for housing, agriculture, industry, and environmental protection. Without this, we continue to see fertile agricultural land disappear under unchecked urban sprawl, while marginalised areas are expected to sustain large-scale projects with little regard for feasibility.\"</p><p>Secondly, he underscored the potential of aquaculture and forestry as viable alternatives, particularly in degraded lands. \"Look at the blackish water in parts of Cholistan \u2014 rather than dismissing it as useless, we should explore what kind of crops can thrive there. Can we grow salt-tolerant crops? Can we use it for aquaculture? What about agroforestry? Can we cultivate tree species that can be harvested in six years for timber or biodiesel?\" Khan insisted that these are the questions the government needs to ask before deciding to pour billions into unsustainable projects.</p><p>Lastly, he called for enhancing existing irrigation systems within canal command areas. \"If food security is the real concern behind corporate farming, why aren't we first improving the way we irrigate our crops? There is ample opportunity to optimise agronomic practices on the land we already have \u2014 if only we choose to look in that direction.\"</p><p>It's not Punjab vs Sindh, it's powerful vs powerless</p><p>We already have a troubled situation across all provinces. The people are fuming everywhere, said Memon.</p><p>Speaking in the context of Sindh, he warned that a huge political movement is taking root. \"If you follow Sindhi media, channels, newspapers \u2014 you'd know that every single day brings fresh strikes, demonstrations, and riots. Yet, most mainstream media outlets are barely giving it the coverage it deserves.\"</p><p>\"When that happens, what sentiment do you think it creates? Think politically. Think of relationships between people and between provinces. What is already strained is being further damaged, and this is a dangerous sign for the federation,\" he expressed.</p><p>Memon brought attention to the fact that the impact of the project will not be exclusive to Sindh; southern Punjab, too, will experience a perpetual water shortage. \"Cholistan is already a poverty-stricken region, and its people will not see any economic relief from this initiative. In a corporate farming model, the benefits are reaped solely by private companies and it's important to not lose sight of who your fight is really against,\" he said.</p><p>Khan echoed this concern. \"A farmer sitting at the tail end of Punjab shares a similar fate with a farmer based in Sindh. He doesn't get water either \u2014 not even through perennial canals. Both of them survive by pumping whatever little water they can,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't want to make this a Punjab vs Sindh issue because it really isn't,\" Zulfikar Jr noted too, aware of how easily the outrage against resource exploitation can be conflated with hostility against a specific province. He cautioned to steer clear of narratives that can be reduced to a provincial rivalry.</p><p>\"I want to see a united, happy, and equal Pakistan, and this project, to put it as simply as I can, is a slap in the face of the unity of our federation,\" he concluded.</p><p>The author is a Social Development and Policy major who aims to amplify the voices of underrepresented communities and challenge the status quo through storytelling.

The continent endures some of the harshest impacts of climate disruptions, losing up to 15 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) annually due to climate-related challenges. This alarming figure underscores the profound economic and social toll of climate change on a region already grappling with poverty and inequality. At the recent COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan, African leaders reiterated the urgency for decisive global action to address this escalating crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recent climate events have amplified the vulnerability of African nations. Rising sea levels threaten coastal regions in West Africa, causing displacement and infrastructure damage. In East Africa, prolonged droughts have devastated crops and livestock, triggering a severe food security crisis. These erratic and intensifying climate patterns jeopardize the livelihoods of millions of farmers and destabilize economies heavily reliant on agriculture.</p><p>In 2023 alone, climate-related disasters pushed an estimated 14 million Africans into poverty. This stark statistic highlights the urgency of addressing the crisis. Unlike wealthier regions, African nations lack the resources to adequately mitigate or adapt to climate impacts, making them particularly susceptible to its devastating consequences.</p><p>Africas reliance on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, fishing, and tourism exacerbates the issue. For instance, farmers in the Sahel region report shorter, more intense growing seasons, leading to reduced crop yields and heightened food insecurity. These pressures, compounded by existing socio-economic vulnerabilities, push many communities further into extreme poverty.</p><p>Another critical dimension of Africas climate crisis is the growing migration and displacement caused by climate events. Millions are forced to leave their homes in search of food, water, and livelihoods. Without immediate action, these migrations will intensify, creating humanitarian crises and straining the infrastructure of neighboring regions. The ripple effects of such instability underscore that Africas climate crisis is not confined to the continent-it is a global issue with far-reaching implications.</p><p>In response to these challenges, African leaders and climate advocates have proposed actionable strategies to address the continents vulnerabilities and promote sustainable growth. These strategies, if supported globally, could transform Africa into a leader in green energy and climate resilience.</p><p>One of Africas key strengths lies in its abundant natural resources essential for clean energy technologies. Minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are critical for batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels, are found in abundance across the continent. By harnessing these resources responsibly, African nations can transition from environmentally damaging extractive industries to sustainable green economies. This shift not only positions Africa as a vital player in the global clean energy market but also mitigates the economic risks posed by climate disruptions.</p><p>In addition to its mineral wealth, Africas vast forests and unique ecosystems offer immense potential for carbon sequestration. Conservation and reforestation initiatives, particularly in the Congo Basin, are crucial for global climate stability. Protecting these forests not only captures carbon but also preserves biodiversity, sustains rural livelihoods, and safeguards critical water sources. Nature-based solutions provide a holistic approach to addressing climate challenges while enhancing ecological and social resilience.</p><p>At COP29, African leaders highlighted the urgent need for adequate financial resources to build climate resilience. Current global commitments fall woefully short of what is required. Africa needs more than $100 billion annually for climate adaptation, yet only $11.4 billion was committed in 2019-2020. Bridging this funding gap is critical for investing in resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, water management, and food security programs.</p><p>Africas renewable energy potential is another area of immense promise. From the solar-rich deserts of North Africa to the hydroelectric capacity of sub-Saharan rivers, the continent has the resources to lead a green energy revolution. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure can simultaneously reduce emissions and address energy poverty, as over 600 million Africans currently lack reliable electricity. Expanding access to clean energy would not only improve living standards but also drive sustainable economic development and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>While Africa bears the brunt of climate change, its contribution to global emissions is minimal. The responsibility for mitigating the crisis rests heavily on developed nations, which are historically the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. These countries have a moral and practical obligation to support Africas climate adaptation and green transformation efforts.</p><p>Financial commitments from high-income nations must be scaled up and delivered transparently to ensure they reach the regions most in need. Beyond funding, developed countries can share advanced renewable energy technologies and expertise to accelerate Africas clean energy transition. Such support would not only empower Africa to address its energy challenges but also benefit the global fight against climate change.</p><p>The consequences of inaction are dire. Climate disruptions in Africa will exacerbate global instability, creating economic, political, and humanitarian challenges that transcend borders. Supporting Africas climate resilience is therefore not just an ethical imperative but a strategic necessity for global stability and environmental health.</p><p>Africas climate crisis is one of the defining challenges of our time. The devastating impacts of climate change are already unfolding, with millions of lives, ecosystems, and economies at risk. The strategies proposed by African leaders at COP29 offer a roadmap for a resilient and sustainable future. However, these initiatives require substantial global support to succeed.</p><p>The international community must recognize that addressing Africas climate challenges is integral to securing a stable and sustainable future for all.

This shift not only positions Africa as a vital player in the global clean energy market but also mitigates the economic risks posed by climate disruptions. In addition to its mineral wealth, Africas vast forests and unique ecosystems offer immense potential for carbon sequestration. Conservation and reforestation initiatives, particularly in the Congo Basin, are crucial for global climate stability. Protecting these forests not only captures carbon but also preserves biodiversity, sustains rural livelihoods, and safeguards critical water sources. Nature-based solutions provide a holistic approach to addressing climate challenges while enhancing ecological and social resilience. At COP29, African leaders highlighted the urgent need for adequate financial resources to build climate resilience. Current global commitments fall woefully short of what is required. Africa needs more than $100 billion annually for climate adaptation, yet only $11. 4 billion was committed in 2019-2020. Bridging this funding gap is critical for investing in resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, water management, and food security programs."]}, {"relevance_score": 16, "title": "UN chief calls for global action on extreme heat", "published": "2024-07-26", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has released a \"Call to Action\" on extreme heat in response to the deadly impacts of rising temperatures all over the world. </p><p>The call to action outlines the global need to care for the vulnerable, protect workers, boost resilience using data and science, and limit global average temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C. </p><p>The climate crisis is driving temperatures up to unbearable levels all over the world, leading to heat-related deaths, heat-related illnesses, and putting strain on health systems all over the world.

Countries in the region also need assistance to phase out coal.</p><p>But the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference COP29 could offer some hope, with developed countries agreeing to channel US$300 billion (S$402 billion) a year to developing countries by 2035. The ultimate aim is to raise US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for countries in need, through various forms of finance.</p><p>But the US$300 billion core amount was criticised as woefully insufficient by climate-vulnerable countries and civil society, who expected richer countries \u2014 who were historical emitters \u2014 to commit more.</p><p>It is also uncertain how the amount will be raised. While developed countries will take the lead, the COP29 decision stated that the amount will come from \"a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources\".</p><p>Mr Gao Xi, a research associate at the NUS Energy Studies Institute (ESI), said: \"Most South-east Asian countries are coastal, making them particularly vulnerable to threats such as typhoons, floods and droughts caused by climate change. Frequent extreme weather events often result in significant financial losses and social disruptions.\"</p><p>In 2024 alone, the Philippines was struck by six typhoons within a span of 30 days \u2014 between October and November \u2014 killing more than 170 people, displacing more than 214,000 people and causing damage worth about 470 million pesos (S$10.8 million). While the archipelago is prone to tropical storms, such back-to-back typhoons within a month is unusual.</p><p>As most countries in South-east Asia are still developing and have relatively weak economic foundations, climate finance is necessary for the region to take climate action, added Mr Gao, with money particularly needed for clean energy generation, low-carbon transport and coastal defence.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, Asean will need US$21 billion in investments annually from 2026 to 2030 just to upgrade its energy infrastructure. And to build resilience against climate impacts, the region needs US$422 billion until 2030.</p><p>The finance outcomes from the UN conference in Azerbaijan could also benefit other developments in South-east Asia, such as the future regional power grid and carbon trading, which can also benefit Singapore.</p><p>Funding the Asean power grid</p><p>The funds pledged at COP29 could provide crucial support for accelerating the development of the Asean power grid.</p><p>One of the region's decades-long ambitions, the complex power interconnection will enable electricity trade across borders \u2014 for both energy security and access to greener energy.</p><p>The regional ambition made progress with the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore electricity import pilot in 2022, which transmitted 100MW of hydropower from Laos to Singapore, via Malaysia and Thailand. This was later extended to include another 100MW from Malaysia's electricity grid in October 2024, but this includes a mix of energy sources, including coal and natural gas.</p><p>Singapore is also laying the groundwork for the regional grid by committing to import 5.6GW of clean electricity from Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia.</p><p>Asean envisions a power grid by 2045, and climate finance has the potential to address the unique challenges of financing such a large-scale, multi-country initiative, said Mr Beni Suryadi, acting executive director at the Asean Centre for Energy based in Indonesia.</p><p>Several key challenges make traditional financing for the Asean power grid difficult. One is cross-border investment risks, since the giant grid will involve multiple countries with different regulatory frameworks and tariffs.</p><p>Another is the high upfront capital required, especially for building the grid and transmission infrastructure. The resulting long payback periods can put off traditional investors, who seek quicker returns, noted Mr Beni.</p><p>Climate finance can loosen these gridlocks. These funds often come in the form of concessional loans with low interest rates, grants, or guarantees which lower the financial risks for private investors. When forms of finance like green bonds, blended finance and funding from the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank are injected into a mega-project first, the risks are lowered for private investors to participate.</p><p>Blended finance refers to bringing together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks, philanthropies and the private sector.</p><p>\"This is where climate finance can step in \u2014 by bridging these gaps, mitigating risks, and enabling investments that otherwise might not materialise,\" he added.</p><p>As a wealthier developing country, Singapore would not be a recipient of the US$1.3 trillion, and instead would contribute voluntarily to climate finance. But the island-state would be a beneficiary, nonetheless, of the Asean power grid, which would enable it to import low-carbon and renewable electricity to reduce its carbon emissions.</p><p>Singapore's National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) said the Asean power grid would maximise the region's diverse renewable energy potential by matching renewable resource-rich areas with those that need to buy clean energy.</p><p>\"By doing so, it can reduce the region's dependence on fossil fuels, increase resilience against fluctuations in global energy markets and make progress towards our decarbonisation targets,\" the NCCS spokesperson added.</p><p>But while the Asean power grid is undoubtedly a worthy project, directing climate finance to it would not be straightforward, as it would be considered an electricity transmission project, said Mr Beni.</p><p>Whether transmission projects are considered to be green and contribute to reducing carbon emissions is still a question to be settled.</p><p>\"At the moment, climate finance for transmission infrastructure projects is still nascent, while the needs are huge,\" he added.</p><p>South-east Asia: Between the devil and the deep blue sea</p><p>South-east Asia is in a tricky position when it comes to receiving climate finance as stipulated by COP29. On the one hand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia were, until 2019, among the 20 countries most exposed to climate risks, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, which is published by non-profit organisation Germanwatch.</p><p>But South-east Asia is expected to continue its fast economic growth, accompanied by more greenhouse gas emissions, noted Dr Kim Jeong Won, a senior research fellow at ESI.</p><p>This growth has reclassified many Asean nations as middle-income countries, reducing their eligibility for development financing, she added.</p><p>Among the developing nations, the least developed countries and small island developing states are recognised as having the greatest need for support.</p><p>Given the competition for funding, a significant gap already exists between the required investments and actual finance that the countries have received. For example, only 9.7 per cent of investments from the UN's Green Climate Fund \u2014 the world's largest fund of its kind \u2014 has been channelled to South-east Asia.</p><p>Similarly, only 6.3 per cent of investments from the UN's Adaptation Fund has been allocated to Asean countries, said Dr Kim.</p><p>She added: \"South-east Asian countries are expected to compete for limited bilateral and multilateral public funding with other low-income developing countries.\"</p><p>If they want to attract a greater share of private funding, it is vital that countries develop more innovative finance models and attractive climate-related projects, she noted.</p><p>Ms Lau Xin Yi, sustainable finance lead for South-east Asia at the Carbon Trust consultancy, is looking at a newer type of finance tool called climate transition bonds.</p><p>The proceeds from these bonds can be used for a wider range of decarbonisation projects, including those in hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and petrochemicals.</p><p>Despite guidelines to prevent greenwashing, Ms Lau noted that about 90 per cent of the transition bonds issued globally has been dominated by Japan's issuances.</p><p>\"Climate transition bonds can help South-east Asia unlock more capital needed for its low-carbon transition. More capital will be channelled towards clean technologies, but how transition is achieved will vary across sectors and regions,\" said Ms Lau.</p><p>More incentives to protect Asean forests</p><p>A bright spot at COP29 was an agreement on carbon trading, achieved after nearly 10 years of negotiations.</p><p>Carbon trading is governed under a segment of the Paris Agreement known as Article 6, which was finalised at COP29.

A crucial aspect of this process is to increase demand for credits.</p><p>\"The market needs to have stronger demand signal, and it is unclear yet whether companies will suddenly trust these (Article 6) mechanisms and make funding available to address their climate impacts,\" he added.</p><p>Mr Anshari said: \"We are closely tracking the development of the infrastructure and tracking systems required to operationalise Article 6 decisions, and we expect to see meaningful progress in 2025 with the first few (carbon) projects to be registered under the (UN) by COP30 in Brazil.\"</p><p>Paying up for climate</p><p>At COP29, nations set an ambitious goal to channel US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 to developing countries to help them reduce carbon emissions and deal with the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The Straits Times breaks down the layers of finance needed to achieve this target based on insights from independent experts, who suggest raising US$1 trillion annually by 2030 as the first step.</p><p>1.

Limiting Global Warming to 1.5\u00b0C Last year at COP28 in Dubai, the United Nations' 'Roadmap to Mission 1.5\u00b0C,' which aims to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 1.5\u00b0C beyond pre-industrial levels, was the focus of the first of three consecutive COP summits: The UAE (COP28), Azerbaijan (COP29), and Brazil (COP30).</p><p>in 2023, the first \"global stock-take\" was carried out to meet the goals established by the Paris Agreement.</p><p>the primary result of COP28, the \"UAE Consensus\" accord, outlined the appropriate course of action for each party.</p><p>at last year's COP28, the first global assessment of global efforts to combat climate change under the Paris Agreement and maintain the 1.5\u00b0C global temperature limit was concluded.</p><p>this year, the EU has already called for efforts to keep the 1.5\u00b0C goal within reach. However, limiting warming to 1.5\u00baC requires collective effort and further action from all countries, especially from major economies.</p><p>this COP29 should focus on enhancing ambition and ensuring all parties commit to ambitious national plans and transparency, including finalizing the first enhanced transparency framework.</p><p>technology Development and Transfer Framework Strengthening the current technology development and transfer framework with additional requirements should be one of the leading climate governance issues for COP29.</p><p>a technology framework should be established to provide overarching guidance to the work of the Technology Mechanism in promoting and facilitating enhanced action on technology development and transfer to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement (PA).</p><p>the \"technology development and transfer\" framework should be developed under Article 10 of PA: \"Parties have a long-term perspective on the necessity of fully achieving technology development and transfer to strengthen resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissionsAs the overall working pace for reaching the PA goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius pre-industrial levels is inconsistent, further guidelines are needed for climate technology innovation from a policy and practice perspective.</p><p>attributions of Loss and Damage to Climate Change Assigning anthropogenic climate change to extreme weather events and determining whether and to what degree specific events have increased in frequency or intensity are the goals of climate attribution science. Changes in the likelihood or frequency of such occurrences can be computed by developing various climate models.</p><p>additionally, so-called slow-onset events, like sea level rise, can be attributed to climate change through trend attribution.</p><p>as a result, research can identify and quantify the effects of both individual occurrences and longer-term changes linked to climate change regarding monetary losses and damages. However, attribution science cannot measure some losses, namely non-material losses like the loss of a person's life or cultural property.</p><p>impact attribution is a new discipline, and evaluations are a common way to communicate how climate change affects weather and climatic events in the real world. However, several significant issues still need to be resolved by the community to ensure that the subject continues to progress while maintaining scientific rigor and that stakeholders and related applications appropriately employ attribution findings. Funding for Loss and Damage A fund for developing nations experiencing loss and damage from climate impacts (the \"FRLD\") was operationalized by the United Arab Emirates, the hosts of COP28, to start the meeting with a rapid and comprehensive victory last year. However, only $661 million has been committed thus far. Given the projected damage inflicted by many rapid onset events such as hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical cyclones observed last year, FRLD funding is far short of what is required.</p><p>at the summit, the COP29 presidency pledged to continue to seek new pledges to the fund. The loss and damage issues are expected to be discussed in the negotiations.</p><p>it is expected that COP29 will approve these short-term measures and continue the discussion on improving and fortifying loss and damage financing arrangements. Negotiators will also examine the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), which was established to address the consequences of climate change that go beyond ecological and human adaptation. Conference participants and civil society organizations, including the Least Developed Countries, will continue to engage and share their experiences responding to loss and damage.</p><p>increase financial support within the evolving framework of damage and loss governance, which will also be a focus of COP29. Guiding Countries in Planning to Implement Adaptation It is expected that COP29 will drive adaptation action by guiding countries from planning to implementing their adaptation plans. People worldwide are affected by climate change, and it is becoming increasingly clear that making adaptation investments now will save lives and reduce expenses later.</p><p>a framework for the Global Goal of Adaptation was already adopted during COP28.</p><p>adaptation to the effects of climate change has gradually moved up the worldwide agenda as its effects intensify. Despite eight years of negotiations, little progress has been made in defining the global goal for adaptation (GGA), which the Paris Agreement requires. Countries ultimately agreed to a broad framework for the objective at COP28. However, there are no clear, measurable goals in the framework by which advancement may be evaluated. Furthermore, it does not consider technology transfer or financing, making it unclear how adaptation measures may be put into practice.</p><p>it was recommended that nations create National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) by 2025 and show progress in implementing them by 2030.</p><p>to speed up adaptation efforts, lower vulnerability, and boost resilience, countries will continue to evaluate their progress in creating and executing NAPs and provide suggestions.</p><p>it is time to identify what is effective and requires urgent attention because developing nations have made significant strides in adaptation planning and execution.</p><p>this year, the emphasis should be on giving nations more direction on how to draft and carry out their NAPs. Furthermore, COP29 may draw financial commitments for loss, damage, and adaptation, including donations to the Adaptation Fund. Finally, COP29 adaptation negotiators must ensure that the climate finance aim appropriately reflects adaptation.</p><p>additionally, the meeting in Baku will be a significant chance to further the UAE-Bel\u00e9m work program.</p><p>this work program aims to provide a set of metrics for tracking ad-vancement against the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience's goals. Nations and the gathered specialists Establish a Just Transition Work Program Parties decided to create a work program on just transition at COP27 to consider methods to accomplish the objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>the goals of the program were established and approved by the parties at COP28 a year later.</p><p>until 2026, the Just Transition Work Program's two-year roundtable discussions must be efficiently run to succeed.</p><p>one of the historic agreements reached at COP28 was to \"move away from fossil fuels in energy systems\" for the first time in 28 years of negotiations. Parties need to stay focused on the main issue, which is how to phase out the use of fossil fuels in a timely, effective, and equitable manner. However, the COP28 accord was woefully inadequate in addressing the climate crisis. Making headway on new measures at COP29 will be challenging, and it will be crucial to avoid reversing previous pledges. Parties failed to reach a consensus on improving the program's procedures or creating a more organized work plan during the 60th session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Implementation. Furthermore, there was no agreement on properly structuring international collaboration or engaging pertinent stakeholders through social discussion.</p><p>the program's ability to expedite just transition initiatives may be jeopardized if COP29 results in no progress. Parties must reach a consensus on comprehensive and ambitious mechanisms at COP29 to move the Just Transition Work Program forward. Delivering the conversations and results required to scale and accelerate just transition pathways internationally requires a well-defined, organized work plan backed by active stakeholder participation and international cooperation. Plans for a just transition, phase-out routes, and information on reserves and extraction should all be included in the NDCs of nations that produce fossil fuels.</p><p>urgency of Boosting Ambition There is an urgent need for more ambition as the 2025 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submission deadline draws near.</p><p>the global stocktake (GST) findings, agreed upon at COP28 and offered a roadmap for the next phase of climate action, including the historic choices to double energy efficiency, quadruple renewables, and move away from fossil fuels, must be reflected in them. Parties have a crucial opportunity to propose their climate strategies at COP29.</p><p>in addition, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) should inform the adaptation component of NDCs.</p><p>this enhances mitigationadaptation synergies and increases awareness of adaptation. For comprehensive and coordinated action on climate and nature, NDCs should, when appropriate, also refer to nations' most recent National Biodiversity Strategies and Actions Plans (NBSAPs). Commitments to modify fossil fuel subsidies, such as creating national roadmaps with precise policy-specific timeframes for phase-out or reform, should also be included in NDCs. Countries should pledge to stop the spread of fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement's target of keeping global warming to 1.5C at the very least. Challenge to Establish Linkages Among Climate, Nature, Land, and Cities Three major international environmental conferences are being held this year, known as a \"triple COP\" year.</p><p>the COP16 on biodiversity in Cali, Colombia, then the COP29 on climate change in Baku, and finally, the COP16 on desertification and soil degradation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>in these three COPs, world leaders have the chance to coordinate their activities across these interrelated challenges thanks to the convergence of the conference.</p><p>to provide sustainable solutions that improve the health of the world as a whole, climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation must be addressed jointly.</p><p>iPCC is also planning to publish a special report on Cities and Climate Change under its Seventh Cyclone of Assessment (AR7).

Global Collaboration on Climate Mitigation Initiative A critical factor in promoting global collaboration on climate action through both market-based and non-market channels is Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>the initiatives started at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit bring together different sectors to build sustainable infrastructure, use nature-based solutions, reduce emissions, address critical issues like gender equality and jobs, unlock finance, and promote adaptation and climate resilience.</p><p>in addition to encouraging sustainable development, it seeks to increase the cost-effectiveness of climate mitigation initiatives by permitting nations to exchange emissions reductions.</p><p>at COP29, Article 6 is essential because it seeks to finalize global carbon market regulations, guaranteeing environmental integrity, transparency, additionality, and the avoidance of double counting.</p><p>it is also necessary for this regulation to provide support for reliable global emissions trading and economically viable climate mitigation.</p><p>the Parties must create robust governance frameworks, transparent procedures, and unambiguous safeguards for reviewing Article 6. Mechanisms under Article 6 should be created to consider the various goals and situations, including those of nations with abundant forests. We think acknowledging the needs and rights of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) and ensuring they have equitable access to the money made from Article 6 activities is a crucial part of this. Gender-inclusive Climate Action and Human Rights Climate action is more sustainable and prosperous when it incorporates human rights and gender equality.</p><p>there are chances to guarantee that social and gender disparities that increase susceptibility to climate change and restrict possibilities to engage in solutions are addressed across all COP29 negotiation items.</p><p>the Lima Work Program on Gender and its accompanying Gender Action Plan (GAP) must be renewed to achieve this. COP29 negotiators must agree upon a comprehensive and ambitious framework for gender-responsive climate action.</p><p>this framework will be the basis for an updated, higher-quality GAP and create connections with other negotiating streams.</p><p>a longer implementation timeline, specific goals and metrics, and greater delineation of roles and duties are all necessary for this new GAP.</p><p>the COP29 decision must acknowledge that gender and social inequality are context-specific, structural, and intersectional.</p><p>the Paris Agreement's success depends on a renewed dedication to gender-responsive climate action.</p><p>it will be essential to integrate human rights and gender equality into all negotiating topics using an intersectional perspective. New Collective Quantified Goals (NCQG) Building on the $100 billion target set by developed nations in 2009, the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) will establish a new financial framework and assist developing nations by filling climate finance gaps, providing them with funding to carry out climate adaptation and mitigation measures, and addressing loss and damage. Before the 2025 deadline that the Parties set for themselves in the Paris Agreement, there will be a significant emphasis on COP29 as nations attempt to finalize a more ambitious climate financing objective. Guidelines for inclusive and equitable climate finance that balances the demands of adaptation and mitigation should be discussed at COP29. Subgoals for loss and damage, adaptation, and mitigation should be included in the NCQG, and the final decision should have strong human rights and gender standards.</p><p>to mobilize private capital, the framework should incorporate novel financial structures, domestic governmental support measures, and international funding.</p><p>to achieve net zero and improve climate resilience in poor nations, it should tackle the urgent need to redirect money flows away from fossil fuels and toward boosting private investments.

International climate finance</p><p>What it is:</p><p>The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance will replace the previous goal, agreed upon in 2009, where developed nations committed to channelling US$100 billion (S$132 billion) per year by 2020 to meet the needs and priorities of developing countries.</p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) assessed that the US$100 billion goal was fulfilled only in 2022, two years after the deadline.</p><p>The UN evaluated that currently developing countries need around US$500 billion of climate finance annually. Estimates from other groups such as the World Resources Institute and African environment ministers go up to more than US$1 trillion a year.</p><p>With such a coffer on the table, the amount or quantum of the NCQG will be the key political question. Who the donor countries are and the ratio of public funding versus other sources of finance like investments, loans and private finance will also be on the negotiating table.</p><p>Another consideration is whether the NCQG will also include a sub-category for loss and damage. This refers to funds given to help compensate countries suffering from the impacts of climate change.</p><p>Discussions on loss and damage often take place under a separate negotiating track, and a major breakthrough at COP28 was the establishment of the loss and damage fund, which is currently at about US$790 million.</p><p>But at COP29, it is likely that discussions on loss and damage will spill into the NCQG track.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><p>Developing and least developed countries, including Small Island Developing States, disproportionately face the brunt of climate change impacts, especially with rising seas, storms and drought.</p><p>These Global South countries also have limited financial resources to switch from fossil fuels to renewables to decarbonise.</p><p>The bulk of global greenhouse gas emissions had come from developed countries that industrialised earlier. Therefore, the basis of the Paris Agreement related to the NCQG states that developed countries shall provide financial resources to assist developing countries with mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>Non-profits and advocates have said climate finance must not exacerbate developing countries' existing debt burden.</p><p>According to non-governmental organisation Christian Aid, a major lesson from the previous US$100 billion goal is that climate finance had deepened levels of indebtedness in developing countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, 81 per cent of public climate finance for the region was in the form of loans.</p><p>Singapore has estimated that an annual funding gap of at least US$300 billion is needed for climate finance in Asia.</p><p>Classified as a developing country despite its high gross domestic product per capita, Singapore's position on the NCQG is to contribute voluntarily while helping to unlock finance through innovative ways.</p><p>2. Carbon markets</p><p>What it is:</p><p>Carbon markets are governed under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which has been deeply contentious at COPs.</p><p>At COP28 in Dubai, Article 6 negotiations fell through due to deep divisions on several topics, which are expected to be hammered out at the upcoming summit.</p><p>Article 6.2 issues guidelines on the bilateral trade of carbon credits between countries. Article 6.4 creates a global carbon market overseen by a UN entity.</p><p>Under Article 6.2, some countries have argued for the right to revoke carbon credits once they have been issued, especially if carbon projects violate indigenous people's land rights. Others are concerned this would lead to the double counting of carbon offsets \u2014 if carbon project-hosting countries were to revoke the carbon credits they sold and count them towards their own carbon reduction goals. Leeway to revoke credits can also affect investors' confidence in a project.</p><p>Another issue to be tackled under 6.2 is the nature of international and national registries to document and track carbon trading between countries.</p><p>Some countries like the US and Singapore, which have a thriving private sector of registry service providers, want to limit the international and national registries to pure accounting functions.</p><p>Most countries do not like to depend on private entities and thus want the international and national registries to undertake credit transactions.</p><p>As for Article 6.4, various countries had concerns about the wording of the draft text related to the global carbon market. One issue was with the definition of carbon dioxide removals.</p><p>But some progress has been made. In early October, the 6.4 oversight body finalised key standards related to project methodologies and greenhouse gas removals.</p><p>COP29 needs to endorse those standards; only then can the global carbon market mechanism kick in in 2025.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><p>Countries with limited natural resources to decarbonise, like Singapore, need to tap carbon credits to meet their national climate targets. Singapore is collaborating with more than 20 countries on carbon credits, including South-east Asian nations such as Laos, the Philippines and Vietnam.</p><p>Carbon markets help to channel funds to nature-based and underfunded forest conservation projects that would not otherwise have been implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives.</p><p>Carbon projects can further the sustainable development of host countries, benefit local communities in terms of job creation and access to clean resources, and improve their energy security. This allows capital to flow to developing and least developed countries.</p><p>Having a global carbon market and harmonised standards to refer to could make it easier to shape carbon trading pacts. This would reduce confusion and uncertainties with existing carbon market regulations.</p><p>3. Mitigation</p><p>What it is:</p><p>Mitigation refers to one of two key prongs of climate action, such as bringing down the amount of planet-warming emissions. The other is adaptation.</p><p>Mitigation efforts include closing down coal plants, increasing renewable energy deployment or using carbon capture technologies.</p><p>At COP28 in 2023, countries agreed on a few global mitigation goals, including to triple renewable energy capacity and to double energy-efficiency improvements by 2030.</p><p>The UN has also urged countries to submit new, more ambitious, climate targets by early 2025.</p><p>As US-based think-tank World Resources Institute noted: \"The UN summit in Baku is the last major opportunity to set clear expectations for what this next generation of (national climate targets) should aspire to.\"</p><p>On Oct 24, the UN's latest emissions gap report noted that if countries do not increase the ambition of their upcoming climate targets and start delivering on them immediately, the world is on course for a temperature increase of 2.6 deg C to 3.1 deg C above pre-industrial levels over the course of this century.</p><p>Climate scientists have said that warming must be limited to 1.5 deg C to avoid catastrophic climate change, which is already ravaging the planet.</p><p>At COP29, certain groups of countries, especially those vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, will likely urge nations, especially developed ones, to set more ambitious climate change targets.</p><p>Developed countries, on the other hand, are expected to argue that all nations, and not just them, should make more ambitious climate pledges.</p><p>As a result, it is likely this negotiation track would be closely interwoven with discussions on climate finance, since many developing countries have climate targets that are conditional on them receiving support to achieve them.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><p>No country is exempt from the impacts of climate change, and regions such as South-east Asia, where there are millions living in off-grid and coastal areas, could suffer disproportionately from the impacts of typhoons, coastal flooding and other climate issues.</p><p>If countries set more ambitious climate targets and deliver on them, it could help protect many communities from harsher climate impacts.</p><p>South-east Asia could also reap other benefits by ramping up renewable energy deployment, with the Asean power grid having the potential to enable sharing of renewable energy. Asean has a plan to increase renewable energy's share in the region's total primary energy supply to 23 per cent by 2025, up from the 15.6 per cent in 2022.</p><p>A US-Singapore feasibility study on energy connectivity in South-east Asia had assessed that building the Asean power grid will not only provide more green electricity, but also create new jobs, reduce air pollution from coal-fired power plants, and pump in significant investments for the energy sector.</p><p>These would include investments of US$2 billion annually for research and development, and US$1.4 trillion cumulatively to build electricity generation capacity.</p><p>The region's manufacturing sector would also receive a boost, with greater demand for solar panels, batteries and cables.</p><p>4. Adaptation</p><p>What it is:</p><p>Adaptation, the other key prong of climate action, refers to actions that reduce the impact of climate change on communities.</p><p>These include early warning systems, which enable people to better prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, or building sea walls to keep out sea-level rise.</p><p>While the Paris Agreement is most known for its temperature target \u2014 which is to limit global temperature increase to preferably 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels \u2014 the agreement also has another target: establish a \"global goal on adaptation\".</p><p>This goal aims to strengthen resilience to climate change and, at COP28, a set of adaptation targets was agreed upon for countries to achieve by 2030.</p><p>It includes strengthening resilience to water-related climate hazards, achieving climate-resilient food production, reducing climate impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, and accelerating the use of ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions.</p><p>At COP28, countries were also urged to have their adaptation plans in place by 2030. \"Experts say these ambitious targets will help direct support and finance to where it is most needed, accelerating action,\" said the UN Environment Programme on its website.</p><p>But outstanding issues on adaptation currently centre on tracking progress \u2014 in terms of achieving targets and how they are funded.</p><p>What counts as adaptation finance is also not clearly defined, and estimates can differ based on organisations. Under the bucket of climate finance, most funds have flown to mitigation.</p><p>Estimates by the OECD show that 60 per cent of the climate finance from developed countries in 2022 went to mitigation. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), however, estimated that only 7 per cent of total climate finance over the years has gone to adaptation.</p><p>At COP29, discussions on the global goal on adaptation are likely to be closely intertwined with discussions on the new climate finance target. The indicators of the global goal will be discussed at COP29 and will be adopted at COP30.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><p>South-east Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, with an estimated 77 per cent of the region's total population of 2.62 billion living in coastal areas.</p><p>This makes them susceptible to climate change impacts such as coastal flooding from rising sea levels and typhoons that are expected to strengthen as the world warms.</p><p>The IPCC has warned that heatwaves are expected to become more frequent, intense and longer-lasting as global temperatures rise. Tropical regions, in particular, are expected to see heatwaves becoming more frequent as baseline temperatures are already high.</p><p>In April, the Thai authorities said at least 30 people died from heatstroke in the first few months of 2024.</p><p>But taking steps to soften the impact of these events can be costly. Singapore, for example, has estimated the cost of protecting its coastlines from sea-level rise to be more than $100 billion over 100 years.</p><p>In 2023, the UN estimated the costs of adaptation in developing countries to be in the range of US$215 billion per year this decade.</p><p>\"As a result of the growing adaptation finance needs and faltering flows, the current adaptation finance gap is now estimated at US$194 billion to US$366 billion per year,\" noted the UN in its 2023 Adaptation Gap report.</p><p>\"At the same time, adaptation planning and implementation appear to be plateauing. This failure to adapt has massive implications for loss and damage, particularly for the most vulnerable.\"</p><p>5. Nature and climate</p><p>What it is:</p><p>COP29 is bookended by two other UN conferences with major themes on nature. It is likely the role of nature in tackling climate change will be pronounced and interwoven with other issues such as mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>The UN's biodiversity conference, COP16, concluded in Cali, Colombia, on Nov 1, while the global body's ocean conference will take place in Nice, France, in June 2025.</p><p>The back-to-back events will underscore how the twin planetary crises \u2014 of nature loss and climate change \u2014 are intertwined.</p><p>For example, natural habitats such as forests and seagrasses can, through photosynthesis, take in and lock away planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Protecting these key sinks will be important in the climate battle.</p><p>Nature can also play a role in protecting communities from the harshest impacts of climate change. Mangroves, for one, are a nature-based solution to rising sea levels since these ecosystems can keep pace with sea-level rise.</p><p>Global environmental organisation The Nature Conservancy said it expects nature to take centre-stage at the conference, with more discussions on how nature can help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change impacts.</p><p>Why it matters:</p><p>South-east Asia is a hot spot for biodiversity on land and in the oceans.</p><p>Past studies have shown how the region is home to nearly 15 per cent of the world's tropical forests by area, and has high levels of species endemism, referring to species found only in the region and nowhere else.</p><p>Take, for example, the orang utan, which is found only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Various plant species are also unique to this region, such as the orchid Nervilia singaporensis \u2014 found only in Singapore.</p><p>But this tapestry of life is increasingly under threat from deforestation and other developments.</p><p>The discussions at COP29, such as those on international finance flows and carbon markets, could provide governments in the region with the resources needed to keep these habitats standing.</p><p>___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.asianewsnet.net/home\">www.asianewsnet.net/home</url>/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>", "publisher": "The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network", "instances": ["AdaptationWhat it is:Adaptation, the other key prong of climate action, refers to actions that reduce the impact of climate change on communities.

Loss and damage are closely related to climate justice and equity because the world's most vulnerable countries are often the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases.</p><p>This raises the question of who exactly should pay for the compensation of climate loss and damages. Mitigation Mitigation refers to human intervention in climate chal-lenges, to reduce, limit, or prevent greenhouse gases, or to enhance carbon sinks that are removed from the atmosphere, move forward a low-carbon and resilient future, through cost-effective solutions from energy systems, industry, buildings, transport and agriculture, forest, and other land use (AFOLU) sectors to help close the emissions gap the emitting gases trap heat from the sun on our planet, making it warmer the actions/interventions include formulating and implementing programs containing measures to minimize the intensity of climate hazards (e.g. policy, new technology, preparedness, incentives, behavioral changes, etc.) adaptation The process of adjusting to the effects of climate change, building more resilience to climate, moderating, minimizing, or avoiding harm to people, through 4 actions: infrastructure, institutional, behavioral, and nature-based options.</p><p>The UN organs and other donor agencies are promoting a wide range of nature-based solutions: i.e. development of national adaptation plans, early warnings, climate-resilient livelihood, preparedness, training, and much more the UNEP underscores the importance of minimizing loss and damage through scaled-up, expedient, and accelerated climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Finally at COP27 in 2022 countries agreed to establish a Loss and Damage Fund, which would provide financial assistance to climate-vulnerable countries the fund was officially operationalized at COP28 in November 2023 in Dubai, UAE technical Assistance and Fund Committee Initially, UNEP extends its expertise to the Transitional Committee on Loss and Damage, providing technical assistance to help member states make progress on addressing loss and damage, to support the creation of new loss and damage funding arrangements, and to identify possible financing solutions like carbon pricing, taxes levies, and 'cap-andtrade' systems the Fund Committee comprises 24 members from Parties to the Convention and Paris Agreement, with 10 members from developed countries and 14 members from developing countries. (The 14 members from developing countries will be nominated in line with the geographical representation: 3 members from Africa, including a representative of the COP27 President; 3 members from Asia and the Pacific, including a representative of the COP28 President; 3 members from Latin America and the Caribbean; 2 members from small island developing States; 2 members from the least developed countries; 1 member from a developing country). First Step of Loss and Damage Fund Talks to set up a fund to pay for climate losses and damages were pushed online after extreme weather wreaked havoc across different parts of the world, the first fund committee held from 30 April to 2 May in Abu Dhabi with positive decisions, mainly dealt with procedural matters, assistance to disaster-affected communities to access the fund directly, and on the establishment of a secretariat to run the fund, including the naming of the fund although loss anddamage have long been a controversial topic amongst the high emission contributors, and polluting countries, it requires huge amounts of money to compensate, to repair climate damages, but who will take the responsibility for polluting the atmosphere? Following the COP28 agreement, the fund's board was assembled to decide the institution's policies; its decisions will be approved by governments at COP29 this November, with choosing an Executive Director. Due to delays and the big task of launching a new institution, the fund is not expected to start disbursing money until 2025 also to resolve the issue, the World Bank to host the fund's secretariat temporarily for 4 years, and later for a permanent secretariat the committee makes decisions, including around funding and eligibility aspects. Process and Mechanism of Fund Management The UNFCCC process has included a discussion about Loss and Damage at COP13 and subsequent decisions taken to address unavoidable impacts.</p><p>The UNFCCC process has established three bodies: e.g. (i) the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) as a policy body, (ii) the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage (SNLD) as a technical support body, and (iii) Loss and Damage funding arrangements. (a) Management of the Fund: The WIM promotes comprehensive risk management approaches and strengthens finance, technology, and capacitybuilding support for affected countries through its three pillars: (1) enhancing knowledge; (2) strengthening dialogue; and (3) enhancing action and support for developing countries the SNLD focuses on enhancing action and support for addressing loss and damage at local, national, and regional levels through its network providing technical assistance. (b) Pledges to Fund: The fund is designed to assist developing countries, the Green Climate Fund, the World Bank, and climate-vulnerable countries in December at COP 28, countries pledged almost US$ 700 million to the Loss and Damage Fund. (c) Objectives of the Fund access: Loss and Damage Fund should be more accessible, with allocations equitably shared to all and accessible at all levels; approach: The Loss and Damage Fund should be in a grant format, reaching the most vulnerable communities, through a direct access modality with a human-rights-based approach in operationalizing the Fund it should adopt a fair, transparent, inclusive, and equitable financing system; . Groups: Most vulnerable communities, the Pacific Small Island Developing States, and Indigenous peoples' groups specifically for Non-Economic Loss and Damages should directly benefit from the Fund; and . Purpose: The Fund should provide funding for human mobility and be available at the local level to implement grassroots actions. (d) Perceived Problems and Challenges . Fund Use: Consideration of the trade-offs between short-term assistance for immediate impacts and long-term investments in resilience building and potential diversion of funds from disaster-risk reduction efforts; .</p><p>Sustainability: Perceived inadequacy of international support for the Fund and mobilizing sufficient resources to support the Fund; . Fund Mechanism: Negotiating the Fund's operational mechanism to include access modality, funding structure and safeguards, defining scope, parameter, rapid response, balancing due diligence with urgency, and ensuring inclusiveness of the Fund through the participation of affected communities (women, men, children, youth and Indigenous peoples) in decision-making process; . Loss and Damage Metrics: Lack of metrics to quantify non-economic loss and damage; and . Capacity Building: Perceived inadequate capacity of countries to navigate, access, and implement projects from the Loss and Damage Fund. Criticism of Fund Pledges The pledges to fund are still inadequate for what is needed, which was only around US$ 700 million, a big gap to the targeted fund it is estimated that loss and damages in the developing/poorest countries are already greater than US$ 400 billion a year, less than 1% of what is needed to support the climate harms immediately after the fund became operational in COP28, countries including France, Germany, Italy, and UAE, together pledged more than US$ 400 million to the fund, while a big criticism was raised to very small contributors, e.g.</p><p>USA (17.50), Canada (11.60), Japan (10.00), Netherlands (16.30), Norway (25.00), Denmark (25.50), and European Commission (27.10) also, questions raised are 'When and how the contribution from highly polluting countries will pay out and sustain over the long term' the first fund board meeting was concluded with weak decisions and raised questions: 'How to finance adaptation efforts', and 'Who will pay the hundreds of billions of dollars for adaptation and unavoidable climate impacts', which needed to be addressed properly, fostering international cooperation assessment Methods of Loss and Damage Climate-induced loss and damages can be brought by extreme climate events, where women and marginalized community members (e.g.</p><p>Elderly or disabled persons, poor and minority groups) suffer first, and severely, due to a combination of gendered roles, lack of access to information, skills, services and resources that can strengthen resilience. Vulnerable communities are affected in many ways, e.g. displacement of homes, people's physical safety, their agriculture, fishing, food security, livelihood, education, health, cultural activities, access to fresh water, and logistic barriers these are leading to population migration - a major consequence of climate impacts the assessment 'methods', or 'tools' can enable the local community to work together to prepare maps, resources, infrastructures, livelihoods, hazards, season changes, and changing trends of climate impacts to build up a picture of the historical climate change.</p><p>Seven Steps for Loss and Damage Assessment . 'Mapping of Risks and Resources': to highlight the geophysical changes taking place in the village/area; . 'Seasonal, Agricultural and Livelihood Calendars': to highlight how climate change is affecting seasonal weather patterns, the impacts on farming, fishing, and livelihoods, and how these impacts affect women, men, and marginalized community members differently; . 'Hazard Risk Index': to identify which family homes and community infrastructures are most vulnerable to disasters, (i.e. floods, cyclones, or landslides); . 'Trend Analysis': for a collective and a key process for enabling insights and understanding about climate impacts, including gendered impacts; (5) 'Key Informant Interviews': find out community information by experts/officials on climate change. Community maps and calendars are shared with the experts; . 'Calculating and Reporting Loss and Damage': used for the qualitative understanding of communities, to develop a quantitative assessment for reporting purposes.</p><p>Simple household and community-level questionnaires are used to identify the monetary value of loss and damages, and information on migration or displacement the findings are organized in a table (with costs), in a new map of risks, and resources for reducing risks and strengthening resilience; and . 'Advocacy and Lobbying': for the community to take the information and evidence to relevant duty officers, to local/national/international governments/agencies. Conclusions The Loss and Damage Fund is a new funding mechanism for the climate victims, key considerations in designing the Fund's operational modalities and guidelines, sustainability and flexibility, and capacity building are to be required to run the fund process.</p><p>Also, fair consideration is needed in decision-making processes for balancing urgency, highlighting direct access for national governments, and vulnerable countries, and a rapid disbursement mechanism. Current commitment by the countries is voluntary, therefore, it would require a long-term strategy to ensure for establishment of a predictable and sustainable fund to meet the significant needs of the victim countries.</p><p>A long-term fund-raising strategy is essentially needed to ensure sufficient funding resources.</p><p>The Loss and Damage Fund should include a capacity-building component to strengthen the capacities of countries to access the fund, and also to ensure fund flexibility to address diverse needs and situations for the affected communities.

Flooding can be caused by heavy rain or manmade changes to water bodies and water flows. To control the impact of flooding, countries around the world have taken diverse structural and non-structural types of initiatives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reasons Behind Flooding: Why Water Overflows</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Flash floods can be triggered by natural phenomena, such as heavy rainfall, severe wind flows above water, tsunamis, cyclones, high tides, etc.</p><p>Now, what happens when huge amounts of water rush down? A portion of this water is retained in water bodies (rivers, lakes, canals, ponds, etc), vegetation, and soil surface while some water gets evaporated, and the rest of water passes through surface runoff. Floods occur when water bodies, soil, and vegetation cannot absorb the excess water.</p><p>Human activities can influence the creation of excess water or prevent the natural ways of water absorption, retention or run-off. For example, deforestation, inadequate green spaces, failures/breakage/willful opening of dams or barrages, insufficient water reservoirs, impervious or paved surfaces, blocked drainage systems, clogged water bodies, etc can lead to inundation.</p><p>Structural Methods to Control Inundation</p><p>Structural flood control methods include man-made physical solutions, such as the construction of dams or barrages, water reservoirs, river dredging, planting vegetation, etc. Besides, well-functioning drainage systems, channels to divert flood water, levees (dikes), etc are man-made structures to fight floods.</p><p>Barrages or Dams</p><p>Dams or Barrages are designed to control the flow of water completely or partially. In the case of large barrages, associated reservoirs are built to create a space to hold the floodwater.</p><p>Dams are also used to generate hydroelectric power and water conservation. Construction and designs of barrages and the associated reservoirs depend upon standards set out by the respective governments. Usually, dams and reservoirs are built considering the watershed's design flow rates, meteorological data, topographic features, streamflow, soil data, etc.</p><p>However, dry dams serve for flood control only without any conservation storage.</p><p>Diversion tunnels or canals</p><p>Flood control tunnels or channels refer to empty large basins where the surface water can flow through. The water will be retained only during flooding periods.</p><p>These types of structures also include dry tunnels or channels that are built underground and run below the street levels of cities. When a flash flood occurs the excess surface water is drained out through these underground structures into a sea, river or other water bodies.</p><p>In many cases, underground flood tunnels or channels are built on the ancient natural waterways to reduce flooding.</p><p>Floodplains and groundwater replenishment</p><p>Groundwater replenishment is a great way to utilise the excess surface water. In this method, the flood is diverted onto land so that the soil can absorb excess water. The recharging of groundwater tables not only prevents flooding but also serves as a natural reservoir. People can extract the underground water through pumps during dry seasons or droughts.</p><p>River defences</p><p>Rivers can cut down the risk of inundation by holding the water. Regular dredging is essential to preserve the navigability of the rivers during flooding. Structures such as reservoirs, levees, bunds, weirs, etc can be built to prevent rivers from overflowing their banks.</p><p>Flood barrier</p><p>A flood barrier is also known as a surge barrier or storm surge barrier. This structure refers to a specific type of floodgate, designed to prevent inundation in the protected area behind the barrier. Flood barriers can also be built around individual buildings to prevent floodwaters from entering the buildings.</p><p>Non-structural Ways to Prevent Flooding  and  Minimise Losses</p><p>Non-structural flood control methods include flood risk management strategies, land-use planning, zoning, flood proofing, flood forecasting, advanced flood warning systems, flood insurance, evacuation of flood victims, rebuilding plans, etc.</p><p>Flood mapping</p><p>Governments and policymakers utilise flood mapping as a tool to delineate the areas of potential flooding events, assisting planned decisions to prevent extreme flooding occurrences. Flood maps help create documentation for experts and policymakers to make informed decisions about flood hazards. It also generates conceptual models with information for public and private sectors about flooding hazards.</p><p>Flood modelling</p><p>Flood modelling is another tool that is used to anticipate the severity of flood hazards and their effects on humans and structures. Flood modelling is conducted by combining diverse factors such as terrain, hydrology, urban topography, etc. This technology utilises geomorphic methods, remote sensing, hydraulic models, conceptual models, etc.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement</p><p>Integrating stakeholder engagement into flood management provides a more complex analysis of the situation and allows enhanced public engagement in policy discussions. This creates paths for collective solutions through greater cohesion and consensus.</p><p>Flood risk assessment (FRM)</p><p>Flood risk assessment can help to reduce the human casualties, and socio-economic losses caused by flooding. FRM is used to reduce flood risk and manage risks to lives and properties due to flooding.</p><p>Examples by country</p><p>Canada</p><p>To protect Manitoba from future floods, the authorities constructed a massive system of diversions, dikes, and floodways including the Red River Floodway and the Portage Diversion.</p><p>United States</p><p>The USA took multiple flood barrier projects to protect the transit assets in Manhattan. In one case, they sealed subway entrances using a deployable fabric cover system called Flex-Gate that protects the subway entrances against 14 feet of water.</p><p>The USA revised their extreme storm flood protection based on new Federal Emergency Management Agency guidelines for 100y and 500y design flood elevations.</p><p>After the 1993 flood across the Midwest, the federal government bought flood-prone lands as a part of their flood prevention plans. Several communities agreed and the government converted their lands into wetlands. These wetlands served as a sponge when storms and floods occurred.</p><p>Japan</p><p>Tokyo built a 6.3 km long, 50-metre-deep concrete tunnel system called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC). This tunnel diverts flood water from small to midsize rivers to the Edogawa River.</p><p>Egypt</p><p>Egypt built the Aswan Low Dam (1902) and the Aswan High Dam (1976) to control flooding along the Nile River.</p><p>France</p><p>France built a series of reservoirs to remove pressure from the Seine River during flooding.</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>London built a huge mechanical flood barrier across the river Thames in 1982. This Thames Barrier is raised when the water level reaches a certain point.</p><p>Russia</p><p>Russia built the Saint Petersburg Dam in 2008 to protect the city from storm surges. It is extended for about 25.4 kilometres (15.8 miles) and stands about 8 metres (26 ft) above the sea water level.</p><p>The Netherlands</p><p>Through the construction of dykes, the Netherlands owns one of the best flood control systems in the world. Their Delta Works project includes the movable storm surge barrier Oosterscheldekering.</p><p>They have also managed floods with the latest techniques, such as storing water underground, and building reservoirs utilising large parking garages, playgrounds, etc.</p><p>Rotterdam City constructed a floating housing development across 120 acres to deal with rising sea levels.

We are #Generation Restoration\". The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is hosting the event, reflecting a global commitment to address our current pressing environmental challenges. On Bangladesh's end, collective efforts from local government and international organisations are continuing to propel us forward towards achieving this year's WED agenda and sustainable development goals (SDG) alike.</p><p>Our national strategies designed to deal with the growing consequences of climate change are inclusive of adaptation, mitigation and resilience, showing the government's commitment to development despite the foreseeable sustainable losses. Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 encourages nature-based solutions for flooding, agriculture, and renewable energy development, emphasising the role of innovative technology particularly in the form of environmental tech startups, in reducing climate change and natural hazard vulnerability at the national level. The 8th Five Year Plan (8FYP) commits to a green growth strategy but currently defines it narrowly. It outlines specific strategies, policies, and institutional reforms within the environmental sector, specifically the forest sub-sector, to integrate environmental costs into the macroeconomic framework. However, it does not fully integrate environmental and climate change considerations into its overall growth strategy. Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan is another plan that aims to promote a climate-resilient, low-carbon, and resource-efficient economy that creates jobs quickly.</p><p>In addition to national plans, if we zero in on Bangladesh's local initiatives, several issues come to mind. For example, LoGIC which stands for Local Government Initiative on Climate Change supports the capacity building of vulnerable communities, local government institutions, and civil society organisations in planning and financing climate change adaptation solutions in climate-vulnerable areas. Bangladesh has also implemented such local initiatives to address land degradation, desertification, and enhance drought resilience, demonstrating significant progress through concrete actions and rather notable statistical outcomes simultaneously aligning with the WED 2024 theme. Government in the past years set an ambitious target to increase its forest cover to 20% of the total land area by the year 2030, and it currently stands at approximately 17.62% forest cover. The credit for this can be given to large-scale tree-planting programmes like Community-Based Adaptation to Climate Change through Coastal Afforestation (CBACC-CF). In the past ten years, over 200 million young trees had been planted, with approx. 30 million planted in just 2022 post-pandemic. More than 50,000 hectares in the Sundarbans had been regenerated by planting mangroves since 2000 with the help of CBACC-CF. Moreover, thanks to funding from the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF), community-led restoring initiatives have shown results in the establishment of 10,000 hectares of mangroves in our coastal regions, showcasing the important contribution of our local communities to conservation endeavours even more.</p><p>Addressing extended periods of drought in northern and northwestern regions like Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions, local efforts have also implemented soil conservation strategies on more than 100,000 hectares of land. The methods applied directly to help prevent soil erosion in layman's terms are contour ploughing, terracing, and setting up windbreaks. Approx. 25,000 hectares of degraded land have been enhanced through incorporating trees and crops in agroforestry systems, leading to improved erosion control and soil fertility for the long term. The SLM project has carried out pilot initiatives on 15,000 hectares to demonstrate sustainable farming methods and soil conservation techniques. Over 50,000 farmers have received training on sustainable land management practices, improving their capacity to handle land resources as a result of this project effectively.</p><p>One of the main goals that also align with SDG is to improve our ability to withstand drought. 70% of cultivable areas in regions prone to drought are experiencing an increase from 55% recorded in 2010. According to the World Bank, over 20,000 solar-powered irrigation pumps were implemented to enhance water availability for farming in secluded and drought-prone regions. The Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) Project gave rise to the emphasis on water harvesting and storage projects to reduce the side effects of droughts. More than 50,000 rainwater collection systems have been set up in regions vulnerable to droughts, offering a dependable water supply for households and farms. To add to that, over 200 small and medium-sized reservoirs have been built to store rainwater and surface runoff, aiding in irrigation and livestock requirements during times of drought till date. The enhancement of early warning systems includes expanding the meteorological station count to more than 200, enhancing the country's ability to monitor and forecast drought conditions. Community-driven early alert systems now protect more than 500,000 households in regions vulnerable to drought, improving readiness and reaction to droughts. Teaming up with private companies such as Chaldal to support SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) among farmers and others, environmental tech startups like Intelligent Machines have utilised AI to offer solutions like maximising water usage and minimising waste, helping achieve SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) for effective resource management. Local startups and government initiatives in Bangladesh are teaming up to tackle environmental challenges together. Such startups are introducing innovative solutions to promote sustainability and conservation, helping Bangladesh meet global environmental goals. Via technology, addressing issues like renewable energy and waste management, positions Bangladesh as a proactive player in global sustainability efforts. In fact in 2024, Startup Bangladesh Limited invested Tk 150 million (15 crore) in seven startups, including environmental tech companies, to enhance their innovation capabilities and market reach like BD Recycle Technologies.</p><p>Government-led agricultural research organisations have also created and distributed over 20 drought-tolerant strains of crops like rice, wheat, and maize, which are currently being grown on 1.5 million hectares of land. These enhanced strains have demonstrated a 15-20% growth in productivity when compared to conventional strains in dry weather.</p><p>The aforementioned local initiatives demonstrate Bangladesh's longstanding commitment to addressing environmental challenges and delivering solutions through practical and impactful actions, leaving an indelible mark on ties with local communities that compound to national resilience overtime. This unity, in conjunction with innovative technology is the main ingredient of success for these initiatives, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient environment. The collaborative support received from funding, policy initiatives, and infrastructure development is of utmost priority in maintaining the said momentum. Future plans that engage both on a local and international scale include even more investments in sustainable technologies, encouraging FDI, and expanding support for early-stage startups to ensure long-term growth and environmental sustainability. This holistic approach, integrating technology and sustainability, will be the beacon of hope.</p><p>The author is an intern at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bangladesh, and a policy associate of the environmental and climate change team at the Youth Policy Forum.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Land suitable for agriculture is limited and cannot be easily created or replaced. Once converted to other use, restoring agricultural and forest land to a productive former state is difficult. Therefore, managing the landscape more sustainably is urgently needed to meet the food and shelter needs of a growing population and sustain diverse ecosystem services.</p><p>The widespread alteration in land cover in the CHT region has led to the loss of native vegetation, which is disrupting the hydrological cycle, particularly infiltration and recharge of spring aquifers. Intensive agriculture and changes in forest cover are also leading to soil erosion and sedimentation in springshed areas and rivers downstream.

Such landscape degradation is impacting the livelihoods and wellbeing of hill communities that depend on the region's natural resources.</p><p>In response to the above challenges, the Bangladesh government has undertaken various development schemes to improve living conditions and reduce vulnerability.

Despite his respect for democracy, he lamented its shortcomings, particularly the lack of education and rationality among voters. Believing voting to be an art requiring enlightenment, he tirelessly advocated for education as the cornerstone of democratic participation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Socrates' view remains as relevant in the upcoming elections in Pakistan. Voting is an art, and citizens should prioritise political parties that in turn prioritise climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Democratic setups move on public sentiment, and the best time to galvanise public support is around the time of the elections. Unfortunately, climate change remains a relatively low priority for the average voter in most places across the globe \u2014 seemingly less pressing than immediate economic concerns.</p><p>Pakistan's many crises</p><p>There are several reasons \u2014 not least the floods and recurring environmental disasters that have struck the country in recent years \u2014 why climate action should be central to the election mandates of Pakistan's political parties. In recent weeks, various mainstream parties have unveiled their manifestos, stressing upon economic revitalisation, human development, and structural reforms. Where these manifestos lack is a robust focus on climate action, despite pledges for a greener Pakistan.</p><p>For example, the PML-N, in its manifesto, lists various measures under the section, 'Building a Climate Resilient Pakistan', while the PPP has committed to a 'Green New Deal: Climate Resilient Futures'. But where these proposals prioritise areas such as loss and damage funds, post-disaster planning, and establishing effective early warning systems, there is a significant lack of attention given to climate-displaced individuals, particularly indigenous communities, who often find themselves marginalised and unsupported in these circumstances.</p><p>Moreover, even as these political parties have promised to align with UN protocols on climate change policies, there has been insufficient attention given to the challenges faced by communities living in climate hotspots.</p><p>Climate change isn't just about policy-making \u2014 it interacts with problems like hunger, poverty, and disease. These broader implications should be at the forefront of political promises, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the climate crisis and its profound impact on communities.</p><p>Mass displacement</p><p>In the northern mountainous regions, glacial floods pose a significant threat, while in the south, rising sea levels are compelling people to flee, inevitably becoming internally displaced persons (IDPs). Conservative estimates suggest that over 1.2 million individuals have already been displaced from their homes, and approximately 4.2 million acres of land has been submerged due to the rise in sea levels. Pakistan's climate hotspots, where many poor and vulnerable communities reside, are witnessing a burgeoning climate refugee crisis as climate-induced disasters render life uninhabitable in these areas.</p><p>For example, the looming threat of rising sea levels along the coastal belt, notably in Keti Bunder, poses a significant risk of displacement and agricultural disruption. Small towns and villages have disappeared while many, such as Keti Bundar, are on the retreat.</p><p>In Bangladesh, an estimated 1,000-2,000 climate-displaced individuals are migrating to urban slums in Dhaka, the country's most densely populated city, every day. While accurate data is lacking, similar patterns are likely occurring in Pakistan, where climate-displaced people from vulnerable regions are seeking refuge in urban slums, particularly in cities like Karachi.</p><p>The looming threat of glacial outbursts in the Himalayas poses another significant risk of displacement and exacerbates the economic strain in Pakistan. With more than 36 per cent of glaciers expected to shrink, the potential for mass displacement looms large.</p><p>In other parts of the country, chronic heatwaves and extreme droughts frequently disrupt agricultural activities, resulting in substantial financial losses. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan is currently the fifth most climate-vulnerable country in the world, having lost nearly 10,000 lives and suffering economic losses worth $3.8 billion due to climate change between 1999 and 2018.</p><p>What is most concerning is that communities in Pakistan most impacted by climate shocks often reside in areas with limited investment and resources, leading to their disenfranchisement from the electoral process. Without prioritising the inclusion of these communities and ensuring their active participation in the democratic system, the prospect of free and fair elections remains elusive.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>To combat these challenges, Pakistan is poised to establish a robust conditional target aimed at reducing its projected emissions by 50pc by 2030. This ambitious goal entails a 15pc reduction funded by domestic resources and a 35pc reduction contingent upon international grants. To achieve this target, Pakistan intends to transition to 60pc renewable energy and implement 30pc electric vehicle usage by 2030. Additionally, the country plans to prohibit coal imports and expand nature-based solutions.</p><p>But merely drafting policies is insufficient; it is imperative to empower local authorities, especially where indigenous communities have the autonomy to shape and contribute their insights to policies that prioritise their needs. Elevating indigenous voices to positions of power within their regions ensures not only a smoother democratic process and inclusivity but also fosters more effective public policies tailored to their communities. For decades, marginalised areas in Pakistan have been overlooked, leaving indigenous peoples to fend for themselves.</p><p>While no single solution exists, almost all experts agree that there is a pressing need for systemic change to align the policy timeline in democracies with the urgency of the climate crisis.

Despite this, nations like Australia and the United Kingdom are already extending their carbon markets to nature, while the European Commission is planning for biodiversity credits and water pollution trading. COP is a hoax and has become more and more corrupted over the years. The reality is - and everyone knows it - the only way forward is an end to fossil fuels, an end to corporate capture of politics and a far-reaching conversion of industry away from any fossil fuels. Some countries are already taking this path and creating alternatives by promoting the campaign for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty."]}, {"relevance_score": 20, "title": "ADB plans $14b to ease food crisis in Asia, the pacific", "published": "2022-09-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dhaka, Sept. 28 -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday announced plans to provide at least $14 billion over 2022-2025 in a comprehensive program of support to ease a worsening food crisis in Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>The fund will also be used to improve long-term food security by strengthening food systems against the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss, said a press release.</p><p>The assistance expands ADB's already significant support for food security in the region, where nearly 1.1 billion people lack healthy diets due to poverty and food prices which have soared to record highs this year.</p><p>The funding will be channeled through existing and new projects in sectors including farm inputs, food production and distribution, social protection, irrigation, and water resources management, as well as projects leveraging nature-based solutions.</p><p>ADB will continue to invest in other activities which contribute to food security such as energy transition, transport, access to rural finance, environmental management, health, and education.</p><p>\"This is a timely and urgently needed response to a crisis that is leaving too many poor families in Asia hungry and in deeper poverty,\" said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa, in remarks at ADB's 55th Annual Meeting.</p><p>\"We need to act now, before the impacts of climate change worsen and further erode the region's hard-won development gains.

Situated at the triangular head of the Bay of Bengal - a magnet for cyclones and a storm surge amplifier - the country now has an early-warning system that is capable of evacuating millions of people in 24 hours and coastal embankment systems that protect over 6,000 km of vulnerable coastline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thanks to decades of systematic investments in climate resilience, Bangladesh has married impressive economic growth with savvy cyclone preparedness to become a global leader in disaster risk reduction.</p><p>Mobilizing community participation</p><p>Key to Bangladesh's success has been the creation of the Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) - an early warning system with more than 76,000 volunteers, half of whom are women. In thousands of remote communities across the Bangladesh coastline and further inland, handpicked volunteers are trained in disaster preparation. Armed with up-to-date cyclone forecasting, volunteers go door-to-door - sometimes using megaphones from the turrets of local mosques - to usher households to cyclone shelters. For women, who are traditionally more vulnerable when it comes to cyclone and flooding risk, the CPP has saved countless lives.</p><p>The model is both deceptively simple and surprisingly effective in terms of its community based social mobilization scale. It is rooted in the government's strategic effort to move disaster management away from relief and rehabilitation and towards risk reduction and is enforced by a series of legislative, institutional, and regulatory frameworks including the Standing Orders on Disaster, the Disaster Management Act, the National Plan for Disaster Management.</p><p>In May 2021, when Cyclone Yaas made landfall, CPP volunteers directed local communities to the Char Chatkimara School in the southern coastal district of Bhola in Bangladesh. Built in 2018, the shelter is the product of the World Bank's Multi-Purpose Disaster Shelter Project (MDSP) which is constructing and rehabilitating over 1,000 shelters and 550 kilometers of access roads.

The paved roads have seen a rise in three-wheeled motorized vehicles, which previously could not traverse the dirt roads. In the cyclone off-season, shelters serve as a vibrant community focal point, morphing between meeting place, polling station, and sometimes medical office. Because of the school's accessibility ramp, now children with disabilities can come to school.</p><p>Along with the MDSP, the World Bank's Coastal Embankment Improvement Project-I and the Emergency Cyclone Recovery and Restoration Project has supported coastal communities and continues to safeguard their livelihoods.</p><p>In 2018, the government approved the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, which will invest two and half percent of the country's GDP annually - approximately $6 billion - into shoring up its resilience and social and economic development.
