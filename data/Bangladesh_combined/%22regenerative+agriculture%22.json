Bangladesh is a key target country for Bayer's BLF initiative, which is rapidly expanding its reach within the country, said Simon-Thorsten Wiebusch, Cluster Head, Bayer CropScience, India, Bangladesh &amp; Sri Lanka (IBSL), during an interview with The Financial Express. Text of the interview follows:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Question (Q): Mr Wiebusch, how does Bayer view Bangladesh in terms of its agricultural market potential within the South Asia region?</p><p>Answer (A): Agriculture in Bangladesh has tremendous potential. Its large population and rising demand for food has created a significant opportunity for innovative solutions. The country's strong agricultural backbone aligns with Bayer's mission to transform farming through technology, productivity, and sustainability.</p><p>Q: What potential do you see in the Bangladeshi agricultural sector for Bayer's future growth?</p><p>A: Bangladesh has a young, dynamic farming community that's increasingly open to adopting new technologies. The government is investing in modernizing agriculture, which creates opportunities for Bayer to introduce high-yield seeds, crop protection products, and digital farming tools. There's also significant potential in areas like climate-resilient agriculture and precision farming.</p><p>Q: What is Bayer's mid-to-long-term plan for Bangladesh?</p><p>A: Our plan is focused on expanding our footprint in Bangladesh by deepening farmer outreach, introducing new innovations, and building stronger local partnerships. We aim to bring more hybrid seeds, invest in training programs,advance agronomic practices by combining seeds, best crop protection solutions and ensuring soil health to ensure regenerative agriculture in Bangladesh.. Additionally, we're exploring collaborations with startups and Agri-tech platforms to accelerate digital transformation- all with the broader goal of meeting the growing need for nutritional security for 220 Million Bangladeshi's, while also enabling potential export opportunities in the future.</p><p>Q: Operating in a new market often comes with unique challenges. What has Bayer's experience been in Bangladesh?</p><p>A: Every market has its own nuances and challenges. In Bangladesh, the opportunities far outweigh the challenges and with strong cooperation from the government and local stakeholders we are confident of overcoming the challenges. Our focus is on building long-term relationships rooted in trust, transparency, and shared value.</p><p>Q: Can you highlight some of Bayer's ongoing initiatives that are making a difference in Bangladesh?</p><p>A: Certainly. We've launched farmer education programs focused on safe and effective use of crop protection solutions. Bayer has also initiated collaborations to support women in agriculture and promote sustainable practices. Our product portfolio is being continuously expanded to ensure farmers have access to the best inputs available. One such very successful initiative are the Better Life Farming centres set up by Bayer in Bangladesh.Bayer has set an SDG goal to empower 100 million smallholder farmers worldwide by 2030. The Better Life Farming (BLF) initiative is a key global effort aimed at achieving this goal. Bangladesh is a key target country for Bayer's BLF initiative, which is rapidly expanding its reach within the country.</p><p>The BLF initiative seeks to enhance the income and living standards of smallholder farmers by providing holistic solutions both on and off the crop field, primarily through increased yields and the smart utilization of resources. With approximately 1,000 BLF centers nationwide, Bayer is connecting with smallholder farmers to offer innovative crop protection solutions and high-yield hybrid seeds. We also share knowledge of modern agricultural technology through extensive training sessions, result demonstrations, and method showcases led by dedicated agronomists.</p><p>As part of Bayer's stewardship commitment, BLF promotes the safe use of pesticides among farmers. Additionally, we are exploring collaborations with technology, nutrient, and other industries to address needs beyond quality seeds and crop protection solutions.</p><p>Q: What kind of support or policy framework would you like to see from the Bangladesh government to encourage further investment?</p><p>A: A stable and predictable regulatory environment is key. We also welcome policies that encourage innovation, protect intellectual property, and support digital infrastructure in rural areas. Public-private partnerships, faster registration of new products and technologies and increased investment in agri-research will further boost the confidence of large and established companies like Bayer.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

A six-week open consultation on the thematic areas and sequencing was held in which stakeholders were invited to submit feedback - the first such approach taken by a COP Presidency.</p><p>Kicking off with a two-day World Climate Action Summit, during which the first-ever Global Stocktake response will be presented to world leaders with the COP Presidency seeking commitments and accountability, the program also features new individual thematic days that respond to global challenges.</p><p>For the first time at a COP forum, COP28 will dedicate a day to Health, Relief, Recovery, and Peace, with a high level climate health ministerial, among other thematic activities.</p><p>COP28 will also be the first to focus on the role of trade in tandem with finance and it will be the COP that brings leaders together from across all levels of government and society - from the local mayors to global leaders- to work towards cleaner, greener, safer cities for current and future generations.</p><p>All thematic days throughout the two weeks will be underpinned with an inclusive approach that prioritizes frontline communities and focuses on how finance, technology and innovation can drive solutions.</p><p>More detailed information about each thematic day will be released in the weeks and months ahead, as the COP28 Presidency continues to ramp up preparations for this year's meeting at Expo City Dubai.</p><p>Below are the key themes and events for each day:</p><p> 30 November: COP28 UAE opens to the world at Expo City, Dubai.</p><p> 1-2 December: World Climate Action Summit - These two days will see heads of state and world leaders come together to tackle the most pressing climate issues in dialogue with leaders from civil society, business, youth, Indigenous Peoples' organizations and others. Typically, the summit helps to firm up the ambition for the remainder of the COP. For COP28, it will go further; it is where the first-ever Global Stocktake response and the urgency of the situation faced will be presented, and the COP Presidency will seek accountability from the highest levels of global governance on a way forward.</p><p> 3 December: Health/Relief, Recovery, and Peace - Climate change is already impacting human health across the planet, from the quality of the air we breathe to the water we drink and the places that provide us with shelter. It is also a major cause for displacement of vulnerable communities, leading to increased fragility which can compromise peace. This day, a first for COPs, will explore ways to provide relief to those affected while strengthening resilience and recovery leading to increased stability.</p><p> 4 December: Finance/Trade/Gender Equality/Accountability - Neither global financial systems that control and impact access and affordability of climate finance nor international trade networks, are working effectively and equitably. It is widely acknowledged that leaders of the global institutions and countries that govern these systems must accelerate and be accountable for an overhaul. An example of this is freeing up access to international finance and trade to support the implementation of adaptation and mitigation solutions without restrictions such as high interest rates that the poorest countries cannot afford. This is necessary to create fairer and more equal conditions for the world - and especially the most climate vulnerable countries from the Global South - to meet collective climate targets. This day will focus on moving this work forward while championing the importance of gender equality across the full climate spectrum.</p><p>5 December: Energy and Industry / Just Transition / Indigenous Peoples - The world needs to decarbonize rapidly while continuing to progress economically. It is critical that this development happens sustainably and inclusively to support lives and livelihoods while protecting the planet. This day will focus on how the world can accelerate the energy transition while ensuring it is just. The energy needed for day-to-day life must remain affordable but become cleaner, and jobs must be retained but expand as green technologies emerge and provide increased and equitable access to opportunities. The day will look at the broad spectrum of solutions from deploying renewable energy at scale and how hydrogen can support this, to decarbonizing the energy of today through carbon capture technologies and rapidly reducing methane emissions from oil and gas. It will also focus on heavy-emitting industry including steel, cement, and aluminium. Indigenous Peoples are stewards of 80% of our planet's biodiversity and Indigenous Peoples Day will recognize the importance of their intergenerational knowledge, practices, and leadership in climate action. The day will also strengthen their role in the just transition, reinforcing the urgency of a fully inclusive, all-of-society approach.</p><p>6 December: Multilevel Action, Urbanization, and Built Environment/Transport - It is not often that leaders representing all levels of governance, from the local to the global, come together. This day will provide a rare opportunity for mayors and governors, ministers and parliamentarians, and global business and civil society leaders to work together to accelerate climate action solutions across society in every form. This will include exploring how greener urban mobility systems can be designed to withstand and adapt to climate change while supporting the transition to low carbon built environments and infrastructure, and redesigning our systems of production and consumption to minimize waste. In addition, this day will showcase how all of these solutions contribute to safer, healthier and greener cities for current and future generations.</p><p> December: Rest Day</p><p> 8 December: Youth, Children, Education, and Skills - Children and youth are facing disproportionate risks and impacts from climate change as the generation who will inherit a planet with tougher conditions in which to live and prosper but which was not responsible for contributing to the problem. This day seeks to empower children and youth to shape the outcomes of COP28 and beyond and provide them with clear, defined, accessible opportunities to be a leading part of the solutions proposed at every level.</p><p> 9 December: Nature, Land Use, and Oceans - Our world's climate and its biodiversity are inextricably interconnected, one cannot exist without the other. Mitigating both crises must therefore be integrated. In a landmark win for nature, a 30 x 30 biodiversity goal was adopted by world leaders at the CBD COP15 - to protect at least 30 percent of the planet's land and water by 2030. Contributing to the goal, this day will focus on delivering climate and nature co-benefits. This includes co-designing approaches to land use and oceans conservation with local and Indigenous Peoples to protect and manage biodiversity hotspots and natural carbon sinks.</p><p> 10 December: Food, Agriculture, and Water - Climate change is creating severe pressure and risks for the food, agricultural and water systems that ensure human wellbeing. At the same time, these systems are also key contributors to climate change: one third of all human-made GHG emissions derive from agri-food systems, and 70% of fresh water consumed worldwide is used for agricultural production. This day will focus on how to fix this, from scaling up regenerative agriculture and water-food systems that support habitat restoration and conservation and increase food security, to implementing stronger, fairer integrated governance between states and corporations, farmers and producers.</p><p>Read more: COP28 UAE Presidency: Leading economists to drive progress on int'l finance reforms</p><p> 11-12 December: Final Negotiations - On the final two days of COP28, there will be no thematic days to avoid extensive programming when the negotiation text is often being closed.</p>", "publisher": "United News of Bangladesh", "instances": ["In a landmark win for nature, a 30 x 30 biodiversity goal was adopted by world leaders at the CBD COP15 - to protect at least 30 percent of the planet's land and water by 2030.

In the context of world's food insecurity, finding the right balance between adapting to climate change and meeting other developmental goals poses one of the greatest, if not the greatest, challenges before the policymakers with a nightmarish scenario. The Food and Agriculture Organisation points out that although world food production has increased over the preceding decades, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger has also increased from under 800 million in 1996 to over a billion today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact of climate change on food production and food security is a global concern. Yet, for Bangladesh, such issues represent a particular threat where agriculture is already under pressure, primarily due to increased demand for food and depletion of land and water resources. Hence, rising climatic risks could potentially derail development efforts and further aggravate poverty.</p><p>Changing weather patterns can affect agriculture in several ways. Rising temperatures adversely affect plant, animal and farmers' health. Rise in pest population and reduction in water supply would inevitably lead to the risk of aridity and land degradation. Scenarios forecast by government and international agencies point to a bleak picture: By 2050, dry season rainfall may fall by 37 per cent resulting in a significant increase in risk of drought. While monsoon rainfall is projected to rise by an estimated 28 per cent, irregular dry and wet spells may become the norm. With intense rainfall will inevitably come increased flooding and sedimentation leading to decreased productivity of agriculture lands. Rising temperatures will require greater effort by developing nations such as Bangladesh to adapt agriculture production to climate change. Putting it in another perspective, agriculture management will have to be planned and executed under adverse conditions: water constraints, higher temperatures and greater exposure to weather extremes. Practices will have to be put in place to improve farm bio-diversity and improved soil organic matter. Some practices if implemented today could help weather the storm of climate-induced changes that are coming in the foreseeable future. For instance, the use of intra and inter-species diversity could potentially serve as an insurance against future environmental changes by increasing the system's resilience. Use of green manures, mulching and recycling crop residues and animal manure would increase water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during the monsoon.</p><p>There is a greater need to move towards sustainable production methods: recycling of manures from livestock and crop residues by way of composting; and increased inter-cropping rotations with leguminous nitrogen-fixing crops. Crop rotation and diversification would enable farmers to grow products that can be harvested at different times, and have different climate / environmental stress response characteristics. Putting in place diverse outputs and resilience will serve as a safeguard against risk of drought, extreme or un-seasonal temperature variations that threaten to reduce output of one crop, but not of others. Such practices can on the one hand mitigate green house gas (GHG) emissions and at the same time aid farmers to better weather floods, droughts and extreme weather fluctuations caused by climate change patterns.</p><p>The other point of contention is the growing scarcity of water. With agriculture consuming nearly 70 per cent of the world's freshwater reservoir withdrawals, it has become highly suspect whether developing nations of Asia and Africa can marshal sufficient water for agricultural use to sustain the increases in population. One method to improve water use efficiency would be to enhance the capture and percolation of rainwater into the topsoil making use of crop residues as cover to facilitate water filtration and reduce water and soil erosion.</p><p>For developing countries like Bangladesh, agriculture is of pivotal importance for assuring food security. According to the United Nations, global warming and climate change hold the potential to drastically reduce total agriculture prosecution by up to 50 per cent over the coming decades, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. To compound this, population growth projections lead credence to a doubling of the population creating huge tensions between demand for and supply of food. Bringing about a radical transformation in agricultural practices require bold and farsighted policy measures. It will require a considerable increase in public expenditure for agriculture, with particular emphasis on public research, extension education and services and the improvement of local infrastructure aimed at empowering, in particular, small-scale farmers to significantly increase gross productivity of the new regenerative agriculture systems.</p><p>To mitigate the challenges to agriculture looming in the future, policy makers must recognise and adopt multiple, but integrated pathways across sectors to improve adaptive responses to changing climatic conditions. Neither an agricultural nor any other single sectoral intervention alone can provide sufficient scope to manage the future climate change risks. Short-term and long-term adaptive measures in agriculture, linked with clear focus on possible future risks must be integrated into cross-sectoral planning. Physical adaptive measures, such as link canals, irrigation, storage facilties for retaining water and drainage; adjusting existing agriculture practices to match future anticipated rsks, such as adjusting cropping pattern, selection of adapted crops varieties, diversification of cropping systems, more efficient use of nitrogen application on cultivated fields, etc. The above illustrates but a few measures that could pave the way for a changed and more adaptive agriculture sector capable of countering the adverse effects of climate change.
