In a David-versus-Goliath moment, the tiny Pacific Island state of Vanuatu recently changed international law forever by bringing the world's most important issue before its highest court. The result is an ICJ advisory opinion on \"the legal obligations of states in respect of climate change,\" as requested - at Vanuatu's urging - by the United Nations General Assembly (with 132 states co-sponsoring the resolution).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The questions posed to the ICJ were as simple as they were seismic: What obligations, under international law, do states have to tackle climate change? And what are the legal consequences if they fail to do so?</p><p>The ICJ's answer was unequivocal. States have a duty to protect their citizens from climate change - a duty rooted not only in treaties like the Paris climate agreement, but also in environmental law, human-rights law, and customary international law. \"Climate change,\" said the court's president, Yuji Iwasawa, speaking from the Peace Palace in The Hague, \"is an urgent and existential threat of planetary proportions.\" \"The science is clear,\" notes John Silk, the Marshall Islands' representative to the UN, \"and now the law is, too.\"</p><p>The fact that this bold message was delivered unanimously by the highest court in the international system would have been extraordinary enough. But the path that led to this outcome is even more remarkable.</p><p>The most significant climate case ever heard by the ICJ began not in a ministry or a think tank, but in a classroom. It was conceived by a group of 27 Pacific Islands law students who formed the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC), led initially by Solomon Yeo and then by Cynthia Houniuhi, both from the Solomon Islands, as well as Vishal Prasad from Fiji, Siosiua Veikune from Tonga, and others. These were not seasoned diplomats, nor were they backed by billionaires. But they were determined. \"Whether you win or lose, some fights are worth fighting,\" argued Justin Rose, a former lecturer at the University of the South Pacific (in Fiji), whose classroom exercise first planted the seed of this unlikely revolution in 2019.</p><p>The ruling delivers a resounding victory for the climate-justice movement that has been gaining momentum ever since the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg staged her first solo protest. Now, for the first time, the movement's intergenerational demand for dignity and legal recognition has a concrete judicial imprimatur.</p><p>It is also a triumph for the Global South. For decades, developing countries have called attention to the injustice of being exposed to the gravest consequences of a problem they did not cause. Now, the ICJ has acknowledged this asymmetry and taken the first step toward correcting it, vindicating, in particular, the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change: small island states with vanishing coastlines, salinizing freshwater, and intensifying cyclones. Countries long treated as voiceless victims have become the protagonists in a world-spanning legal story.</p><p>This was not the first attempt to bring climate justice to The Hague. Palau and the Marshall Islands made a similar effort in 2012, but it stalled for lack of political backing. The difference this time lay not just in the Pacific Islanders' persistence, but also in their strategy for building solidarity. Refusing to follow the usual, stodgy diplomatic script, they brought the warmth of the South Pacific to international law. Houniuhi always wore a rorodara (a seashell-studded ceremonial headdress) to address the UN, and her group treated the courtroom drama as occasion for song and dance. Hearings were celebrated as watch parties.</p><p>The Pacific Islanders also built coalitions across oceans and generations - working with Vanuatu's then-Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu, Caribbean allies, and youth activists worldwide. With some countries even calling for financial reparations, the ICJ process became a movement in itself.</p><p>The ICJ's ruling comes at a time when other international courts are converging on similar conclusions. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has just affirmed that states must curb marine pollution from greenhouse-gas emissions; the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has, in an opinion on climate obligations, recognized the right to a healthy climate as a human right; and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights is in the process of weighing in on the matter.</p><p>The ICJ's opinion is not legally binding, but it is far from toothless. Its authority comes not from enforcement, but from amplification. It crystallizes a set of norms for courts, lawmakers, and activists around the world, and it sharpens the tools of transnational litigation. Hence, the ICJ decision is already expected to influence domestic cases, such as Greenpeace's suit against the Italian oil company Eni. It may also mean that countries can sue each other over climate change.</p><p>The evolution of climate justice from a slogan into a legal standard may be the most important signal yet that a genuinely global legal system is emerging. By that I do not mean a world government, but rather a legal system defined by what the legal theorist H.L.A. Hart called \"the union of primary and secondary rules\" recognized across jurisdictions. Climate law, once a patchwork of soft pledges and nonbinding resolutions, is being stitched into something more cohesive and robust.</p><p>What the Pacific Islands students lacked in money and influence, they made up for in conviction. They worked on shoestring budgets, faced visa barriers, and repeatedly were told that their campaign would go nowhere. But they kept going, proving that legal innovation does not have to come from men in suits; it can come from the margins and eventually change international law.</p><p>\"We were there. And we were heard,\" said Houniuhi in disbelief when the opinion was published, speaking for the two communities most impacted by climate change - Pacific Islanders and young people. The subaltern spoke, and the world's highest court listened. Flawed and slow-moving though it may be, international law still holds transformative potential. As Justin Rose told me, \"International law is itself a repository of stories.\" The ICJ's decision is a much-needed reminder that happy endings are still possible.</p><p>From Project Syndicate</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

It may also mean that countries can sue each other over climate change.

While SB62 in Bonn didn't include climate finance formally on the agenda, there were some side discussions. However, growing geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions could significantly hinder finance mobilization. We all know the USD 100 billion per year promised by developed countries for 2020-2024 was never fully delivered.</p><p>a new pledge of USD 300 billion per year was made in Baku, but again, there are no guarantees. Still, we hope this roadmap will lead to a formal institutional structure that allows negotiations to move forward more efficiently. Negotiators from developing countries still hope that most climate finance will come from public sources. But developed nations are now shifting focus to innovative finance and the private sector. How do you interpret this? The basic principle of the finance discussion is that polluters must pay. Countries like the US, which have historically polluted the most, must pay now. Countries like China, which are among today's top emitters, also need to step up.</p><p>this is fundamentally about compensating for pollution.

For instance, there are proposals to levy taxes on the maritime and aviation sectors.</p><p>these are promising, but implementation will be difficult.</p><p>there was once a proposal to tax the wealth of the ultra-rich to fund climate action. What's the current status of that idea? That idea hasn't gained much traction. The reality is that the ultra-rich often own or control the industries most responsible for emissions.</p><p>these individuals and their corporations- especially in developed countries-bear historical responsibility for climate damage.</p><p>ideally, fossil fuel-producing countries should be paying compensation. But now governments are trying to shift that responsibility onto corporations instead. Private capital is profit-driven.</p><p>it may invest in mitigation, where returns are possible. But how can we attract private financing for adaptation and loss and damage, which don't generate profits? Despite its limitations, the private sector has become a key player in today's global climate framework.</p><p>underArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement, a carbon market mechanism is being developed, and many private actors are eager to participate. Funds generated through these markets could potentially be directed toward adaptation and loss and damage.</p><p>another idea is to legally require polluting companies to fund climate resilience.</p><p>the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is expected to release an advisory opinion on this, and I believe it will carry weight.</p><p>it could lead to real pressure on fossil fuel companies. We need to move beyond viewing climate finance as a public-sector-only issue.</p><p>the private sector must be involved, and this requires active engagement from civil society, academia, NGOs, youth, and women's groups. You mentioned the need to institutionalize the Baku and Bel\u00e9m roadmaps. What exactly do you mean by that? Our goal is to mobilize USD 1.3 trillion by 2035. But where will this money come from? It must come from the public, private, and all other actors.</p><p>the Paris Agreement already outlines various mechanisms for accessing climate finance. What's missing is a structured system to pull together those funds. By institutionalization, I don't mean creating a new fund-I mean setting up a financing mechanism that can tap into these existing sources more effectively.</p><p>over the years, the UNFCCC has developed several strategies, mechanisms, and funding tools. What kind of preparation do developing countries need to access these funds fairly? It starts at the national level.</p><p>each country- through its government, civil society, NGOs, and media-must first define its priorities for the COP.</p><p>once this national process is complete, the 148 developing countries must come together with a unified negotiating agenda.</p><p>together, we must push for public finance and fair access. Given the changing global landscape, it's clear that climate finance will shrink. Countries must submit strong project proposals to secure their share. How prepared is Bangladesh? You're absolutely right-global climate finance is shrinking. So, we must be prepared to capture what's still available. First, we must build local capacity. Unfortunately, we still lack the technical expertise to develop highquality projects.</p><p>this means we may have to rely on foreign experts. Second, institutional integration is key. Though we have designated national entities (DNEs) for different funds, we now need to identify a central body-or a few key institutions-that can coordinate access to all climate funds. This central body should receive funds and allocate them to pre-selected eligible projects. Strong coordination is crucial. Bangladesh has begun this process, but we must accelerate it. We should also prepare to receive not just financial assistance but also technical support.</p><p>the 6th Board Meeting of the Loss and Damage Fund was recently held in Manila.</p><p>a decision was made to initially disburse USD 250 million. Have distribution guidelines been finalized? What about mobilizing new or pledged funds? The main goal of the 6th Board Meeting was to finalize disbursement modalities.</p><p>a decision was made to provide USD 5-20 million per country as an initial allocation.</p><p>the question now is how that money will be disbursed.</p><p>unlike other funds- where you submit a project, get approval, and then implement-this fund is different.</p><p>the Board agreed that it must be capable of rapid disbursement for natural disasters like floods or cyclones. At the same time, it will also allow for project-based disbursements. So far, there is no agreed-upon access strategy. Discussions are ongoing about innovative access options, including direct budget support.</p><p>the World Bank, which is acting as an interim host, wants disbursements to meet its high standards. But many developing countries struggle to meet those requirements.</p><p>therefore, the Board decided to conduct more research and finalize the access modalities-possibly at its next meeting in October.</p><p>in the meantime, the Fund Secretariat is working on mobilizing pledged funds, while the Board explores how to bring in private sector contributions. Corporations worldwide are spending heavily through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. Could any of that money be channeled into the Loss and Damage Fund? Yes, there's potential for that. But both the political leadership at the COP and the Fund's board need to take action. We need public campaigns and political pressure to ensure that polluters pay financial compensation to those suffering the consequences.</p><p>the United States is increasingly impacted by natural disasters.

With the theme 'Right to food for a better life and a better future', the global event will plan a resilient food system for a better future and better life. Food and nutrition security have become increasingly critical concerns for policymakers despite a technological revolution in agri-food systems over the last two decades. Observance of this international day is important for Bangladesh, a country with a population of 170 million, because it helps us evaluate our strengths, weaknesses, and prospects for becoming a food-secure nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">World Food Day is an annual global observance that aims to raise awareness and take action against worldwide hunger and malnutrition. This day serves as a reminder of the need to ensure food security and access to nutritious food for all. It also highlights the importance of sustainable agriculture and food production in addressing global food challenges. World Food Day is an opportunity to come together as a global community and work towards a world where no one goes to bed hungry.</p><p>Food security is still a global concern despite the introduction of cutting-edge modern agricultural technologies. Global arrangements for climate-smart agriculture, precision farming, and generative production systems failed to ensure food for all. Fragile distribution channels, weak value chains, distorted market intervention and faulty agri-food systems make the prospect of food security uncertain. The global mission for net zero, farming resilience, and sustainability further compounded the traditional production system. Salinity, drought, draw-down of groundwater level, and decreasing cultivable land threaten food security in Bangladesh and many other countries.</p><p>Close to 700 million people go to sleep hungry each night, and of equal significance, more than two billion of the world's population suffer from hidden hunger due to a lack of essential micronutrients, such as vitamin A, iron and zinc in diets. Furthermore, according to recent reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), more than 144 million children are stunted, causing developmental problems and susceptibility to lifelong ill health. Bangladesh remains a global hunger hotspot despite a stunning success in food production over the last four decades.</p><p>Zero hunger by 2030 is one of the major SDG goals of the United Nations. More than 3 million people will need to be taken out of hunger every month to achieve the goal. However, achieving a zero-hunger target by 2030 is quite uncertain. With the current pace, 58 countries are expected to fall outside the middle score boundary in the Global Hunger Index. The COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, the economic recession, and climatic change have retarded the growth. Bangladesh's achievement in reducing GHI score (26.2 in 2015 and 19.0 in 2023) is significant compared to neighbouring countries India (28.7), Pakistan (26.6) and Afghanistan (30.6). Bangladesh still needs a 10-point reduction to graduate to a low-score country. Given the climatic risk, reducing cultivable lands and regular disasters would make it difficult for Bangladesh to achieve the zero hunger goal. Holistic policy planning, cutting-edge research, and substantial investment will be required.</p><p>Estimates suggest a 68 per cent increase in food production by 2050. Given the growing middle class and increasing purchasing capacity, demand for meat and other calorie-rich high-value food will increase significantly. Added demand for feeds (poultry, fish and livestock), fodder crops, and industrial raw materials is likely to insert more pressure on our soil. Thus, agriculture will be more intensive by using more inputs (fertilizer, chemicals, PGR).The food system accounts for 26 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. (Agriculture, forestry, and land use make up 18.4 per cent of this, while the rest is down to things like packaging, refrigeration, and transport.</p><p>The agri-food systems may be considered as an instrument of public health that can deliver health-promoting foods with consumer acceptability. This system faces existential threats from: declining availability of water and soil nutrients; loss of productive arable land due to degradation and urbanisation; plant and animal biosecurity; unpredictable weather and changing climate, declining public trust and social license. There is widespread optimism about the potential of digital innovations to transform agrifood systems and value chains, boost market linkages, and facilitate smallholder commercialisation.</p><p>Global connectivity, technological excellence, scientific collaboration, and shared goals will justify smart and sustainable agri-food systems by 2050. Planning a carbon-neutral sustainable agri-food system is a strategic priority for Bangladesh in the future. Setting an ambitious agriculture vision is imperative to achieve a USD 1500 billion GDP goal by 2050.</p><p>By 2050, Bangladesh is expected to experience an increase in temperature of about 1.5degC which will threaten the life and livelihood of about 15 million people residing in coastal areas. About 25 million farm families will be the worst victims of climatic change. Therefore, climate justice for climate-vulnerable Bangladeshi farmers is essential for sustainable agri-food systems in the coming years.</p><p>Bangladesh is the most vulnerable to climate change impacts as it is predicted to lose 11 per cent of its land if sea level rises by 2050 according to IPCCC report.

The petitioners assert that the IEPMP violates sections of the Environment Conservation Act and the spirit of Article 18A of the Bangladesh Constitution, which emphasizes the right to a healthy environment for current and future citizens. The IEPMP continues its reliance on fossil fuels, which threatens both environmental sustainability and the health of future generations, as fossil fuel emissions are a primary driver of climate change, contributing to extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, and droughts challenges to which Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable."]}, {"relevance_score": 52, "title": "Why is critical thinking not included in Bangladesh\u2019s curriculum?", "published": "2025-08-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">DHAKA \u2014 If Bangladesh\u2019s national curriculum were a recipe, it would go something like this: take a bright, curious child, add 12 years of rote memorisation, sprinkle in fear of GPA disasters, mix well with coaching centre propaganda, and bake under pressure until all signs of individuality are thoroughly extinguished.

Vanuatu's initiative gained widespread support, starting with unanimous backing from the 18-member Pacific Islands Forum and eventually growing to include 105 nations from across continents.</p><p>on 29 March 2023, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution formally requesting the ICJ's opinion.</p><p>it asked the court to consider two pivotal questions: What are the legal obligations of states to protect the climate system under international law? What are the legal consequences if states, by their actions or inaction, cause significant harm to the climate? The court was also asked to pay particular attention to the rights of vulnerable states, communities, and future generations.</p><p>unprecedented Legal and Scientific Engagement The ICJ process that followed was the most participatory in its 88-year history. The court received 91 written statements and 107 oral arguments from countries and international organizations, as well as 65 replies to follow-up questions from judges.</p><p>even countries that had never appeared before the court, such as Barbados and Micronesia, participated.</p><p>in a rare move, ICJ judges also held a private consultation in late 2024 with leading scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including its chair, Professor Jim Skea.</p><p>this meeting provided the court with up-to-date scientific insights into the nature and urgency of the climate crisis.</p><p>the court's 133-page opinion, delivered on 23 July 2025, marks only the fifth time in its history that the ICJ has reached a unanimous advisory opinion. Scientific Consensus as Legal Context The ICJ heavily referenced IPCC assessments in defining the scientific context of its ruling.</p><p>it confirmed that human activity-particularly fossil fuel use-is the main driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation in the atmosphere; climate change is already causing severe and escalating impacts, including sea-level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and irreversible ecosystem damage.</p><p>a livable and sustainable future is only possible with rapid emissions cuts in this decade. Quoting directly from IPCC reports, the court cited the 'very high confidence' in findings that every fraction of adegree of warming brings heightened risks.</p><p>it warned that scientific uncertainty should not be a reason for inaction and reaffirmed the 'precautionary principle': where there is a threat of serious harm, states must act even without full certainty. Binding Climate Obligations under International Law The court concluded that states have binding legal obligations to act on climate change under both specialized treaties, like the Paris Agreement, and general international law.</p><p>this directly contradicts arguments made by highemitting states such as the US, China, and the UK, which claimed their climate duties should be interpreted only through the UN climate regime.</p><p>the ICJ rejected that narrow reading, asserting that broader customary international law, environmental principles, and human rights law also apply. Key obligations include: preventing significant transboundary environmental harm; acting with 'due diligence' to reduce emissions and avoid worsening climate impacts; cooperating internationally in good faith to address climate threats; and respecting and protecting human rights by maintaining a healthy environment. The court stated that these obligations also apply to states not party to the Paris Agreement, such as the US, which has moved to exit the treaty again under the administration of President Donald Trump. Responsibility Extends Beyond Emissions A particularly groundbreaking element of the opinion is its recognition that countries' legal obligations extend not only to GHG emissions but also to fossil fuel production, subsidies, and permitting.</p><p>this means states can be held accountable not just for burning fossil fuels, but also for enabling their extraction and sale.</p><p>this expands legal scrutiny to economic activities that underwrite fossil-fuel dependence and suggests that governments approving new oil, gas, or coal projects may be violating international law. Joy Reyes of the Grantham Research Institute notes that this language gives future litigants more ammunition to challenge fossil fuel infrastructure in court. Professor Jorge Vi\u00f1uales of the University of Cambridge, who acted as counsel for Vanuatu, said the court's decision to include fossil fuel production-even though it was not directly asked to-demonstrates how seriously it takes the issue. Legal Consequences: Liability, Reparations, and Court Orders In response to the second question posed by the UN General Assembly, the court declared that states that breach their climate obligations can face legal consequences under international law.</p><p>this includes: liability for climate harm, paving the way for reparations, including compensation and formal apologies; court orders requiring states to revise or strengthen their national climate plans (NDCs) if they are found inadequate; and mandates to cease harmful activity, including revoking permits, halting subsidies, or strengthening environmental regulations.</p><p>the court emphasized that assigning legal responsibility is not impossible, even if the causal links between emissions and climate impacts are more diffuse than in cases like oil spills or industrial pollution.</p><p>it cited IPCC research showing that human-caused climate change has already worsened disasters like floods, heatwaves, and droughts. This significantly strengthens the legal basis for climate litigation worldwide. Courts in different jurisdictions can now refer to this opinion when ordering governments to act, enforce stronger climate targets, or address damages caused by climate-related events.</p><p>a Path to Climate Reparations Perhaps the most politically significant implication of the ICJ opinion is its support for climate reparations.</p><p>the court held that victims of climate harm-states or individuals-can seek compensation or restitution under international law. While the Paris Agreement specifically states that its loss-and-damage provisions do not imply liability or compensation, the ICJ clarified that this language does not override the broader framework of international law.</p><p>in other words, voluntary contributions to lossand-damage funds do not shield countries from lawsuits or reparations claims. Harj Narulla, legal counsel for the Solomon Islands, called it 'a legal pathway for developing states to seek reparations from developed states.'

It is about how food, a basic human need, becomes a language for connection, resistance and care,\" said Ms Villarama. \"And in that way, it becomes something every audience can understand \u2014 Filipino, Chinese or anyone who has ever craved meaning in the middle of chaos.\"</p><p>Despite the global attention, Food Delivery has not secured commercial distribution in the Philippines. No major cinema operator has agreed to screen it as tensions between Manila and Beijing simmer on.</p><p>In general, documentaries rarely reach mainstream cinemas in the country, where commercial chains favour blockbuster fare. Independent film-makers often rely on film festivals, university circuits or grassroots community screenings.</p><p>Ms Villarama's team has embraced this model, coordinating independent screenings with advocacy groups, schools and film collectives. The documentary will be shown again at the same Manila shopping mall in August, with more community screenings planned after that.</p><p>Associate Professor Danilo Arao, who teaches journalism at the University of the Philippines (UP), said China's efforts to block the film reflect both media suppression and diplomatic overreach.</p><p>\"It is not just an issue of media freedom, it is also an issue of overreach on the part of China because they are trying their best to deodorise their image and to control the narrative pertaining to what they claim to be control over the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea. So, it is deplorable that they are doing that,\" he said.</p><p>Dr Arao believes the Philippine government should be more proactive in defending artists and journalists from foreign political pressure.</p><p>Ms Villarama said that since reports of China's intervention in New Zealand, some Philippine officials have quietly reached out to her team.</p><p>\"We are not expecting uniform support from them, especially when geopolitics are involved. But I do hope this film encourages our leaders to defend freedom of expression, and to stand with the people whose lives and labour make that freedom necessary,\" she said.</p><p>Dr Aries Arugay, visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS \u2014 Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and chairman of UP's Political Science Department, called China's actions \"undue intrusion into the internal affairs of another country\".</p><p>He said Beijing increasingly uses seemingly benign sectors such as trade, art and cultural exchange as tools of influence.</p><p>\"There are no benign aspects of relationship with China because they can weaponise and use it against the country,\" Dr Arugay told ST.</p><p>He said Food Delivery might not contain direct criticism of China, but its existence contradicts Beijing's tightly managed narrative on the maritime dispute.</p><p>In April, then Senator Francis Tolentino accused the Chinese Embassy in Manila of running a \"hidden and sinister\" disinformation campaign to sway public opinion and discredit critics of Beijing's South China Sea claims. China denied the allegation and has since banned Mr Tolentino from entering the mainland and its territories.</p><p>.Dr Arao and Dr Arugay said Food Delivery's visual storytelling is especially powerful in the Philippines, where television and cinema heavily shape public consciousness.</p><p>\"A documentary is potent from a Filipino cultural perspective because we are visual as a people. It will penetrate the public consciousness more, so it is threatening to them (China),\" said Dr Arugay.</p><p>The backlash from Beijing has only strengthened Ms Villarama's conviction that her film's message is more urgent than ever.</p><p>\"The attempts to block the film didn't intimidate us. They clarified our purpose,\" she said.</p><p>\"Food Delivery isn't just about delivering food. It is delivering a message: that Filipinos have had enough.

Urban per capita plastic consumption increased from 3 kg in 2005 to 9 kg in 2020, while in Dhaka, it soared to 22.25 kg - a threefold rise. Nationwide, more than 646 tonnes of plastic waste are produced daily, much of which flows into rivers and landfills, causing severe environmental damage.</p><p>Alarmingly, research has detected high levels of microplastics in rivers and municipal water systems in Dhaka, with an average of over 30 particles per litre.

The trip, which included engagements with British government regulators and activists arrested under controversial legislation, has been interpreted by some UK commentators as a breach of protocol and a direct interference in British domestic affairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, first published by The Telegraph on May 24, paints a picture of quiet but deliberate American engagement in a sensitive and polarizing British debate, the rights of anti-abortion activists versus the scope of public order legislation. The delegation from the State Departments Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) met not only with Foreign Office officials and the UKs media watchdog Ofcom, but also privately convened with British activists who had faced arrest or prosecution for protesting outside abortion clinics.</p><p>At the heart of Washingtons concern is Britains new Online Safety Act, legislation that has sparked significant debate over its implications for freedom of expression. Although the Act primarily focuses on curbing harmful content on the internet, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent by broadening the states ability to monitor and restrict speech.</p><p>But the US delegations attention extended beyond the digital realm. In what appears to be a broader critique of the UKs approach to civil liberties, officials attended an event held in a &amp;#8220;nondescript&amp;#8221; London office block, meeting British citizens prosecuted for peaceful demonstrations near abortion facilities.</p><p>One such case is that of Livia Tossici-Bolt, a 64-year-old campaigner who in 2023 was charged under a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) for standing outside a clinic in Bournemouth with a sign that read: &amp;#8220;Here to talk if you want.&amp;#8221; Tossici-Bolt refused to leave the area when asked by police, triggering legal proceedings. While the British authorities defend the buffer zones around abortion facilities as necessary protections for women seeking medical services, free speech advocates &amp;#8211; both in the UK and abroad &amp;#8211; see them as overreach.</p><p>Another prominent case is Adam Smith-Connor, a British army veteran convicted in October 2024 for silently praying within the restricted zone of the same clinic. His case received significant international attention when US Vice President J.D. Vance labeled it &amp;#8220;a most concerning case,&amp;#8221; stating it highlighted the growing threats to &amp;#8220;basic liberties of religious Britons.&amp;#8221;</p><p>These interventions mark a notable shift in the US approach to foreign human rights advocacy &amp;#8211; from defending democratic rights in authoritarian regimes to openly challenging restrictions in long-standing allies such as the UK.</p><p>The meetings took place as UK and US officials were also engaged in trade negotiations, raising questions about whether diplomatic leverage was being subtly applied. While the State Department has publicly framed the visit as part of its global human rights mission, British commentators, particularly from conservative media, have accused the US of diplomatic overreach.</p><p>&amp;#8220;The visit is the latest sign of the Trump administrations willingness to intervene in domestic British affairs,&amp;#8221; The Telegraph noted, despite President Trump not currently holding office. However, his administrations legacy &amp;#8211; including placing a high priority on religious freedom and political expression &amp;#8211; appears to still shape Republican policymaking, especially under the vice presidency of J.D. Vance, who has taken up the mantle on human rights advocacy abroad.</p><p>While the Biden administration had focused much of its international human rights dialogue on racial equity, gender rights, and climate justice, the current Republican leadership, particularly since Trumps resurgence in American politics, has taken a sharp turn toward defending traditional values and religious liberties &amp;#8211; even across borders.</p><p>The situation has also reignited debates in the UK over what critics describe as &amp;#8220;two-tier policing.&amp;#8221; The term refers to the alleged disparity in how police treat right-wing versus left-wing protesters. While climate activists and pro-Palestinian demonstrators often face leniency, anti-immigration or socially conservative campaigners are said to receive disproportionately heavy-handed treatment.</p><p>Tech magnate Elon Musk, an outspoken critic of liberal censorship and a staunch ally of Donald Trump, recently weighed in on the UKs protest laws. He accused British authorities of exhibiting bias in their policing strategies, arguing that peaceful demonstrators with unfashionable opinions were being unjustly silenced.</p><p>This view is echoed by several British politicians and advocacy groups who fear the erosion of core democratic principles. &amp;#8220;Free speech is meaningless if it only protects speech that the majority agrees with,&amp;#8221; said Claire Fox, a former member of the House of Lords and director of the Academy of Ideas. &amp;#8220;Were drifting into dangerous territory when people are arrested for praying or offering a conversation in public space.&amp;#8221;</p><p>While the US has long seen itself as a guardian of liberal democracy, this latest episode illustrates how definitions of &amp;#8220;freedom&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;rights&amp;#8221; are beginning to diverge between allies. In continental Europe, and increasingly in the UK, maintaining social harmony and protecting minority groups is often prioritized over absolute freedom of expression. The US, especially under Republican leadership, views any curtailment of speech &amp;#8211; even if offensive &amp;#8211; as a threat to democracy.</p><p>That transatlantic divergence is now playing out in real time, with implications for bilateral relations. Britains Foreign Office has so far remained tight-lipped about the meetings, likely aiming to avoid a diplomatic spat. But the implications are serious. As the US increasingly frames free speech as a global issue &amp;#8211; regardless of jurisdiction &amp;#8211; traditional allies may find themselves subject to uncomfortable scrutiny.</p><p>The US visit to the UK to meet with anti-abortion campaigners underscores a broader shift in American foreign policy priorities and raises thorny questions about sovereignty, civil liberties, and diplomatic norms. While Washingtons defenders argue that advocacy for human rights knows no borders, critics counter that such actions veer dangerously close to interference.</p><p>At a time when both nations face rising polarization at home and instability abroad, their handling of fundamental freedoms &amp;#8211; and their willingness to critique each other &amp;#8211; may prove a litmus test for the future of the &amp;#8220;special relationship.&amp;#8221;</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

For countries like Bangladesh, the consequences are especially dire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With its low-lying coastal regions, dense population, and vulnerability to a variety of natural disasters, Bangladesh finds itself on the frontlines of the climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense storms, floods, and droughts, are disrupting lives and livelihoods, particularly in rural and coastal areas. The consequences of inaction are clear, and urgent steps need to be taken.</p><p>However, the solution to the climate crisis is not just the responsibility of governments or international bodies. It is a collective responsibility that must involve all segments of society, particularly the youth. In Bangladesh, young people have shown remarkable resilience, creativity, and dedication in responding to the challenges posed by climate change.</p><p>They are not waiting for others to take action; instead, they are actively stepping up to make a difference in their communities and the country at large. The youth of Bangladesh are not just passive recipients of the consequences of climate change-they are determined to take charge of their future and shape a more sustainable world for themselves and future generations.</p><p>The youth of Bangladesh are becoming increasingly aware of the urgent need to act on climate change. They understand that the current crisis will have long-term consequences for their generation and those that follow. Climate change is not just an environmental issue; it is a threat to their futures, their livelihoods, and their communities.</p><p>And it is clear that if the world does not act swiftly, the situation will only worsen, making their dreams of a better future more difficult to achieve.</p><p>As such, many young people in Bangladesh are actively engaged in climate action efforts, from promoting environmental sustainability to advocating for stronger climate policies at the national and international levels.</p><p>They are leading grassroots initiatives, pushing for climate-resilient infrastructure, and advocating for climate justice in vulnerable communities.</p><p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in a national youth convention on climate change adaptation and disaster resilience organized by Islamic Relief Bangladesh and YouthNet Global.</p><p>The convention brought together youths from various disaster-prone areas, each of whom demonstrated immense passion and commitment to combating the challenges posed by climate hazards.</p><p>The dreams and aspirations of the young participants were nothing short of inspiring. These youth-hailing from some of the most vulnerable regions of Bangladesh-are fully aware of the impacts that climate change has on their communities. And yet, they remain determined to rise above these challenges. They are committed to finding solutions, developing resilience, and building a more sustainable future.</p><p>Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The country is highly susceptible to flooding, cyclones, and rising sea levels. As much as 30% of the country is less than five meters above sea level, and much of the population lives in coastal and flood-prone areas.</p><p>Changes in weather patterns, such as irregular rainfall, extreme heat, and rising salinity in the coastal regions, have already disrupted agriculture and food production, threatening food security for millions. The impacts on agriculture are particularly concerning, as the sector employs a large portion of the population and forms the backbone of the rural economy. The disruptions to agriculture, alongside threats to water security and infrastructure, create immense challenges for communities.</p><p>It is clear that the youth of Bangladesh have a crucial role to play in addressing the climate crisis. They are not only the most affected by its impacts, but they are also the most motivated to create solutions.</p><p>The younger generation has already demonstrated an impressive ability to mobilize and advocate for climate action, and their energy and determination are essential in the fight against climate change.</p><p>They are active participants in various movements and organizations that are dedicated to promoting environmental sustainability and advocating for climate justice.</p><p>Their grassroots efforts are contributing to the development of innovative solutions, such as promoting renewable energy sources, sustainable agricultural practices, and disaster-resilient infrastructure.</p><p>Despite their commitment and passion, youth in Bangladesh face several obstacles in their climate action efforts. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of financial resources to implement their ideas. While many young people have innovative ideas and solutions to combat the climate crisis, they often lack the necessary funds and institutional support to bring these ideas to fruition.</p><p>The absence of funding for youth-led initiatives means that many projects remain small-scale or fail to reach their full potential. Additionally, young people often struggle to gain access to the knowledge and technical skills required to design and implement climate solutions.</p><p>Although many young people are aware of the urgency of the situation, they may lack the formal training and expertise needed to develop and implement large-scale climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. To address these barriers, there must be greater support for youth-led projects and initiatives.

They understand that the current crisis will have long-term consequences for their generation and those that follow. Climate change is not just an environmental issue; it is a threat to their futures, their livelihoods, and their communities. And it is clear that if the world does not act swiftly, the situation will only worsen, making their dreams of a better future more difficult to achieve. As such, many young people in Bangladesh are actively engaged in climate action efforts, from promoting environmental sustainability to advocating for stronger climate policies at the national and international levels. They are leading grassroots initiatives, pushing for climate-resilient infrastructure, and advocating for climate justice in vulnerable communities. I recently had the opportunity to participate in a national youth convention on climate change adaptation and disaster resilience organized by Islamic Relief Bangladesh and YouthNet Global. The convention brought together youths from various disaster-prone areas, each of whom demonstrated immense passion and commitment to combating the challenges posed by climate hazards. The dreams and aspirations of the young participants were nothing short of inspiring. These youth-hailing from some of the most vulnerable regions of Bangladesh-are fully aware of the impacts that climate change has on their communities. And yet, they remain determined to rise above these challenges.", "The impacts on agriculture are particularly concerning, as the sector employs a large portion of the population and forms the backbone of the rural economy. The disruptions to agriculture, alongside threats to water security and infrastructure, create immense challenges for communities. It is clear that the youth of Bangladesh have a crucial role to play in addressing the climate crisis. They are not only the most affected by its impacts, but they are also the most motivated to create solutions. The younger generation has already demonstrated an impressive ability to mobilize and advocate for climate action, and their energy and determination are essential in the fight against climate change. They are active participants in various movements and organizations that are dedicated to promoting environmental sustainability and advocating for climate justice. Their grassroots efforts are contributing to the development of innovative solutions, such as promoting renewable energy sources, sustainable agricultural practices, and disaster-resilient infrastructure. Despite their commitment and passion, youth in Bangladesh face several obstacles in their climate action efforts. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of financial resources to implement their ideas. While many young people have innovative ideas and solutions to combat the climate crisis, they often lack the necessary funds and institutional support to bring these ideas to fruition. The absence of funding for youth-led initiatives means that many projects remain small-scale or fail to reach their full potential."]}, {"relevance_score": 29, "title": "Pope Francis, the people's pontiff, dies at 88", "published": "2025-04-22", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dhaka, April 22 -- Pope Francis, the beloved and transformative leader of the Catholic Church, passed away on Easter Monday at the age of 88, following a prolonged illness caused by double pneumonia. He died peacefully at his residence in Casa Santa Marta, within the Vatican.The announcement of his passing was made by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, who said: \"Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father.\"He added: \"His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church.</p><p>He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.\"The Director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni, later informed the media that arrangements were being made to transfer the late Pope's body to St. Peter's Basilica on Wednesday, 23 April, where the faithful will have the opportunity to pay their final respects.\"The translation of the Holy Father's mortal remains to the Vatican Basilica, for the veneration of all the faithful, may take place on the morning of Wednesday, April 23, 2025, according to the arrangements that shall be determined and communicated tomorrow, following the first Congregation of the Cardinals,\" Bruni stated.Leaders from across the globe, including from Bangladesh, have expressed their condolences at the passing of Pope Francis. In a heartfelt message addressed to Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy See, Bangladesh's Chief Adviser, Professor Dr Muhammad Yunus, paid tribute to the late Pontiff, describing him as \"a beacon of peace, humanity, and unity\" whose leadership transcended religious and national boundaries.\"On behalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh, we, with a heavy heart, express our deepest condolences at the sad demise of His Holiness Pope Francis,\" wrote Professor Yunus.He praised the Pope's unwavering commitment to upholding human dignity, promoting interfaith harmony, and advocating justice for the marginalised and displaced.Reflecting on his personal interactions with the Holy Father, Professor Yunus noted:\"I have been honoured to meet many times with Pope Francis and to work closely with him to foster peace, human dignity, and environmental stewardship.\"The message also recalled the deep admiration held by the people of Bangladesh, particularly during Pope Francis's historic visit to the country in 2017, which left a lasting impression on both Christian and non-Christian communities alike.\"During this time of sorrow, we stand in solidarity with the Catholic Church and people of faith around the globe, remembering the profound impact of his teachings and the kindness he extended to all,\" the Chief Adviser stated.He concluded by offering prayers for the eternal peace of Pope Francis's soul and reaffirmed Bangladesh's commitment to advancing his vision of a compassionate, inclusive, and just world.Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Pope Francis was the eldest of five siblings. He felt called to the priesthood at the age of 16 and, after 13 years of religious formation, was ordained. In 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, he was elected the first Pope from the Americas and the first Jesuit to hold the Papacy.During his papacy, Francis became a global moral voice, championing the causes of climate justice, poverty alleviation, and the rights of migrants and refugees. His encyclical Laudato Si on environmental care received international acclaim. He played a critical role in the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, and frequently spoke out against nationalism, extremism, and exclusion.Notably, he opened doors for women and laypeople to participate more fully in church leadership and decision-making processes, and consistently advocated for interfaith dialogue and global peace.Pope Francis passed away peacefully after delivering his final blessing to Easter crowds on Sunday.

For generations, her family relied on Badin's salty waters for fishing, but seawater intrusion turned freshwater ponds brackish and fertile lands barren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This change, steady but not slow, left Fareeha in dire financial straits, forcing her husband and sons to work at brick kilns. But this wasn't a permanent solution, she says. \"The sea took our nets, then our dignity ... we were eventually forced to move out.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fareeha's plight resonates with almost 80 per cent of other fishing families in Badin, where, without compensation or adaptation, climate poverty has pushed hundreds into a chaotic storm of displacement.</p><p>While climate change is a global issue, its impacts, unfortunately, are spread disproportionately across the world. Despite having minimal contributions towards global greenhouse gas emissions, low-income countries tend to be extremely vulnerable to the disastrous effects of the crisis. Moreover, the increased frequency of extreme weather events, lack of resources and infrastructure, and limited access to climate finance make developing nations less resilient and more prone to climate poverty.</p><p>Pakistan is among these nations, having been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025. The floods that submerged over a third of the country three years ago affected more than 33 million people, resulting in the loss of 1,700 lives and $30 billion.</p><p>At the same time, droughts in Sindh and Balochistan in recent years have made water increasingly scarce, leading to parched crops and rising food prices, highlighting Pakistan's severe vulnerability to disasters driven by climate change.</p><p>At the same time, climate change also deepens pre-existing inequalities, with marginalised communities facing a greater burden. Their vulnerabilities increase due to a myriad of socio-economic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and low income, which traps communities into a vicious web of climate poverty \u2014 when the conditions stemming from climate change destroy livelihoods, increase food and water scarcity, and displace communities.</p><p>According to the World Bank Group's Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) for Pakistan, \"the combined risks of extreme climate-related events, environmental degradation, and air pollution are projected to reduce Pakistan's GDP [gross domestic product] by at least 18pc to 20pc by 2050.\" This will significantly slow down economic progress and hinder efforts towards poverty reduction.</p><p>Engineered, not accidental</p><p>In Pakistan, 40 per cent of the population is highly vulnerable and frequently exposed to climate-induced disasters, including floods, cyclones, droughts, heavy rain spells, and extreme heatwaves. Marginalised urban residents, indigenous rural communities, small-scale farmers, and fisherfolk are among those at high risk.</p><p>A research report by Oxfam studying Pakistan's rural disaster-prone communities in Badin (Sindh), Rajanpur (Punjab), and Khuzdar (Balochistan) found that they bore the brunt of climate-induced displacement, food insecurity and economic instability. In Badin, seawater intrusion has degraded freshwater resources, reducing fish and prawn catches and leaving many fisherfolk struggling to sustain their livelihoods. The increased frequency of cyclones and storms has further displaced coastal populations, many of whom lack the resources to adapt or migrate.</p><p>In Rajanpur, erratic rainfall patterns and intense flooding have destroyed agricultural lands, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to predict sowing and harvesting cycles. Meanwhile, prolonged droughts have rapidly depleted groundwater levels in Khuzdar, shrinking grazing lands and threatening livestock-dependent livelihoods. Across these regions, traditional methods are proving insufficient, pushing many families into seasonal migration in search of alternative sources of income.</p><p>In Pakistan's urban centres, the poor are often pushed to the margins, forced to live in overcrowded, unsafe housing that not only endangers their lives but also intensifies the impact of climate-induced disasters. Take the port city Karachi as an example; prolonged power outages lasting between 10 to 16 hours severely impact low-income areas such as Shah Faisal Colony, Lyari, Bhit, and Baba Island.</p><p>These disruptions affect daily wage earners the most, making it increasingly difficult for them to sustain their livelihoods. Beyond economic strain, the lack of electricity poses serious health risks, particularly for the elderly, children, and pregnant women. With growing climate-related health issues, financial burdens worsen, trapping many in a relentless cycle of poverty.</p><p>In 2021, around 15,000 families living along the Gujjar and Orangi nullahs were displaced without rehabilitation in the name of flood mitigation and anti-encroachment campaigns. Government agencies seem to have not just failed in solving the housing crisis in the metropolis but also in implementing resettlement policies.</p><p>The authorities use the Supreme Court's 2021 order of demolition while displacing people, but forget that the apex court had also issued directions for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the victims. To top it, the government displays impeccable punctuality and pace when it comes to demolition, while delaying tactics are used in relocation and resolution, keeping hundreds of families in limbo for years.</p><p>The impacts of climate change are also deeply intertwined with corporate accountability, such as the illegal development of Karachi's waterfront, or Emaar's $3 billion Bundal Island project, which blocks natural drainage and worsens urban flooding in nearby low-income communities.</p><p>This is why slum dwellers say, \"As soon as the builders get permits, we (the poor and the vulnerable) get evicted.\" Meanwhile, dozens of textile factories along Karachi's Lyari River dump untreated sewage, making monsoon rains toxic, but that doesn't even cross the ears of officials at Sindh's Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). It's right to say that climate vulnerability is not accidental. In cities like Karachi, they are engineered.</p><p>Where resilience becomes resistance</p><p>Meanwhile, statistics issued by the Pakistan Disaster Management Authority show that around $50 million in the World Bank's flood resilience funds are tied up in bureaucratic delays. It is evident; when institutions fail, the poor drown twice \u2014 first in floodwaters and then again in departmental negligence.</p><p>The disproportionate cost of climate change is not limited to class but also seeps into gender, where women and girls face a higher risk and challenge. The United Nations concurs, highlighting in various reports how women make up 80pc of those displaced by climate change. In Pakistan, it is the women in rural areas who are the most vulnerable.</p><p>According to a 2021 study on vulnerable communities in Sindh, declining agricultural productivity and men travelling in search of work have left women with the dual burden of managing domestic and financial responsibilities, worsening their vulnerability to food scarcity, malnutrition, and health complications.</p><p>The situation is no different in Balochistan. \"Our men have migrated; we (the women) have stayed to fight for the land,\" said Rozina, 51. She leads a women's collective for drought-resistant millet cultivation in Khuzdar. Her efforts are at odds with a system that denies women land title and ownership.</p><p>\"And it is this land that we (women) are protecting,\" Rozina stressed.</p><p>For Pakistan's transgender community, the situation is even worse. Facing immense stigma and marginalisation, they are disowned by their families, limiting their access to education, employment, and proper housing. As a result, they are forced to live in informal settlements or slums, which are particularly susceptible to climate-induced disasters such as floods and extreme heat waves.</p><p>Moreover, due to systemic discrimination and exclusion, many are unable to access government relief post-disasters, as highlighted in the devastating floods of 2022, with a majority of those affected unable to access relief programs due to the lack of official identification documents. According to an NGO working for transgenders, 95pc of flood victims were denied assistance, discriminated against or excluded by design.</p><p>Here, resilience is resistance.</p><p>The path to recovery</p><p>But is there a way out of this toxic and repetitive cycle? Yes.</p><p>A working paper titled 'The 24-Hour Risk City: A Framework for Thinking About Building Infrastructures of Climate Repair in Nairobi and Karachi' introduces the concept of climate repair, describing it as a practice of maintenance and repair that focuses on both human and environmental well-being in the face of climate risks. It is framed as an ethic of care, emphasising the importance of continuous and deliberate efforts to sustain and restore urban and ecological systems.</p><p>Climate repair involves three different dimensions: bodily and familial, infrastructural, and connective-communal repair, particularly in low-income settlements where inadequate infrastructures and governance failures leave communities more vulnerable.</p><p>The paper highlights that climate repair is a gendered practice, often carried out by women and marginalised communities who engage in everyday forms of care and adaptation to combat the effects of extreme weather events, urban flooding, and heatwaves, especially in the absence of governmental or institutional support.</p><p>Therefore, it underlines the need for a holistic approach in policymaking, including not only the improvement of physical infrastructure but also strengthening social networks and integrating local solutions to build resilience towards adverse climatic impacts.</p><p>Encompassing infrastructural resilience, socioeconomic empowerment, and participatory governance, the idea of climate repair recognises that the most vulnerable communities must be at the centre of climate action.

The government has formed three layers of committees including one headed by Prime Minister Oli, another led by Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, and the third, a secretariat at the Prime Minister's Office (PM) under Rajkumar Shrestha, secretary at PMO. In the common minimum programme announced by the Congress-UML coalition in September last year, the government had committed to organising the Sagarmatha Sambad. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Forests each has allocated Rs5 million to organise the event. The core objective of Sagarmatha Sambad is to build shared understanding among national and international stakeholders for immediate climate action. Next objective is seeking inclusive solutions where nations can advocate for climate justice by providing vulnerable nations and communities with fair and inclusive solutions. Also, the Sambad will seek enhanced global cooperation to accelerate climate finance, scale up innovative technologies, and boost capacity building. Finally, it strives to form a global coalition for taking ambitious action in preserving mountains and securing a sustainable future for humanity. However, officials at the PMO and Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed to the Post that invitations to foreign delegates were yet to be sent. The officials said there is a lack of coordination between the PMO and the ministry, and foreign interest in Sagarmatha Sambad remains low. As a result, high-level participation from neighboring countries is not expected.", "Some heads of INGOs and NGOs, along with a few experts are likely to participate,\" an official said. \"But we have not received any enthusiastic inquiries from neighboring countries and foreign leaders who could make a real impact. The government is planning to invite leaders from the South Asia region, China, the UN Secretary-General, heads of international organisations working on climate change, and multilateral aid agencies, among others. We are busy in preparations,\" said Maheshwar Dhakal, member-secretary of the organising committee. The event will generate momentum among nations and institutions working on climate change. The event aims to develop a common understanding of the impact of climate change on mountainous countries, advocate for climate justice for those bearing the brunt of carbon emissions, and develop bilateral and multilateral partnerships for climate finance and technological advancements. It will also take initiative for the inclusion of mountainous countries in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dialogue process. The government plans to invite heads of state and government, as well as ministers for forest, environment and climate change of mountain and oceanic countries facing climate risks. Likewise, invitations will be extended to UN Secretary-General, heads and representatives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO), United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), (UNFCCC), UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) and UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Likewise, those from UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), UN Habitat, UN Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are also being invited. Another list of invitees includes heads and representatives of various international organizations working in the field of climate change, like the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP), International Water Management Institute (IWMI), Climate Analytics and Innovative Solutions for Sustainable Development (TERI)Other such organisations are Regional Community Forestry Training Centre for Asia and the Pacific (RECOFTC) and Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Innovative Solutions to Climate Change (CAS), Practical Action, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), and Mission East."]}, {"relevance_score": 16, "title": "Adviser Rizwana urges unified global action to tackle climate change", "published": "2025-01-22", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan has called for unified global action to confront the challenges of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She spoke about the importance of minimising environmental harm while striving to meet mitigation targets during a Capacity Building Workshop on Paris Agreement Article 6 Implementation, held at the Department of Environment Agargaon, on Wednesday.</p><p>Environment Secretary Dr Farhina Ahmed addressed the event as a special guest, while the Department of Environment Director General presided over the workshop.</p><p>Rizwana, US Charge d'Affaires discuss critical environmental challenges</p><p>'Market-driven solutions have a role, but my humble request is to prepare ourselves for the challenges of climate change.

For Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, the tripling in financing from $100 billion to $300 billion a year by 2035 \u2014 known formally as the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance \u2014 to help protect vulnerable and developing countries against the adverse impact of worsening climate disasters was a \"breakthrough agreement\" and \"an insurance policy for humanity. Poorer nations that are bearing the brunt of the catastrophic effects of a steadily warming planet howled in protest, however, rejecting the COP29 deal as \"abysmally poor. India's delegate Chandni Raina described it as a \"paltry sum\" that \"will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Greenpeace Philippines campaigner Virginia Benosa-Llorin could not agree more. \"It is a betrayal of climate justice and a slap on the face of all developing nations. We have been dragged into a climate crisis that had little to do with us, at the cost of countless lives and trillions in loss and damages,\" Benosa-Llorin said. Most vulnerableIndeed, countries such as the Philippines had pushed for a climate finance target of as much as $1. 3 trillion from wealthy nations to bankroll developing countries' climate mitigation projects. The Philippines knows only too well the devastating impact of worsening climate change with storms becoming more frequent because of warming seas that supercharge these weather disturbances, bringing with them more rain and therefore more intense flooding and damage to infrastructure and farmland, and deaths. According to the Asian Development Bank, climate-related disasters could be as high as 7.", "6 percent of gross domestic product by 2030 which could set back its economic momentum. The Philippines has already been determined by experts to be the country that's most vulnerable to natural disasters given its location, exposed to the Pacific Ocean and lying well within the Pacific ring of fire. Supertyphoon \"Pepito,\" for instance, was the sixth typhoon to strike the Philippines in less than a month. Scientists have also determined that last July, Supertyphoon \"Carina's\" wind speeds were about more intense by 9 miles per hour and its rainfall 14 percent higher as a result of warmer sea temperatures. Those coming in the future will likely have the same characteristics if nothing is done, thus draining government resources for disaster response with higher toll on life and limb and property. Global leaderThis then makes it more imperative for the Philippines to use its unique role as host of the Loss and Damage Fund Board to lead efforts to get the so-called Global South\u2014those most vulnerable to climate change\u2014the financial assistance that rightfully belongs to them in the name of climate justice. Established through a decision of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, the Loss and Damage Fund aims to help developing countries respond to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with climate change, including extreme weather events such as typhoons and droughts. President Marcos earlier signed into law the Loss and Damage Fund Board Act, that provided the body with a legal personality to govern the international climate change fund. With that, the Philippines is \"on the way in positioning itself as a global leader in calling for climate accountability,\" according to Greenpeace. Indeed, the Philippines can be the \"test case\" for the fund itself following the successive strong tropical cyclones that hit the country in just a month, demonstrating the \"unique cumulative loss of lives and damage to critical infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, roads and water, and power systems.

She noted the challenges posed by an ultra-capitalistic system and called for alternative approaches that prioritise people over profit. She also highlighted the need to empower young people, who are rightly demanding climate justice, to lead nature-based solutions and avoid corporate traps in building a resilient future. Dr. S. M. Munjurul Hannan Khan, executive director of NACOM, presided over the event. One of the findings of the report, \"Equity and Justice in Climate Finance: Climate Debt Trap Risks for Bangladesh and Other LDCs\" says that LDCs are disproportionately reliant on loans rather than grants for climate action, despite contributing minimally to global emissions."]}]
