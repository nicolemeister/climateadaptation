According to news originating from Hiroshima, Japan, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Cities must prepare for future uncertainties associated with climate change and societal challenges. This study used the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model to simulate potential scenarios for Tehran metropolitan area.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Hiroshima University, \"We considered various scenarios for future development and their implications.The sustainable development scenario produced more balanced outcomes, including rangeland expansion and the preservation of cropland. In addition, using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, we quantified seven ecosystem services from 2017 to 2043, revealing temporal and spatial variations. Some scenarios showed significant declines in water yield, carbon storage, urban cooling, habitat quality, stormwater retention, flood mitigation, and recreation potential, particularly in southern areas. In contrast, sustainable development is a promising scenario, along with compact urban growth and nature conservation. Utilizing the Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method, we identified flood risk mitigation and stormwater management as critical ecosystem service priorities. Synergies emerged among heat mitigation, habitat quality, and water yield, while trade-offs were observed between recreation and others, such as carbon storage and habitat quality. Priority maps from fuzzy geospatial multicriteria analysis identified high-priority areas for ecosystem protection and restoration. The proposed integrated multi-scenario approach discovered the gap in regional, urban, and landscape planning, emphasizing the need for balanced priorities to minimize trade-offs and promote a sustainable urban future.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study helps to clarify the current situation and trends and promote nature-based solutions that help build urban resilience and prepare cities for future challenges.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Balancing priorities for a sustainable future in cities: Land use change and urban ecosystem service dynamics.

It has many aspects, including social sustainability and economic sustainability, in addition to environmental sustainability, all of which must be ensured.</p><p> The World Economic Forum has been underscoring the importance of this issue since 1973, when the \"limits to growth\" report was published. Humans cannot continue to exploit nature indefinitely, and economic growth in a way that imposes costs on future generations is unjust and unsustainable.</p><p> However, the risks related to sustainability have been underestimated in past policies related to politics, economics, and society. One reason is the optimism that was embedded in many people during the globalization that followed the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1989 that the world economy could expand indefinitely.</p><p> Policymakers are not always adept at integrating certain risks, like a pandemic, that are highly uncertain and have no great probability of occurring, but if it does occur, it will have serious consequences. The same is true of climate change risks, which have only recently been taken seriously, as many parts of the world are experiencing torrential rain and heat waves.</p><p> Many scientists have pointed out that if the temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution exceeds 1.5 C, the change will exceed a tipping point and become irreversible. Some estimates suggest that if the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is unstoppable, global sea level will rise by 7 meters. Since the average temperature has already risen by 1.2 C, there is little margin left for change, and the coming seven years until 2030 represents a crucial period. Without addressing the underlying issues of climate change, a sustainable society will not be realized.</p><p> Achieving a sustainable future will require transformative changes in the economy and society.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has temporarily reduced emissions, carbon dioxide levels are still at record highs -- and rising.</p><p> The past decade was the hottest on record. Arctic sea ice in October was the lowest ever and apocalyptic fires, floods, droughts and storms are increasingly the new normal. Biodiversity is collapsing, deserts are spreading, oceans are warming and choking with plastic waste. Science tells us that unless we cut fossil fuel production by 6 percent every year between now and 2030, things will get worse. Instead, the word is on track for a 2 percent annual rise.</p><p> Pandemic recovery gives us an unexpected yet vital opportunity to attack climate change, fix our global environment, re-engineer economies and re-imagine our future. Here is what we must do:</p><p> First, we need to build a truly global coalition for carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p> The European Union has committed to do so. The United Kingdom, Japan, the Republic of Korea and more than 110 countries have done the same. So, too, has the incoming U.S. administration. China has pledged to get there before 2060.</p><p> Every country, city, financial institution and company should adopt plans for net zero -- and act now to get on the right path to that goal, which means cutting global emissions by 45 percent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. In advance of next November's U.N. Climate Conference in Glasgow, governments are obligated by the Paris Agreement to be ever more ambitious every five years and submit strengthened commitments known as Nationally Determined Contributions, and these NDCs must show true ambition for carbon neutrality.</p><p> Technology is on our side. It costs more to simply run most of today's coal plants than it does to build new renewable plants from scratch. Economic analysis confirms the wisdom of this path. According to the International Labor Organization, despite inevitable job losses, the clean energy transition will create 18 million net new jobs by 2030. But we must recognize the human costs of decarbonization and support workers with social protection, re-skilling and up-skilling so that the transition is just.</p><p> Second, we need to align global finance with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, the world's blueprint for a better future.</p><p> It is time to put a price on carbon, end fossil fuel subsidies and finance, stop building new coal power plants, shift the tax burden from income to carbon, from taxpayers to polluters, make climate-related financial risk disclosures mandatory and integrate the goal of carbon neutrality into all economic and fiscal decision-making.</p><p> Banks must align their lending with the net zero objective and asset owners and managers must decarbonize their portfolios.</p><p> Third, we must secure a breakthrough on adaptation and resilience to help those already facing dire impacts of climate change.</p><p> That is not happening enough today. Adaptation represents only 20 percent of climate finance. This hinders our efforts to reduce disaster risk. It also is not smart. Every $1 invested in adaptation measures could yield almost $4 in benefits. Adaptation and resilience are especially urgent for small island developing states, for which climate change is an existential threat.</p><p> Next year gives us a wealth of opportunities to address our planetary emergencies, through major U.N. conferences and other efforts on biodiversity, oceans, transport, energy, cities and food systems. One of our best allies is nature itself. Nature-based solutions could provide one-third of the net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Indigenous knowledge can help to point the way. And as humankind devises strategies for preserving the environment and building a green economy, we need more women decision-makers at the table.</p><p> COVID and climate have brought us to a threshold. We cannot go back to the old normal of inequality and fragility. Instead, we must step toward a safer, more sustainable path. This is a complex policy test and an urgent moral test.
