These rivers begin their journey in the central highlands, where steep slopes and abundant rainfall make the region a natural watershed. Then, they descend through valleys and traverse fertile plains, distributing water across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taken for granted</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All 25 districts of Sri Lanka are traversed by rivers and perennial watercourses, their paths sculpted by the island's diverse topography. These waterways carve out distinct ecological zones, shaping patterns of land use, agriculture, and human settlement.</p><p>As they journey downward from the central highlands, rivers become the lifeblood of rural economies. They feed intricate irrigation networks that sustain rice paddies and other crops, power hydroelectric stations, supply drinking water, and support small-scale fisheries in downstream communities.</p><p>Eventually, these rivers reach the coast, nourishing estuaries and lagoons and linking inland populations to marine ecosystems. This transition-from upcountry to ocean-is more than a geographic shift; it forms an integrated economic corridor, connecting rain-fed agriculture in the highlands to coastal livelihoods, trade, and biodiversity.</p><p>Yet, because these rivers have always been part of our landscape, we often overlook their significance. Familiarity breeds invisibility. We've grown accustomed to their presence-taking for granted the vital role they play in our economy, our ecosystems, and our everyday lives.</p><p>More than geography</p><p>Sri Lanka's rivers are far more than geographic features-they are dynamic economic arteries that shape livelihoods, ecosystems, and development across the island. Originating in the central highlands, their descent from mountain to sea nourishes diverse landscapes and sustains communities along every stretch.</p><p>In the uplands, fast-flowing rivers drive Sri Lanka's renewable energy grid, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Rain-fed slopes, enriched by river-fed microclimates, support the globally renowned tea industry and highland agriculture. Forested upper catchments regulate water flow, minimise erosion, recharge aquifers, and balance carbon cycles-delivering invisible yet indispensable ecosystem services.</p><p>As rivers flow through midland regions, they become vital sources of domestic and industrial water. Expansive irrigation systems in the North Central, Eastern, and Southern provinces rely on these flows to power rice cultivation and food production. Midstream stretches also support fisheries, livestock grazing, and seasonal farming-key pillars of rural income diversification.</p><p>At the coastal interface, rivers feed estuaries and brackish lagoons, sustaining mangrove ecosystems and ocean-linked livelihoods. Their flow regulates salinity intrusion and mitigates coastal erosion-critical for the long-term resilience of coastal settlements and the growth of Sri Lanka's blue economy.</p><p>Together, these rivers bind upstream energy, midstream agriculture, and downstream ecology into a single, interconnected system. Their integrated management is not merely an environmental imperative-it is a strategic necessity for economic stability, climate adaptation, and inclusive rural development.</p><p>Downstream problem</p><p>The downstream problems of the rivers are a common one: Upstream river users can significantly affect downstream communities and activities economically, environmentally, and socially, often without direct accountability. It usually happens due to the activities of the upstream users.</p><p>The activities performed by the upstream users can limit the consistent and clean water flows to the downstream users throughout the year. Agricultural runoffs due to agrochemical usage or the industrial effluents due to industrial activities in the upstream areas can cause water contamination for the downstream users affecting their lives and economic activities.</p><p>Poor land use patterns, haphazard constructions, encroachment activities and deforestation in upper catchment areas increase soil erosion leading to sedimentation downstream and in water reservoirs. These activities may cause erratic rain patterns, earth slips, flash floods and climate change as well as disruptions to economic activities including hydropower generation.</p><p>Accordingly, it is quite possible that the activities of the upstream users - individuals or businesses or government agencies - can harm the biological diversity and disrupt ecological balance, affecting the downstream users. The negative impact can be felt by the economic activities and livelihoods tied to mangroves, lagoons, and brackish water fisheries as well as at macro level by the whole nation.</p><p>Market-based solution</p><p>The question now is how to address this issue: Although laws and regulations can be implemented, such interventions cannot go too far due to the complexity of the problem.</p><p>The downstream problem is a result of activities performed collectively by the upstream users. Due to the accountability issue, it is extremely difficult to identify who had done what and how much. The same issue makes that the use of rules and regulations and their implementation would be a complex and costly affair.</p><p>Although the problem is clear, the world has so far been ignoring the issue and continuing with business as usual. Nevertheless, now the people who have faced with detrimental consequences of environmental issues globally have been responsive and finding solutions.</p><p>The global issues of environmental pollution, biodiversity losses and climate change have also been getting aggravated. Against this background, some countries have adopted innovative market-based instruments to handle the types of issues as in our opening story.</p><p>Price of ecosystems?</p><p>The newest market-based instruments are called Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). Before everything else, we must understand the concept of 'ecosystem services' which are the nature's way of supporting life on earth, human well-being and human activities including economic progress.</p><p>We have taken the nature's services for granted without any economic value attributed to them. The earth is filled with such services as pollination of crops, water purification, climate regulation, soil nutrient cycling, balancing carbon emission, and disease regulation - all are part of the ecosystem services.</p><p>Accordingly, we need rivers, forests, and other elements of topography and geography which form the sources of the planet's ecosystems. If such ecosystem services are gradually getting destroyed by human activities, and if the established legal systems are not capable of protecting and promoting them, then the market has a solution.</p><p>Let's take our unique case of rivers flowing from the hilly centre of the country towards the plains and the sea. Downstream users have a case for getting uncontaminated clean water consistently throughout the year, while the upstream dwellers have the ability to ensure it. Accordingly, there is space for exchange of ecosystem services between the two parties at a price, which is called the PES.</p><p>Costa Rica case study</p><p>Among many international case studies available today, the National PES scheme in Costa Rica launched in the 1990s is a widely cited success story in environmental economics. Its focus has been on forest conservation in critical watersheds.</p><p>The impact of this PES scheme in Costa Rica has been the conservation of forest area covering over 500,000 acres, resulting in improved water quality and reduced sedimentation benefitting the downstream users in particular, and the national economy in general.</p><p>How did Costa Rica manage to do so? The private owners of the forest area were prevented in undertaking any activities that affect negatively the ecosystem services on the one hand, but carried out such activities that would promote the ecosystem services in the forest areas.</p><p>The forest owners entered into long-term contracts with the government. The government paid for the forest owners by imposing a user fee for water and utilising donor funds, while carrying out a monitoring and evaluation process to ensure the long-term success of the project.</p><p>Similar case studies on the implementation of PES schemes could be found in African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, in South American countries such as Mexico and Colombia in addition to Costa Rica, and in Asian countries such as Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and South Korea.</p><p>Some other Asian countries have shown emerging readiness for PES implementation: These countries include, Mongolia, Thailand, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Brunei and Singapore.</p><p>Relevant for Sri Lanka?</p><p>Sri Lanka's ecologically sensitive landscapes-ranging from watersheds and forests to coastal zones and human-wildlife interfaces-make PES highly relevant. As a market-based tool, PES aligns with national goals for green growth, climate adaptation, and inclusive development, especially amid fiscal constraints.</p><p>However, despite years of research, PES remains largely unimplemented. Establishing a functional PES market requires robust regulatory and institutional frameworks-currently absent in Sri Lanka. Moreover, weak governance poses a significant barrier, potentially undermining transparency, accountability, and long-term viability.</p><p>(The writer is Emeritus Professor at the University of Colombo and Executive Director of the Centre for Poverty Analysis (CEPA) and can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sirimal@econ.cmb.ac.lk\">sirimal@econ.cmb.ac.lk</email> and follow on Twitter @SirimalAshoka).</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Their flow regulates salinity intrusion and mitigates coastal erosion-critical for the long-term resilience of coastal settlements and the growth of Sri Lanka's blue economy.

Beyond extreme weather events and other direct losses and damages, climate change also has a variety of cascading long-term consequences that affect livelihoods, economies, ecosystems, culture, health, and human lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, while many climate impacts happen at the local level, local actors often don't have the resources or capacities to adequately respond to them. They require means of implementation-finance, technology, and capacity-building-that is commensurate to their challenges and aligned with principles of equity, fairness, and common but differentiated responsibilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What needs to be funded?</p><p>Quantifying exact numbers for loss and damage-particularly for non-economic and/or indirect losses-can be challenging, but the general needs on the ground are clear.</p><p>Local actors, such as farmer cooperatives, community associations, municipal councils, civil society organisations, or women's groups, are aware of their challenges and possible actions to address them. For example, this could entail investment into disaster-resilient infrastructure, new crop varieties, restoration of tanks and traditional water management systems, or seed funding for climate-friendly entrepreneurs.</p><p>However, these actors are often unable to access the necessary resources to develop or implement such interventions, which is further compound by gaps in data, risk and vulnerability assessments, available technology, and other factors. Due to their lack of technical capacity for proposal development, fiduciary management and monitoring, as well as requirements to co-finance projects or absorb upfront costs, local actors are not in a position to effectively tap into climate funding, especially from multilateral funds and entities.</p><p>From this, a first takeaway emerges: To effectively reach the ground level, means of implementation for climate adaptation and responses to loss and damage should support the full project cycle, from capacity-building on risk appraisal and project design to streamlined access modalities and sustained operational funding.</p><p>Where does global funding come from?</p><p>Addressing the full spectrum of risks requires funding that is as multifaceted as the impacts themselves. Compensation for economic losses must be coupled with investments in social protection, mental health support, and ecosystem conservation. Non-economic losses, such as the erosion of cultural identity and community networks, need financing for participatory mapping, the establishment of dialogue platforms, and preservation of traditional knowledge or practices. Without resources calibrated to local contexts, efforts of resilience-building run the risk of overlooking root causes of vulnerability and perpetuating inequitable outcomes.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, Articles 9 to 11 enshrine finance, technology transfer, and capacity building as means of implementation. Funding sources for climate action at the global level include the operating entities of the financial mechanisms under the UNFCCC: the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD). Furthermore, there are also other climate funds-the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund-as well as multilateral development banks and international financial institutions.</p><p>A second takeaway: There is no universal one-size-fits-all solution for funding, as local impacts and needs-as well as the existing structures for access and implementation-vary greatly. However, there are lessons to be learned from the operation of existing funds and their attempts to make finance more accessible, such as through the GEF's direct access entities or the Adaptation Fund's direct access modalities.</p><p>What are the key challenges to overcome?</p><p>Making direct access available and building capacities of local actors to actually utilise is a complex task that includes development of a local ecosystem for adaptation, risk management, and resilience-building. Central to unlocking finance for local actors is the expansion of direct and enhanced direct access modalities without lengthy accreditation processes and requirements for technical expertise and upfront investment that exceed what local actors can deliver.</p><p>Building local capacity is indispensable and encompasses not only technical skills in project appraisal, financial management, and monitoring, evaluation, and learning, but also institutional strengthening through governance frameworks, participatory decision-making bodies, and robust accountability mechanisms. Investing in regional project preparation facilities, automatic 'kick-start' funds for accredited entities, and standardised accounting packages can further lower these barriers while layered or tiered structures can decentralise decision-making while ensuring fiduciary compliance.</p><p>Equally important is harmonising global funding with national systems and priorities. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and other policy documents provide strategic roadmaps for climate action. Embedding local access windows within these instruments-through dedicated budget lines, policy targets, and reporting indicators-can align subnational investments with broader adaptation goals.</p><p>The third takeaway: For access modalities to be truly inclusive, equitable, and transparent, they should be developed through participatory multi-stakeholder processes to ensure that the voices of frontline communities and vulnerable groups, as well as those of local actors in general, are taken into account.</p><p>How can we move forward?</p><p>Several pivotal entry points in 2025 and beyond offer opportunities to recalibrate climate finance further towards the local level. This includes the FRLD, which is now becoming operational, with a first application window-known as the Barbados Implementation Modalities-opening soon. This first window could serve as a testing ground for local and community-driven grants supported by participatory monitoring and evaluation systems to build an evidence base for scaling up and learn from experience.</p><p>Another entry point is presented by the Global Goal on Adaptation and the issue of means of implementation, which is currently being discussed in connection with the development of indicators to measure progress towards global adaptation targets. When defining indicators on scale, quality, and access to finance, considerations related to local access (for example, the proportion of adaptation funds reaching subnational entities or the rate of project approval for direct access proposals) could help to further highlight this question.</p><p>In addition to loss and damage and adaptation, finance is itself a central agenda item in the UNFCCC and very relevant to this question. Besides the formal negotiations, this also includes the Baku-to-Belem Roadmap to USD 1.3 trillion, which aims to find a way forward to scale up climate finance in line with the new collective quantified goal (NCQG). In this process, local access as well as local investment plans could play an important role and help to shift from centralised, project-centric financing to decentralised, program-based approaches underpinned by participatory governance.</p><p>Designing global climate funds to reach effectively the ground is not merely a financing challenge, but a test of political will, momentum, and solidarity. With strategic entry points in 2025 and beyond, the international community can ensure that those at the frontlines of climate change are not left alone, waiting for support. For developing countries, the dividends of enhanced access are clear. Investments in local actors do more than protect assets and help to nurture social cohesion, preserve cultural heritage, and foster the adaptive capacities that underpin long-term sustainable development and prosperity.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["However, these actors are often unable to access the necessary resources to develop or implement such interventions, which is further compound by gaps in data, risk and vulnerability assessments, available technology, and other factors.

To fully harness this potential, Sri Lanka must promote sectors such as high-value apparel, electronics assembly, pharmaceuticals, shipping, tourism and logistics services and BPO services.</p><p>Opportunity</p><p>However, policy consistency, improvements in port and energy infrastructure, and a stable business environment will be crucial. Additionally, Sri Lanka's potential role in the India-Middle East Economic Corridor could further enhance its strategic and economic significance. In parallel, Sri Lanka must develop a transparent, efficient, and environmentally responsible regulatory framework for its emerging critical minerals sector. Aligning exploration and extraction activities with international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards is essential.

A bilateral investment treaty could provide much-needed reassurance for potential German investors.</p><p>Development cooperation and peacebuilding</p><p>Germany has long been one of the most generous bilateral donors to Sri Lanka, offering both technical assistance and financial aid. What sets Germany apart is its focus on sustainability,</p><p>capacity building, and social inclusion. German support has played a significant role in promoting vocational education, decentralisation, and the strengthening of health systems. In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's civil war, German aid shifted toward supporting reconciliation, psychosocial care, and civil society engagement.</p><p>German foundations such as Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES), Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), and Heinrich B\u00f6ll Stiftung (HBS) have been actively involved in promoting human rights, democratic governance, and inter-ethnic dialogue. Given Germany's growing emphasis on a feminist foreign policy, there is further potential for collaboration on gender equality, women's empowerment, and peace building-areas that are critical for Sri Lanka's long-term stability.</p><p>The diaspora as a cultural bridge</p><p>The Sri Lankan diaspora in Germany, though relatively small (estimated at around 60,000), plays a unique role in strengthening people-to-people ties. Comprising professionals, students, artists, and second-generation youth, the diaspora contributes not only to Germany's economy but also to its multicultural identity. Sri Lankan temples, cultural associations, and Tamil language schools are visible across cities like Berlin, Hamburg, and Frankfurt. In recent years, diaspora-led initiatives in entrepreneurship, humanitarian aid, and academic exchange have helped bridge the gap between the two societies, offering a bottom-up approach to diplomacy.</p><p>There is also a growing number of Sri Lankan students pursuing higher education in Germany, attracted by its tuition-free universities, world-class research facilities, and inclusive visa policies. Many return to Sri Lanka with advanced skills, while others contribute to the German workforce. Encouraging more bilateral academic exchanges and research collaborations could amplify this brain circulation.</p><p>Climate, sustainability, and shared priorities</p><p>As the world grapples with climate change, Germany and Sri Lanka share common interests in climate resilience, biodiversity protection, and sustainable development. Germany's expertise in renewable energy and environmental policy could greatly support Sri Lanka's transition to a greener economy. Joint research on climate adaptation, sustainable agriculture, and disaster management would benefit both nations. Furthermore, Germany's leadership in global climate diplomacy aligns well with Sri Lanka's vulnerability to climate shocks. A focused bilateral agenda on environmental cooperation could enhance the relevance of the Germany-Sri Lanka relationship within global climate negotiations.</p><p>Looking ahead: A strategic reimagining</p><p>The upcoming visit of Sri Lanka's president to Germany on 10 June presents a timely opportunity to elevate the Germany-Sri Lanka partnership. This visit should not only celebrate the longstanding friendship but also address the relationship in a wider strategic context. While Sri Lanka has recently focused much of its foreign policy attention on neighbouring giants like China and India, it is crucial not to overlook the mutual benefits that a strong partnership with Germany-and the broader European Union-can bring. Germany's economic strength, technological expertise, and commitment to sustainable development offer avenues for Sri Lanka to diversify its international partnerships and reduce over-dependence on a few large powers.</p><p>At the same time, Germany stands to gain from closer ties with Sri Lanka in areas such as trade, renewable energy, tourism, education, and regional stability in the Indian Ocean. The president's visit could thus serve as a catalyst for forging new agreements, expanding trade relations, and deepening cooperation on security, digital innovation, and climate action. For the partnership to truly flourish, both countries need to envision a comprehensive bilateral framework that goes beyond aid and trade. This includes enhanced diplomatic engagement, cultural exchange, and people-to-people connectivity, supported by active involvement from the diaspora and academic communities.</p><p>The upcoming visit of Sri Lanka's president to Germany on 10 June presents a timely opportunity to elevate the Germany-Sri Lanka partnership.

Although my first visit, I am no stranger to Sri Lankan hospitality, thanks to the Sri Lankan diaspora community in the United Kingdom. Their remarkable contributions to British public life exemplify the deep, people-to-people connections that form the foundations of our modern partnership, alongside our cultural, economic links.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UK remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka's reform agenda, particularly the Government's commitment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, which is crucial for long-term economic stability. I am pleased that the UK is supporting by providing technical assistance to Sri Lanka's Inland Revenue Department to support them increase collection of vital revenue and supporting debt restructuring as a member of Sri Lanka's Official Creditor Committee. Working together on eradicating corruption to widening educational access, successful reform will deliver economic growth - the single most important thing we can do to improve living standards.</p><p>Both our Governments are united in our commitment to driving this inclusive economic growth for both our nations. Trade is central to this mission, with UK-Sri Lanka trade amounting to \u00a3 1.4 billion in 2023. It is our responsibility as Governments to support and improve the trading environment to allow businesses to thrive.</p><p>That is why I was delighted to welcome new trading initiatives on my visit. This includes launching new export procedure handbooks, helping Sri Lankan businesses better access the UK market through the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS). The UK is keen to improve utilisation of the DCTS scheme to further support Sri Lankan exporters and ensure important foreign exchange earnings.</p><p>The UK has ambitions to widen opportunities under DCTS with forward-looking initiatives such as the UK-funded SheTrades program which aims to increase the participation of women in trade by promoting opportunities for women-led businesses in Sri Lanka and supporting Sri Lanka's Export Development Board (EDB) to promote inclusive trade policies and data.</p><p>Our relationship goes beyond our economic ties - the questions that most often come up in the British Parliament are about the legacy of the civil war. During my time in Sri Lanka, I discussed these issues with civil society groups, political leaders in the North and with the new Government. I welcome what the new Government and other groups said on these issues. This is another area where I look forward to working with Sri Lanka.</p><p>Education represents an important cornerstone of our partnership; and to building a fairer more united further for communities. Sri Lanka stands as the UK's second-largest Transnational Education market, with 45 British universities offering degree programs to approximately 50,000 Sri Lankan students. I met with The British Council to explore how we can further strengthen this pillar of our partnership. This educational cooperation not only builds bridges between our nations but also helps develop the skills needed for tomorrow's economy.</p><p>The UK is also at the forefront of addressing global challenges, particularly climate change. On my visit to Jaffna, I saw the only UK government-funded climate adaptation project which directly addresses groundwater depletion and its impact on agriculture and local communities. Groundwater, an essential resource for agriculture, livelihoods, and daily life, is facing growing threats.</p><p>In addition to our climate adaptation projects, the UK has also funded the World Bank's Offshore Wind Roadmap for Sri Lanka, demonstrating our dedication to supporting renewable energy initiatives and the transition to net zero emissions.

Sri Lanka remains highly climate vulnerable and green growth should be a central feature of its economic recovery.</p><p>The Indo-Pacific region, with Sri Lanka at its crossroads, is the engine of global economic growth in the coming decades. As island nations dependent on maritime trade, both our countries understand the importance of maintaining a rules-based international order and ensuring maritime security.</p><p>Following this first official ministerial meeting of our two new governments I am optimistic about what we can achieve together. Whether it's expanding trade under the DCTS, collaborating on climate action, or strengthening educational partnerships, the potential for growth in our relationship is immense. President Dissanayake's Government has set out an ambitious agenda for reform and renewal, and the UK stands ready to support Sri Lanka on this journey.

Accordingly, issuers can now raise funds in the Capital Market by way of issuing Green, Blue, Social and Sustainability Linked (identified as GSS+) Bonds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Regulatory Framework for Green Bonds was published in April 2023 and subsequently was extended to include Blue Bonds. With the recent SEC approval, now issuers have the option of focusing on two additional products; Social and Sustainability Linked Bonds. Whilst Green, Blue and Social Bonds provide issuers (Sovereigns and Corporates) the impetus for directing issue proceeds towards eligible Projects that will generate positive environment and social outcomes, Sustainable Linked Bonds identified as a 'filler' in the ESG space provides businesses and investors more options for financing and investing in sustainability initiatives.</p><p>In response to the calls for action on climate change stemming from global agreements such as the Paris treaty, Sri Lanka is committed to achieve carbon neutrality by year 2050. In the journey of transitioning to a low carbon economy and a cleaner Sri Lanka through the development of the ESG pillars, the Government of Sri Lanka and environmentally and socially responsible corporates could make great use of innovative sustainable financing tools such as GSS + bonds introduced at the CSE.</p><p>Putting your money where your values are: GSS+ products explained</p><p>GSS+ refers to a category of financial products designed to fund projects with positive environmental and social impacts. The following are types of sustainable bond products within the GSS+ framework.</p><p>1. Green Bonds</p><p>Green Bonds are innovative financial instruments where the proceeds are invested exclusively (either by specifying the use of the proceeds, direct project exposure, or securitisation) in eligible green projects that generate climate or other environmental benefits such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable waste management, sustainable land use (forestry and agriculture), biodiversity, clean transportation and clean water. Their structure, risk and returns are otherwise identical to those of traditional bonds. They are no different from conventional bonds where their structure, risk and return are identical to traditional bonds with the only difference being the specification that the proceeds be invested in projects that generate environmental benefits.</p><p>2. Blue Bonds</p><p>Blue Bonds are a subset of Green Bonds, where the funds raised are used to finance the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems, particularly in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development).</p><p>Possible broad project categories include:</p><p>Sustainable blue economic activities that restore, protect and maintain diversity, productivity, resilience, core functions, value and health of marine ecosystems.</p><p>Provide sustained livelihood opportunities and strengthen livelihoods and communities dependent on the marine ecosystems.</p><p>Investments which strengthen, restore and conserve the blue natural capital for climate mitigation and climate adaptation.</p><p>Investments that address coastal resilience and coastal and marine climate adaptation challenges.</p><p>Activities and projects that reduce stressors to marine ecosystems, such as sources of pollution which can be from industry, agriculture, retail sector etc.</p><p>Infrastructure that is using nature-based solutions in the marine and coastal space and.</p><p>Activities that strengthen coastal and marine governance, science and technology for the benefit of ecosystems.</p><p>3. Social Bonds</p><p>Similar to a Green Bond, a Social Bond is a fixed income instrument where the proceeds are focused on activities with predominantly positive social outcomes. Accordingly, Social Bonds mobilise funds to finance or refinance in part or in full new and/or existing eligible social projects. Some examples of eligible social projects include ; affordable basic infrastructure (e.g. clean drinking water, sewers, sanitation, transport, energy), access to essential services (e.g. health, education and vocational training, healthcare, financing and financial services), affordable housing, employment generation and programs designed to prevent and/or alleviate unemployment stemming from socioeconomic crises, climate transition projects and/or other considerations for a 'just transition' (such provision and/or promotion could include SME financing and microfinance), food security and sustainable food systems (e.g. physical, social, and economic access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food that meets dietary needs and requirements, resilient agricultural practices; reduction of food loss and waste, and improved productivity of small-scale producers).</p><p>4. Sustainability linked bonds</p><p>Sustainability Linked Bonds differ from the other types of GSS+ Bonds in that their proceeds are not used to finance specific projects but are instead made available for general corporate purposes, with the issuer contractually undertaking to achieve predefined, measurable sustainability targets or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). As a rule, failure to achieve these targets results in penalty payments to investors attributes to an increased coupon. The opposite is sometimes true, i.e. the coupon or payment to investors is reduced if the KPI targets are met. In both cases, sustainability-linked bonds are intended to provide the issuer with a financial incentive to achieve the sustainability targets it has set within the agreed time frame.</p><p>An example of a recently issued Sustainability Linked Bond is by Coca-Cola I\u00e7ecek (CCI), which successfully launched the largest Sustainability-linked bond in Trkiye to date, with an issue size of USD 500 million. Under the terms of the bond, CCI has committed to improving its water efficiency by 13% by 2027 and 17% by 2029, aligning its financial strategy with its broader environmental sustainability goals by the time the bond reaches maturity.</p><p>In addition to the aforesaid main categories, issuers also have the option of combining both Green and Social elements and issuing a Sustainability Bond where proceeds are utilised to finance or re-finance a combination of both Green and Social Projects.</p><p>From millions to trillions: The explosive growth of Sustainable Bonds</p><p>As per World Bank data, the market expanded remarkably from just $140 billion pre-2016 to a peak of $1,239 billion in 2021, representing nearly 9x growth over this period.</p><p>After explosive growth culminating in 2021, the market experienced a moderate contraction in 2022 (to $1,020 billion) followed by slight recovery in 2023 ($1,073 billion) and 2024 ($1,125 billion).</p><p>Moreover, when it comes to product diversification, while the Green Bonds dominated the early market, there was a significant diversification with Social Bonds emerging more prominently around 2019-2020, sustainability-Linked Bonds appearing around 2020 and solidifying their presence and Transition bonds representing the smallest segment with minimal visibility.</p><p>The period between 2019-2021 marked the most dramatic growth (from $389B to $1,239B), likely influenced by the pandemic which heightened focus on both social welfare and green recovery initiatives.</p><p>However, despite the diversification, Green Bonds consistently represent the largest segment by volume throughout the entire period between pre 2016, 2016 -2024, underlining their foundational role in the sustainable finance market.</p><p>Moreover, Sustainable Bond issuances for the year 2024 reached USD 1.1 trillion which is a 5% increase from the amount recorded for 2023. Further, the cumulative amount of Green, Social, Sustainability, Sustainability-Linked, and Transition (labeled sustainable) Bonds issued in the market amounted to USD 6.2 trillion as at the end of December 2024.</p><p>Additionally, advanced markets demonstrate both greater volume and diversity in sustainable finance instruments, while Emerging Markets and Supranational issuers contribute relatively equal shares but with different compositions.</p><p>The above facts denote the maturing of the sustainable finance market, with initial explosive growth, giving way to a more stable but still substantial market with diversified product offerings across the GSS+ spectrum.</p><p>Unlocking value: The advantages of GSS+ Bond issuance and investment</p><p>These bonds offer issuers a pathway to diversify funding sources, enhance their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) profiles, and attract a broader investor base. For investors, GSS+ bonds present opportunities to achieve competitive financial returns while contributing to impactful projects that address global challenges. As the market for these bonds continues to expand, understanding their advantages is crucial for both issuers and investors aiming to make informed and responsible financial decisions.</p><p>Benefits to issuers</p><p>1.

Provided however, in the case of a Commercial Bank, Specialised Bank or Financial Institution licensed/regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka seeking to issue GSS+ Bonds, such Entity shall additionally adhere to the Green Finance Taxonomy, or any related Taxonomy (as applicable) issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Further, it is required that the Entity seeking to issue GSS+ Bond/s appoint an Independent External Reviewer to provide prior to the issue, an external review in the form of one of the following:1) Consultant's Review/ Second Party Opinion, 2) verification or 3) a Green Bond Rating (separate from an issuer's overall ESG rating). Further, post issuance, the external reviewer is to attest on the entity's compliance with the applicable ICMA Principles and Guidelines and the Green Finance Taxonomy issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as applicable on a periodic basis and confirm the effective utilisation of proceeds. The Rules include stringent enforcement criteria to deter and remedy any non-compliance by the issuer.</p><p>Sri Lanka's emerging GSS+ Bond landscape: Key milestones and market interest</p><p>Sri Lanka's first Green Bond was issued by the DFCC Bank in September 2024 for a total value of LKR 2.5 billion at a coupon of 12%. This issue was oversubscribed. In December 2024, the DFCC went on to obtain a dual listing for its Green Bond at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE). Further, Alliance Finance Company PLC, a Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) issued LKR 1 billion of Green Bonds in February 2025 at a coupon of 10.75%, which was also oversubscribed.

Some of the most intense battles against the environment are waged by the smallest of creatures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When it's cold, we, as warm-blooded (endothermic), animals simply put on a coat. Other endotherms, can be large, fat or furry to insulate their body from the cold.</p><p>Generating your own body heat, however, requires a lot of energy. Insects do not do not do this. The heat they need for metabolism and growth comes from the environment. This is partly how they are so abundant around the world. They need less energy to grow compared with warm-blooded animals like mammals and are great at exploiting this advantage.</p><p>Not being able to generate your own body heat is a problem for insects in cold places. They are at the mercy of the environmental temperature and can only grow, develop and feed when it is warm enough. Typically this optimum temperature is around 20 C.</p><p>Yet some insects survive when temperatures drop below freezing. Generally, when the temperature goes below 0 C this causes damage to animal cells and even death. This cell damage is what causes frostbite.</p><p>Many insects use one of two simple strategies. Freeze tolerance or freeze avoidance.</p><p>For example, they produce cryoprotectants, such as glycerol, which lower their freezing point. This allows the animal to undergo supercooling without freezing. Some generate antifreeze proteins that stop ice crystals from forming in their tissue.</p><p>Mites are common in the Antarctic - there are hundreds of species. Some even live in the nasal cavities of penguins. Penguin noses provide not only a source of food for the mites that feed on the penguins' dead skin cells, but also a warm environment.</p><p>However, some Antarctic mites, which don't rely on a host, such as Halozetes belgicae, are freeze-avoiding, using antifreeze compounds to lower the freezing point of their body to well below 0 C.</p><p>One of the smallest land animals in Antarctica are the springtails, related to primitive insects but lacking some of the features we see in modern insects. For example, their mouthparts are internal whereas insects have external mouthparts. One springtail, Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, can reach a temperature of -38 C before it freezes. It is a small species of only 1-2 millimetres in length but important for the Antarctic soil ecosystem, fulfilling an important function as a decomposer of organic matter.</p><p>The midge species Belgica Antarctica, however, is the only true insect found in Antarctica. It endures many periods of sub-zero temperatures throughout its life and has some unique strategies to deal with the hostile Antarctic climate. This species takes two years to reach adulthood - which in insect time is quite the long while. Some insects such as aphids have multiple generations in a year.</p><p>Belgica Antarctica can tolerate ice crystals forming in its body by minimising the damage they do to tissue. It can also lose water from its body through a semi-permeable outer membrane, removing molecules that could form into ice crystals.</p><p>Perhaps among the most dominant animals in the Antarctic, and indeed anywhere on the planet, are the nematodes. This is a small worm-like animal, that lives in and on top of the soil. Some species like Panagrolaimus davidi can tolerate their body cells freezing. They can also undergo a dormant state called diapause by dehydrating themselves (cryptobiosis), which prevents ice crystals forming in their cells.</p><p>Another group that uses this method for dealing with the cold Antarctic climate are the tardigrades (also known as water bears). Freezing can extend the life of this animal. In fact, one tardigrade species known as Acutuncus antarcticus was frozen at -20 C and defrosted 30 years later with no ill effects.</p><p>Invertebrates, make up an enormous proportion of all life on earth.

'Solidaridad had looked at many opportunities for smallholders to enter carbon markets. We explored many different options for smallholders and in 2021, we found an interesting initiative called Acorn,' he told The Sunday Times Business in an interview recently.</p><p>This mechanism was able to connect the right proposition or solution towards smallholder farmers. 'It's normally exceedingly difficult to aggregate and to connect many different smallholder farmers, such as reaching them and combining them into one bigger project. One of the areas this initiative has provided is an efficient way of certifying and connecting farmers with remote sensing-based technologies.' The carbon can be measured by remote sensing-based approaches rather than going inside a farm and measuring individual trees. Based on Solidaridad's existing work with farmers, there is an opportunity for connecting smallholder farmers to first invest in cleaner production or more resilient, better production that helps farmers build their climate adaptation,' Mr Merger said.</p><p>There is a way to connect them to markets and to use the carbon money, the carbon markets as a way to find the transition towards climate resilience and climate adaptation.

We obviously would like to achieve more which is one of the reasons why we're here to explore opportunities for smallholder farmers sector in Sri Lanka,' Mr. Merger explained.</p><p>He noted that one of the promising solutions for the smallholder farmers sector across the world is the technology that's practiced called agroforestry which integrates trees into say a tea production system or a coffee production system. 'In agroforestry, trees have positive features. They can improve soil health, and they can increase and improve shade coverage, which is important and relevant for better yield. We're focusing on this kind of carbon market programmes agroforestry, but there were other different mechanisms and practices such as bio charts, and other soil management practices.'</p><p>The major innovation in agroforestry is that you combine not only one production system but increase and diversify production. When integrating fruit trees, for example, they can be an additional source of food - not only the cash crop, such as black tea. Also fruits can be integrated. Depending on the tree species that were invented farmers can minimise and reduce the risks and at the same time improve the resilience of the production system, Mr. Merger explained further.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["One of the areas this initiative has provided is an efficient way of certifying and connecting farmers with remote sensing-based technologies.

Two strong responses questioned why I had left out entrepreneurs such as David Pieris, Chairman of Sri Lanka's largest automotive company; the late Abbas Akbarally, Founder Chairman of Akbar Brothers, one of the world's largest tea companies based in Sri Lanka; the late Mikki Wickremesinghe, pioneering industrialist and social entrepreneur, the legend behind Munchee; Mahesh Amalean, Sri Lankan industrialist and Chairman of MAS Holdings; businessman Dhammika Perera, Founder and Chairman of DP Education; Ishara Nanayakkara, Sri Lankan entrepreneur and investor; and the late Rajamahendran, the visionary who redefined mobile telephony, media reporting, and energy delivery and Ranjit Page of Cargills, -each of whom has made significant contributions to Sri Lanka's economy. I'd like to address both of these comments.</p><p>Firstly, my article last week focused on entrepreneurs that I have had the privilege of working with closely at the Board level or professionally. Secondly, regarding the question of what Sri Lanka can do to create a pipeline of young entrepreneurs, I believe Sri Lanka certainly needs a program akin to Start Up India (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.startupindia.gov.in/\">https://www.startupindia.gov.in/</url>) to foster and support a new generation of entrepreneurs. Despite several governments attempting to create the necessary infrastructure, we have yet to successfully implement such a program.</p><p>The role of entrepreneurs in GDP growth</p><p>Sri Lanka post-crisis desperately needs entrepreneurs to create wealth and drive GDP growth. Entrepreneurs are catalysts for innovation, economic development, and job creation. They boost productivity, elevate living standards, and foster wealth generation.</p><p>Take India, for example: entrepreneurs there have been key drivers of economic transformation, establishing businesses that contribute significantly to GDP while reducing dependency on traditional industries. Similarly, in China, despite a state-dominated business environment, entrepreneurs have played a vital role in driving growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. Entrepreneurs contribute to GDP not only by producing goods and services but also by expanding underdeveloped sectors such as technology, tourism, and renewable energy.</p><p>Additionally, they attract both domestic and foreign investments, which further fuel economic expansion and wealth creation. New businesses also generate employment opportunities across various skill levels, reducing unemployment. Importantly, entrepreneurs create demand for a skilled workforce, prompting governments to invest in upskilling their populations. India's Skill India Initiative, for instance, has helped transform the country into one of the world's leading suppliers of a young, employable workforce-fundamentally altering the nation's economic landscape.</p><p>Start-up Sri Lanka</p><p>The Start-up Sri Lanka program was initially conceived to complement the Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative, aiming to cultivate an entrepreneurial culture. It sought to promote job creation, wealth generation, and the development of new industries. Key elements included:</p><p>Regulatory reforms.</p><p>Tax exemptions.</p><p>Intellectual property protection.</p><p>Incubators for public-private collaboration.</p><p>For such initiatives to succeed, Sri Lanka must simplify regulatory processes, offer financial incentives, and build support structures that nurture innovation. The success of similar programs worldwide illustrates their potential to drive economic growth.</p><p>However, to truly unlock entrepreneurial potential, Sri Lanka must adopt a holistic approach. This involves:</p><p>Effective policy-making.</p><p>Access to capital and supportive banking sector.</p><p>An ecosystem that supports creative and innovative solutions.</p><p>By fostering a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem, Sri Lanka can drive sustainable growth, unlock its economic potential, and create opportunities for future generations.</p><p>Renewable energy and climate adaptation</p><p>Another critical area where the Government must support entrepreneurs is in renewable energy, sustainable energy infrastructure, and climate adaptation projects. Globally, there are numerous examples of successful partnerships between governments and the private sector, working toward a shared vision of a better, more sustainable future for their people. Sri Lanka has the talent and resources to replicate these successes.</p><p>References:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Entrepreneurs-who-shaped-Sri-Lanka-s-biz-landscape/14-769795\">https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Entrepreneurs-who-shaped-Sri-Lanka-s-biz-landscape/14-769795</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/pn716s8Z16E?si=koVhjlQ7OhHfRC2z\">https://youtu.be/pn716s8Z16E?si=koVhjlQ7OhHfRC2z</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbs.edu/creating-emerging-markets/video-database/Pages/details.aspx?v=Akbarally+-+Government+and+Business\">https://www.hbs.edu/creating-emerging-markets/video-database/Pages/details.aspx?v=Akbarally+-+Government+and+Business</url></p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["An ecosystem that supports creative and innovative solutions.

The National Intelligence Assessment (NIA) on the 'National Security Implications of Global Climate Change to 2030,' produced by the National Intelligence Council (NIC), remains classified at the 'Confidential' level-the lowest tier of national security secrecy-raising questions about the rationale for its continued restriction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Security Archive, a nonprofit research institute advocating for transparency, has renewed its call for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to release the report. In 2022, the organization filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to obtain the document, followed by an official letter in December 2024. However, no response has been received.</p><p>A Longstanding Intelligence Focus on Climate Change</p><p>The Intelligence Community (IC) has monitored climate change for decades, but its focus on climate as a national security issue gained momentum in the early 1990s. Reports such as the 1990 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment and the 2003 Pentagon-commissioned study, 'An Abrupt Climate Scenario and Its Implications for U.S. National Security,' underscored climate change as a critical security concern.</p><p>By 2007, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) Military Advisory Board had coined the term 'Threat Multiplier' in its landmark report on climate and national security. This prompted growing bipartisan interest in Congress, leading to the commissioning of the 2008 NIA by the NIC. The report was expected to serve as a foundational intelligence product, informing policymakers on how climate change could exacerbate global instability.</p><p>Secrecy vs. Public Interest: The Debate Over Declassification</p><p>Despite the report's reliance on publicly available data, including the 2007 Fourth IPCC Assessment, the NIC has consistently maintained its classified status. Dr. Thomas Fingar, the lead author of the 2008 NIA and former Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis, testified before Congress in 2008, summarizing its key findings: climate change would exacerbate poverty, social tensions, and political instability worldwide, while also impacting U.S. economic and military interests.</p><p>During a December 2024 National Security Archive interview, Fingar defended the NIC's decision, arguing that declassification could trigger diplomatic and financial consequences. He explained that naming specific countries vulnerable to climate change might lead to premature requests for U.S. aid and 'cause embarrassment' to those nations. However, his position has been met with skepticism from transparency advocates and former intelligence officials.</p><p>Dr. Rod Schoonover, a former State Department intelligence official and current head of the Ecological Security Program at the Council on Strategic Risks, argues that the rationale for secrecy is weak. He pointed out that more recent intelligence reports-such as the 2021 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) released during the Biden administration-have already named vulnerable nations, including Afghanistan, Haiti, and North Korea.</p><p>'The 2008 report is far superior to the 2021 estimate in its depth and clarity,' Schoonover said in the December 2024 interview. He criticized the 2021 NIE for downplaying risks to the U.S., noting that warnings about domestic climate threats were 'buried on the last page' of the report.</p><p>A Pattern of Censorship in Climate Intelligence</p><p>The continued classification of the 2008 NIA is part of a broader pattern of resistance to transparency in climate intelligence. Under the Trump administration, Schoonover himself faced censorship when the White House attempted to block his 2019 Senate testimony on climate security. The administration refused to enter his written testimony into the Congressional Record, leading to his resignation.</p><p>The reluctance to declassify climate intelligence is not just a Trump-era phenomenon. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about intelligence agencies withholding critical information that could aid U.S. businesses, local governments, and policymakers in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p><p>Why Declassification Matters</p><p>The National Security Archive argues that releasing the 2008 NIA would provide crucial historical insight into how the U.S. Intelligence Community has assessed climate risks over time. This transparency is vital, especially as climate change accelerates and new geopolitical challenges emerge.</p><p>Furthermore, the classification status of 'Confidential' suggests that the report does not contain sensitive intelligence sources or methods, reinforcing arguments that its continued secrecy is unnecessary. Advocates believe declassification would help the public and policymakers better understand climate risks and national security strategies.</p><p>What Happens Next?</p><p>With no response to the 2022 FOIA request or the December 2024 letter, pressure is mounting on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to release the report. If declassification efforts fail, transparency advocates may pursue legal action to compel disclosure.</p><p>As climate change continues to reshape global security landscapes, the push for intelligence transparency grows more urgent. The fate of the 2008 National Intelligence Assessment remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the public deserves access to the information that shapes national security decisions affecting their future.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about intelligence agencies withholding critical information that could aid U.

As the newly elected Government finalised an IMF-backed debt restructuring deal agreed by the previous Government, a sustainable path out of the crisis with key creditors, including international sovereign bondholders (ISBs) who hold nearly 30% of the country's debt, seems unlikely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This unjust debt restructuring process underscored deeper systemic issues in global finance, including the lack of a sovereign bankruptcy mechanism and the unchecked power of private creditors. Without binding legal frameworks to ensure equitable debt resolution, debtor nations like Sri Lanka remain vulnerable to reckless lending practices, odious debts, and delays in restructuring processes that further harm their economies and people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge of negotiating with ISBs</p><p>ISBs represent a significant portion of Sri Lanka's debt burden and pose a unique challenge in the restructuring process. Unlike bilateral creditors or multilateral institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, ISBs are governed predominantly by New York or UK law, and there is no legal mechanism to compel private creditors to participate in debt restructuring negotiations. This absence of enforceable rules allows International Sovereign Bondholders to prioritise their financial interests, often to the detriment of the borrowing nation's economic recovery and public welfare.</p><p>Compounding the issue is the 'risk premium' that ISB investors receive-higher interest rates designed to compensate for the perceived risk of lending to countries like Sri Lanka. However, this premium has incentivised reckless lending practices, where creditors profit from high-risk loans without considering the long-term sustainability of the borrower's debt. When a country defaults, these same creditors can delay restructuring negotiations or demand disproportionate repayments, exacerbating economic instability and social hardship.</p><p>The consequences of an imbalanced system</p><p>The lack of a sovereign bankruptcy mechanism creates a profound power imbalance between debtor nations and their creditors. For countries like Sri Lanka, this imbalance manifests in several ways:</p><p>Prolonged negotiations: Without legal obligations to participate, private creditors can stall negotiations, delaying the resolution of debt crises. These delays exacerbate economic uncertainty, restrict access to international markets, and prolong the suffering of citizens.</p><p>Odious debts: Reckless lending practices often result in debts that are unsustainable or unjust, burdening nations with obligations that prioritise creditor profits over the needs of their people.</p><p>Limited resources for essential services: During restructuring, debtor nations must continue servicing their debts, diverting funds from critical areas such as healthcare, education, and climate resilience.</p><p>Economic and social damage: The uncertainty and austerity associated with protracted debt crises can lead to widespread economic stagnation, social unrest, and loss of trust in government institutions.</p><p>Legislative solutions for debt justice</p><p>Recognising these challenges, lawmakers in the UK and New York-two jurisdictions that govern most ISB contracts-are working to address the systemic flaws in sovereign debt resolution.

The country's default has revealed the predatory nature of international lending practices and the inadequacy of current frameworks to ensure equitable outcomes. For Sri Lanka, the immediate priority is to secure a sustainable debt restructuring agreement that alleviates the burden on its economy and people. However, achieving this goal requires more than just negotiations with creditors-it demands a global commitment to reforming the rules that govern sovereign debt.</p><p>The role of international advocacy</p><p>Organisations such as Debt Justice UK, alongside campaigners and lawmakers in the UK and New York, are playing a critical role in pushing for these reforms. Their efforts are aimed at creating a legal framework that prioritises the welfare of debtor nations and their citizens over the profit motives of private creditors. As Sri Lanka navigates its debt restructuring process, these advocacy efforts offer hope for a more just and sustainable resolution-not only for Sri Lanka but for all countries grappling with unsustainable debt.</p><p>The writer, co-founder of the Institute of Political Economy and a former local councillor in London, met with his local MP, Bambos Charalambous, at the UK Parliament to discuss the pressing challenges posed by Sri Lanka's debt crisis.

We must build on that success and push for renewed international action on debt relief, ensuring that savings from debt cancellation are redirected towards vital investments in health and education for low-income nations.'</p><p>The way forward</p><p>Sri Lanka's debt crisis underscores the urgent need for legislative reforms to address the inequities in sovereign debt resolution. Without mechanisms to enforce private creditor participation and ensure equitable restructuring, debtor nations remain trapped in a cycle of financial instability and social harm.

Thwaites, which is about the size of Florida, acts as a barrier holding back the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The glacier's height reaches nearly 4,000 feet above the bedrock, and it is seen as a critical factor in the future of sea-level rise. However, a warming ocean current is steadily undermining its foundations, accelerating its movement into the Amundsen Sea. This shift could eventually trigger the collapse of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would release enough water into the oceans to raise global sea levels by over 11 feet. Such a rise would flood coastlines, submerge cities, and displace millions of people living in low-lying areas.</p><p>The Ar\u00eate Glacier Initiative, founded by scientists from MIT and Dartmouth College, aims to better understand and address the risks posed by the Thwaites Glacier's instability. This initiative has raised $5 million in funding to focus on improving forecasts for sea-level rise and to explore ways of preventing the collapse of glaciers like Thwaites through a radical idea-refreezing glaciers in place. This intervention, known as basal intervention, involves techniques to freeze the water beneath the glacier to solidify its base, thus preventing further melting and the potential disintegration of the glacier.</p><p>The Thwaites Glacier is central to the initiative's research because of its significant role in sea-level rise. The glacier holds enough ice to raise sea levels by over two feet, which, while devastating, is just the beginning. If the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to collapse, the increase in sea levels could be as much as 11 feet, permanently altering coastlines and creating widespread destruction globally. This makes Thwaites a key focal point in the effort to prevent a global climate catastrophe.</p><p>Ar\u00eate was officially launched with the goal of providing clearer answers about the glacier's behavior, the timeline of its potential collapse, and whether any human intervention could stop it. The organization will announce its official launch, website, and open research proposals on March 21, coinciding with the UN's inaugural World Day for Glaciers, according to an exclusive report from MIT Technology Review. Alongside the launch, Ar\u00eate will issue its first round of grants, with each worth about $200,000 over two years, going to glacier researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This funding will support research into improving scientific understanding of how glaciers move, melt, and ultimately break apart, with an eye on refining predictions for sea-level rise.</p><p>One of the most ambitious goals of the Ar\u00eate Glacier Initiative is to study the potential for refreezing glaciers like Thwaites. This would involve large-scale, costly, and difficult engineering projects in a harsh, remote environment. The idea is to prevent the glacier from collapsing and thereby avoid a global crisis that would force millions of people to become climate refugees. The hope is that such a mega-adaptation project could minimize the displacement of populations and reduce the extreme social, political, and economic consequences that would accompany the loss of coastal cities. The ultimate aim would be to preserve trillions of dollars' worth of infrastructure, from homes to ports to airports.</p><p>Brent Minchew, an MIT professor of geophysics and a cofounder of Ar\u00eate, emphasizes the human cost of sea-level rise. He explains that, on average, a million people are displaced per centimeter of sea-level rise. Even small reductions in that number, by lowering sea levels by a few centimeters, could help safeguard millions of homes and people. While many scientists view these ideas skeptically due to the scale of the interventions and their uncertainty, the initiative believes such drastic actions may ultimately be necessary.</p><p>Despite the ambitious nature of the initiative, there are many who question the plausibility of such a large-scale intervention. Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, warns that the engineering challenges are immense. She cautions that humans tend to overestimate what engineering solutions can achieve and worries that attention may be diverted from other critical research into polar ice dynamics. There are also those who believe that such interventions could harm the delicate polar ecosystems or inadvertently make matters worse by adding contaminants or altering ice dynamics.</p><p>Beyond direct interventions, the Ar\u00eate Glacier Initiative aims to improve the accuracy of sea-level rise forecasts. Currently, estimates for the rise in sea levels this century range from as low as 0.28 meters (11 inches) to 1.10 meters (3.5 feet). However, some models suggest a small chance of a two-meter (about 6.5 feet) rise by 2100, which could displace as many as 190 million people. Understanding and refining these projections is critical for urban planning and disaster preparedness.</p><p>The initiative's immediate goal is to help narrow these forecast ranges by improving our understanding of glacier dynamics. One of the main challenges is understanding the forces that control glacier movement. Gravity drives glaciers along their bedrock, but friction between the ice and the underlying terrain plays a key role. Variables like sediment type, temperature, and ocean currents are still poorly understood but have significant impacts on glacier speed and the potential for ice loss.</p><p>Recent advancements in satellite technology and computational modeling are enabling scientists to study glaciers with unprecedented detail. New satellites can track the movement and shape changes of glaciers with higher resolution, while machine learning and improved computational resources are helping create more accurate models of how ice sheets behave. With better data, Ar\u00eate plans to improve forecasts of sea-level rise, helping cities make decisions about infrastructure like bridges, seawalls, and roads.</p><p>Ar\u00eate is also focused on collaborative data sharing. One of its first initiatives is to gather and openly publish existing observational data, much of which is currently locked behind high costs or institutional barriers. By increasing access to this data, Ar\u00eate hopes to facilitate better global collaboration and improve scientific models.</p><p>Among the more radical ideas being explored is the concept of basal intervention, which involves methods to freeze water beneath glaciers to prevent their slide into the ocean. This has a natural precedent in the form of the Kamb Ice Stream, a glacier in West Antarctica that stopped moving about 200 years ago after a water flow path was altered. This halted its slide by reducing friction and allowing water to refreeze, possibly providing a model for intervention.</p><p>Minchew suggests that long thermosyphons, a type of passive heat exchanger, could be used to draw heat away from the glacier's base and encourage refreezing. While the required project would be vast in scale (potentially requiring as many as 10,000 boreholes over 100 square kilometers), it might be feasible on a smaller scale compared to other global climate adaptation efforts like constructing massive seawalls.</p><p>The Ar\u00eate Glacier Initiative's work is still in its early stages, and much of the research remains highly speculative. Legal, ethical, and environmental questions abound, particularly regarding intervention in Antarctica, which is governed by international treaties. The technical hurdles of interventions, the cost, and the unknown outcomes remain significant challenges.</p><p>However, the idea of geoengineering polar glaciers is gaining traction, as the potential benefits of slowing or halting the collapse of Thwaites are immense. As Minchew puts it, 'One thing is challenging-and the other is even more challenging,' highlighting that, even with great unknowns, finding solutions to stop the Thwaites Glacier's collapse is critical. Inaction could lead to the necessity of even more drastic, global interventions in the future.</p><p>The Ar\u00eate Glacier Initiative, as reported by MIT Technology Review, is pushing forward with a mix of innovative forecasting, data-sharing, and speculative geoengineering solutions. By investigating radical ideas such as glacier refreezing, Ar\u00eate hopes to mitigate the devastating effects of sea-level rise and safeguard coastal communities. However, much of the science and engineering behind these solutions is still in its infancy, and the initiative faces both fierce skepticism and strong support in the race against time to save glaciers like Thwaites.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["This halted its slide by reducing friction and allowing water to refreeze, possibly providing a model for intervention.

To combat this effort to suppress and censor public data, the National Security Archive's Climate Change Transparency Project today ( Feb. 06) publishes a selection of materials on climate change and environmental justice that have been deleted from agency web pages and spotlights the environmental and archivist organizations working to identify, scrape, and preserve these critical data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During President Trump's first term, organizations like the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) documented the administration's widespread campaign to suppress climate and environmental data, like when it deleted all webpages, fact sheets, and emissions and financial incentives calculators related to President Obama's 2015 Clean Power Plan. Since the 2024 presidential election, EDGI and environmental advocacy organizations alike have anticipated the targeting of federal environmental and climate data and have been archiving datasets and preparing to rebuild public access to web tools.</p><p>So far, one of the most glaring deletions from the current administration has been the removal of the White House pages on the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), divisions within the Executive Office of the President that coordinate federal environmental and scientific efforts and work closely with federal agencies and other White House offices on environmental energy policies and initiatives.</p><p>During the Biden administration, CEQ-an office established in 1969 by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) under Republican President Richard Nixon-created the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), a public web tool which allowed users to locate communities in the U.S. facing marginalization and disproportionate climate and pollution impacts. The current Trump administration has already removed access to the tool and to CEQ's webpage on the White House website. Three days after the CEJST was taken offline, EDGI and fellow members of the Public Environmental Data Partners (PEDP) posted an 'unofficial but functional copy' of the tool, restoring public access for the time being.</p><p>The website of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-which Trump sought to dismantle through a rollback of regulations during his first term and which has seen its authority whittled down by a more conservative Supreme Court-experienced its own overhaul last week when the administration deleted all references to climate change from its homepage and other prominent parts of the site. Although the EPA's 'Climate Change Impacts' page still exists, it is buried deep in sections of the website that are harder to find, and the topic of climate change has been removed from the homepage's 'Environmental Topics' section.</p><p>Climate change has for years been a cornerstone policy issue for many other agencies as well. This was strengthened during the last four years as the former Biden administration sought to integrate climate adaptation and resilience plans across 20 federal agencies. Under Biden, the State Department's website had two 'Policy Issues' sections on 'Climate and Environment' and the 'Climate Crisis' filled with documents related to U.S. climate policies aimed at cutting emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The current 'Climate and Environment' page has been pared down and includes no mention of the Paris Agreement (which the Trump Administration officially withdrew from for a second time on his first day in office), and the 'Climate Crisis' page has been removed. Now, a search for 'global warming' leads to a list of defunct links.</p><p>Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency currently at the center of President Trump's immigration executive actions, removed several of its 'In Focus' topics including a section called 'Addressing the Climate Crisis.' Previously, users could access information on 'FEMA Floodplain and Flood Map Resources,' guidance on extreme temperatures and heat tools, and reports like the agency's 'Strategic Framework for Addressing Climate Change' and its 'Climate Action Plan.' Now, along with the removal of the 'Addressing the Climate Crisis In Focus' topic, DHS has also removed its pages on 'Artificial Intelligence at DHS,' 'Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA),' 'Honoring Veterans,' 'Operation Allies Welcome,' and 'Securing the Border.'</p><p>Notably, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), which may be the next target of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), still has a live Climate page, including a variety of tools and resources, funding opportunities, and a 'Climate 101' section. While unchanged at the time of this publication, the agency's global climate data distribution system, the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), is undergoing 'scheduled maintenance' from February 4-6, according to the banner announcement on the NCEI page. Similarly, the Department of Defense's website still includes a live and unchanged 'Spotlight on Tackling the Climate Crisis,' which states that DOD is 'elevating climate change as a national security priority, integrating climate considerations into policies, strategies and partner engagements.' And although key climate information is still spread sporadically throughout the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website, the agency's climate website displays a message about moving to a 'more integrated portal on science,' and the word 'climate' is removed from its URL.</p><p>Most recently, the White House ordered the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take down all websites referencing the climate crisis, most impacting the United States Forest Service (USFS) website, which previously included key resources, research, and adaptation tools, such as vulnerability assessments for wildfires. At the time of this publication, the USDA's 'Climate Hubs' sites are still live, but sites including the USFS 'Climate Change Resource Center,' the 'Climate Change Action Tracker,' and the 'National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change' have gone dark.</p><p>Since President Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, more than 2,000 datasets have also disappeared from data.gov, the largest repository of U.S. government open data on the internet. (Figure 7) At the time of this posting, there are currently 306,770 datasets available, still over 1,000 fewer than before President Trump assumed office. According to 404 Media, it is still 'too early to say what, specifically, has been deleted, though archivists and academics...are working on triaging the situation.'</p><p>As these sites and datasets go dark, environmental and archivist organizations, researchers, and citizens are racing to save government resources from vanishing entirely. The End of Term Web Archive Project-an effort that partners with EDGI, PEDP, the Common Crawl, universities, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration and the U.S. Government Publishing Office-preserves web material from previous administrations through a series of web crawlers that scrape federal websites and data. Every four years, librarians, archivists, and technologists undertake an 'end-of-term-crawl' to capture websites that preserve the historical record as one administration ends and another begins. The data collected during the end-of-term crawls lives on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, a longstanding and valuable public tool containing billions of webpages that can be searched and downloaded as bulk data.

Let me thank each of you for joining the 1.4 billion Indians today in celebrating the 76th Republic Day of India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This day marks the completion of 75 years since the Constitution of India commenced. It is an occasion to celebrate the edifice of Indian democracy. This a landmark achievement, for when Bharat gained independence, there were numerous hesitations, several sceptics of having the longest written Constitution govern a country that had been impoverished over the years by its colonial masters. However, the Indian Constitution defied and nullified all such doubts, guiding us to where we stand today, as the fifth largest economy in the world and on our way to soon becoming the third largest with a 5 trillion dollar GDP. 'We the people' have resolutely upheld the values of the republic for three quarters of a century.</p><p>Democracy is not a mere political construct, it is a tradition in India. India is the Mother of Democracy. Evidence has it that the ethos of a limited government and countervailing institutions prevailed in ancient India, in the age of the Buddha. Allow me to indulge you in some trivia. A quote by the Chinese traveller and Buddhist monk Xuanzang that has stayed with me, 'People of distant places, with diverse customs, generally designate the land they most admire as India'. This is from the account of Xuanzang's travels in the 'Indosphere' in about 6th century CE. India was then an exporter of its civilisation - from religion, art, philosophy, to textiles, technology, even mathematics, medicine, literature, India was the cradle of it all.</p><p>Today, the nation is in the early years of Amrit Kaal, the period leading to the centenary of Independence. This is the time of an epochal transformation. India is 'happening' at a pace and scale that is unprecedented. Let me give you a readout of highlights from my country from just these last couple of weeks.</p><p>Eclectic mix of energy and vigour</p><p>We saw the launch of the Genome India Project - a new platform and framework for sharing 10,000 human genome dataset sequenced from 99 ethnic populations. A fillip to India's Bio Economy, which was valued at $ 10 billion in 2014, and has now grown to over $ 150 billion. With more than half a billion already having digital health IDs, this will usher an era of targeted medicine in India.</p><p>Bharat Global Mobility Expo bringing the entire mobility value chain under one roof just concluded. India has witnessed rapid growth in electric mobility. In the last decade alone, electric vehicle sales have increased by 640 times.</p><p>In another update, for the first time, India commissioned a destroyer, a frigate and a submarine together - all Made in India. INS Surat, INS Nilgiri and INS Vaghsheer. ISRO successfully demonstrated space-docking, or the joining of two fast moving satellites in space, making India the fourth country in the world - after the United States, Russia, and China - to have this capability . On this success rests ISRO's vision for the future of Indian space exploration, which includes building a space station and putting a person on the Moon.</p><p>We also marked the 150th Foundation Day of India Meteorological Department. IMD has enabled today that the Early Warning for All facility is reaching more than 90% of the country's population. Weather forecasts reach directly on WhatsApp. Services like the Meghdoot mobile app make this information available in all the local languages of the country. Till a decade ago, only 10% of the farmers were able to use any weather related advice - Today this number has increased to more than 50%.</p><p>Rural Land Digitisation has achieved 92% coverage, giving legal property ownership to over 20 million rural families.</p><p>The Sonmarg Tunnel was inaugurated, in what is one of the most difficult terrains in India, ensuring year-round seamless connectivity between Srinagar and Ladakh.</p><p>We had the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue, wherein the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi engaged with 3,000 dynamic young leaders from across India, to mobilise their energies towards making India a developed country by 2047.</p><p>I can go on and on, but this little recap over the last two weeks in India is only to demonstrate the eclectic mix of energy and vigour in the country today. This energy is visible across domains - be it science and technology, climate adaptation, digitisation, manufacturing and industry, defence capability, infrastructure and connectivity. As the youngest country in the world, Indian aspirations for sustainable and inclusive growth are visible across the country.</p><p>The underlying mantra of this growth is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. Our vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India) is not just about self-sufficiency; it is about being a partner in progress for our neighbours and the global community. We intend to take our friends along this trajectory guided by our policy of Neighbourhood First and Vision SAGAR. </p><p>Today, I am delighted to be here as the Acting High Commissioner to India's closest maritime neighbour and longstanding partner, celebrating the 76th Republic Day amongst our Sri Lankan friends.</p><p>Our futures are interlinked</p><p>Sri Lanka just as India has remained a steadfast democracy and a republic through its independent years. India and Sri Lanka not only are fellow democracies, sharing in our diversity and dynamism, we are civilisational partners, sharing our history, language, religion and ethos. Our stories have intertwined- and our futures are interlinked. Our geographical proximity makes us natural partners and the same proximity demands a mutual sensitivity to each other's interests. It also requires each of us to support the other with an unmatched spontaneity, unencumbered by third party pulls and pressures.</p><p>India has time and again demonstrated that it is a dependable partner and a reliable friend for Sri Lanka. Whether it is natural disasters, mishaps at sea, the COVID pandemic or the recent economic crisis, India has always come to Sri Lanka's assistance as the first responder. Our support has been timely, quick and unconditional.</p><p>India as the co-chair of the Official Creditors Committee remains involved in the financial stabilisation effort for Sri Lanka through its engagement with the IMF. In addition to the ongoing debt restructuring, India has created additional fiscal headroom for Sri Lanka by converting $ 100 million worth of developmental debt assistance to grants. This takes India's grant assistance to Sri Lanka to $ 780 million, making India the principal development partner for Sri Lanka. India's development assistance projects exist in each of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka. Completed projects amount to $ 390 million, ongoing projects are approx. $ 211 million and committed grant projects in the pipeline stand at nearly $ 180 million.</p><p>As Sri Lanka turns a corner from economic recovery to growth, our leadership has indicated a strategic shift from debt-driven models towards investment-led partnerships across different sectors. This is a major highlight of the Joint Statement agreed upon by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake during the latter's visit to India in December 2024. These investment projects are focused on enhancing physical, digital and energy connectivity - the key pillars of our partnership.</p><p>The energy projects include establishing electricity-grid connectivity and multi-product petroleum pipelines between both the nations. We have jointly decided that, post the successful launch of the Nagapattinam-Kankesanthurai ferry service, we will also initiate a ferry service between Rameshwaram and Talaimannar. You must have seen that IndiGo has emerged as the largest foreign carrier in Sri Lanka. On the digital connectivity front, we are working to implement the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity project in mission mode. In keeping with the promise of the Sri Lankan Government for people-centric digitisation, SL UDI will be the foundational DPI to unlock benefits of the Digital Stack. A Joint Working Group has been established to explore the implementation of DPI stack in Sri Lanka.</p><p>We will also be assisting Sri Lanka in training 1,500 Sri Lankan civil servants across ministries and departments, with a focus on e-governance including the Government e-Marketplace, India's multimodal logistics digital dashboard - PM Gati Shakti, digitised customs and other taxation procedures. India's capacity building initiatives extend to students as well, through the offer of nearly a 1,000 scholarship slots under various schemes.</p><p>Mutual and inseparable security interests</p><p>Friends, while capacity building remains as a major pillar of our defence partnership, we are continually expanding and strengthening this dimension further given our mutual and inseparable security interests. Last year saw the establishment of the Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre in Sri Lanka amongst other assistance vital for Sri Lanka to enhance its maritime domain awareness. Both sides have now decided to work on a Security Cooperation Agreement. We have also agreed to cooperate on Hydrography. The Colombo Security Conclave as an important platform for regional peace, security and development will continue to be buttressed.</p><p>As you can see, the India-Sri Lanka partnership today is all-encompassing. India's growth and its capacities have been made available for Sri Lanka to partake in, as per Sri Lanka's needs and priorities. It is not often that one country tells another to exploit its markets and its scale. We do that - for the intent is to transform the bilateral relationship into a new standard for friendly and neighbourly ties. These ties may be non-reciprocal in benefits, but are underpinned by a significant measure of trust and goodwill that is very much reciprocal and mutual.</p><p>The foundation of the comprehensive partnership between the two countries rests on the bonds of longstanding religious and spiritual links, filial friendships, language exchanges, traditional trading routes and business exchanges between our peoples. When India declared the Pali language as a Classical Language, Sri Lanka joined us in this celebration. We have recently supported the reprinting of the Pali Grammar book Namamala. This World Hindi Day, Sri Lanka's first-ever open learning certificate course in Hindi was also launched. Legend and devotion connect our people through the Ramayana Trail in Sri Lanka and Buddhist Circuit in India. It is no surprise that India remains the largest source of tourists for Sri Lanka.</p><p>As is evident, the India-Sri Lanka partnership, just as democracy, is people-led and people-centred. People lie at the core of each project, every initiative undertaken by the two countries. To strengthen that core, to 'Foster Partnerships for a Shared Future', I look forward to your continuous cooperation and support.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["We had the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue, wherein the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi engaged with 3,000 dynamic young leaders from across India, to mobilise their energies towards making India a developed country by 2047.

The people who elected President Anura Kumara Dissnayake at the Presidential Election held on September 21 as well as a substantial number of those who voted for other candidates would like to see a stable government of the National People's Power (NPP). At the same time democratic people of the country would like to see a strong opposition in parliament to offer constructive criticism to correct any errant ways, if any, of the government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The people of Sri Lanka consensual in their opinion that the new government faces a series of critical tasks in addressing political, economic, and social challenges following years of economic turmoil, political instability, and public discontent. The leadership's ability to effectively address these pressing issues will shape the country's future and influence public confidence in the government's capacity to drive positive change.</p><p>The main challenge is to sustain the economic recovery with a clear understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) major foreign donors and international lending institutions. The government's first task is to negotiate debt restructuring agreements, particularly with international creditors like the IMF, China, and India. Achieving favorable terms will be key to easing the debt burden and opening up opportunities for economic growth.</p><p>Structural changes</p><p>While doing that it is essential to take effective measure to effect the promised structural changes required for social, political and economic reform.</p><p>Galloping inflation and currency depreciation have hit Sri Lankan households hard. Addressing these issues will require a mix of monetary policies, possibly through measures such as improving foreign exchange reserves, reducing inflationary pressures, and stabilizing the rupee to protect consumers' purchasing power.</p><p>Sri Lanka must rebuild investor confidence to attract foreign capital. It is heartening to see the positive attitude displayed by the United States, China, India and Europe and the assurance from many governments that they would encourage investments. This will involve implementing clear regulatory policies, reducing red tape, and offering incentives in key sectors like tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, which are critical.</p><p>Sri Lanka's agricultural sector has faced significant challenges, including a controversial move to ban chemical fertilizers, which led to food shortages. The new government will need to implement sustainable agricultural policies, support farmers with subsidies and training, and encourage self-sufficiency in staple crops to avoid further food security issues.</p><p>The health sector in Sri Lanka has been strained by economic challenges, leading to shortages of essential medicines and equipment. The government must prioritize funding and resources for public healthcare and work with international organizations to stabilize supply chains for medical supplies.</p><p>Social discontent</p><p>Education and employment opportunities have been adversely affected, especially for the youth, which has fueled social discontent, which reached its zenith in 2022 with the Aragalaya. Following anti-government protests, public trust in political institutions remains low, and the government must work to rebuild confidence.</p><p>Sri Lanka boasts a relatively young and educated workforce, which can be a competitive advantage. Investing in education and skill development, particularly in technology, finance, and healthcare, could equip the youth to contribute to high-value sectors. A skilled workforce could also attract foreign companies looking to outsource certain operations. Encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, and vocational training programs can create new employment opportunities, helping to boost economic growth.</p><p>Transparency, anti-corruption measures, and decentralization of power are essential to improve governance. A critical part of restoring trust involves the commitment to anti-corruption and accountability. This requires a well- functioning legal and judicial system, which itself may require reform.</p><p>To achieve energy security, the government will need to secure new sources of fuel, invest in renewable energy, and possibly explore regional energy partnerships. Long-term plans may include investment in solar, wind, and hydropower to reduce reliance on imports.</p><p>Executive power</p><p>Public dissatisfaction with governance in Sri Lanka has sparked calls for reforms to reduce executive power and promote transparency. The government should consider constitutional amendments that will empower democratic institutions and reduce the president's powers, in line with public demands for a more balanced governance structure.</p><p>Fighting corruption and strengthening the judicial system are essential for restoring public trust. Anti-corruption measures, transparency in public projects, and accountability mechanisms for government officials are crucial to reestablishing faith in public institutions.</p><p>Sri Lanka's strategic location makes it a focal point for both China and India. Balancing relationships with these regional powers will be crucial, especially regarding infrastructure projects and financial aid. The government should adopt a non-aligned stance while fostering regional cooperation, ensuring that international alliances do not compromise Sri Lanka's sovereignty.</p><p>Rebuilding relations with global entities such as the IMF, World Bank, and UN will be essential for obtaining financial support, technical assistance, and economic development guidance. Engaging constructively with these bodies can also enhance Sri Lanka's image internationally, attracting further investment and assistance.</p><p>Another crucial issue is the climate change. Sri Lanka is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising sea levels, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss. The government should focus on environmental conservation, promoting sustainable agriculture, and implementing climate adaptation strategies. Developing early warning systems and disaster response plans will be crucial to protect communities at risk from natural hazards.</p><p>Integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into national policies can help Sri Lanka tackle environmental, social, and economic challenges in a holistic manner. By adopting a sustainability-focused development model, the country can address issues like poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.</p><p>Sri Lanka's history of ethnic tensions remains a sensitive issue, with continued challenges in ensuring peace and unity among its diverse communities. The government must work to promote inclusivity, prevent discrimination, and create platforms for peaceful dialogue.</p><p>Social cohesion</p><p>Ensuring justice for past conflicts and establishing protections for minority groups will be critical to fostering social cohesion. The government's efforts should also include protecting freedoms and human rights, addressing concerns about disappearances, and providing reparations where applicable.</p><p>However, with a clear strategy, the government also has a unique opportunity to set the country on a path of sustainable development. Investing in human capital could help transform Sri Lanka's economy and create a more equitable and prosperous society.</p><p>At this juncture in which the country is faced with numerous challenges, the opposition must play a constrctive role and allow the government to implement its policies. The public service and trade unions as well as the impatient youths must take the path of self-restraint and patience and refrain from disruptive strikes and protest action and resort to negotiation method to solve their issues.</p><p>Sri Lanka's new government has an immense responsibility to restore stability, rebuild the economy, and address the aspirations of its people. Success will require transparent governance, genuine reforms, and effective public communication. In the long term, the government's ability to meet these tasks will determine Sri Lanka's trajectory and the quality of life for its citizens.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

While GDP growth rates in the developed world have returned to their pre-pandemic trends, those of developing countries are even lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The economic scars of COVID-19 across the developing world, particularly large debt overhangs and insufficient investment in future growth, will remain visible for decades. And as environmental disasters become increasingly frequent and more severe, the pandemic might be a harbinger of future shocks. COVID-19 is not the last or the most virulent virus the world will face.</p><p>After all, pandemics are far from the only environmental threat disproportionately affecting low-income countries. Climate change and biodiversity loss, together with antimicrobial resistance, air pollution, and lead poisoning, among others, all have the potential to act as significant drags on developing economies' growth.</p><p>To be sure, emerging and developing economies are still growing faster than their more developed counterparts. Over the past three decades, developing countries' share of global economic growth has nearly doubled to over 70%, but as extreme weather events, epidemics, and other natural disasters become more frequent, this may change. To prevent the gap between rich and poor countries from growing, we require a deeper understanding of developing economies' unique vulnerabilities, as well as more effective strategies to build resilience.</p><p>COVID-19 is a case in point. Despite the massive death toll, developed countries have been able to leverage their substantial fiscal and monetary resources, along with their access to vaccines, to minimise the pandemic's long-term economic impact. By contrast, the damage to emerging and developing countries has been more severe and is expected to last much longer than initially anticipated, reversing decades of progress and undermining their ability to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>The financial risks associated with climate change can be both acute, triggered by extreme events such as storms and floods, and chronic, resulting from long-term shifts in weather patterns. Damage to physical assets, supply-chain disruptions, and reduced output pose significant threats to economic growth and development, especially in countries with mounting debt burdens and limited resources.</p><p>These risks inevitably affect the cost of capital. Ideally, capital should flow 'downhill' from capital-rich to capital-poor countries, where the potential social returns are higher. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, however, capital has tended to flow uphill, largely owing to perceived risks and weak institutions in emerging and developing countries, as well as developed economies' monetary policies. The growing threat posed by pandemics and climate change is reinforcing these trends.</p><p>This is happening despite steady improvements in macroeconomic policies across the developing world. A recent paper by Piroska Nagy Moh\u00e1csi and others suggests that in terms of transparency and accountability, central banks in developing countries have even surpassed the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. During the 2008 crisis, and again during the pandemic, developing countries' central banks closely followed the policies of the Fed and ECB. But their post-pandemic inflation forecasts have been more accurate, enabling them to respond faster to price increases.</p><p>While these improvements have not significantly reduced the cost of capital, they may help address another, related problem. Most infrastructure investments needed to mitigate future pandemics and environmental shocks rely on technologies that are financed in dollars, yen, and euros but that generate revenues in local currencies. Improved macroeconomic management could make developing countries' currencies more attractive, reducing currency mismatches.</p><p>Climate adaptation and resilience efforts are more difficult to finance than mitigation measures, as developing countries often lack the necessary revenue streams to secure contracts. The newly created Pandemic Fund could help bridge some financing gaps by facilitating investments in pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. But the Fund is not large enough to support the necessary climate adaptation and biodiversity restoration projects, underscoring the need for additional financing mechanisms.</p><p>Collective investments in resilience are particularly crucial for poor people who cannot afford personal protective measures like generators, air purifiers, air conditioners, and floodwalls. Using the case of mangroves in Indonesia, a recent study by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank shows that these trees protect economically vulnerable communities from tidal waves. But poor people are more likely to deplete mangroves as they use them for firewood and building materials and live in areas where local authorities have less capacity to maintain these vital ecosystems.</p><p>To build resilience, emerging and developing economies must also attract private and institutional capital. This requires the creation of markets that can accurately assess the value of lower carbon footprints and the impact of climate change. Multilateral development banks, in particular, can play a vital role in certifying such assessments. They also help in managing risks, mobilizing private investment, stabilizing capital flows, and creating new tools for evaluating investments in adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Developing economies are already facing much tighter environmental constraints, with a limited global carbon budget and commitments to reverse biodiversity loss, than countries that achieved high-income status in the past. Strengthening resilience to future pandemics and environmental shocks will be crucial to preventing lower growth in emerging and developing economies - and thereby maintaining overall global growth.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Most infrastructure investments needed to mitigate future pandemics and environmental shocks rely on technologies that are financed in dollars, yen, and euros but that generate revenues in local currencies.

But a rising tide of disinformation is undermining the effectiveness of these investments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, a massive increase in financing for climate adaptation is urgently needed, but the impact of calls for increased investment would likely be limited if disinformation campaigns persuade people that global warming doesn't exist or is not worth addressing. As COVID-19 showed, pandemic responses can be undermined if people fall victim to misleading health advice. Without a free and independent press to hold politicians and policymakers to account, famines become more likely because increasingly scarce resources such as water and arable land may be poorly managed in the absence of transparent and equitable governance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More worryingly, disinformation threatens not only development but also democracy itself. As news organisations struggle to survive in a complex and fast-changing media landscape, abuses of political and corporate power go unchecked. Independent journalism is one of the cheapest and most efficacious bulwarks against authoritarianism. It is so effective that autocrats are spending billions of dollars each year to undermine it by influencing domestic and foreign media narratives, as Freedom House's report on China's global media influence shows.</p><p>And yet, while autocratic regimes invest billions in disinformation, Western countries are doing little to address the problem. To be sure, policymakers and politicians emphasise the vital role of press freedom in speeches, disinformation reports, and democracy conferences. But global government investment in public-interest journalism remains shockingly low.</p><p>The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) recently published a landmark report that underscores this 'mismatch between rhetoric and resource allocation.' A detailed mapping study of ODA for media found that donor countries have not allocated enough resources to respond adequately to the dramatic erosion of information integrity worldwide.</p><p>Over the last decade, the percentage of the global population living under autocratic rule has risen, from 49% to 70%, disinformation has surged in every country, and the financial threats confronting independent media have become existential. But support for media has remained stagnant, with 38 OECD countries spending a total of around $500 million per year-or about a third of Russia's estimated propaganda budget. This represents less than 0.2% of total ODA in 2022 (the most recent year for which statistics are available).</p><p>Worse, only a small fraction of this support is directly channelled to independent media organisations in recipient countries. The report finds that less than 10% of ODA for media and the information environment is delivered to journalists, media outlets, and civil society organisations focused on journalism. This represents a mere 0.05% of total ODA between 2016 and 2022. Unless ODA for journalism is significantly increased, public-interest media in many countries will die out, with dire consequences for the societies served by these outlets. Democratic processes will be destabilised, and progress on development will be stunted-perhaps irrevocably so.</p><p>Fortunately, some donor countries have finally begun to recognise this need. In March, the OECD DAC published a new set of principles for providing relevant and effective support to media and the information environment, which call for increasing financial and other forms of support, and strengthening local leadership and ownership. This means 'ensuring a more significant share of ODA for media development reaches local and regional actors directly' and 'increasing the availability and accessibility of direct, flexible, and reliable support, including core funding and longer-term, multi-year funding.'</p><p>This suggests that the low levels of spending on independent journalism do not reflect a lack of knowledge or evidence. Rather, donor countries consider this type of support to be politically challenging and difficult to execute-and rightly so. Investment in independent media can complicate government-to-government relationships. Moreover, even large donor countries are unable to invest in the staff required to support media organisations effectively as part of their bilateral ODA support to countries.</p><p>In addition, preserving the editorial independence of media outlets remains essential. While the amount of ODA going directly to media organisations is unacceptably low, it would also be inappropriate for donor countries to increase direct support themselves-no government should be picking and choosing which news outlets are worthy of support.</p><p>Our organisation, the International Fund for Public Interest Media (which financially supported the OECD DAC study but played no role in data collection or analysis), was created to address these challenges. As a multilateral fund that pools contributions from a large and diverse group of donors, it is designed to channel funding to media outlets quickly and at scale without compromising the editorial independence of the newsrooms it supports.</p><p>Equally important are the other global, regional, and local organisations that help strengthen the capacity of independent media, advocate for press freedom, and push for regulatory reform. The International Fund was set up to work in synergy with these entities.</p><p>All of these initiatives are ready to scale up their support. But they need more resources. They must also work together to make media support a more central part of political discussions related to foreign policy and international development. Working together, we can urge government decision-makers who have leverage over ODA spending to increase support for this critically important area. This can be achieved by amplifying constructive voices and broadening the coalition of actors supporting independent media, particularly by connecting journalism's plight to other high-profile problems such as disinformation and corruption.</p><p>Looking ahead, artificial intelligence will fundamentally alter the information ecosystem, making investment in journalism even more critical. With enough funding, independent news outlets will be able to develop the tools and the capacity to deploy new technologies in the service of the public interest, rather than being left behind-as they were after the rise of social media. If OECD donor countries increased their support for media from 0.2% to 1% of total OAD-a relatively small increase, given the scale of the challenge-more than $2 billion would be available for the sector globally.</p><p>Western countries have been lamenting the crisis in independent media for over a decade now. But foreign-aid spending on journalism has remained flat over that period. The world has changed drastically in the last ten years, and a shift in donor strategy is long overdue. Now is the time to save independent journalism. The longer we let disinformation thrive, the less likely it will be that democracy survives.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Last year, OECD countries collectively allocated more than $220 billion in official development assistance (ODA).

Looking to advance progress towards the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) goals and targets adopted by almost 200 countries (including Sri Lanka) at the last CoP in 2022, all attention this year is on the 700 billion dollar question, 'So where will the money come from?' $ 700 billion is the annual biodiversity finance gap, identified in the GBF and analysed in detail by The Nature Conservancy. Recognising the urgent need to fill this gap, Target 19 of the GBF commits to 'mobilise $ 200 billion per year for biodiversity from all sources'. As Conservation International's Chief Strategy Officer remarked ahead of the summit in Cali, Colombia, '...negotiators cannot leave Cali without deciding where some of that funding will originate, when it will be delivered, and what groups will receive it'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amidst Sri Lanka's acute fiscal constraints alongside rising risks to nature and biodiversity, the outcome of this global conversation will certainly matter. But what we do here at home may matter even more - not just for biodiversity conservation, but also for the wider state of the economy, growth, and people's basic wellbeing and livelihoods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka and biodiversity financing</p><p>Sri Lanka has been a contracting party to the Convention on Biological Diversity since 1994, and in 2022 we adopted the GBF. So, we are also committed to the GBF targets, including reversing nature loss and conserving 30% of the world's land and sea by 2030. The GBF calls for a whole-of-economy approach that involves shifting to new ways of producing, consuming and investing. In August 2024, the Sri Lankan Government launched a special '30x30' program to draw renewed attention to the agenda.</p><p>Estimates for Sri Lanka by UNDP back in 2018 (based on work by Vidanage, et al.) showed that the financing to achieve biodiversity targets between 2016 and 2022 was already short by US$ 190 million, on top of the resources allocated by the government budget between 2018 and 2024. These were pre-COVID and pre-crisis numbers. With the sharp fiscal cuts since then, it is clear that the financing pressures have greatly intensified. There are no new official figures on the financing gap, or to what extent the previous figures are relevant today.</p><p>The looming threats require us to accelerate our efforts. Biodiversity is in decline, with economy-wide impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods, and human health, that we haven't even begun to comprehend yet. It is estimated that one-fourth of our bird species, half of our freshwater fish, over half of our mammals, two-fifths of our reptiles, and two-thirds of our amphibians are under threat. Among keystone species, we have lost over 700 elephants in under two years. Between 2001 and 2023, the country lost 222,000 hectares of tree cover.</p><p>These issues matter not only from a pure conservation perspective, but also from a socio-economic one. The dependence of the Sri Lankan economy, key export sectors, and rural livelihoods on biodiversity, as well as the critical role that natural ecosystems play in securing clean and regular water supplies, pollination, disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation and other key services, is poorly appreciated by mainstream stakeholders in economics and finance. Moreover, there are lucrative new markets and return-generating investment opportunities that are emerging in relation to sustainable supply chains and nature-positive business. As yet, we have barely started to tap into these valuable economic opportunities.</p><p>Improving understanding, reorienting priorities</p><p>In recent years Sri Lanka has taken some steps that improve policy conditions for financing nature. The Central Bank's sustainable finance roadmap and green finance taxonomy are now well-anchored in the financial sector. A sovereign green bond framework is being finalised. And multi-stakeholder discussions around revising targets contained in the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (NBSAP) relating to financing and private sector involvement, disclosure and reporting have been active.</p><p>Yet, CSF's work in this space - engaging with policymakers, financial institutions, conservation organisations, corporates, and environmental professionals - has shown that the understanding around biodiversity financing mechanisms is still nascent.</p><p>At the policy level, conversations on financing of nature descend into narrowly talking about financing of climate change mitigation. There is a tendency for local stakeholders to conflate climate finance and biodiversity finance - although of course linked, the two are quite distinct. A small sub-set of climate finance - those relating to 'natural climate solutions' or 'ecosystem-based' mitigation and adaptation approaches - goes to biodiversity. But the rest is overwhelmingly focused on energy and transport sectors, not on agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) and nature-based solutions. Indicative of this conflation is that at a World Bank biodiversity finance forum in April, the then State Minister focussed the majority of his comments not on biodiversity and nature conservation, but on the government's plans for renewable energy.</p><p>At the financial institutional level, our work has shown that bankers have a narrow understanding of green finance - primarily focussing on lending to clean energy projects. Although biodiversity has been emerging as an asset class over recent years, it is only just beginning to be incorporated into the credit lines and investment portfolios of our financial institutions.</p><p>At the level of conservationists and ecologists, there is often either a sharp distrust of innovative financing instruments, or a loose embrace of all and any concepts - from credits to bonds. Most conservation organisations are yet to fully embrace the important economic and financial opportunities that exist to not just support biodiversity conservation, but at the same time strengthen the economy.</p><p>Budgeting processes in Protected Areas (PAs) remain underdeveloped, making estimates of conservation financing needs difficult. CSF's work in the Vidaththalvitu Nature Reserve (in partnership with Blue Resources Trust) revealed that PA management plans and financing plans are not fully-aligned, that there is under-estimation of costs and cost-bearers. We also observed substantial capability gaps in modern conservation finance planning among conservation mandate holders in government.</p><p>Looking at financing mechanisms critically</p><p>Sri Lanka needs to become much more open to, and informed about, the new sources and mechanisms that are available for biodiversity financing. These range from environment fees and levies, biodiversity credits and blended finance mechanisms, to blue bonds and nature-themed insurance. All offer opportunities to better finance conservation and strengthen our natural ecosystems (which in turn improves our economy), as well as to kick-start new and sustainable sources of income and livelihoods. As part of a much-needed shift of our post-crisis economic recovery to a more nature-positive path, these biodiversity financing mechanisms are important allies.</p><p>Over the last year, CSF has been guiding stakeholders in this space on the options that exist, how to think about their relevance and practical application, and what cautionary notes to look out for. While nature-linked sovereign debt instruments (like blue bonds and debt-for-nature swaps) are often spoken of, there are many critical considerations for Sri Lanka, as highlighted in a recently published Analytical Note by CSF. Without due recognition of global capital market trends, domestic debt management weaknesses, and the need for inclusive approaches in identifying credible and impactful projects, such sovereign biodiversity finance can only add to the country's debt troubles.</p><p>Meanwhile, attempts to establish small, site-specific Conservation Trust Funds (CTF) - as some projects have mooted - may be futile. It would be more compelling to global funders to have a marine seascape-wide CTF for Sri Lanka, and structure it as a special purpose vehicle for mobilising a mix of funding (bilateral, multilateral, philanthropic, and commercial) over a longer term. This resonates with the advice shared by the international Conservation Finance Alliance's CEO David Meyers during a webinar hosted by CSF earlier this year.</p><p>There is also a growing recognition of the role of corporates in financing biodiversity efforts, and in benefiting from the new nature-based markets and investment opportunities that have been emerging over recent year. There is also a responsibility for businesses and enterprises to better factor biodiversity into their business, with an increasing attention on (and requirement for) nature-related disclosures and reporting. At this year's CoP16, discussions on advancing the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and Science-Based Targets Initiatives (SBTI) will be quite prominent. Sri Lankan corporates would also find IFC's recent Biodiversity Finance Reference Guide useful in understanding how to practically mobilise investment and identify credible projects.</p><p>Readiness of domestic financial institutions</p><p>Sri Lankan financial institutions (FIs) provide a vital bridge between international funding sources, and domestic financing needs, across sectors, and at all levels of scale. Whether it is new foreign credit lines that fund nature-positive projects, blue bond issuances that have a window for lending to reef-positive businesses, the domestic financial industry will have a role to play. But still there is some progress needed to shift their thinking and prepare them to take a wider perspective. Two recent studies by CSF reinforce this view. An assessment of 'Environmental Integration by Sri Lankan Financial Institutions' showed that very few Sri Lankan lenders systematically assess environmental impacts and risks in granting credit facilities - just 5 of 47 FIs. The research also uncovered that only two FIs quantify/measure environmental and/or climate risks in their portfolio. With many of Sri Lanka's productive sectors heavily reliant on biodiversity and nature in some way (whether it is export crops like tea, rubber, coconut and spices, fish and seafood products, services like tourism or, indeed, any industry that requires clean and regular water supplies, or protection against floods, soil erosion and tidal surges), FIs that lend to these sectors need to urgently increase their attention to these considerations that have hitherto been ignored.</p><p>Encouragingly, though, another CSF study on green finance maturity among Sri Lankan banks, showed that there is a growing prevalence among them in engaging with environmental organisations. Two-fifths of surveyed banks reported that they 'Engage with environmental organisations to better understand environmental issues in the country', and nearly half reported that they 'Engage with environmental organisations to better understand risks and risk mitigation'. Unfortunately, none of them report that they 'Engage with environmental organisations to introduce third-party checks and balances on our green finance practices', and only one-third said that they have formal partnerships or collaborations with environmental organisations, not in a CSR capacity but specifically for informing and advising on green finance-related matters. These all point to a growing need to reorient Sri Lanka's finance sector to look beyond the narrow field of view of mitigation finance, to adaptation finance - given Sri Lanka's need to chart a nature-positive economic recovery.</p><p>Cautious engagement with international private capital</p><p>As for international private investment interest - there are some initial signs. A leading global firm, Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute, wrote to the financial industry in 2022 that, 'Sri Lanka exhibits exceptional levels of terrestrial and marine biodiversity whilst having an economy highly dependent on nature and its services (for sectors such as fisheries, agriculture and tourism)', and that, 'there are a number of potential high impact target areas linked to biodiversity that could be considered in a sustainability linked bond and would be attractive for investors looking to participate and access the sustainable debt markets'. They highlighted forest conservation, marine biodiversity protection, and whale habitat protection specifically, as areas of interest. Additionally, over the past two years following the unilateral debt standstill, there have been visits from global banks and financial advisors seeking a mandate from the Government to proceed with sovereign green debt strategies.</p><p>While being open to these, the government as well as civil society conservation stakeholders need to be acutely aware of the nuances of such instruments, including both potential gains and risks. This includes reviewing the ongoing global critiques of sovereign debt (notably, the lack of a multilateral architecture for sovereign debt workout for middle-income countries like Sri Lanka). Domestic policy and institutional coordination gaps - especially between state bodies handling public finance issues and those handling environmental issues - exacerbate the risks.</p><p>Lessons and inspirations from others</p><p>As we strengthen Sri Lanka's ability to access new finance for nature, we can look to other interesting cases. Through our research specifically in the marine finance space, we have unpacked examples ranging from Belize and Seychelles (on blue bond-financed debt-for-nature swaps), to Indonesia and Fiji (on blended finance mechanisms), Mikoko Pamoja and Vanga Blue Forest in Kenya (blue carbon credits), and Palau (small-ticket crowd-funding for marine protected areas).</p><p>All of these point to the need for a) inclusive, multi-stakeholder approaches to designing mechanisms and monitoring impacts; b) the need for domestic stakeholders (government as well as civil society) to be open to including international partners in domestic mechanisms - not just as providers of capital, but also providers of expertise and accountability); c) the need for policy and institutional coordination, overcoming turf wars and risk-aversion; and importantly, d) the need for a pipeline of 'bankable' nature projects, that have been carefully vetted not only for their pure conservation objectives, but rooted in local community and livelihood realities.</p><p>Concluding thoughts</p><p>With the current mandate given by the GBF, there is currently a great deal of international interest in funding biodiversity. Amidst a problematic international financial architecture, bright spots for attracting conservation finance do exist - whether it is from global philanthropies, multilateral agencies, or via leveraging new nature-positive markets and investment flows. By the end of August 2023, Fitch put biodiversity-tied bond sales at a record $ 165 billion. About 16% of green, social and sustainability bonds issued in 2023 included biodiversity conservation as a use of proceeds, up from just 5% in 2020. According to Credit Suisse and McKinsey (2016), the total private conservation finance investment potential is estimated at $ 200-400 billion.</p><p>The world is constantly looking for success stories, amidst dire news about climate failure in many places. Sri Lanka can offer the world the next success story - a country that emerged from debt distress, to chart a more nature-positive economy that benefits rural communities, MSMEs, larger corporates, consumers, and society as a whole.</p><p>With the right domestic mechanisms, a credible policy commitment, open-mindedness among government and non-government stakeholders, and a nuanced view of the financing options, Sri Lanka can rise up to meet the challenge. While the outcome of the COP16 is uncertain, and the commitment of the developed world to expand financing is yet unknown, Sri Lanka must work on putting its own house in order and get prepared.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Between 2001 and 2023, the country lost 222,000 hectares of tree cover.

This reform must focus on enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and coordination of institutions across the tea sector, ensuring smoother transitions and a more streamlined, responsive framework. The goal is to create a robust institutional structure that supports the sustainable growth, competitiveness, and modernisation of Sri Lanka's tea industry4.</p><p>Given the likelihood of resistance from established stakeholders, it is crucial to approach restructuring with a clear, evidence-based strategy and a collaborative framework. Early engagement with stakeholders and consensus building will help to minimise disruptions and foster cooperation. The focus should be on improving coordination between agencies, streamlining decision-making processes, and enhancing service delivery to all tea sector participants.</p><p>This reform will ensure smooth integration of institutional changes and maintain the sector's ability to effectively respond to both local and global challenges by aligning with the Government's broader restructuring initiatives and prioritising financial efficiency.</p><p>Key components</p><p>Institutional restructuring</p><p>Identification: Conduct a comprehensive review of the existing organisational structures, roles, and responsibilities of key Government institutions involved in the tea sector. Identify areas for improvement and restructuring to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>Capacity building: Develop and implement capacity-building programs to enhance the skills and competencies of government officials and staff. This includes training in modern management practices, regulatory frameworks, and industry-specific knowledge.</p><p>Service improvements: Simplify and streamline administrative processes to reduce bureaucracy, improve service delivery, and enhance responsiveness to the needs of the tea sector.</p><p>Policy and regulatory reforms</p><p>NDGs: Ensure that the policies and regulations governing the tea sector are aligned with national development goals and international best practices. This includes updating outdated policies and introducing new regulations to address emerging challenges and opportunities at least once in 5 (or 10?) years.</p><p>Transparent and accountable governance: Strengthen regulatory oversight to ensure compliance with industry standards and promote transparency and accountability practices. This includes regular audits, inspections, and enforcement of regulations.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement</p><p>Engagement: Establish a collaborative framework for engaging with key stakeholders, including tea growers, processors, exporters, and industry associations. This includes regular consultations, workshops, and joint decision-making processes.</p><p>Auditing: Promote transparency and accountability in the operations of government institutions by implementing robust reporting and auditing mechanisms. This will help build trust among stakeholders and improve governance.</p><p>Innovation and technology integration</p><p>Integration: Integrate digital technologies into the operations of government institutions to improve efficiency, transparency, and service delivery. This includes developing e-government services, digital platforms for stakeholder engagement, and data management systems.</p><p>Enhancement via R and D: Invest in research and development, monitoring to explore innovative solutions for enhancing the effectiveness of government institutions in the tea sector. This includes partnerships with academic institutions, industry experts, and international organisations.</p><p>Monitoring and supervision:</p><p>KPIs: By incorporating comprehensive evaluations and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on international best management models, the institution(s) can achieve effective monitoring and supervision. This approach involves establishing a systematic framework to regularly assess the institution's performance against predefined benchmarks. KPIs should be clearly defined to measure progress in achieving strategic goals, such as response times, compliance rates, and impact outcomes. This data-driven approach not only provides transparency and accountability but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement, enabling the institution to adapt to changing needs and enhance its overall performance.</p><p>Global standards: By adopting global standards such as the Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, or Total Quality Management, the institution can ensure that its operations align with best practices in efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. Periodically conduct evaluations, concentrating on areas like operational efficiency, service delivery, and stakeholder satisfaction.</p><p>Better evaluation: The 360-degree feedback method is indeed a better evaluation method, at least to be conducted every three years. It involves collecting feedback from a variety of sources around an individual or institution, including peers, subordinates, supervisors, and sometimes external stakeholders or clients. This comprehensive approach provides a well-rounded perspective on performance, strengths, and areas for improvement. The tea institution(s) can use 360-degree feedback to evaluate the performance of employees, teams, or even the efficacy of specific programs or initiatives. It aids in identifying performance gaps, enhancing leadership skills, and improving overall organisational effectiveness by integrating diverse viewpoints.</p><p>Incentivising performances:</p><p>A combination of financial and non-financial strategies can effectively motivate officials-a crucial element in enhancing service delivery to achieve KPIs. Developing these incentive mechanisms hinges on establishing a robust performance measurement methodology. Historical evidence, however, suggests that incentive schemes can endure even without achieving specific KPIs. Best practices include performance-based bonuses, which link part of compensation to achieving KPIs; recognition and awards to publicly acknowledge accomplishments; and career advancement opportunities tied to performance. Additionally, offering professional development, ensuring KPIs are clear and realistic, fostering public accountability and transparency, implementing regular feedback mechanisms, and promoting team-based incentives can all contribute to improved performance. Prioritising work-life balance and aligning incentives with public service motivation further enhance effectiveness. Each practice must be tailored to the local context, culture, and existing systems to ensure sustainability and impact.</p><p>Priority H: Tea legislation review</p><p>The Tea Control Act of Sri Lanka, commonly referred to as the Tea Act, is a cornerstone in the regulation and management of the nation's tea industry. The act, originally enacted in 19575 (1949?) with several updates later, plays a crucial role in overseeing the cultivation, production, marketing, and export of tea-one of Sri Lanka's most significant economic contributors. The act plays a crucial role in ensuring the sector's orderly growth and sustainability, within the business objectives as tea has a deep place in the country's history and continues to be a primary source of export revenue.</p><p>However, with changing global dynamics, there is an urgent need to modernise Sri Lanka's legal framework governing the tea industry. The primary objective of this modernisation is to update the Tea Act, aligning it with contemporary challenges and opportunities. Key focuses of the proposed revisions include promoting sustainable growth, ensuring gender inclusivity, and enhancing the international competitiveness of Sri Lanka's tea sector.</p><p>Updating the Tea Control Act must involve a comprehensive review of existing regulations, drawing on insights from both local stakeholders and international experts. The updated Tea Act will adopt international best practices, particularly geographical indications (to protect the unique identity of Ceylon Tea) and the integration of digital technologies for improved efficiency and transparency across the supply chain, as well as removing redundant sections.</p><p>By incorporating these elements, the revised Tea Act aims to reposition Sri Lanka's tea industry as a resilient, forward-thinking sector capable of thriving in a dynamic global market. This reform will not only preserve Sri Lanka's rich tea heritage but also ensure that it continues to evolve, empowering smallholders, enhancing gender equality, and fostering innovation.</p><p>Key components</p><p>Updating the Tea Act</p><p>Multistakeholder consultations: Revise and update the existing Tea Act to reflect current industry practices, technological advancements, and global standards. This includes addressing gaps and outdated provisions that may hinder the sector's growth.</p><p>Engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including tea growers, processors, exporters, and regulatory bodies, to gather input and ensure that the updated legislation meets the needs of all parties involved.</p><p>Review and fresh perspectives</p><p>International best practices: Leverage the knowledge and experience of local experts who understand the unique challenges and opportunities within the Sri Lankan tea sector. Their insights will be crucial in tailoring the legislation to local conditions. Incorporate perspectives from international experts to ensure that the updated Tea Act aligns with global best practices and standards. This will enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lankan tea in international markets.</p><p>Regulatory framework</p><p>Compliance and enforcement: Strengthen the regulatory framework to ensure compliance with the updated Tea Act. This includes establishing clear guidelines, monitoring mechanisms, and enforcement procedures.</p><p>Institutional framework:</p><p>Tea sector institutional reform: It must carefully evaluate the tea sector's institutional framework to learn from past successes and failures and shape its future. Institutional reforms should align with the digital government agenda, adopt international best practices, and incorporate the private sector's experience and expertise. A key question is whether the current government-led setup or a public-private partnership (PPP) model would be more effective, especially considering that private and public representation can contribute more to the sector's growth than traditional bureaucratic systems. Institutional behaviour must be publicly accessible, transparent, accountable, and focused on delivering results that are both effective and efficient. A comprehensive model for achieving this is yet to be developed and will be based on detailed analysis and careful consideration of best practices.</p><p>The institutional setup should take into account the integration of Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) into governance, incorporating the lessons learned from the privatisation process. It's crucial that stakeholder collaboration goes beyond mere representation to involve real responsibility, empowered through a shared governance mechanism. These issues will be explored in greater detail in a separate section, with a focus on ensuring that the tea sector's institutional structure is both effective and adaptable for the future.</p><p>Fiscal and expenditure framework</p><p>Transparency and accountability: Promote transparency and accountability within the tea sector by implementing robust budgeting, reporting and auditing requirements. This will help build trust among stakeholders and improve governance.</p><p>Sustainability and inclusivity:</p><p>Sustainability: Integrate provisions that promote environmental sustainability, such as sustainable farming practices, waste management, and biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Inclusivity: Ensure that the updated legislation includes measures to promote gender inclusivity, such as equal employment opportunities, support for female entrepreneurs, and protection against discrimination.</p><p>Implementation and monitoring:</p><p>Continuous monitoring: Implement the updated Tea Act and establish monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance and assess the impact of the new legislation.</p><p>Providing subsidies and incentives to various agricultural sectors has been a practice for many decades. In certain situations, such as short-term production issues or market fluctuations caused by external factors, government financial assistance may be justified.</p><p>For instance, if the international market for tea were to collapse due to a global economic crisis, the Government should consider implementing a time-bound assistance program.</p><p>Short term assistance programs should be periodically reviewed to determine whether continued support or sectoral transition is necessary based on a thorough situation analysis. However, the indefinite continuation of subsidies or Government support in any agricultural sector is counterproductive and inefficient. If a sector is proven to be unsustainable in the long term due to socio-economic, climatic, or scientific factors, the government's focus should shift to supporting the transition (another form of subsidies based on true financial analysis) to more viable alternatives (i.e. British's transition from coffee to tea). Subsidies, when funded through tax revenue, can make both the sector (distorting market competition) and the country unsustainable if not managed carefully. It leads to inefficiencies and wasted resources.</p><p>If subsidies are utilised by producers without optimising yields, total production can actually decrease due to lower break-even points. For example, a farmer might achieve the same profit by producing 90 kg instead of 100 kg with the help of a subsidy, as the cost of production is reduced. This can lead to complacency, where producers focus more on maintaining profits rather than maximising output, ultimately resulting in lower overall production.</p><p>There are instances where subsidies or financial support are provided simply due to popular demand, but this should not be the future approach for a country like Sri Lanka.

And, while employment growth has also increased, it is well short of working-age population growth. As a result, the share of the employed working-age population has been declining since 2000 and is low. In 2023, the employment ratio for South Asia was 59%, compared to 70% in other emerging market and developing economy regions.
