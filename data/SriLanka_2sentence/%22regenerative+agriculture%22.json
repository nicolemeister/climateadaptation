But this cradle of Ceylon tea, famed from London to Beijing, is faltering. Soil, once fertile, now lies tired from years of chemical overload. Pest outbreaks are more frequent. Fertiliser prices have soared beyond reach. And the cup, once golden, is losing its richness. 'The rain used to come like clockwork,' says Gamage Bandara, a second-generation tea farmer I met during one of my trips to Sri Lankan tea gardens. 'Now, it either pours like a flood or disappears for weeks. The leaves don't know when to grow anymore.' Gamage's lament echoes through the central highlands of Sri Lanka, where tea is more than a crop-it's heritage, livelihood, and national identity all steeped into one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crisis beneath the canopy</p><p>Sri Lanka's tea industry-once the pride of Ceylon and the third-largest tea exporter globally-is gradually wilting under the weight of environmental and economic distress. From the hill slopes of Nuwara Eliya to the low-grown estates in Ratnapura, the once-verdant plantations are confronting depleted soils, erratic rainfall, and rising temperatures that threaten both yield and quality. In 2022, the industry's output plunged to a 26-year low, with total tea production falling to 251 million kg from a high of over 340 million kg in 2013, according to the Sri Lanka Tea Board Annual Report.</p><p>However, the industry began to recover modestly in the following years. By the end of 2023, total production rose to 256.04 million kg, marking a 4.54 million-kg (+1.8 %) increase from 2022 (TEA Statistics, 2024). The upward trend continued through 2024: 262.16 million kg was produced by December, an additional gain of 6.07 million kg (+2.4 %) from 2023 (Market Reports - Ceylon Tea Brokers, Dec. 2024). While this modest rebound is promising, it remains significantly below the heights of the early 2010s and continues to face substantial challenges from climate impacts, soil degradation, and market instability. In fact, it will not be out of place to suggest that this downturn is more than cyclical. It's structural.</p><p>It would be a profound irony-and a strategic misstep-if Sri Lanka, a pioneer in regenerative tea, lets others overtake it in the global shift to sustainability. After all, it was Halgolla Estate that made history as the world's first Regenagri-certified tea estate, having implemented soil-restorative practices, wildlife conservation, and carbon footprint reduction to global acclaim. Likewise, Lumbini Tea Factory-the first to bring a group of smallholder outgrowers under Regenagri-has shown that long-term returns on investment come not just from environmental gains, but from lower input costs, premium market access, and greater climate resilience</p><p>Decades of continuous monoculture on steep slopes have eroded the health of Sri Lanka's tea soils-up to 412 t/ha/year in some highland plantations-far exceeding the 9 t/ha/year threshold and causing yield losses upward of 133 kg/ha annually (Wickramarachchi and Bandara, 2014). Soil organic carbon has dwindled to around 2.16% (pH 4.5), weakening nutrient retention and soil structure (Joachim and Pandithasekara, 2004).</p><p>The nationwide ban on chemical fertilisers in April 2021 led to a 35% drop in usage, slashing tea production nearly 18%, and costing the sector an estimated LKR 84 billion (US$425 million) (Drechsel et al., 2025).</p><p>Climate patterns have also become unpredictable: rising temperatures, erratic monsoons and intermittent droughts now reduce yields by roughly 4.6% per 1 \u00b0C warming (IWMI, 2025).</p><p>Collectively, these pressures have eroded yields by about 15%, degraded cup quality, and left farming families in severe economic and emotional distress-signalling a crisis beneath the green canopy.</p><p>Amidst these compounding crises, regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessity. Rooted in ecological principles and traditional knowledge, regenerative practices focus on rebuilding soil health, increasing biodiversity, and restoring the ecosystem services on which tea production ultimately depends. Unlike organic farming, which can often be prescriptive and yield-focused, regenerative farming emphasises long-term resilience, carbon sequestration, and farmer autonomy, as detailed by the Rodale Institute.</p><p>As global buyers-from Unilever to niche ethical tea brands-increasingly shift toward carbon-neutral, traceable supply chains, Sri Lanka has a window of opportunity to rebrand its tea not just as premium, but as planet-positive. The world's largest regenerative agriculture certification standard, Regenagri, offers a chance to lead that transformation.</p><p>Regenagri: The global benchmark for regenerative agriculture</p><p>Regenagri is the world's largest regenerative agriculture initiative, headquartered in London, UK, with over 2.2 million hectares under certification-more than any comparable program. Incubated by Solidaridad, the world's oldest and largest sustainability organisation, Regenagri operates as a Community Interest Company (CIC), jointly owned by farmers, businesses, and NGOs, ensuring equitable governance and shared accountability.</p><p>In tea estates, Regenagri promotes sustainable practices such as cover cropping, organic soil amendments, shade tree planting, and biodiversity corridors. Its certification process helps tea producers move beyond just \"chemical-free\" claims by verifying long-term ecological restoration and carbon sequestration through third-party audits. The platform also provides a digital hub for farmers to track data on soil health, water use, biodiversity, and greenhouse gases, ensuring transparent and continuous improvement.</p><p>For tea packers and brands, Regenagri certification ensures traceability from field to cup and opens access to premium markets demanding climate-smart products. With mounting global pressure to comply with sustainability laws like European Union's Green Deal, Regenagri offers both ecological and economic resilience for South Asian tea producers looking to future-proof their industry. For tea estates, regenerative farming isn't just good for the planet-it's also good business. Under the Regenagri framework, estates that adopt soil-friendly practices like composting, reduced tillage, agroforestry, and cover cropping can sequester carbon-essentially pulling harmful CO2 out of the atmosphere and storing it safely in the soil. What makes this powerful is that Regenagri provides a verified carbon certification system, aligned with global standards like the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064-2. Once verified, estates can generate carbon credits, which are tradable on environmental markets or sold to companies looking to offset their emissions. This creates an entirely new income stream for tea growers, especially at a time when input costs are rising and market prices remain volatile.</p><p>Evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment. Regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessity</p><p>Myths and truths about Regenerative Agriculture</p><p>Critics often mistake regenerative agriculture for simply being another form of organic farming. While organic bans chemical use, regenerative agriculture suggests planned reduction. In fact, regenerative practices go further, restoring soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and actively capturing carbon, making it a systems-based, outcome-driven approach rather than a fixed-input model.</p><p>Some argue it's too costly or too slow to scale. Yet evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment (ROI).</p><p>Concerns about initial yield drops are not visible in several pilots conducted across the world. NGO Solidaridad has shown through its field trials in 2020-22, that 13,000 farmers cultivating cotton and soy have increased yield by 20% to 30%, reduced input costs by 30%, and received a market price premium of 3%. This project shows economic and environmental viability. Importantly, the smallholder farmers in India were able to generate 2 carbon credits per acre in cotton in partnership with carbon project developer Boomitra.</p><p>Lastly, critics claim it's too radical for legacy tea estates. In reality, Regenagri supports phased adoption, allowing estates to implement hybrid models that integrate regenerative principles without disrupting ongoing operations-making the transition both practical and strategic.</p><p>Global momentum, local opportunity</p><p>Across the world, regenerative agriculture is not just a movement-it's becoming a market expectation. Meanwhile, global demand for regeneratively produced tea and other commodities is accelerating. Markets such as the EU, UK, and Japan are tightening sustainability regulations. The European Green Deal and the upcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (EUCSDDD) require exporters to prove deforestation-free, low-carbon supply chains (CBI Report, 2023). Germany's Lieferkettengesetz (LkSG) adds another layer of accountability for social and environmental compliance.</p><p>Importantly, Regenagri complements existing ethical labels like Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance rather than competing with them. However, it adds deeper ecological validation and carbon-traceable integrity. It's already attracting global brands like illycaff\u00e8, Candiani Denim, Giorgio Armani, and J.Crew, signalling that regenerative supply chains are becoming the gold standard in sustainability (Regenagri Certified Companies).</p><p>In this context, India's recent partnership between Solidaridad Asia and the Indian Tea Association (ITA) is a game changer. It aims to bring 100,000 hectares of Indian tea under Regenagri certification over three years-a move that could propel Indian tea industry into a global leader in regenerative, climate-resilient tea production.</p><p>Sri Lanka must not miss the bus</p><p>It would be a profound irony-and a strategic misstep-if Sri Lanka, a pioneer in regenerative tea, lets others overtake it in the global shift to sustainability.

It could mean exclusion from premium markets, especially in Europe, where regulations like the EU Green Deal and German Due Diligence Laws demand verifiable environmental compliance. Regenagri's framework, already in use by Sri Lankan estates like Halgolla, provides the tools, credibility, and international alignment required to keep \"Ceylon Tea\" not just relevant-but revered in a carbon-conscious world.</p><p>The question isn't whether Sri Lanka can afford to embrace regenerative agriculture. The question is-can it afford not to?</p><p>A future worth brewing</p><p>Imagine the same mist-draped estate in Nuwara Eliya, five years from now-its slopes teeming with life. Tea bushes thrive under a canopy of shade trees, soil hums with microbial activity, and farmers no longer fear the rain. This is not a utopia-it is the promise of regenerative agriculture made real.</p><p>Regenerative tea is not about romanticising the past or rejecting progress. It's about moving forward-with nature, not against it. It aligns ancient wisdom with cutting-edge science, ensuring that Sri Lanka's proud legacy of Ceylon tea can weather the storms ahead. With pioneering estates like Halgolla and Lumbini showing the way, Sri Lanka has a rare chance to lead as a global model for climate-smart, carbon-positive tea.</p><p>But this transition needs support. Policymakers must step in with subsidies, extension services, and market linkages. Consumers can help too-by choosing regenerative brands. And industry bodies must reorient investments towards soil-first solutions.

In an exclusive online discussion from Brussels, Douglas spoke with the Daily FT, offering a visionary outlook on the implications, opportunities, and future of regenerative agriculture powered by the cooperative movement. Here are excerpts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: ICA joining regenagri's board has been hailed as a game changer. Could you elaborate on why this partnership is so pivotal for ICA members globally, and particularly in a nation like Sri Lanka?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This partnership represents more than a simple collaboration; it is the confluence of two powerful, shared visions aimed at fundamentally transforming global agriculture through sustainable, farmer-centric, regenerative practices. The International Cooperative Alliance is the global voice for a movement that encompasses over one billion members, a significant portion of whom are smallholder farmers who act as stewards of our planet's land and resources. For too long, these farmers have been at the mercy of volatile markets and degrading environmental conditions. This alliance is a declaration that a new era is possible.</p><p>Regenagri's proven, data-driven methodologies and certification frameworks provide the tools for this transformation. They offer a clear pathway for farmers to access higher-value markets that are increasingly demanding proof of sustainability, enabling them to build prosperous livelihoods while actively healing their environment. In a country like Sri Lanka, where agriculture is the very backbone of rural economies, embracing regenagri standards is not just an upgrade-it's a paradigm shift. It is about empowering farming communities to build a future defined by resilience, greater productivity, and profound ecological harmony.</p><p>Q: What does regenerative agriculture specifically offer the smallholder farmers of Sri Lanka?</p><p>Regenerative agriculture offers a pathway to liberation and sovereignty for smallholder farmers. At its core, it is about restoring the natural vitality of the earth-it fundamentally rebuilds soil health, enhances biodiversity, and contributes to the global effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all while increasing the productivity of the farm. For Sri Lanka's dedicated smallholders, this translates into a cascade of benefits: healthier, more resilient soils that can better withstand climatic shocks, leading to more stable and abundant yields. More than that, it builds resilience against the escalating climate crisis, which is a critical advantage in a nation so frequently affected by extreme weather events.</p><p>Furthermore, this partnership unlocks new economic pathways. Through regenagri's carbon in-setting program, cooperatives can measure and verify greenhouse gas reductions and soil carbon improvements from their regenerative practices. This process generates verified carbon credits, which represent a reduction in the farm's carbon footprint. These credits can then create an additional revenue stream for the cooperative and its members by negotiating with the downstream buyers who are trying to reduce their carbon footprint and are willing to reward farmers for their positive environmental impact. It's a powerful model where ecological restoration translates directly to economic benefits.</p><p>Q: How do you envision ICA's membership in regenagri influencing the cooperative farming movement worldwide?</p><p>The ICA's global membership is a powerful network for change, and through it, we can scale the adoption of regenagri standards with unprecedented speed and impact. Cooperatives are not top-down institutions; they are built from the ground up, deeply embedded in the communities they serve. This inherent structure makes them the perfect vehicles for championing regenerative methods that resonate with both economic aspirations and environmental stewardship.</p><p>This creates a powerful domino effect: as one cooperative embraces regenerative agriculture and reaps the benefits, it inspires others. As more cooperatives join this movement, market opportunities expand, best practices are shared and refined, and farmers across the world benefit collectively from this shared wisdom. This is amplified by our strategic alliances, such as our long-standing partnership with Solidaridad, which allows us to pool resources and expertise to support cooperatives in their journey. Our ultimate goal is to make regenerative practices a cornerstone of the global cooperative identity, creating a mainstream movement driven by cooperative systems.</p><p>Q: What immediate opportunities does ICA see in implementing regenagri standards?</p><p>The most immediate and compelling opportunities are found in establishing transparency and achieving market differentiation. In today's world, consumers and international markets are not just buying a product; they are buying a story, a commitment. They are increasingly demanding credible, verifiable evidence of sustainability, and regenagri certification provides exactly that.</p><p>This allows ICA member cooperatives to move beyond local commodity markets and present verifiably regenerative products to the world, gaining a competitive edge and ensuring fairer returns for their farmer-members. For a nation like Sri Lanka, with its global reputation for premium tea, spices, and other export crops, regenagri certification is a golden opportunity. It can position its cooperatives as leaders at the forefront of the premium, sustainably, and ethically sourced agricultural products market.</p><p>Q: What role does technology play in making regenerative agriculture viable and attractive for smallholders?</p><p>Technology is the great enabler in this transition. It is central to the regenagri approach, democratising access to powerful tools and insights. Through the regenagri digital platform, farmers can accurately monitor the health of their soil, track water usage, and measure positive impacts on biodiversity and carbon sequestration.</p><p>This provides data-driven insights that empower smallholders to make informed decisions, optimise their practices, enhance productivity, and minimise their environmental footprint. Crucially, technology makes the process of verification and certification more efficient, scalable, and accessible for even the smallest farms, ensuring no one is left behind in this agricultural revolution.</p><p>Q: Looking ahead, how might this partnership between ICA and regenagri evolve over the next five years?</p><p>I see our collaboration deepening profoundly, becoming a cornerstone of our global strategy. Over the next five years, we anticipate a wave of adoption of regenagri standards across our vast network of ICA cooperatives, catalysing systemic and lasting change throughout global agriculture. We envision a future of enhanced data integration, where insights from millions of farms create a powerful feedback loop for continuous improvement. We will work to build a robust and vibrant global marketplace dedicated to regenerative products. Ultimately, this partnership will firmly establish cooperatives as the undisputed global leaders in sustainable agriculture, serving as a powerful demonstration of how our business model can deliver profound and positive environmental and socio-economic impacts.</p><p>Q: What is your message to policy makers in Sri Lanka and globally on the subject of regenerative agriculture?</p><p>My message is clear: regenerative agriculture is not merely a good practice-it is an essential policy for the 21st century. Policymakers must awaken to the immense potential that regenerative systems hold for building climate resilience, fostering sustainable economic growth, and advancing social equity. Governments have a critical role to play. By actively supporting regenerative practices through education, infrastructure development, research, and forward-thinking incentives, they can unlock transformative outcomes for rural communities and the health of our planet. Sri Lanka has the potential to become a shining example for the world, demonstrating how progressive policy and unified cooperative action can forge a future of agricultural sustainability and widespread rural prosperity.</p><p>Q: How optimistic are you that regenerative agriculture will become the norm rather than the exception?</p><p>I am incredibly optimistic, more so now than ever. We are witnessing a historic global momentum, a powerful convergence of forces. This change is being pulled by conscious consumer demand, pushed by the undeniable urgency of the climate crisis, and propelled by a new understanding of true value. The principles of regenerative agriculture resonate deeply with the innate values that farmers have always held-a profound connection to their land, a commitment to their communities, and the desire for economic stability.

For generations, the emerald slopes of this island nation have produced some of the world's finest tea. But that legacy is now increasingly fragile. Beneath the beauty of the rolling tea gardens, a crisis is unfolding in the very soil that sustains them. As that soil depletes, production costs rise, and international markets fundamentally evolve, the Sri Lankan tea industry faces a defining question: will it cling to the familiar, yet failing, practices of the past, or will it pioneer a regenerative future and reaffirm its global leadership?.</p><p>The path forward is not an academic fantasy; it is already being mapped out on the ground. The good news is that Sri Lanka has already taken the first, critical steps. Halgolla Estate, in a landmark achievement, earned the world's first-ever Regenagri certification for a tea estate, a move that instantly put the country on the global sustainability map. Not long after, the Lumbini Tea Valley followed, becoming the first group of smallholders in the world to earn the same prestigious certification. These pioneers, operating at different scales, have definitively proven that regenerative agriculture-a holistic method of farming that actively restores soil health, boosts vital biodiversity, and sequesters atmospheric carbon-is a viable model for both large estates and smallholder collectives.</p><p>But these isolated success stories, however inspiring, will not be enough to turn the tide. If Sri Lanka is to maintain its competitive edge in export markets that are increasingly and aggressively driven by sustainability, it needs a systemic transformation. That monumental shift requires one thing above all else: clear, consistent, and courageous policy support from the Government.</p><p>To be clear, embracing regenerative agriculture is not merely a feel-good idea or a corporate social responsibility initiative; it is a smart and necessary economic strategy. At its core, it directly confronts the industry's most pressing financial challenges. It systematically reduces the reliance on expensive, often imported, agrochemicals that have become a crushing burden for many growers. By rejuvenating the soil, it improves long-term yields, creating a buffer against the notoriously volatile prices in the global tea market. This transition offers growers a pathway to both economic resilience and new streams of revenue. It opens previously inaccessible doors to carbon credit markets and allows producers to command sustainability premiums for their certified products.</p><p>The urgency is underscored by a tectonic shift in international trade regulations. The world is not waiting for Sri Lanka to make up its mind. The European Green Deal, Germany's rigorous Lieferkettengesetz (Supply Chain Act), and the forthcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive are game-changers. These regulations will legally require importers to trace and verify the environmental and social sustainability of their entire supply chains. Independent, verifiable certifications like Regenagri are designed to provide exactly that assurance. Without widespread adoption and alignment, Sri Lankan tea risks a devastating outcome: losing not just its market share to more proactive competitors, but losing market access altogether.</p><p>So what should the Sri Lankan Government do? A six-point policy agenda offers a clear road map</p><p>First, it must rethink and redeploy agricultural subsidies. Current subsidy schemes often favour the very chemical fertilisers and conventional monoculture practices that degrade the soil and lock farmers into a high-cost system. Instead, the Government must implement targeted, performance-based support for regenerative inputs. This means creating time-bound, results-linked subsidy programs for estates and smallholders who commit to adopting these new methods. These subsidies should support compost production, the cultivation of agroforestry seedlings and shade trees, and the use of cover crops and mulching materials. Crucially, they should not be open-ended handouts, but should be tied to real ecological outcomes, such as measured increases in soil organic carbon or a verifiable reduction in chemical inputs.</p><p>Second, the Government must invest in robust extension services and farmer training to close the significant technical know-how gap. Many tea farmers, particularly smallholders, are simply unaware of viable alternatives to the high-input chemical model they have been taught for decades. This is where key institutions like the Department of Agriculture and the Tea Research Institute must step in decisively. The strategy should include placing dedicated regenerative agriculture officers in every tea-producing district, establishing demonstration plots to showcase model practices, and integrating regenerative curricula into farmer field schools and tea factory networks. Partnering with expert organisations like Solidaridad, which has already supported Regenagri implementation in Sri Lanka and India, would ensure global best practices are adapted to local realities.</p><p>Third, this transformation cannot rest on public funds alone; it requires Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to de-risk investment and scale adoption. A formal PPP framework, perhaps under the Plantation Ministry or the Export Development Board (EDB), could convene stakeholders and coordinate efforts. This would encourage banks to offer preferential green loans to regenerative estates, motivate tea exporters to co-invest in pilot programs to secure their own certified supply chains, and foster collaboration with agritech startups that can provide digital tools for monitoring soil health and biodiversity.</p><p>Fourth, Sri Lanka must leverage its leadership with powerful export incentives and branding support. If the nation wants to be recognised as a global leader in regenerative tea, it must help its exporters market that unique distinction. The EDB and Sri Lanka Tea Board should offer export tax incentives for Regenagri-certified tea, feature it prominently in trade delegations and international expos, and develop a 'Ceylon Regenerative' brand seal as a powerful sibling to the famed 'Pure Ceylon Tea' mark. This branding must target not just bulk buyers, but the high-end specialty tea markets in Europe, North America, and Japan, where ethical sourcing and climate claims are rewarded with significant price premiums and long-term contracts.</p><p>Fifth, the Government must actively support participation in the global carbon market. This remains one of the least understood but potentially most lucrative benefits of this transition. Regenagri-certified estates can meticulously measure and verify the carbon stored in their soils and vegetation, which allows them to sell valuable carbon credits on international markets. The Government can facilitate this by formally recognising Regenagri under any future national carbon registry, helping estates navigate complex global standards like Verra or Gold Standard, and creating pooled carbon trading platforms to benefit smallholders. This could provide growers with an estimated $15 to $30 per tonne of CO2 sequestered, creating a vital new revenue stream.</p><p>Finally, for any of this to scale, there must be deep legal and institutional alignment. This requires embedding regenerative agriculture as a core pillar of the National Export Strategy and amending the Tea Control Act to include provisions for sustainable production. A light-touch, enabling regulatory environment that rewards ecological stewardship and supports innovation is all that is needed. Furthermore, the Government should actively channel international development aid, particularly from OECD countries, towards these programs to secure concessional financing and technical assistance.</p><p>Sri Lanka has a precious head start, but the window of opportunity is closing fast. While Sri Lanka deliberates, its competitors are acting; India is already aiming to bring 100,000 hectares under certification in the next three years.</p><p>This is not just about sustainability; it is about economic survival, global relevance, and intergenerational justice.</p><p>The tools are on the table. The pioneers have shown the way.</p><p>All that's needed now is policy support and coordinated action.</p><p>Let's make regenerative tea not just our future-but our signature.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Halgolla Estate, in a landmark achievement, earned the world's first-ever Regenagri certification for a tea estate, a move that instantly put the country on the global sustainability map.

Furthermore, this event has been used to vilify the regenerative agriculture movement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sri Lankan crisis has brought deep sufferings in the neighbouring country. Food and agriculture seem to be at the centre stage of this crisis. Several commentators have blamed Sri Lanka's decision to go organic as the root cause of this crisis. Furthermore, this event has been used to vilify the worldwide regenerative agriculture movement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Organic farming has also been a project of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi Government. It was during his tenure that the Paramparagat Kheti mission was launched. Did we take the wrong step, too? But at a deeper level, has our traditional agricultural wisdom been wrong? Could organic methods even work? I had a lot of questions, and widespread slander against natural farming did not go down well either. So I began meeting some Indian experts to figure this one out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First on the list was Ashok Gulati, agri-economist and professor at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), New Delhi. It was an unusually hot April afternoon. I walked into the India Habitat Centre office. It was a very neat-looking place, with dark wooden furniture.</p><p>Green Revolution</p><p>After half an hour of intense discussion, I asked him about Sri Lanka: Is organic farming the real problem? Gulati took me down the memory lane and said, \"Norman Bourlog said that you cannot feed more than 4 billion people without chemicals. Now we are at 7.9 billion, how are we going to feed the world? Organic farming cannot feed the whole world. After fall, before the Green Revolution, everything was organic anyway, and India too was caught in the ship to mouth scenario.\"</p><p>\"Organic is good for the niche markets, but scaling it up for a whole country requires a proper assessment of demand and supply. In organic agriculture, yields for most crops are likely to be lower than those that are given for chemical fertilizers. If the natural resource endowment of the country cannot feed the entire population through organic produce, it should be ready to import produce and food. That is the problem with Sri Lanka. Now they do not have enough foreign exchange to import goods. Hence the problem,\" he added.</p><p>At this point I remember meeting a famous Sri Lankan novelist in March at the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF). He too had criticised the Government's decision to ban agri-chemicals. Various reports pointed in the same direction.</p><p>Sri Lanka's tryst with industrial agriculture has not always been pleasant. The British-era plantations had destroyed much of the native biodiversity and newer crops like oil palm had further threatened the fragile ecosystem. Plus, certain agri chemicals have also caused kidney failures for over 40,000 people in the island nation.</p><p>Next I caught up with well-known environmentalist Prof. Vandana Shiva, given her position in the matter. She was wearing a dark blue sari with a white embroidered border. So, was organic fertilizer the main problem in Sri Lanka? She answered, \"the Sri Lanka crisis is a debt crisis, a financial crisis which was aggravated by the high costs of COVID.\"</p><p>Organic farming</p><p>We spoke for another hour about the various issues and alleged propaganda against organic farming. But then our conversation took a serious turn. She explained, \"the food crisis in Sri Lanka has deeper roots than a six-month ban on the import of various agri-chemicals. A short-term policy of an import ban is not an organic policy. We need to look to Cuba for a full-fledged organic policy in the face of a fuel and fertilizer supply stoppage due to sanctions [imposed by the US].\"</p><p>But what is the way out of this mess? She answered, \"the solution to the Sri Lanka crisis is the restoration of democracy, including economic democracy, so that the people of Sri Lanka can choose the development options that provide for their basic needs instead of trapping them in debt further. A participatory policy for food sovereignty has become an imperative need for every country in times of Climate Change, wars, and economic and ecological collapse.\"</p><p>Of course, she believed that organic was the way out of malnutrition, disease and Climate Change for the world. \"Organic farming is an entire system. You have to rejuvenate the soils, biodiversity, local communities, etc. But Sri Lanka should have carefully planned this step, keeping all the factors in mind to achieve the coveted organic label,\" she added.</p><p>I had heard two sides on the issue, and still was not done. Next I got talking with former Agriculture Secretary of India Siraj Husain, to see where he saw the gaps. \"I do not think Sri Lanka's May 2021 decision to halt the import of chemical fertilizers is the only reason for the current economic woes there,\" he said.</p><p>But was this an administrative failure? Has the Government machinery including the bureaucracy failed? \"A country cannot become 100 per cent organic in the short term. If the entire production is organic, the premium on organic produce will crash and farmers will be left with lower production. The present economic woes are also due to the nationalistic politics of their President,\" Siraj said.</p><p>What can India do? Siraj had a clear solution. \"India can give wheat and rice as we had given Afghanistan a few years back during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government. Recently also, we have given wheat to Afghanistan and it has been sent via Wagah through Pakistan. We can come to aid Sri Lanka too, and help ameliorate the issue.\"</p><p>For the final word, I caught up with Sukhpal Singh, Professor at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad. \"The chemical fertilizer ban was imposed only about eight months back and was partly relaxed within a few months. Maybe only one crop season has been partly affected by this sudden change in policy which no doubt should have been implemented more gradually, though there could be other compulsions for that. Therefore, putting the entire blame of the Sri Lankan economic crisis on the policy shift to organic farming can only be a half-truth,\" he said.</p><p>After hearing different viewpoints, I was not worried about the Indian organic mission. The Indian Government seems to have a graded plan for ecological restoration through regenerative agriculture. Apart from environmental and health benefits, it is also offloading the rising fertilizer and fuel subsidies. Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) and other nitrogen-based fertilizers may soon be as precious as gold. I was reassured that India won't go the Sri Lanka way. But of course, I was certain that organic farming was not the main culprit. Bad policy decisions taken haphazardly would be closer to the truth.</p><p>(The writer is an independent agri-policy analyst and the former Director, Policy and Outreach, National Seed Association of India)</p><p>- FirstPost</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

I can literally see it at my front door. My figs ripened in October 2024, which has never happened before as it was never warm enough during that month. In my home state of Oregon, wildfires set new records this year, with almost 2 million acres burned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, in my hometown, Eugene, we had the longest stretch of consecutive days when temperatures reached at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. It's hard for me to think about the world that I will leave to my grandchildren. So I look for what I can do, and believe it or not, there's hope right at the grocery store; buying organic can contribute to combating climate change. Organic farmers actually store carbon in the soil, meaning there's less in the air to change our climate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A series of long-term studies mentioned below demonstrate that organic farming increases soil carbon. In other words, organic farming is carbon farming. Federal law defines organic farming as a farming method, so we know what we're buying. Organic farmers use cover crops, mulches, and crop rotations to build healthy soil. They utilize various techniques to prevent pest problems, using only certain pesticides, which have been thoroughly reviewed as a last resort. You can support carbon farming by buying organic.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2023 Synthesis Report states that carbon sequestration in agriculture has one of the highest potentials for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon sequestration, or carbon farming, uses farming techniques to increase soil carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere (For more details about carbon farming and farmers who are using the method, see 'How Land Use Is a Tool for Solving Climate Change' and 'Carbon Farming: A Sustainable Agriculture Technique That Keeps Soil Healthy and Combats Climate Change.')</p><p>Referring to the IPCC recommendations, the World Economic Forum's November 2024 article states, '[E]nhancing soil carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture could sequester up to 23 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050, a substantial portion of the mitigation required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.'</p><p>Studies on Organic Farming and Soil Carbon-the Big Picture</p><p>Organic carbon farming has been documented by scientists for decades. In 2012, researchers from Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy published a meta-analysis of 74 studies that were pairwise comparisons of organic and conventional farms growing various crops around the world-from all continents except for Africa and Antarctica. The researchers measured soil carbon in three ways (if the underlying study provided the necessary data): the soil carbon concentration, the amount of soil carbon per unit area, and the rate at which the soil carbon measurements changed. They found that for all three measurements, soil carbon was greater at the organic farms than conventional farms. They concluded that 'organic farming has the potential to accumulate soil carbon.'</p><p>Meanwhile, a 2017 study by Northeastern University and the Organic Center-which studied more than 1,000 soil samples from both organic and conventional farms across 48 states in the U.S.-'found that organic soils had 13 percent higher soil organic matter and 44 percent higher long-term carbon storage than conventionally managed soils.'</p><p>Crops That May Be on Your Grocery List</p><p>Eating organic fruits and vegetables is better for the environment and has overall health benefits. 'Not only does organic production help reduce public health risks, mounting evidence shows that food grown organically are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, with less exposure to nitrates and pesticide residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables, and grains when compared to conventionally grown products,' states the Organic Trade Association.</p><p>Below is a list of popular items we regularly purchase from grocery stores. I chose these products because they are foods that most of us buy often. For each food, There is at least one study showing that choosing organic can help support carbon sequestration and, therefore, allows us to play our part in combating climate change:</p><p>Corn</p><p>A 2015 review article examined six long-term organic and conventional corn farming comparisons. Each study involved one site, with some plots managed organically and others managed conventionally. Four studies were done in the Midwest, one in California, and one in Maryland. All the studies grew corn in rotation with other crops. The studies were initiated between 1981 and 1998, and these plots had been continuously used for farming between 10 and 24 years when soil carbon was measured.</p><p>In five of the six studies, soil carbon capture increased in instances of organic treatments compared to conventional treatments. (The one exception was a plot that used to be a dairy farm and had high soil carbon levels at the beginning of the study.) The review article concludes, 'These results suggest that organic farming practices have the potential to reduce nitrate leaching, foster carbon sequestration, and allow farmers to remain competitive in the marketplace.'</p><p>Wheat</p><p>An 11-year comparison of organic and conventional wheat farming (with other crops grown in rotation) in Nebraska found that soil organic matter (one way to measure carbon) was higher in the organic plots than in conventional plots.</p><p>Tomato (in rotation with corn)</p><p>California's Century Experiment has compared organic and conventional tomato (and corn) farming since 1993. Measurements of soil organic carbon showed that the concentrations in organic plots were two to three times higher than in the conventional plots. The study authors noted that the increases occurred throughout the soil profile, down to a depth of 6 feet.</p><p>Potato (in rotation with wheat and corn)</p><p>A long-term field study in Switzerland that compared organic and conventional farming systems showed that soil organic carbon was higher in the organic plots. The researchers collected soil samples over two decades after the experiment started. A study in Germany found that while carbon was sequestered in the organic plots for more than 15 years, in the conventional plots, the soil lost carbon.</p><p>Almonds</p><p>In 2018 and 2019, researchers in California compared eight conventional almond orchards with eight organic orchards. (The researchers identified the organic orchards as 'regenerative,' but all were certified organic.) The trees in the orchards had been growing for between three and 38 years. Total soil carbon was about 30 percent greater in organic orchards than in conventional orchards. The researchers concluded: 'Our results support the notion that converting agriculture to regenerative systems could contribute to remediating several imminent global problems, including climate change diminishing water resources, biodiversity loss, agricultural pollution, human health problems, and diminishing rural economies.'</p><p>Strawberries (in rotation with broccoli and lettuce)</p><p>In 2004 and 2005, researchers, mainly from Washington State University, compared 13 pairs of organic and conventional strawberry farms in Watsonville, California. The farms had been either organic or conventional for at least five years. They found that the amount of carbon in the soil from organic farms was higher than 21 percent compared to conventional farms.</p><p>Apples</p><p>Scientists from Washington State University and the United States Agency for International Development compared conventional and organic apple production in a commercial orchard in the Yakima Valley. Trees were planted in 1994, and soil measurements were taken in 1998. At that time, soil organic carbon in the organic plots was about 15 percent higher than in the conventional plots.</p><p>Citrus</p><p>Two studies, one from Brazil and the other from Italy, showed that total organic soil carbon was higher in organic citrus orchards than in conventional orchards. The increase in soil carbon was 30 percent in the Italian study and 300 percent in some Brazilian measurements.</p><p>Extra Benefits</p><p>Organic farming benefits people who grow and harvest food because they are exposed to fewer pesticides. According to a 2024 study from California, researchers looked for seven common herbicides and two fungicides in carpet dust from homes in the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. The frequency at which each pesticide was detected and its amount increased in homes where larger amounts of pesticides were used nearby. None of these pesticides are used on organic farms.</p><p>'Our findings suggest that most of these herbicides and fungicides travel from the field via primary and secondary drift to homes in the surrounding area, potentially impacting the health of children and other vulnerable groups,' the study published in Environmental International states.</p><p>Organic farming also benefits those of us who eat the food. In 2024, Consumer Reports (CR) analyzed pesticide contamination of 59 common fruits and vegetables. The data came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spanning seven years, and included both conventional and organic produce. The analysis by CR found that pesticide contamination posed significant risks in 20 percent of conventional foods but in almost none of the organic foods. Eating more organic produce ensures a healthier diet.</p><p>Tackling a Global Problem With Personal Choices</p><p>Climate change is an enormous and complex problem, and the solutions are also complex. There's no single silver bullet that can fix the crisis, including carbon farming. Even its proponents state that converting power generation to solar or wind energy and reducing the destruction of natural ecosystems are more significant measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>However, while organic food is sometimes hard to find and more expensive, it is a relatively simple step that many of us can incorporate into our daily lives, providing a crucial opportunity to help mitigate climate change.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2023 Synthesis Report states that carbon sequestration in agriculture has one of the highest potentials for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

This model, which follows a 'take, make, dispose' approach, has led to environmental degradation and resource depletion. The circular economy, on the other hand, emphasizes the principles of reducing, reusing, and recycling, aiming to create a closed-loop system that minimises waste and conserves natural resources. As Sri Lanka grapples with climate change, pollution, and the depletion of natural resources, the adoption of a circular economy has never been more crucial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Linear Economy: A Recipe for Disaster</p><p>The linear economy operates on a straightforward but ultimately unsustainable principle: extract resources, manufacture products, use them, and then dispose of them. This model has fuelled economic growth and consumerism but at a significant environmental cost. The consequences are evident: mountains of waste in landfills, oceans choked with plastic, and an atmosphere burdened with greenhouse gases. The linear economy relies heavily on finite resources, which are rapidly being depleted, threatening the very foundation of future economic stability and ecological health of the earth.</p><p>The Circular Economy: An Innovative Solution for Sri Lanka</p><p>The circular economy seeks to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits. It involves gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and designing waste out of the system. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital. It is based on three principles: designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems.</p><p>1. Designing Out Waste and Pollution</p><p>In a circular economy, products are designed and optimised for a cycle of disassembly and reuse. This approach eliminates waste by design, ensuring that materials flow continuously through the economy, instead of ending up in landfills. Sri Lankan companies are increasingly adopting eco-design principles, creating products that are easier to repair, upgrade, and recycle. This shift not only conserves resources but also reduces pollution and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>2. Keeping Products and Materials in Use</p><p>The circular economy promotes a shift from ownership to access, encouraging practices such as leasing, sharing, and recycling. By keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible, Sri Lanka can significantly reduce the demand for new resources. For example, the fashion industry is exploring rental and resale models, while the electronics sector is embracing repair and refurbishment programmes. These initiatives not only extend the lifecycle of products but also create new business opportunities and jobs in Sri Lanka.</p><p>3. Regenerating Natural Systems</p><p>Unlike the linear economy, which depletes natural resources, the circular economy aims to regenerate them. This involves returning valuable nutrients to the soil and other ecosystems, enhancing their capacity to regenerate. Practices such as composting organic waste and adopting regenerative agriculture techniques can restore soil health, increase biodiversity, and sequester carbon. By working in harmony with nature, the circular economy helps to rebuild natural capital and create resilient ecosystems in Sri Lanka.</p><p>The Role of Technology and Innovation in Sri Lanka</p><p>Technological advancements play a pivotal role in the transition to a circular economy. Innovations in digital technology, biotechnology, and materials science are driving the development of circular solutions. For instance, digital platforms facilitate the sharing economy, enabling people to share resources like cars, tools, and even living spaces. Biotechnology is advancing the production of biodegradable materials and bio-based products, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, advances in materials science are leading to the creation of more durable, recyclable, and non-toxic materials.</p><p>Business and Policy: Key Enablers in Sri Lanka</p><p>The successful implementation of a circular economy requires collaboration between businesses, policymakers, and consumers. Businesses need to embrace circular principles in their operations, supply chains, and product designs. This involves rethinking business models, investing in sustainable technologies, and fostering a culture of innovation. Many companies in Sri Lanka are already leading the way, demonstrating that circular practices can drive profitability and competitive advantage.</p><p>Policymakers play a crucial role in creating an enabling environment for the circular economy. This includes developing regulations and incentives that promote sustainable practices, such as extended producer responsibility, tax incentives for circular activities, and firm waste management regulations. The government can also support research and development in circular technologies and foster public-private partnerships to drive systemic change.</p><p>Consumer Engagement: A Collective Effort in Sri Lanka</p><p>Ultimately, the success of the circular economy pivots on consumer behaviour. Public awareness and education are essential to inspire individuals to adopt sustainable practices. Consumers can contribute by making conscious choices, such as buying durable products, repairing rather than replacing items, and participating in recycling programmes. By embracing a circular mindset, individuals in Sri Lanka can reduce their environmental footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The transition to a circular economy represents a transformative shift in how we produce, consume, and manage our natural resources. It offers a convincing vision for a sustainable future, where economic growth is decoupled from environmental degradation, and resources are used efficiently and responsibly. While the journey to a fully circular economy is complex and challenging, it is also filled with opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and positive change. By embracing the principles of the circular economy, Sri Lanka can build a resilient, prosperous, and sustainable country for generations to come.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Regenerating Natural SystemsUnlike the linear economy, which depletes natural resources, the circular economy aims to regenerate them.

However since the introduction of tea to the island since the 1800s, the tea sector has largely drifted away from sustainable practices to a more profit-driven sector. Practices such as growing trees in areas where forest lands were cleared to grow more tea don't exist today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is why institutions such as the Rainforest Alliance have now come forward to empower the estate community, plantation companies and other stakeholders to work together. The Rainforest Alliance has been operating in Sri Lanka for over a decade and creating a positive environmental and social impact on a vast expanse of land coming under the purview of plantation companies, bringing them under more sustainable agriculture practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certification as a tool of sustainability</p><p>The Rainforest Alliance certification program is one of the key tools for driving sustainability at scale. Working alongside partners in diverse sectors including bananas, cocoa, tea, and coffee across 58 countries -it helps maximise the positive social, environmental, and economic impact of agriculture, while offering farmers a framework to improve their livelihoods and protect the landscapes where they live and work.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, the programme has been active since 2008, predominantly in the tea sector. Of the 20 privately owned companies in the country, 18 have since received Rainforest Alliance certification, now following criteria spanning aspects such as biodiversity conservation, better labour practices and integrated pest management. This certification extends to approximately 170 estates, marking a significant stride towards environmental and social responsibility in Sri Lanka's tea industry. Independent, third-party auditors evaluate farmers against the Rainforest Alliance's requirements before rewarding or renewing certification.</p><p>The Rainforest Alliance believes that workers around the world should be paid enough money to provide a decent life for themselves and their families. Currently, tea producers face challenges and have insufficient profits to meet their increasing cost of production and act in compliance with requirements and workers' demands. \"The cost of production is high and producers feel that they are not adequately compensated with corresponding prices. Herein lies the imperative for shared responsibility along the supply chain,\" observes Dr. Madhuri Nanda, Director South Asia at Rainforest Alliance. \"For genuine sustainability in supply chains, the costs and benefits of production need to be evenly distributed between farmers and buyers, so that both are rewarded for their efforts to embrace more sustainable practices,\" said Dr. Nanda. Often, only a small part of the value of production reaches the farmer, though they bear most of the risks, burden of sustainability compliance, and impacts of climate change. Jehan CanagaRetna, the Rainforest Alliance's Country Representative for Sri Lanka shared that the tea smallholders account for 70% of Sri Lanka's exports and a challenge arises in terms of certification. \"Because of who Sri Lanka exports to and ships to; 80% of our exports go to countries such as Iran, Iraq and the Middle East, Russia and Turkey where certification is not as important when compared to the West. This is a challenge we face on a day-to-day basis,\" says CanagaRetna. He further adds that the increased demand for commodities carrying certification from the West and other regions could not only enhance market value, but also encourage positive changes in production practices, ultimately creating a bigger impact on the ground.</p><p>To help overcome the economic challenge for producers, Rainforest Alliance has introduced two key requirements for companies in its certification program. \"One is the Sustainability Differential, which is a mandatory additional cash payment made to certified producers over and above the market price of the commodity. The other are Sustainability Investments which are mandatory cash or in-kind investments from buyers of Rainforest Alliance certified products to certified producers for the specific purpose of helping them meet the farm requirements outlined in the Rainforest Alliance's Sustainable Agriculture Standard,\"</p><p>he explains.</p><p>One of the other benefits of the certification programme seen in Sri Lanka is crop diversification, a strategy that has helped retain labour during off seasons. \"Crop diversification, as part of our standard, has led estates to overcome losses and become more profitable over time,\" explains Dr. Nanda. \"It allows workers to harvest different crops during the off-season, providing additional income, motivation, and better wages on tea estates,\" she adds.</p><p>The Rainforest Alliance understands the importance of its certification programme as a strategic building block for identifying and addressing root causes of systemic issues, but underscores that, it cannot be used as a standalone tool, especially when it comes to human rights.\"Audits may not always uncover human rights violations such as gender discrimination and freedom of association. That's why the Rainforest Alliance Certification Program employs an assess-and-address approach, which supports farms in developing trackable systems for preventing, identifying, monitoring, and remediating against key human rights issues,\" she says.</p><p>Dr. Nanda also explained that social issues need more delicate approaches to be effectively addressed. \"Workers, for instance, may not trust auditors and making it challenging to delve into sensitive topics during audits. To overcome these challenges, we're enhancing grievance mechanisms and transparency through partnerships with local NGOs closely connected to estate communities, which have already earned the trust of workers,\" she says.</p><p>Beyond Certification.</p><p>Having been present globally for more than 35 years, the Rainforest Alliance has evolved beyond mere certification. Dr.Nanda underscores their landscape level interventions and collaborative efforts with corporate partners, like Unilever and Kirin Beverages/ Holdings who have been actively engaging in supply chain initiatives such as training and supporting tea smallholders and Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs). The focus lies on assisting these companies, and others in incorporating sustainable practices into the tea industry.</p><p>With the support from Kirin, the Rainforest Alliance has successfully trained around 200 youth from the estate sector in biodiversity issues within tea landscapes, empowering them to become champions of nature.</p><p>The youth programme has not only equipped individuals to become naturalists, but has also enabled them to train other community members. Notably, some participants have been hired by the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS). CanagaRetna adds: \"With Unilever's support, we have also been conducting leopard education and awareness programmes within the estates, fostering community engagement by bringing together thalaivars (male leaders), thalaivees (female leaders) and field officers. We also did a small pilot involving forest mapping in the Sinharaja buffer zone to gain insights into deforestation issues in the region.\"</p><p>The Rainforest Alliance organizes periodic stakeholder engagement events to collect feedback from its members regarding the certification program. Dr. Nanda reports: \"In a recent stakeholder forum, many representatives shared their views on the standard, discussing ways to enhance its implementation in Sri Lanka. In fact, some representatives expressed interest in initiatives like leopard awareness and micro- watershed conservation within their estates, aiming to bringing tangible benefits to the tea communities\".</p><p>Through partnerships with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and supported by the Global Environmental Facility, the Rainforest Alliance is expanding its focus to landscape level issues in the Eastern and Western Ghats of India. \"While certification primarily concentrates on farm level issues, interventions at landscape level provide opportunities to address broader environmental issues, such as land degradation and biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Strengthening sustainability - way forward</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is one cornerstone in the Rainforest Alliance's approach. Therefore, good soil and weed management, integrated pest management are certain aspects to be considered in regenerative agriculture. Incorporating these practices in the long-run can increase productivity, efficiency and resilience of the tea industry \"Through the regenerative agriculture approach, we could build more resilience towards climate change among vulnerable communities,\" Dr. Nanda explains further. \"We strive to develop contextualised solutions to improve soil health and promote adaptive capacities to address the impacts of flooding, landslides and other extreme environmental events - mostly triggered by climate change - that are impacting the tea sector,\" says Dr. Nanda.</p><p>To strengthen sustainability in the sector, the Rainforest Alliance recognises the need for greater collaboration and partnerships. To this effect, the Rainforest Alliance is actively collaborating with organizations such as the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), with which it works to conserve micro watersheds within the tea landscapes while fulfilling PHDT's mandate of developing housing and infrastructure for tea estate workers. Moreover, the Rainforest Alliance has formed a partnership with the National Institute for Plantation Management (NIPM), to jointly develop a curriculum that integrates sustainability concepts into existing courses. The Rainforest Alliance standard has been incorporated into the NIPM diploma, with the first semester commencing in July 2023. \"A lot of work carried out by these organisations aligns with our standard,\" she continues adding \"With such partnerships we strive for a wider outreach.\"</p><p>Youth engagement -The retention of youth in the sector- has become a challenge as the industry is not attractive to them anymore. \"One or two regional plantation companies are innovating and adjusting job titles with the aim of motivating their workforce and enhancing the overall appeal of the roles,\" CanagaRetna adds. \"We understand that behavioural change is the most difficult task to bring, which is why there is a need for more incentives, motivation and a vision for the youth. We look forward to working with more youth in the future because they are the future of the tea sector in Sri Lanka,\" concludes CanagaRetna.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

They are particularly valuable as a plant-based protein source for vegetarians and vegans. Besides protein, it's packed with essential nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, vitamins, and minerals, contributing to a balanced diet. The demand for soy-based products has surged globally, driven by the growing popularity of plant-based diets and the need for sustainable food sources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Soybean oil is widely used in cooking and food processing.

Besides food, soybeans are now used in the manufacture of various industrial products, such as inks, plastics, and adhesives, contributing to more sustainable manufacturing practices.</p><p>US Soy's role in the global context</p><p>With consumer demand for protein taking a huge leap forward every year globally, US Soy plays a crucial role as a leading exporter to many parts of the world in addition to their strong domestic markets. Currently, nearly 60% of US Soy products are exported. US farmers are expected to produce 4.6 billion bushels of soybeans for the 2024/25 crop and supply estimates up 11% over last year, according to USDA.</p><p>While soybeans are sold as a commodity oilseed, research continues to show that soy from the US is a premium product that increases operational efficiencies for livestock farms, feed mills, and oil crushers; introduces better flavour profiles in the soy foods sector, and exemplifies on-farm stewardship and conservation efforts, giving it the lowest carbon footprint.</p><p>Sri Lanka's need for soy and the poultry industry</p><p>A significant portion of global soybean production is used as animal feed, particularly for poultry, swine, and aquaculture. As meat consumption rises, especially in developing countries, the demand for soybeans in this sector increases.

The US soybean meal imports to Sri Lanka were estimated at $ 101 million in 2023, making it the largest importer in the region. The textured soy requirement is equal to about 12,000 metric tons (MT) per year. The major non-genetically modified organism (GMO) soyfood product in Sri Lanka is soy nuggets.</p><p>Despite the high input costs in the sector, poultry production continues to be profitable, and industry players go beyond just numbers to source sustainable and quality feeds and ingredients that come at a premium, and consumers are increasingly shifting towards choosing sustainable products. US Soy enjoys more than 70% market share in the country, with the industry showing a strong preference based on the essential amino acid profile, higher digestibility, lower fibre and reliable supply chain that US Soy has. And the industry's leaders understand the value proposition of US Soy, who in turn want to give customers products that truly are sustainable.</p><p>USSEC strongly believes that Sri Lanka's poultry industry deserves a lot of credit, with tremendous leaders and people, leading the region in terms of cold chain, hygienic slaughter processing, environmentalism and sustainability. As a result, one could see a very high preference for Sri Lankan poultry in foreign markets. When compared to other countries, Sri Lanka is right at the top when it comes to such characteristics with impressive facilities. Despite its smaller scale given its size, the industry is very confident, resilient and forward looking</p><p>US Soy leading the way</p><p>The primary soybean-producing countries are the US, Brazil, and Argentina. Global soybean production has been increasing, driven by expanding acreage and improvements in yield due to better agricultural practices and biotechnology. Overall demand for US Soy remains strong both domestically and internationally. Exports and their continued growth are critical for the US Soy complex. Currently, nearly 60% of US Soy products are exported. The US Soy is an optimal nutritional bundle that is backed by science, mathematics, and data, and one with the highest level of digestible acids and metabolism activity. High in value, it provides the optimum level of profitability for customers. US Soy farmers this year anticipate a higher yield with favourable weather conditions in recent weeks.</p><p>The US Soybean Export Council (USSEC) greatly contributed to US Soy market, with the goal of gaining market access, differentiating US soybeans for use in aquaculture, livestock feed, and human consumption in more than 80 countries worldwide, and elevating consumer preference. Members of USSEC include related agribusinesses, agricultural organisations, commodity shippers, merchandisers, US Soy farmers, and processors. Together, they represent the whole soy supply chain. USSEC hosts events such as the SoyConnext every year where it brings people together to connect, interact, and make networks.</p><p>Climate change is an incredibly important aspect. For US Soy farmers, raising soy sustainably is a very important topic of concern. Deforestation, carbon intensity, land use change (LUC), and related are other issues at play. Food and nutrition security is another, as the world has an abundant number of calories it's very deficient in protein and USSEC's 'Right to Protein' initiative actively advocates in this regard. Through such a lens, one should find ways in how to satisfy the nutrient requirements of 8 billion people while doing so in an environmentally sustainable manner, and US Soy sits at the nexus of that conversation globally and in South Asia and Sri Lanka alike.</p><p>Sustainability at the helm of US Soy</p><p>US Soy is different from soy in other regions for several different factors, primarily with farmers having focused on sustainability for over a century. From the times of the Great Depression, the industry has looked at soil conservation measures and the development of agencies by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to focus on working with landowners on soil conservation has had a significant impact.</p><p>Within the US, 97% of the farms are family-owned, and these farmers constantly work on improving their operations, passing their legacy and land to the next generation, in a better shape than they received it. Farmers in the US focus on precision agriculture, conservation tillage, cover crops, and just about all areas in regenerative agriculture. All of these efforts lead to the reduction of the carbon footprint of US Soy, which has one of the lowest compared to other regions. This is largely enabled by sustainable production practices including land use change (LUC) which is comparatively lower than countries like Brazil and Argentina because of their deforestation and land conversion. Transportation within the US also has a huge advantage in contrast to other countries due to its efficient infrastructure for the transportation of soy as it relies heavily on barge and rail which is very eco-friendly as opposed to trucks.</p><p>The USDA also has a wide range of programs such as the long-standing Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) where farmers enter contracts to take productive land out of production and provide an eco-service. Last year, the USDA also introduced partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities grants, focused on increasing and improving farms including incentives and compensation.</p><p>USSEC also announced recently that the US Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol (SSAP) has achieved a gold-level equivalency against the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform's Farm Sustainability Assessment 3.0, which looks at the sustainable inputs into products and has a standard evaluation process. The SSAP is a protocol that outlines the regulations, processes, and management practices that ensure sustainable soy production on US soybean farms. It is a national system of sustainability and conservation laws and regulations combined with careful implementation of best production practices on more than 270,000 US soybean farms. Last year, around 70% of the exports had the SSAP certificate.</p><p>Another new addition of the US Soy SSAP is that international customers of US Soy can now request the inclusion of their soy purchase's carbon footprint on their SSAP certificate and USSEC is the first organisation to use the GFLI in this manner to be able to share with its customers what the carbon footprint is of the soy they are purchasing so that they can choose to use it in their scope 3 or any other sustainability reporting. This data, sourced from the Global Feed LCA Institute (GFLI) database, offers a calculation based on the quantity of soy purchased and can be used in their carbon accounting.</p><p>Shift from carb to protein globally and US Soy's role</p><p>The world is experiencing a shift from food security to nutrition security globally. With many understanding the role of having a healthy balanced diet or one with high protein content coupled with increases in disposable income, their first step would be to replace their carbohydrates with some type of protein which can be either animal protein or plant protein.</p><p>The Right to Protein is a consumer awareness and advocacy program by USSEC that is designed to be a catalyst for this, supporting emerging markets by helping consumers, governments, and companies understand the role of what the protein plays within the diet, especially among young and developing children. USSEC is seeing a tremendous shift and intake in countries across South Asia in both animal and plant-based proteins producers, all concentrated in the increase of consumption or protein. The way US Soy plays a role is by taking a holistic approach as soy is a primary ingredient in many animal protein feeds, and being an ingredient in soy-based food. USSEC has a crucial leadership role in the protein consumption conversation and as a leader in this narrative, they are witnessing the importance of protein in major discussions in the highest level of governments around the world.</p><p>Sri Lanka setting a benchmark in the region</p><p>In July last year, a leading local poultry producer, New Anthoney's Farms adopted the 'Fed with Sustainable US Soy' label on their products, making them the first in the entire South Asian and Sub-Saharan Africa region. 10 other producers followed suit and signed licensing agreements. Despite its smaller industry size compared to its neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka's poultry and livestock industry has continued to uphold and increase its quality, efficiency, and capabilities, with significant investments and efforts towards adopting sustainability across its entire operations and supply chain.</p><p>This year's Soy Connext recognised a few of the companies including Sri Lanka's New Anthoney's Group and Happy Hen (Switz Lanka) for using the Sustainable US Soy and the 'Fed with US Sustainable Soy' label, which are used by 120 companies in 18 different countries and across over 1,000 products. It's a great showcase of companies using sustainable products throughout their supply chain and allowing consumers to make choices as they look at labelling. A very recent one was the 7-Eleven convenience store chain in Japan which began using the logo in their tofu bars, assuring customers they're making the right decisions when it comes to sustainability in products.</p><p>The label shows end consumers that their products are committed to environmentally friendly and sustainable practices. It helps them add value to their brands. It helps them differentiate their brand in the marketplace thereby capturing market share. It helps them attract a higher level of talent. A speech highlight at Soy Connext mentioned that a company based in Korea was able to increase its sales by 21% since the label's adoption.</p><p>USSEC is seeing an uptake in companies opting for the Sustainable US Soy and the 'Fed with US Sustainable Soy' labels in their packaging including in South Asia. With Sri Lanka pioneering in such aspects and very much leaning into green agriculture and initiatives, the country could take advantage of export opportunities and tie into the importance of global environmental sustainability.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["From the times of the Great Depression, the industry has looked at soil conservation measures and the development of agencies by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to focus on working with landowners on soil conservation has had a significant impact.

The two-day convention, themed \"Tea : A Lifestyle and a Livelihood,\" has been jointly organized by the Colombo Tea Traders</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Association and the Sri Lanka Tea Board. An exhibition featuring tea producers and related businesses in Sri Lanka was also part of the event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industry experts, leading brands, and social organizations from numerous countries, including Kenya, China, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Gulf countries, and the United States, gathered at the convention, representing the entire global tea value chain from crop to cup.</p><p>During the ceremony, Mr. Sanjay Herath, Chairman of the Colombo Tea Traders Association, presented a special souvenir to President Ranil Wickremesinghe.</p><p>Addressing the gathering the President further elaborated,</p><p>As we are meeting here today, the Parliament is debating the Economic Transformation Bill. I need not tell you what we underwent in the last four years. But as we emerge from bankruptcy, we must remember that we still need foreign exchange to pay for our goods. The decision of the government is to transform the economy in the next decade into a highly competitive, export-oriented economy based on net zero and digitalization. The principles and institutions are contained in this bill, which is being debated today.</p><p>I hope both sides of the house will vote for it, though there is a big question mark. Nevertheless, I don't intend to speak on the bill itself but to refer to the role that the tea industry has in achieving this transformation. Our transformation from a feudal economy to a modern economy in the 19th and 20th centuries was driven by our plantation industry, by tea. A lot of modernization methods may not have come into being if there had been no tea industry. And certainly, Ella would not have been a tourist attraction without the tea industry coming into being.</p><p>So now we are at the next stage. And let's be realistic. We are a country that broke up our capital formation, which came out of land and plantations, for about 30-40 years. Now we are trying to recapture that and to bring plantations up to play a role in the future.</p><p>So let me first tell you the first step. I don't think we need plantations. We need a thriving agro-business, both of smallholders and large management companies, who will look at the highest earnings possible. So that is the beginning.</p><p>We have to start reforming from inside. Of that, two measures I must mention: one, the need to resolve the issue of remunerations. We have to remember that those who worked in the plantations are some of the people who are at the worst end of the bankruptcy in the country. Secondly, to ensure that we transition to agro-business, we will now extract all the line room areas and the surrounding areas and take them back to the government to re-gazette them as villages so that the line room concept will disappear as people start building.</p><p>But then, that's the part of the world we live in. No one lives next to a factory. They come from nearby. If you go to the coconut estates, we don't have anyone living on the lands that belong to us. This is especially because the multi-dimensional poverty indicators in Nuwara Eliya are very high, higher than some of the northern areas that were affected by the war. So these are some of the issues we have to resolve.</p><p>Thirdly, there is the question of the debt incurred by some of the enterprises, especially the small enterprises, during this period and how we resolve it. Fourthly, a matter which concerns us and others is the access to the Russian market.</p><p>Sanctions have not in any way set back Russia; they have somehow or other come into Asia. The problem is for those of us who have to trade with Russia, and maybe those will require a new look. But we have to wait for the outcome of the US presidential election. Until then, you have to use your means of how you get your tea across to Russia, which I should not know.</p><p>But what is the model of our enterprises? We have the smallholders, and how does the plantation industry become agribusiness? Are we going to stay only with tea, or are we going to allow smart agriculture in your areas? Give your means. Those could include forestry, and in time to come, there will be land opened up in other parts of the country for agro-businesses to grow. So there are opportunities to explore.</p><p>I have no issue with that. Some of our companies have gone abroad and established themselves elsewhere. That's not a problem with the government as long as we are the biggest player in the game. Subject to that, we can go ahead because Sri Lanka must have a dominating position in the market. But having said that, what is the future of tea? Are people going to drink tea the way we drink tea? What are the Millennials, Gen Z, and all going to do? Now that's your future. And that future is not in Sri Lanka, except for the promotion and the R&amp;D you are doing here. You have to carry your battle straight into these areas, into Europe and America. Are they going to drink iced tea? Are they going to have a tea drink? We do not know.</p><p>To help that, Sri Lanka will bring the climate change legislation and the new environment laws which will enable us to hit net zero even before the target date. So that is the help we can provide there. But what people are going to drink is something you all have to decide. Or will you be eating something with tea? We don't know. We just can't say what it is. And that is where the battle is.</p><p>So we now have to look at the TRI. What have they done, what should they do for the future, and make it a joint partnership between the government, which will provide funding, and the private sector. So I think, in a way, we have to look now not at the tea board or the tea smallholders. They are all there. They all have to be restructured. But the Tea Research Institute and how we will build it up.</p><p>Those are my thoughts on the industry. You ll are the ones who are in the game, and it's for us to look at the future because many of the problems we have mentioned are capable of being settled by us. But we have a future out there. How are we going to keep those markets and expand them? So I wish you all the best in your deliberation.</p><p>Minister for Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera,</p><p>Over the decades, we have embarked on a transformative journey to strengthen and sustain our tea sector. By the end of 2024, we will establish a globally accepted national sustainability standard for Ceylon tea. This is a significant milestone for the Sri Lankan tea sector and a testament to our commitment to addressing the challenges of climate change and ensuring the development and well-being of plantation workers and smallholder farmers. This new standard will guide the development and implementation of a regenerative agriculture model, promoting low-carbon tea production. This multi-procedure approach includes conducting a strong life cycle analysis to ensure our tea production processes are environmentally sustainable and economically valuable.</p><p>This convention is an important forum for Ceylon tea and global stakeholders. We are facing a critical time for tea worldwide, and the theme of this convention, \"Tea: A Lifestyle and a Livelihood,\" is timely and crucial for the tea industry. The conversations planned over the next two days are very important for the industry's future.</p><p>My heartfelt gratitude goes to the Organizing Committee, the Colombo Tea Traders Association, and the Sri Lanka Tea Board for their effort and commitment to making this convention a success.

An exhibition featuring tea producers and related businesses in Sri Lanka was also part of the event.</p><p>Industry experts, leading brands, and social organizations from numerous countries, including Kenya, China, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Gulf countries, and the United States, gathered at the convention, representing the entire global tea value chain from crop to cup.</p><p>During the ceremony, Mr. Sanjay Herath, Chairman of the Colombo Tea Traders Association, presented a special souvenir to President Ranil Wickremesinghe.</p><p>Addressing the gathering the President further elaborated,</p><p>As we are meeting here today, the Parliament is debating the Economic Transformation Bill. I need not tell you what we underwent in the last four years. But as we emerge from bankruptcy, we must remember that we still need foreign exchange to pay for our goods. The decision of the government is to transform the economy in the next decade into a highly competitive, export-oriented economy based on net zero and digitalization. The principles and institutions are contained in this bill, which is being debated today.</p><p>I hope both sides of the house will vote for it, though there is a big question mark. Nevertheless, I don't intend to speak on the bill itself but to refer to the role that the tea industry has in achieving this transformation. Our transformation from a feudal economy to a modern economy in the 19th and 20th centuries was driven by our plantation industry, by tea. A lot of modernization methods may not have come into being if there had been no tea industry. And certainly, Ella would not have been a tourist attraction without the tea industry coming into being.</p><p>So now we are at the next stage. And let's be realistic. We are a country that broke up our capital formation, which came out of land and plantations, for about 30-40 years. Now we are trying to recapture that and to bring plantations up to play a role in the future.</p><p>So let me first tell you the first step. I don't think we need plantations. We need a thriving agro-business, both of smallholders and large management companies, who will look at the highest earnings possible. So that is the beginning.</p><p>We have to start reforming from inside. Of that, two measures I must mention: one, the need to resolve the issue of remunerations. We have to remember that those who worked in the plantations are some of the people who are at the worst end of the bankruptcy in the country. Secondly, to ensure that we transition to agro-business, we will now extract all the line room areas and the surrounding areas and take them back to the government to re-gazette them as villages so that the line room concept will disappear as people start building.</p><p>But then, that's the part of the world we live in. No one lives next to a factory. They come from nearby. If you go to the coconut estates, we don't have anyone living on the lands that belong to us. This is especially because the multi-dimensional poverty indicators in Nuwara Eliya are very high, higher than some of the northern areas that were affected by the war. So these are some of the issues we have to resolve.</p><p>Thirdly, there is the question of the debt incurred by some of the enterprises, especially the small enterprises, during this period and how we resolve it. Fourthly, a matter which concerns us and others is the access to the Russian market.</p><p>Sanctions have not in any way set back Russia; they have somehow or other come into Asia. The problem is for those of us who have to trade with Russia, and maybe those will require a new look. But we have to wait for the outcome of the US presidential election. Until then, you have to use your means of how you get your tea across to Russia, which I should not know.</p><p>But what is the model of our enterprises? We have the smallholders, and how does the plantation industry become agribusiness? Are we going to stay only with tea, or are we going to allow smart agriculture in your areas? Give your means. Those could include forestry, and in time to come, there will be land opened up in other parts of the country for agro-businesses to grow. So there are opportunities to explore.</p><p>I have no issue with that. Some of our companies have gone abroad and established themselves elsewhere. That's not a problem with the government as long as we are the biggest player in the game. Subject to that, we can go ahead because Sri Lanka must have a dominating position in the market. But having said that, what is the future of tea? Are people going to drink tea the way we drink tea? What are the Millennials, Gen Z, and all going to do? Now that's your future. And that future is not in Sri Lanka, except for the promotion and the R&amp;D you are doing here. You have to carry your battle straight into these areas, into Europe and America. Are they going to drink iced tea? Are they going to have a tea drink? We do not know.</p><p>To help that, Sri Lanka will bring the climate change legislation and the new environment laws which will enable us to hit net zero even before the target date. So that is the help we can provide there. But what people are going to drink is something you all have to decide. Or will you be eating something with tea? We don't know. We just can't say what it is. And that is where the battle is.</p><p>So we now have to look at the TRI. What have they done, what should they do for the future, and make it a joint partnership between the government, which will provide funding, and the private sector. So I think, in a way, we have to look now not at the tea board or the tea smallholders. They are all there. They all have to be restructured. But the Tea Research Institute and how we will build it up.</p><p>Those are my thoughts on the industry. You ll are the ones who are in the game, and it's for us to look at the future because many of the problems we have mentioned are capable of being settled by us. But we have a future out there. How are we going to keep those markets and expand them? So I wish you all the best in your deliberation.</p><p>Minister for Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera,</p><p>Over the decades, we have embarked on a transformative journey to strengthen and sustain our tea sector. By the end of 2024, we will establish a globally accepted national sustainability standard for Ceylon tea. This is a significant milestone for the Sri Lankan tea sector and a testament to our commitment to addressing the challenges of climate change and ensuring the development and well-being of plantation workers and smallholder farmers. This new standard will guide the development and implementation of a regenerative agriculture model, promoting low-carbon tea production. This multi-procedure approach includes conducting a strong life cycle analysis to ensure our tea production processes are environmentally sustainable and economically valuable.</p><p>This convention is an important forum for Ceylon tea and global stakeholders. We are facing a critical time for tea worldwide, and the theme of this convention, \"Tea: A Lifestyle and a Livelihood,\" is timely and crucial for the tea industry. The conversations planned over the next two days are very important for the industry's future.</p><p>My heartfelt gratitude goes to the Organizing Committee, the Colombo Tea Traders Association, and the Sri Lanka Tea Board for their effort and commitment to making this convention a success. I wish to thank everyone who has gathered here to shape a better future for tea and hope the convention will cover the entire tea value chain from crop to cup.</p><p>The event grace the presence of notable dignitaries including Chief of Staff to the President and Senior Advisor to the President on National Security Sagala Rathnayaka, Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Janaka Dharmakeerthi, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board Niraj de Mel, Co-Chairmen of the Colombo International Tea Convention Mr. Ganesh Deivanayagam and Anil Cooke, along with tea plantation owners, tea factory owners, and local and foreign delegates from the tea industry.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hiru News.

It's called carbon farming, and it just might be key to restabilizing the climate. In the process, it can revitalize rural economies while also producing healthier, more nutritious crops. And amazingly, it's also low-cost, low-tech, and low-risk.</p><p>The carbon farmer works with simple inputs: land, seed, compost, moisture, sometimes animals and manure, and sometimes specially selected microorganisms that speed a depleted soil's return to health.</p><p>Carbon farming doesn't pull land out of production or abuse natural ecosystems. It's a 'down-to-earth' solution to global warming that employs nature's omnipresent carbon cycle, which constantly shuttles carbon molecules into and out of the atmosphere, soil, fresh water, and ocean. Yet carbon farming is still neither widely known nor widely practiced.</p><p>A School of Hard Knocks</p><p>In well-worn jeans and a plaid shirt, Gabe Brown looks like the North Dakota farmer-rancher he is. But if you were to assume that Brown practices typical U.S. production agriculture, you would be wrong. Brown has an iron will, a deep religious faith, a tremendous capacity for hard work, and 'a calling' to bring hope to struggling farmers and ranchers while providing healthful food to consumers. Unlike most farmers, though, he's not as concerned with yields per acre or dollars per pound as he is with soil health.</p><p>How soil became 'top of mind' for Brown-and how he became a rock star of regenerative agriculture-is a tale of good tidings for the climate, the planet, and agriculture in the United States.</p><p>Early in his farming career, Brown endured modern-day trials of Job. In 1995, he wasn't much different from many farmers he knew: a young man with a new family, a struggling farm, and a sizable operating loan to service. That year, a hailstorm wiped out 1,200 acres of his spring wheat the day before he was to start harvesting it. Because hail had been uncommon and mild during the previous 35 years, Brown had no hail insurance and was financially devastated.</p><p>The bank stuck with him, though, and loaned him more money-but, once again, the following year, hail destroyed his entire crop. At that point, the bank refused to provide a similar new loan.</p><p>Brown had to figure out how to ranch and farm without all the expensive chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and genetically modified (GMO) seeds on which neighboring farmers and ranchers depended, and which he now had no money to purchase.</p><p>In those days, no one baled the grass in the roadside ditches into hay for cattle because of the garbage and rocks found there. 'It was a pain to do,' Brown recalled. But his ranch was relatively small, and he could no longer afford to buy forage for his cattle. So, he went from neighbor to neighbor and asked if he could put the hay in their ditches.</p><p>'They just laughed and said, 'Sure.'' 'I would mow it and rake it and bale it. Then I'd carry those small square bales out of that ditch [and] onto the road. At night, my wife would drive with the kids in the car seats with a flatbed trailer behind, and I'd throw those bales onto that trailer one at a time. They probably averaged about 70 or 75 pounds, and I remember years we did 7,000 of them. ... That's a lot of steps up and down a road ditch.'</p><p>The next year, 1997, was extremely dry. Brown and his wife Shelly were just able to scrape enough feed together to keep the cattle, but once again, he had no crop income. 'So, you just keep digging a bigger hole because we had land payments to make,' he explained.</p><p>The next June, another hailstorm cost Brown 80 percent of his crop.</p><p>Those four years, Brown said, 'were hell to go through. I wouldn't wish it on anybody, but in the end, it was the best thing that could have happened because it forced me to change my mindset. ... I realized, 'I have to look at my whole operation... from the eyes of nature and how nature functions.''</p><p>Refocusing on the Synergies of Nature</p><p>During the years of hail and drought, Brown had often wondered how the 2,000 acres of unplowed native prairie on his land could grow so much forage naturally every year without synthetic inputs. It always had live roots, was always protected by vegetation that sealed in the moisture, and was extraordinarily rich in species.</p><p>To figure this out, Brown went to his local public library. There, he read the journals Thomas Jefferson had kept about agricultural practices on his plantation at Monticello, Virginia, where Jefferson planted turnips and vetches to improve degraded soil. Brown also read the journals of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, who had wintered at native Mandan villages in North Dakota-just north of Brown's ranch-in the early 19th century. The Mandans planted 'the three sisters'-corn, beans, and squash-along with tobacco. They were focusing on the synergies of nature, said Brown. They got a legume, a grass, and the squash plant 'all working in harmony to benefit each other.' He took note.</p><p>Brown also noticed that when the third hailstorm pounded his crops onto the ground, it armored his thirsty soil, sealing in its moisture against drought. This was important because his ranch has no irrigation and gets only 10 to 12 inches of rainfall a year, plus another 5 inches of moisture from melted snow. (It snows there every month except July.)</p><p>Informed by his new knowledge of Mandan agriculture, Brown decided to try planting legumes and grass, cover crops that would thrive synergistically through the residue of the hail-killed crops. He intended to raise feed for his livestock and add organic matter to the soil. Then, not even having money to buy the twine to bale hay, Brown simply let his livestock graze off the cover crops. The livestock got a free meal, and their manure enriched the soil. 'That started the act of livestock integration on cropland.'</p><p>Carbon-Friendly Agriculture</p><p>Through his efforts to survive and keep his farm, Brown gained crucial insights into how ecosystems function and the importance of livestock to maintaining a healthy soil ecosystem. Surmounting the challenges this presented forced him to create a new, 'carbon-friendly' agriculture that was as economical, as creative, and unconventional.</p><p>At a time when many family farms were succumbing to competition from industrial agriculture, Brown was able to avert bankruptcy by throwing out the prevailing business model. Instead of the soil-depleting, additive-heavy, financially draining agricultural practices he had learned in vocational school, his farming techniques mimic nature, heeding soil biology and integrating profitable enterprises in an agrarian ecosystem in which little is wasted; the byproducts of one operation are cleverly used as the inputs or feedstock of another.</p><p>As a result, the more than 130 different products sold by Brown's Ranch include organic, grass-fed beef and lamb, pastured pork and pigs, poultry, honey, fruit, and heirloom vegetables in season, as well as border collies. 'Don't tell me there's no money in production agriculture!' he said. 'There's a myriad of opportunities.'</p><p>These days, instead of baling grass in ditches at night, Gabe Brown is on the road most of the year to consult and lead regenerative agriculture workshops through the nonprofit Soil Health Academy, where he is a partner. 'I really believe that my purpose is to give people hope. ... By that, I mean farmers and ranchers and now, more so, consumers. ... We're trying to regenerate everything, including climate.'</p><p>What Makes Soil Ecosystems 'Tick'</p><p>To understand what Gabe Brown is up to, one has to understand how soil ecosystems operate: they run on carbon, the same way fuel powers an engine. Carbon-rich organic matter gives rich, fertile soils their dark color and clumpy texture and nourishes soil organisms and plants. Carbon-poor soil is less able to support life, producing lower crop yields, less forage, and less biodiversity. Soil health is like a magic elixir for climate health.</p><p>Brown's new approach to farming was not initially aimed at mitigating climate change. He simply noticed that the cover crops he grew, when his fields otherwise would have been fallow, significantly raised the soil's water-holding ability and put more live roots into it year-round, as on the native prairie; when those cover crops died, their roots decomposed and increased the soil's organic matter content, nourishing other plants and soil organisms.</p><p>So, the organic matter Brown added to nourish his crops and livestock also had the unsought benefit of boosting the soil's carbon concentration. (Organic matter is more than 50 percent carbon.) Even in harsh, dry North Dakota-where it's sometimes -40 degrees Fahrenheit in winter-Brown's agricultural techniques have captured vast amounts of valuable carbon. And that carbon, removed from the air and packed away in the soil, provides climate benefits.</p><p>Sequestering Carbon in the Soil</p><p>Brown's Ranch was the subject of a soil survey operation designed by John M. Norman, an environmental biophysicist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Norman analyzed the carbon and nitrogen in the ranch's top 4 feet of soil. An early measurement he made in 2017 indicated that those horizons contained an extraordinary amount of carbon per acre (92 tons), but the preliminary estimate was never confirmed, despite some follow-up measurements in 2018 and 2019, due to the project's premature termination. 'The amount of carbon he's sequestered in this soil is staggering,' Norman told me at the time. Even digging 4 feet below the surface wasn't deep enough for Norman to record all the extra carbon.</p><p>Moreover, he said, 'The deeper you bury the carbon, the longer it's going to be in there.' That's important for climate stability because if the carbon moves back into the air right away, it hasn't been purged from the atmosphere for the long term. '[Gabe] built a remarkable soil in a couple of decades. ... A wise farmer,' Norman concluded, 'can grow soil a lot faster than Mother Nature.'</p><p>To further increase his soil's organic matter, Brown nowadays inoculates his seeds with mycorrhizal fungi, and he plants a diverse mix of cover crops to keep the soil from overheating in the summer as the plants capture carbon from the air. Mycorrhizal fungi form a relationship with the roots of vascular plants and are critically important to the development of soil structure, fertility, and water-holding capacity; they also aid plants in using soil nutrients and resisting disease. By promoting plant growth and health, they help increase soil organic matter. 'Nature is more collaborative than competitive,' Brown believes.</p><p>'Mob-Grazing' Pasture</p><p>Ultimately, Brown's cover crops are incorporated into the soil after frost kill and decomposition or when Brown 'mob-grazes' a pasture. That's when cattle trample much of the forage into the soil, protecting it against wind and water erosion and helping it to insulate the ground from temperature extremes, thereby improving warm-weather water retention.</p><p>'The hotter it gets, the less water is available for plant growth,' Brown said. 'At 70 degrees, 100 percent of the water is available for plant growth. At 100 degrees, only 15 percent is used for growth, and 85 percent is used for evaporation. At 130 degrees, 100 percent of water evaporates; at 140 degrees, soil bacteria die.'</p><p>'[Soil] structure is built by a living system of microorganisms-little animals and the roots of the plants,' Norman said. 'They basically make a house for themselves and maintain that structure under a condition that's high yield for the whole system.'</p><p>Conventional Versus Regenerative Agriculture</p><p>Conventional farmers are addicted to fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. They see nature as more competitive than cooperative, so they try to remove or poison anything they see competing with their crops-thereby killing beneficial insects and soil life, including the helpful fungi. In addition, conventional farmers often leave the ground bare in the spring, allowing the soil to erode under rushing snowmelt water and pounding rains that can seal its surface, increasing runoff and decreasing water storage.</p><p>By contrast, in Brown's regenerative agricultural system, plant residues are left on the ground to decompose, and tiny organisms come up to the soil surface. 'They increase the infiltration rate by a huge factor,' Norman said. This is important not only for allowing adequate moisture to soak in to carry plants through dry spells but also for farmers and ranchers trying to adapt to climate change.</p><p>As the climate gets warmer and the frequency and severity of flooding increases, permeable soil is more important than ever to absorb the heavier rainfall. 'Gabe Brown's soil can take a foot of water in an hour with no runoff,' Norman reported. 'That's unheard of in a conventionally tilled agricultural soil.'</p><p>This adapted excerpt is from Solving the Climate Crisis: Frontline Reports From the Race to Save the Earth \u00a9 2023 by John J.

In addition to serving as the standard bearer for Pure Ceylon Tea from field to cup, TTE is also setting the pace for the plantation industry on ethical partnerships and high-impact environmental conservation that are uplifting the entire tea value chain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commitment to people and community</p><p>At the heart of TTE's success is its 4,825 strong team, who continue to serve as the custodians of quality. Accordingly, the company has been a pioneering leader in employee and community welfare. In 2022, the company invested Rs.160 million towards training employee welfare and community development - a staggering 288 percent increase over the previous year.</p><p>This includes investments into globally celebrated interventions like 'A Home for Every Plantation Worker' together with strategic programmes aimed at improving the living conditions, community capacity building, health and nutrition and youth empowerment.</p><p>Moreover, in challenging times, TTE didn't waver in its duty. Swift interventions were made to safeguard the financial and food security of not only its employees but the vast 42,000 estate community residing within its estates. A notable initiative was the launch of a special home gardening project across all estates, encouraging communities to cultivate and bolster food security.</p><p>Recognising the need to not only support its current workforce but also to invest in the future, the company launched an ambitious programme focused on the children of its team members. This initiative trains them to become field officers, giving them unprecedented opportunities to rise within the plantation hierarchy.</p><p>Historically, career progression has always been a challenge for tea harvesters. TTE's initiative seeks to shatter these historical barriers, ensuring that the children of their team members receive the same opportunities, training and pathways to upward mobility as any aspiring youth.</p><p>Participants undergo specialised training sessions at the Tea Research Institute (TRI), ensuring that they are equipped with the latest scientific knowledge and best practices in the industry. Beyond this, they gain exposure to all levels of management across TTE, from the complexities of fieldwork to strategic decision-making.</p><p>Significantly, all the team members participating in this pilot project are women. This not only showcases TTE's commitment to gender equality but also represents a significant leap forward for the entire plantation sector. In an industry historically dominated by male leadership, this initiative stands as a beacon of progress and an affirmation of TTE's commitment to fostering an inclusive and diverse work environment.</p><p>Powered by such ground-breaking initiatives, TTE reaffirmed its position at the forefront of innovation and empowerment in the global plantation industry. The company's vision is clear: to forge a path of equal opportunity, ensuring that every team member, irrespective of their background, has the tools and training to achieve their fullest potential.</p><p>A diverse agricultural landscape</p><p>Strategic crop diversification plays a pivotal role in maintaining resilience and ensuring sustained growth. Recognising this, TTE has proactively ventured beyond tea, investing in coconut and cinnamon cultivation on what were previously marginal rubber lands.</p><p>With a dedicated 35.24 hectares for coconut and 46.91 hectares for cinnamon, TTE's expansion is not merely a nod to Sri Lanka's rich agricultural history but a deliberate move grounded in strategy. Its diversification into cinnamon, coffee and spices like black pepper is not just about tapping into lucrative markets but it's also an astute business move to hedge against the potential vulnerabilities in the tea sector.</p><p>By transforming underperforming rubber lands into productive fields for these crops, TTE is maximising land use efficiency, generating consistent revenue streams and fortifying its overall business resilience. Moreover, this shift aligns with TTE's broader objectives of sustainable farming. Cultivating a mix of crops promotes biodiversity, aids in maintaining soil health and ensures optimal resource utilisation.</p><p>By diversifying its crop portfolio, TTE is not only reinforcing its commitment to innovation but also providing increased employment opportunities for its workforce. In summary, TTE's strategic move to diversify its crop portfolio on previously marginal lands, underscores its forward-thinking approach, positioning the company for long-term growth while enhancing its resilience in the dynamic global agricultural landscape.</p><p>Advancements in infrastructure</p><p>The imminent completion of the state-of-the-art Kiruwanaganga Factory is a testament to TTE's ambition. Expected to be fully operational by the latter half of 2023, this facility is set to produce an impressive 800,000 kilogrammes of made tea annually.</p><p>TTE's approach to sustainability is anything but conventional. With certifications such as RA, Ecolabel-Tea and a host of ISO standards, TTE has always been ahead of the curve. Its commitment to the 2030 Regenerative Agenda and collaborations with leading Sri Lankan universities to drive agri innovations on BioChar, reflect its forward-thinking attitude. Its drive is to not just to sustain but restore and regenerate natural resources.</p><p>A beacon of excellence on conservation and global commitments</p><p>TTE's conservation efforts are unparalleled. Projects such as the St. Clair's Falls Ecosystem Restoration and leadership in the 'KIRULU' initiative underline its dedication to preserving Sri Lanka's unique biodiversity. This commitment is further exemplified by its partnership with the Wildlife Nature Protection Society PLANT project and its zero-deforestation pledge.</p><p>Under the insightful leadership of CEO Senaka Alawattegama, TTE embraces its position as a leader in the producer segment in Sri Lanka not just with pride but with a sense of responsibility. With the laudable achievement of being the first company in Sri Lanka to align with the SBTi initiative, TTEL underscores its commitment to sustainable practices and environmental excellence.</p><p>\"The pursuit of perfection drives us. Each leaf we pick, each process we refine, is with the singular goal of ensuring that we present to the world the essence of Pure Ceylon Tea in its purest form. But our vision doesn't stop at being the top tea producer. By embracing innovations like regenerative agriculture and advanced technology and through the diversification into crops like cinnamon and pepper, we're looking beyond the traditional scope of a tea company.</p><p>With an ethos deeply rooted in sustainability, we aim to enrich our community, enhance the welfare of our workforce and tread lightly on the environment. Our extensive initiatives, whether they be in rooftop solar ventures or the rejuvenating Kirulu Project, reflect our unwavering dedication to a brighter, greener future. This holistic approach not only aligns with our core values but solidifies TTEL's place in the vanguard of the plantation industry,\" Alawattegama elucidated.</p><p>Being a UNGC member since 2016, TTE aligns with global standards, championing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and consistently driving impactful, sustainable actions.</p><p>The recent accolade from The Great Place to Work Survey 2023, reaffirming TTE's status with a 97 percent employee satisfaction score, is a testament to its holistic approach to business, community and environment.</p><p>With a vision clearly set on 'brewing a better future', Talawakele Tea Estates PLC remains at the forefront, paving the way for a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future in the global plantation industry.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The country]s lack of innovation, technology adoption, knowledge sharing, and branding efforts have hindered its progress in the field, leaving it far from establishing an authentic identity that can attract international agri-tourists. Without active participation and collaboration, Sri Lanka risks losing out on the tremendous economic opportunities that Agritourism can offer.</p><p>Agritourism, a form of tourism that involves visiting and participating in agricultural activities, is a growing trend worldwide. During the post COVID-19 era its progress is evolving. While there is a wealth of important and current information about Agritourism available, much of it is not available in the native languages of many regions where Agritourism is popular.</p><p>Instead, this vital information is often published in languages such as English, French, or Spanish. As a result, local and mostly rural farming communities in these regions with limited literacy to foreign languages may miss out on valuable information about Agritourism innovations, knowledge sharing pertaining to know-hows and branding.</p><p>Addressing to redress - Educating MSMEs</p><p>This lack of dissemination of important information creates a knowledge management barrier that local authorities can help to mitigate. By taking steps to ensure that relevant information about Agritourism is available in local languages and accessible to a wider audience of MSMEs, authorities can support the growth and success of Agritourism in their region.</p><p>Overall, it is important for local communities and authorities to recognise the value of Agritourism and take steps to support its growth and development, including ensuring that vital information is accessible to all interested parties, regardless of language proficiency.</p><p>The growth of Agritourism in rural areas in Sri Lanka can provide significant opportunities for local communities, but it requires the support of local authorities to realise its full potential. To this end, the government should play an active role in promoting and branding distant and rural Agritourism ventures, particularly by showcasing local destinations at international events.</p><p>In addition to this, workshops should be conducted to educate rural communities and interested parties on the potential Agritourism markets in each area. Such workshops should take into account the unique locality, geography, fisheries and aquaculture as well as flora and fauna of the region.</p><p>Local media, including press and electronic outlets, should also publish more informative content on Agritourism in local languages to reach a wider audience.</p><p>Governance responsibility</p><p>The Sri LankaTourism Development Authority (SLTDA) should focus on strengthening its RandD team to explore the possibilities of implementing more innovative and sustainable Agritourism practices in the country. Such efforts will help to build an authentic brand image in the sector, enhancing Sri Lanka's reputation as a leading destination for Agritourism in the region. By working together, local authorities and communities can help to create sustainable and profitable Agritourism ventures that benefit all stakeholders involved.</p><p>As listed on United Nations World Tourism organisation's (UNWTO) International Tourism Event Calendar, 16th May is recognised as World Agritourism Day.Some important time still remains for the local authorities to explore how the development of Agritourism and its related activities can be effectively promoted through the advancement of modern agri-business management strategies. The aim is to foster the diversification of local economies, thereby paving the way for increased economic growth and sustainability.</p><p>At the core of this lies the involvement of several key personnel, each playing a crucial role in driving this development forward. These responsible individuals must be guided by sound development principles, which will ensure that progress is both impactful and sustainable.</p><p>As the global community becomes increasingly conscious of the importance of environmental sustainability, the need for innovative solutions that promote 'Sustainable Agriculture and Tourism Practices' is more pressing than ever. It is imperative therefore, the authorities establish a robust platform for experts to exchange their knowledge, deliberate on best practices, and foster innovative ideas to disseminate crucial information on optimal practices.This will not only educate Agritourism stakeholders at the micro, small, and medium levels, but also encourage the emergence of new Agritourism entrepreneurs in rural and remote areas.By doing so, we can cultivate a distinct brand of Agritourism that fosters sustainable economic growth while promoting environmental conservation.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["GAN comprises three statutory bodies that include the Steering Committee, the Executive committee, and the General Assembly.

Both Regenerative Agriculture and Organic Home Gardening need to be promoted. Here, when we are talking about sustainability we are talking about the ecology. Today as individuals and families we have very little control over the events that are taking place in our country due to the economic crisis. So there is an economic aspect to this as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To survive we need to eat. And to eat we need to buy our food from the market or grow our own food. In hindsight growing our own food would have been the better way with the prices of fruits and vegetables skyrocketing today. Of course we may not be able to hold out indefinitely (being dependent on our home gardens) but it may buy us some time. Green Thumbs speaks to Manager SriCart (Organic Certification Sri Lanka), Project Director LOAM (Lanka Organic Agriculture Movement), Ajantha Palihawadana, who speaks of this two pronged approach.</p><p>When thinking of Sustainability, Regenerative agriculture and Home gardening should go hand in hand. Regenerative Organic Agriculture Systems are those that improve the resources they use, rather than destroying or depleting them. It is a holistic approach to farming that encourages continual innovation for environmental, social, economic and spiritual well-being.</p><p>\"The destruction of biodiversity, the greenhouse gases, pesticides, endocrine disrupters, plastics, poverty, hunger and poor nutrition are directly caused by the acts of multinational cooperation. More importantly, we need to build a new regenerative system that will replace the current degenerate system,\" added Palihawadana.</p><p>We know that the soil is fundamental to all terrestrial life on this planet. Our food and biodiversity start with the soil. The soil is not dirt. It is living, breathing and teeming with life. The soil microbiome is the most complex and richest area of biodiversity on our planet. The area with the greatest biodiversity is the rhizosphere, the region around roots of plants. Plants feed the soil microbiome with the molecules of life that they create through photosynthesis. These molecules are the basis of organic matter - carbon-based molecules that all life on earth depends on. Organic matter is fundamental to all life and soil organic matter is fundamental to life in the soil.</p><p>Farming practices that increase Soil Organic Matter (SOM), increase fertility, water holding capacity, pest and disease resilience and, thus, the productivity of agricultural systems. Because SOM comes from carbon dioxide fixed through photosynthesis, increasing SOM can have a significant impact in reversing the climate crisis. The fact is our health and wealth comes from the soil. Regenerative agriculture is the best option to use in our home gardens that can increase SOM. SOM is an important proxy for soil health.</p><p>Home gardening</p><p>Palihawadana points out that home gardening has been a long-standing practice in Sri Lanka. More than 35 percent of the population is engaged directly or indirectly in the agricultural sectors. \"Home gardens cover 14 percent of the total land use in the country and over 80 percent of the organically certified products comes from the home garden. As such, home gardens contribute to a significant amount of foreign currency earnings. In the Sri Lankan traditional Sustainable Agro Ecosystem there are three components - Chena cultivation, home garden and the paddy field. Home gardens provide stable foods, cash crops, fruit, vegetables, medicines fire woods and timber while conserving bio diversity, soil and water and helping eco-systems survive,\" said Palihawadana.</p><p>When talking about canopies in home gardens, we need to understand that there are two - Vertical and Horizontal. The composition and size of these home gardens are vary,</p><p>\"In the typical home garden, if youtake the top canopy layer, it is usually the fruit trees. Timber trees are present in the medium canopy layer. At the bottom canopy layer are vegetables and other crops (root and tuber crops, leafy vegetables). Gliricidia sepium is used as a shade tree, its sticks used for fencing and as a support for vine crops. So these species also occupy different layers of the canopy, contributing to the diversity of home gardens,\" pointed out Palihawadana.</p><p>He also added that fire wood crops are very important, because at present the gas companies are increasing the price. Fire wood from the home gardens can contribute as an alternative.</p><p>Organic agriculture</p><p>\"If you take an organic home garden (without the use of chemicals) it has contributed to a continuous supply of fresh foods and vegetables and food security. It also is a source of medicines.</p><p>I would also like to say that the governments' decision to shift to total organic overnight has created a lot of confusion. It is important to understand organic agriculture in the proper way. So organic home gardens need to continue as their value is time proven and time tested.\"</p><p>Palihawadana points out that in order to have a flourishing home garden there are lessons we can learn by following certain organic principles. Consequently, the four principles of organic agriculture are seen as applicable to home gardens:</p><p>Health: Organic agriculture should sustain and enhance the health of soil, plant, animal, human and planet as one and indivisible.</p><p>Ecology: Organic agriculture should be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them.</p><p>Fairness: Organic agriculture should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities.</p><p>Care: Organic agriculture should be managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well-being of current and future generations and the environment.</p><p>\"The majority of our population is directly or indirectly dependent on home gardens. Agriculture in its various forms has the most significant effect on land use. Industrial agriculture is responsible for most of the environmental degradation, forest destruction, toxic chemicals in our food and environment and a significant contributor, up to 50 percent, to the climate crisis.</p><p>The degenerative forms of agriculture are an existential threat to us and most other species on our planet. We have to regenerate agriculture for social, environmental, economic and cultural reasons. Home gardening can provide some solutions for the current crisis in Sri Lanka, especially for low-income marginalized communities in Sri Lanka,\" explained Palihawadana.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

It is a visual chart that shows the key elements of a business, such as customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key partnerships and cost structure.</p><p>According to Strategyzer, the company that developed the canvas, over 5 million people from more than 150 countries have used it, and businesses that do are more likely to have a clear and concise business plan, be customer-focused, and have a higher likelihood of success.</p><p>Introducing the concept, Growth at GLX Alchemist Good Life X Partner Arj Wignaraja, emphasised the adaptability of the BMC, citing the development of the ExO Canvas: a variation of the model designed for businesses that aim to become exponential organisations (ExOs) using disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data. Variations such as the ExO Canvas are a testament to how businesses can experiment with different business models and pivot their strategies based on feedback and market conditions.</p><p>The significance of Good Life X's THRIVE BMC, designed alongside PepperCube Consultants, is in its replacement of traditional elements of the canvas with regenerative principles. For example, instead of a value proposition, GLX encourages businesses to consider their Purpose, Principles, and Paradigms (P3). 'We, through our business, are trying to solve a social or ecological challenge, and that is articulated through a clear and transformative purpose,' added Good Life X Partner Arj Wignaraja.</p><p>Regenerative principles in business are gaining popularity globally, as companies recognise the need to prioritise long-term sustainability over short-term profits. 'The climate crisis is impacting supply chains. Grassroots communities are increasingly left behind in global value chains. Conscious consumers seek brands with purpose and importance. The best of Gen Z talent try alternative ways to work, seeking meaning in their jobs. We're beginning to see deep changes in the global regulatory landscape.'</p><p>Arj Wignaraja and GLX Founder and CEO Randhula De Silva were alluding to the urgency of incorporating circular models into businesses both locally and globally. 'All of these are signalling the rise of the second wave of disruption in the way we live and work.'</p><p>Case studies also demonstrate that focusing on regenerative principles can lead to financial success while benefiting the environment and society. Interface, a leading US-based carpet manufacturer, transformed its operations to become a carbon-negative company by 2040 and has seen a 96% reduction in Green House Gases (GHG) emissions at the manufacturing stage and an 86% reduction in waste to landfill since 1996, all while maintaining YoY growth - profits doubled four years into their venture into sustainable practices. 'Being regenerative is a complete change of mindset and a new way of operating: actively seeking to give back more than we take,' said Randhula De Silva.</p><p>GLX also gave voice to home-grown case studies of companies 'fighting the good fight,' tapping into a network of 100+ businesses they've worked with and supported. BoardPAC Founder and Executive Director Lakmini Wijesundera, Kalundewa Retreat Director and COO Gihan Candappa, and the Goodfolks Founder Dinesh Gratian Perera took to the stage to showcase their business models and speak on their experience with GLX and THRIVE BMC.</p><p>'Before [working with GLX], it was just this blur of things that we wanted to achieve and stood for, but actually sitting down with GLX and going through the value-oriented aspects of [Goodfolks] put things into perspective, aligned our day-to-day job on the field with our purpose, and tied it to our results,' said Perera commenting on the value of GLX's expert advice in the family company's journey toward becoming truly regenerative. 'We have already integrated one of our products - our honey project - into this new model.'</p><p>The incorporation of regenerative principles into the business world has been a topic of debate in recent years, as there are those wary of its potential to be perceived as a passing trend. Concerns have been raised on these principles being co-opted by companies as a form of green washing, bypassing meaningful changes to their business models or practices. GLX echoed these concerns at the launch, urging businesses to incorporate regenerative practices into their operations in a way that is thoughtful and backed by a deep understanding of the principles.</p><p>'I think with larger companies it's even easier, because they already have systems in place, making it easier for them to move towards regenerative principles on an operational level,' said Randhula De Silva in response to a question posed by The Daily FT on the effort needed by Sri Lanka's corporate leaders to help reshape the business sector. 'The real concern for legacy firms would be the mindset and cultural shift necessary to approach it the right way. If you dedicate yourself for a good six months to a year, it's possible.

However, according to Peter Lehner, managing attorney for EarthJustice, a nonprofit environmental law firm, the EPA estimate is \"almost certainly significantly quite low.</p><p>\"Lehner argues that most analyses exclude five unique sources of emissions from the farming sector: soil carbon (carbon released during the disturbance of soil), lost sequestration (carbon that would still be sequestered in the ground had that land not been converted into farmland), input footprints (carbon footprint for products used in agriculture, like the manufacturing of fertilizer), difficult measurements (it is harder to measure the carbon emissions of biological systems like agriculture than it is to measure the emissions of other industries that are not biological, like transportation), and potent gases (like methane and nitrous oxide).Regarding that last source: Focusing on carbon dioxide as the main greenhouse gas often ignores powerful planet-warming gases that are emitted by agriculture and that are even more potent than carbon dioxide.</p><p> Methane, which is emitted by the burps and farts of ruminants like cows and sheep, has up to 86 times more global warming potential over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide (and also impacts public health, particularly in frontline communities). Nitrous oxide, a byproduct of fertilizer runoff, has 300 times more warming potential than carbon dioxide (and also harms plants and animals).</p><p>\"Most other studies, including by the [United Nations (UN)] and others, say that agriculture contributes much closer to 15 or 20 percent or more of world greenhouse gas emissions,\" Lehner points out.Miscalculating Agricultural EmissionsA systems engineering analysis of climate science and animal agriculture published in the Journal of Ecological Society in 2019 by Sailesh Rao, the founder and executive director of Climate Healers, an environmental nonprofit, backs up the claim that the majority of analyses of agricultural emissions are low.</p><p> Rao's paper found that \"animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change, responsible for at least 87% of greenhouse gas emissions annually.\"According to Rao, there are \"four major miscalculations in the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports, which systematically undercount the climate change impact of animal agriculture.</p><p>\" These miscalculations relate to carbon dioxide, methane, land use, and the timeline of analysis (using data only from the Industrial Era onward, which discounts the long-term contribution of animal agriculture to historical emissions).Rao's abstract states:\"We show that we need to transition to a global plant-based economy first and that blindly eliminating fossil fuel usage first will accelerate the warming of the planet.</p><p> We show that the annual methane emissions from animal agriculture alone cause more incremental global warming than the annual CO2 emissions from all fossil fuel sources combined. We further show that the transition to a global plant-based economy has the potential to sequester over 2000 Gigatons (Gt) of CO2 in regenerating soils and vegetation, returning atmospheric greenhouse gas levels to the \"safe zone\" of under 350 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 equivalent, while restoring the biodiversity of the planet and healing its climate.</p><p> This paper clearly illustrates why the scientific community, government institutions, corporations, and news media, who vastly underestimate the role of animal agriculture and focus primarily on reducing fossil fuel use, need to urgently change their priorities in order to be effective.\"Tackling Food Systems at Global Climate SummitsAgriculture was not a central topic of discussion at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021. \"Despite [the] huge impact to ecological systems and climate,\" writes Suzannah Gerber, a nutrition scientist and fellow of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture--a research agency within the U.</p><p>S.

At the conference, governments actively engaged in intensifying efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance adaptive measures in the agriculture sector to combat the challenges of climate change.During the discussions, an important milestone was reached with the establishment of a comprehensive four-year plan focusing on agriculture and food security, which included the mobilization increased financial resources to drive the transformative changes needed in the agricultural sector by 2030.

Within agriculture, producing meat is the main climate problem: Plant-based foods account for 29 percent of the global food production greenhouse gas emissions, while animal-based food accounts for almost twice as much--57 percent--with beef being the main contributor.</p><p> \"Every bite of burger boosts harmful greenhouse gases,\" said the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). \"Research shows that if cows were a nation, they would be the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter,\" according to UNEP.</p><p> \"As humans, meat production is one of the most destructive ways in which we leave our footprint on the planet.\"UNEP states, \"Between 1970 and 2011, livestock increased from 7.</p><p>3 billion to 24.2 billion units, worldwide.\" With such a staggering number of animals trapped in our food system, it should be no surprise that industrial farming is, as the animal rights nonprofit Animal Equality states, \"the largest cause of animal abuse in history.</p><p>\" The group points out, \"At no other time in history have so many animals died or suffered so much throughout their lives.\"A More Sustainable Future Is Plant-PoweredAnimal-based agriculture is ultimately a poor way to feed a skyrocketing human population.</p><p> \"Farming animals is notoriously inefficient and wasteful when compared to growing plants to feed humans directly, with the end result that 'livestock' animals take drastically more food from the global food supply than they provide,\" writes Ashley Capps, a researcher specializing in farmed animal welfare for A Well-Fed World, an international food security organization advocating for the transition to plant-based agriculture.\"This is because in order to eat farmed animals, we have to grow the crops necessary to feed them, which amounts to vastly more crops than it would take to feed humans directly,\" writes Capps.</p><p> \"To give one example, it takes 25 pounds of grain to yield just one pound of beef--while crops such as soy and lentils produce, pound for pound, as much protein as beef, and sometimes more.\"Beef is so resource-intensive to produce, that it requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse gases per gram of edible protein than beans, lentils, and peas--all commonly farmed plant proteins, according to the World Resources Institute.</p><p>Switching to plant-based agriculture would help prevent food shortages, hunger, and even famine at a time when climate change is creating food insecurity across the globe. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, had warned during the Saudi Green Initiative Forum in October 2021, that failure to stem the climate crisis \"would mean less food, so probably a crisis in food security.</p><p>\"A Well-Fed World points out that \"[c]limate change is a hunger risk multiplier, with 20 percent more people projected to be at risk of hunger by 2050 due to extreme weather events. Unfortunately, the world's most food insecure populations are also those disproportionately harmed by climate-related events, including increased heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, and flooding.</p><p>\"Climate, Conflict, and COVID-19: A Perfect Storm\"A perfect storm of conflict, climate crises, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising costs for reaching people in need is causing a seismic hunger crisis,\" warns the World Food Program, the food assistance branch of the UN. The agency launched a public appeal to the world's billionaires to donate $6.6 billion to save 42 million people across 43 countries from famine.</p><p>\"Concurrently replacing all animal-based items in the U.S.</p><p> diet with plant-based alternatives will add enough food to feed, in full, 350 million additional people, well above the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food waste,\" according to a 2018 study by an international team of researchers published in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The authors note that the results of their study \"highlight the importance of dietary shifts to improving food availability and security.</p><p>\"The dietary shift from meat to plants is something that UNEP has underscored as a way to combat climate change and increase the efficiency of our food system. In their Emissions Gap Report 2021, the agency noted that--in addition to switching from the combustion of natural gas to renewables--\"behavioral changes such as reduced consumption of cattle-based foods and reduced food waste and loss\" present a significant opportunity to reduce methane emissions.</p><p> \"[F]ast methane action, as opposed to slower or delayed action, can contribute greatly to reducing midterm (2050) temperatures,\" the report states.In many ways, this behavioral change is already underway, as veganism is on the rise.</p><p> \"It can be difficult to get an accurate picture of how many vegans there are in the U.S.</p><p>, but one survey found a 300 percent increase in vegans between 2004 and 2019, amounting to about 3 percent of the total population or nearly 10 million people,\" notes Sentient Media, a nonprofit animal rights journalism organization. Still, even though there has been a steady increase in plant-based diets, meat consumption is hitting record levels, aided by carnivores in low- and middle-income countries where incomes are on the rise, like India and China.</p><p>Looking AheadBy 2050, the human population is expected to reach a staggering 9.9 billion people.</p><p> (The Earth supports more than 8 billion people as of 2023; just 50 years ago, the global population was less than half that number.) To ensure global food security in 2050, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that food production must increase by 60 percent.</p><p>In a 2022 Economist blog post, Alice Ruhweza, the Africa regional director of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), an environmental nonprofit, urged nations to make food systems a priority. \"From brands to retailers, manufacturers to farmers, it will take every organization and person involved in the food system to deliver on progress for climate and nature--ensuring our children have access to high-quality fresh food in the future which doesn't cost the planet,\" she writes.</p><p> \"Actions that food system organizations can take now include ensuring renewable energy is used on-site, investing in circular initiatives that simultaneously tackle food waste and address soil health, removing deforestation from their supply chain, and communicating to consumers in a way that makes plant-rich diets irresistible. All of this must be underpinned by a just transition for farmers--who are often the first to feel the impacts of climate change--and a firm commitment to food security.</p><p>\"If society can effectively address the runaway emissions of our broken, unsustainable, and inhumane industrialized food system--including moving humanity to plant-based diets--perhaps the existential climate crisis can truly be overcome.

Do tell us a bit about how this legacy started and how it has become so successful.</p><p>A: It all began with a single person, a young man with a very big dream. It was the 1950s and my father, at the age of 20, had observed the passion and the commitment with which tea was harvested. Each cup of tea contained 30 hand-picked leaves. That means somebody spent time and effort hand picking the finest leaves for your cup of tea. There is nothing more artisanal or more luxurious than that. My father saw this and he wanted to get into the tea industry. He then visited Mincing Lane in London, which ironically was the centre of the global tea trade, though they don]t produce much tea, yet, was the centre of a global tea trade, part of the unfortunate colonial economic legacy the British Empire had. And there, contrary to his expectation of a celebration of what is great about tea he found something quite different, because the trade was focused on profit and therefore value reduction. As a tea grower, my father saw at the time as we see today the incredible artisanal commitment, the effort that goes into making tea, the effort of the tea growers combined with the influence of nature. When you translate that into a commodity to be traded, it turns out to be something completely against the social and economic interests of the country. My father saw this in the 1950s when he conceived an idea. It was a very different time. There was no printing in the country. There were power issues and many complications while the trade was dominated by the British. So he had to work his way through and eventually in 1985 he was able to make his first breakthrough getting his Dilmah tea grown, harvested, ethically produced, packed and branded in Sri Lanka, with the profits coming to the country. In September 1985 he got it on shelf in Australia. That's a potted history of how it all happened.</p><p>Q: In how many countries is Dilmah being sold now?</p><p>A: Then onwards we soared and we are now in over 100 countries. However, our objective is not to say that we are the biggest. We want to maintain our quality, as there is nothing great about saying you are the biggest in volume, what matters for Ceylon tea is value.</p><p>Q: Sri Lanka does not really do much of value-added product exports. When it comes to the tea industry, the majority is bulk exports. Dilmah is an exception. What is the reason for Sri Lanka not being geared for value-added exports?</p><p>A: It]s a tragedy. Sri Lanka has the finest tea, the finest cinnamon; we have exceptional cardamom and the finest pepper. We have an abundance of quality products that extend from our people. If you talk to international chefs they would tell you Sri Lankan pastry chefs anywhere in the world are the finest. We fail to take advantage, with the finest chocolate work, ice carvings and the precision of their work. This is the difference that my father saw. Because every skill, whether it is the quality in a cup of tea, every uniqueness, every point of difference, needs to be emphasised and focused on in building value. In Sri Lanka value addition in tea may be in the region of 30 %. But real value addition is when you take a product and you add value through the use of technology, use of art, craft, communication and presenting new experiences to engage the consumer. Value addition isn]t just saying look I]ve sold something at a high price. It]s about delivering an experience where a consumer says this is worth the price we are asked to pay. Although we have all these attributes, it]s probably in the mindset and the marketing failures that we are yet selling our cinnamon as a competitor to the inferior and carcinogenic cassia. We are selling our finest Ceylon tea with all its artisanal attributes as a cheaper alternative to multi-origin blended tea which has no identity, personality, guarantee of craft nor guarantee of soil conservation. So whether it is cinnamon or our incredible cashew, we need to understand that we have an amazing asset and that asset merits charging a fair price. My father]s philosophy of understanding the concept of value and charging a fair price for the value we offer, not cheating the customer but offering an experience for which he or she is willing to pay the price extends to tourism.</p><p>My brother oversees and manages our Resplendent Ceylon. Our room rate is significantly higher than any other in Sri Lanka, because we offer a unique experience and that]s a Sri Lankan experience. Our Ceylon Tea in most countries has its own place, for example, in Poland you would see us sitting on the top shelf in terms of price, because we offer a quality product.</p><p>Tasting 10,000 teas each week and selecting the finest is about honesty. Honesty builds trust. Trust builds value. I think the important thing here is as Sri Lankans we need to first understand the value of what we have. We need to frame our proposition on how we propose to engage with the consumer. Today the consumer is very responsive to a message that talks of wellness, provenance, biodiversity, quality and taste. Tea has everything, so does cinnamon, cashew and Sri Lanka tourism. When you read some of the reviews online they are exceptional but we need to charge a fair price. Because when you discount something as a commodity, you end up devaluing it. The Seychelles is $ 600 to $ 700 a night while in Sri Lanka it's $200 a night, trying to demonstrate that probably the cost corresponds to the quality. Sri Lanka is worth a thousand plus dollars per night because of the experiences we could offer. Wellness experiences, Ayurveda, fine tea, fine gastronomy are a few that Sri Lanka offers. I believe it is as much the mindset, as well as a relic of colonialism that seems to have colonised our minds. We need to have the confidence to say we have a great product, we are going to market it as a premium, and charge the right price. It is only the right price that]s going to allow us to pay our workers a fair salary and to build innovation into our industry.</p><p>Q: Dilmah is an export-oriented business and the current high currency fluctuation can be a serious challenge. How is this impacting the industry and Dilmah?</p><p>A: We emerged from an unprecedented crisis. In 2020 following the Easter bombing we confronted unimaginable challenges. We had to build parallel transport networks, build fuel dumps. We had to maintain health and safety in a way that we never had to in the past. But we never stopped for a minute. Currency fluctuation is part of the recovery of our nation. Ultimately it]s also in the mindset. We have to be positive. Every problem has a solution. We are a Sri Lankan company, with a Sri Lankan product and believe we can do it. So we will overcome the challenge. To meet any challenge valuing our product is important. When the currency fluctuates or when we have inflationary pressures we can go to the market and tell our partners these are the justifications for a price increase. When you don]t have a brand you become a victim of all of those trends. When you sell bulk tea for example, it is you against the low cost producers around the world. So it comes back to the same thing. Value what we have. Today we have a currency crisis but it]s part of our restoration. Tomorrow we may have a climate crisis. We may have another health crisis or perhaps other issues. It is building value, understanding what you have and crafting it through value addition is what is going to help us to build resilience.</p><p>Q: Turkey and Russia are two main buyers of Ceylon tea. In the recent past we have seen that both these countries are experiencing economic challenges. How are these dynamics affecting the demand for Ceylon tea and how do you manage that?</p><p>A: Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Russia are the traditional markets for Sri Lankan tea and I think our future and our resilience is to broad-base Ceylon tea. We have been reliant on the same markets virtually since the 1960s. There is no reason why we should not venture beyond. When we talk to industry insiders you hear the phrase 'oh we lost that market'. Yes we lost it to Kenya but we lost it on price. Ceylon tea is not a price driven product. It's a quality and sustainability driven product. So perhaps today it]s Turkey and Russia suffering from an economic crisis and tomorrow it could be Europe. But we need to broaden our markets. We cannot stay reliant on the same five or six markets. When Iraq, our number one market, has some sort of import issue, embargo or sanctions, Sri Lanka suffers. Hence, it]s an unsustainable and narrow-minded approach to keep going</p><p>Q: Kenya and India emerged as strong suppliers of tea. However, both countries are facing labour issues at present. Does that mean it creates more opportunities for Ceylon tea and is there any way that we can capture that opportunity?</p><p>A: I think it creates more opportunities but probably not in the way you think. When there is a supply disruption it is inevitably temporary. But where it creates an opportunity is, if we go to consumers and say look during the pandemic most countries either mechanised or retrenched twenty, thirty thousand workers causing them misery or they abandoned minimum wage mechanisms and reduced the wage. But in Sri Lanka we actually increased our wages and increased social commitment. If you walk on the streets of Berlin or London, you need not walk more than 100 feet to see somebody in misery, without health care, or in deep trouble. All those who come here take photographs of somebody and publish in the newspapers and say we are mistreating our workers; they need to look at themselves to understand who is at fault. The world is telling us we want a cheaper product. When we go and offer a product at a fair price we get kicked out. We are asked to compete with one country or another. Our product is valuable because we want to take care of our workers, we provide free education, and free medical care. Kenya and India face short-term labour issues but we should not seek to exploit that because that would be at most a short-term benefit. We need to understand the bigger picture. Where does Sri Lanka fit in this competitive environment? We should not seek to compete with them because it would end up in price competition. We should compete on quality. What is important is not to sell 300 million kilos, but to sell 150 million kilos of Ceylon tea profitably. When I say profitably it must be profitable for the environment. We have to invest in soil regeneration, in agroforestry, make sure it is profitable for the community, and integrate the livelihoods of people into our business model. We should tell the world that we produce the finest tea on earth, that we look after our workers, our environment and that we want a fair price. If you do this you will find a reasonable gap between the cost of production, net sale average and Export FOB. We can use that gap to benefit social environmental issues. This year Dilmah will generate almost over Rs. 900 million over our 13 centres around Sri Lanka, supporting children with Down Syndrome, schools and hospitals on the plantations, environmental education, climate change centres etc. We are not compelled to do this, but we feel obliged because we are a Sri Lankan company benefiting from a Sri Lankan product and we have to share. This is my father]s philosophy. This is a business built on family values. We can do it because we have a brand. We tell our customers, we will give you the finest tea but you have to pay a fair price for it.</p><p>Q: The fertiliser ban imposed in 2021 created serious issues for the plantation sector. Now the regulations have changed. What is the current situation?</p><p>A: That ban was ranked as a stupidity. It was purely political. It]s unfortunate because it caused a catastrophe that is still rippling through our country years later. Now we have recovered to an extent. The availability of fertiliser and the fertiliser that has been applied since is resulting in more normal crops coming through. If you look at it and try to find a little bit of light at the end of that self-imposed tunnel, I suppose people are thinking a little bit about sustainable means of regenerative agriculture. This is important. We should not be reliant on fertiliser because the stupidity of the fertiliser ban was the ban in itself. As members of the tea industry who were part of that initial task force until we were kicked out, we recommended that there should be a progressive plan by setting a target of five or ten % gradually. That would have been a wise and insightful action. Several countries are working on this model. But the time frame is 30-40 years, not overnight. So yes we are recovering but the ramifications are still being felt</p><p>Q: Do you see any change in customer preference over tea especially with the new generation? Is the new generation shifting to substitutes like coffee or juice?</p><p>A: Consumers today are used to a multitude of options. The customer doesn't come with a predetermined notion of saying I]m going to drink tea or drink coffee. They look at what]s on offer. It's up to us to make tea look good. Does tea look good? Infinite variety in taste and the taste is determined in tea, not by the manufacturer. It]s determined by nature. You have Nuwara Eliya tea. Can you produce Nuwara Eliya tea in Ratnapura? No, because there are inherent geographical and climatic characteristics that define light bright tea. We must communicate this positively and say look here]s what we have in Sri Lanka. There]s a multitude of options. You have tea for your morning, for your afternoon, to have with your salad, to have with your biriyani, etc. So make the product relevant, and look good to the consumer. Create occasions. The new consumer isn]t moving away from tea. Today tea is more relevant than any other beverage. There is no herb like tea. It]s varied in taste, with natural plant antioxidant goodness, and a variety of taste. If we build a strong ethical and environmental sustainability proposition in tea we have a compelling offer. You have what a consumer would say, look when I drink this tea. Not only am I doing something good for my body, engaging my taste buds and appealing to my taste buds but also I]m helping the plantation workers in Sri Lanka. Because when they produce this and when I pay a fair price for this they get a fair wage. We just need to be able to communicate that and make tea look good.</p><p>Q: What is the future of the Sri Lankan tea industry?</p><p>A: I think the future has never been as bright as now. The reason for that is gen Z, the younger generation, millennial are conditioned by the pandemic for health and wellness. They]re looking for products that offer health and wellness. Any scientist or if you go online you would find over 45,000 research papers that confirm the natural antioxidant goodness in tea. So it is scientifically proven. Tea has a therapeutic impact on every single lifestyle disease such as diabetes. Tea enhances cognitive ability but also enhances mood. Tea reduces the impact of stress on the human body. Tea reduces the possibility of stroke. The list is endless. The future for Ceylon Tea has never been brighter than today in my opinion.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Now we have recovered to an extent.

The machines are coming in so it will have all the modern things, machinery, tea conveyors, and tea Color sorters. At the same time, even in the fields we have introduced machine harvesters for harvesting, even for rubber tapping they have brought a little machine shaver sort of thing from China. So definitely we are into innovation in a big way.\"</p><p>He said there are niche markets that the plantation sector could also approach to further boost forex income. \"Now we are making handmade artisanal specialties which attract good prices. So there are niche markets which we need to approach. Producing specialty teas and handmade artisanal tea is one area that Sri Lanka can really do well. These are very expensive and a Kilo would go up to about Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000.</p><p>With regard to new investment in plantations he said, \"These plantations are given out on a 55 year lease. Now we have finished about 30 odd years out of it. Everybody is talking about why people are not replanting, there is uncertainty after the end of 55 years. RPCs are owned by large conglomerates and large business people. They are not going to invest the money if somebody is going to take the money away in two or three years' time, they might as well put it in some other business. So the uncertainty is a serious issue and the Government must come out and say this is our policy on land, and this is our policy on plantation then people will align their business according to the policies.\"</p><p>As I said, it's up to all stakeholders, particularly the trade unions, to get on board with us and work together for the betterment of our employees as well as the country.</p><p>He said the plantation sector production dropped in 2022 where the production figures dropped to 251 million kg, whereas traditionally it hovered around the 300 million or little more than the 300 million mark. But since the fertilizer ban came in from 2021 to 2022, the crop production has dropped by around 16% to 18% on a year on year basis. He said they expect to increase it to 275 million kilograms this year.</p><p>He said the industry faced huge challenges because although fertilizer has been made available now it is 10 times more than the price which they used to buy. \"So that has a huge impact on our cost of production. From one side, the crop has come down and on the other side, the cost of production is going up due to fertilizer. Even fuel has gone up three fold so is the cost of transport, firewood and packing material. So all in all, there is a huge increase in the cost of production. So although we get a higher price due to the rupee depreciation, we find that at the same time our costs have also gone up. He said although chemicals have just been made when the fields are weedy they cannot apply fertilizer. So first of all once they receive the chemicals, the fields need to be cleaned before applying fertilizer. Also to apply fertilizer they need proper climatic conditions and some sort of rainfall was needed. He therefore said they will probably start fertilizing from about March or April and this trend of low crops will continue for some time and an increase in production is expected by about April, provided all the climatic conditions and rain comes on time.</p><p>\"We also have a plethora of other issues like wages and things. If there is going to be a Government intervention and they want the wages increased, then these things are going to impact on the total productivity and profitability of all these RPCs.</p><p>We need to talk with the trade unions and try to come up with some sort of understanding. We have proposed a productivity-based wage model which has been working very well within certain plantation companies where people can earn even up to about Rs 2,000, Rs 2,500 a day. And if they talk about the monthly salary they can earn about Rs 50,000 to 60,000 a month. There is some sort of reluctance from the side of their trade unions to accept this, but to a certain extent they are also with us in this, but we need to come out with this proper solution rather than going in for this 150 year old wage model where you pay a daily wage and it's not linked to productivity at all. So if this industry is to continue and to prosper in the future, I think we need to migrate as soon as possible into a productivity based model.\"</p><p>Alawattegama said the Government should have a proper long-term policy for the plantation sector particularly on fertilizer and chemicals without taking sudden decisions. He said the rubber industry was going through a very difficult period due to pest disease and the rubber production has come down. RPCs cultivated oil palm and were doing well. Some time ago they wanted it to be extended to 20,000 hectares.</p><p>And RPCs brought down seeds at very high prices, and once the plants started growing in the nursery, suddenly they said 'you can't plant oil palm.' So as a result, the companies had to incur huge losses. So they have to write off all those things. The country has spent so much foreign exchange to import oil palm. At the time of privatization, RPC's were given the option of diversifying into different profitable agricultural crops. If you look at the labour availability in 1992, RPCs had 327,000 workers. It has dropped to about 100,000. So we are happy about it, but then this is the trend which is going to take place. So therefore we need to now look at less labour intensive crops.</p><p>He said RPCs are looking at expanding into the coconut industry, not only selling nuts but also value added products. Similarly cinnamon is another area RPCs are looking at where value addition where value addition is possible like the production of cinnamon oil. There is a big demand for dehydrated cinnamon leaf and various other products. The RPCs are looking at those areas and they want to expand into that.</p><p>Alawattegama said they have now gone into precision agriculture where the bush is given the required amount of nutrients. With precision agriculture there will be less wastage because you know the number of bushes and the required nutrient. So it will be on a placement basis.</p><p>\"Also we are looking at regenerative agriculture where organic matter is incorporated into the tea and also according to the requirement, we will replace the nutrient so that there will not be any waste. Then we will make use of artificial intelligence, for example like Climate Change. We have established a few weather stations. Which will tell you in advance what the Climate Change is going to be, so that kind of technology is coming in. Also making use of drones to do chemical spraying and mapping of the fields so that you know whether the entire field is harvested. So there are a lot of areas that we are looking at artificial intelligence, IT. All those things will come in and those will assist us in improving the industry standards.</p><p>\"Our quality is always superior to others. We are the country which produces the cleanest tea and that is the only way we are surviving because of our productivity, if you compare with India and Kenya, they are way ahead of us. In Kenya for each plucker the average is around 60 kilos and in South India, it's around 40 kilos, whereas ours is around 20 to 25 kilos. So the only way we are keeping our competitive advantage over the others is due to our quality. So we need to maintain it if this industry is going to continue,\" the Planters' Association of Ceylon Chairman added.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Like citizens of an underground city that never sleeps, tens of thousands of subterranean species of invertebrates, nematodes, bacteria and fungi are constantly filtering our water, recycling nutrients and helping to regulate the planet's temperature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But under fields covered in tightly knit rows of corn, soybeans, wheat and other monoculture crops, a toxic soup of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides is wreaking havoc, according to our recent analysis in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science. The study-to our knowledge the most comprehensive review ever conducted on how pesticides affect soil health-should trigger immediate and substantive changes in how the Environmental Protection Agency assesses the risks posed by the nearly 850 pesticide ingredients approved for use in the U.S.</p><p>Regulations currently ignore pesticides' harm to soil species. Our study leaves no doubt that this disregard must change. For our analysis, conducted by researchers at the Centre for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth and the University of Maryland, we looked at nearly 400 published studies comprising more than 2,800 experiments on how pesticides affect soil organisms. Our review encompassed 275 unique species or types of soil organisms and 284 different pesticides or pesticide mixtures. In just over 70 percent of those experiments, pesticides were found to harm organisms critical to maintaining healthy soils-harms that have never been considered in the EPA's safety reviews. Pesticide-intensive agriculture and pollution are driving factors in the precipitous decline of many soil organisms, such as ground beetles and ground-nesting bees. They have been identified as the most significant driver of soil biodiversity loss in the past decade.</p><p>Soil organisms</p><p>Yet pesticide companies and our pesticide regulators have ignored that research. The EPA, which is responsible for pesticide oversight in the U.S., openly acknowledges that somewhere between 50 and 100 percent of all agriculturally applied pesticides end up on the soil. Yet to assess pesticides' harms to soil species, the agency still uses a single test species-one that spends its entire life aboveground in artificial boxes-to estimate risk to all soil organisms: the European honeybee.</p><p>pesticide industry</p><p>The fact that the EPA relies on a species that literally may never touch soil in its entire life to represent the thousands of species that live or develop underground offers a disturbing glimpse of how the U.S. pesticide regulatory system is set up to protect the pesticide industry instead of species and their ecosystems. What this ultimately means is that pesticide approvals happen without any regard for how those chemicals can harm soil organisms.</p><p>To add to this, as principles of regenerative agriculture and soil health gain popularity around the world, pesticide companies have jumped on the bandwagon to greenwash their products. Every major company now has Web materials touting its role in promoting soil health, often advocating for reducing tilling and planting cover crops.</p><p>As general tenets, both these practices are indeed good for soil health and, if adopted responsibly, are great steps to take. But companies know that these practices are often accompanied by increased pesticide use. When fields are not tilled, herbicides are frequently used to kill weeds, and cover crops are often killed with chemicals before crop planting. This \"one step forward, one step back\" approach is preventing meaningful progress to protect our soils. Pesticide companies have so far been successful in co-opting \"healthy soil\" messaging because our regulators have shown no willingness to protect soil organisms from pesticides.</p><p>The long-term environmental cost of that failure can no longer be ignored. Soils are some of the most complex ecosystems on Earth, containing nearly a quarter of the planet's biodiversity. Protecting them should be a priority, not an afterthought. Our research indicates that achieving this will require that we reduce the world's growing and unsustainable reliance on pesticide-intensive agriculture. And it will require that the EPA take aggressive steps to protect soil health.</p><p>(Nathan Donley is environmental health science director at the Centre for Biological Diversity, Headquartered in Arizona.

(Only Elizabeth Warren demurred.</p><p>)The floods, fires, tornadoes, rain bombs and mudslides are, by far, the biggest threat to global security. Not China.</p><p> Hypersonic Arms RaceThe specter of \"the China threat\" has been effective in justifying endless support for war, expansion of the nuclear arsenal, and developing uber-costly high-tech weapons, like hypersonics, that don't even function yet. Even if they did function, they would open up the chance of miscalculation that could easily tip into nuclear war.</p><p>What makes hypersonic weapons so unique is not their speed, but rather, their maneuverability. They can keep their target a secret by taking a surprising pivot just before striking.</p><p> This makes them impossible to intercept with current technologies. It also makes them prime candidates for a miscalculated retaliatory second strike, and perilous escalation.</p><p>By contrast, the Pentagon's sales pitches stress how much further ahead China and Russia are in their hypersonics development. This narrative has so far been very successful in garnering Congressional support, so much so, that we now find ourselves in an accelerating hypersonic arms race, in which no one benefits but the weapons industry.</p><p>\"Climate change\"? What's that?The companies which routinely benefit from developing hypersonic weapons and their infrastructure are Lockheed Martin, Dynetics Technical Solutions, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, Elon Musk's SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Leidos, L3Harris, and Raytheon  the company where Lloyd Austin served as a board member until he was appointed Secretary of Defense.Clearly, Austin and his colleagues in the weapons industry are in the business to stimulate a profitable arms race.</p><p>The resulting instability has distracted lawmakers from what we actually need for real security. George Nacouzi, a senior engineer at the conservative RAND Corporation, and co-author of \"Hypersonic Missile Nonproliferation: Hindering the Spread of a New Class of Weapons,\" suggests, \"If you could just start with a trilateral agreement between these three major nations (China, the U.</p><p>S. and Russia), that would be taking a really effective step in terms of controlling proliferation of these weapons.</p><p>\"Hypersonics 101Hypersonic speed is defined as traveling at Mach 5 or higher, with Mach 1 being the speed of sound  about 680 mph. Mach 5 would be five times that, so hypersonic weapons are those which travel 57 miles per minute and faster.</p><p>There are two types of hypersonic weapons in development: 1) hypersonic cruise missiles, which use an advanced engine called a \"scramjet,\" which slows down incoming airflow to maintain steady combustion, and 2) hypersonic glide vehicles, which are launched from a rocket, but which then detach and glide, engine-free, through the low atmosphere, before striking a target.The development of hypersonics is still in its infancy, especially interception technologies.</p><p> Existing interception systems are designed to strike incoming ballistic missiles, which may travel just as fast as hypersonics, but because their trajectory is as predictable as a fly ball's arc, they can be intercepted. By contrast, the mosquito-like path of hypersonics makes them impossible to intercept.</p><p>Satellite PlanetHypersonic research and development is focused on developing a new kind of interception. Creating an effective interception system would require a matrix of thousands of satellites cocooning our planet, capable of tracking and striking every 3-dimensional coordinate, within the Earth's atmosphere, with nanosecond precision.</p><p> Northrup Grumman was awarded a $155 million contract in January 2021 to develop the prototype for such a satellite network. SpaceX and United Launch Alliance were awarded contracts worth about about $1 billion per year to launch the satellites.</p><p>The privacy, health and ecological implications of building such a defense infrastructure are staggering. Not to mention that every satellite launch punches another hole in the Earth's fragile ozone.</p><p>No Humans, No HumanityAnother unsettling implication of hypersonic interception is that it is being designed so that artificial intelligence will actually do most of the \"thinking\" required to \"pull the trigger.\" Because the time between launch and strike of an incoming missile could be as brief as 6 minutes, it is believed that humans would be prone to panic within such a short duration of time, whereas machines would not.</p><p> The rapid, rational thought processing required during such a moment of urgency is thought to be best handled by machines.As machine decision-making accelerates warfare, it is plain to see how conflict could easily escalate.</p><p> Compressed time and space creates the incentive for each side to strike first and strike fast in a perceived crisis. This is a recipe for crisis instability.</p><p> It's sort of like a Twitter war, with WMDs instead of words. Even if neither party initially planned to strike first, the accelerated dynamic inherent in an AI-driven scenario forces the likelihood of mutually assured destruction.</p><p>James Johnson, in Strategic Studies Quarterly, elaborates on what parts of the thinking would be turned over to artificial intelligence (AI):\"AI technology is expected to accelerate progress for hypersonic weapons and other long-range (conventional and nuclear-armed) precision munitions in all of these critical enabling capabilities: (1) autonomous navigation and advanced vision-based guidance systems, (2) ISR systems for targeting and tracking (especially mobile) targets, (3) missile release and sensor systems, (4) AI machine learning systems to decipher patterns from large data sets to support intelligence analysis for identifying and tracking targets, (5) pattern interpretation to cue decision support systems for enabling \"fire and forget\" missiles, and (6) escalation prediction.In a 2018 Sandia Laboratories report to the U.</p><p>S. Department of Energy, the company boasts that it is \"(a)chieving an autonomous hypersonic missile that can intelligently navigate, guide, and control itself and home-in on targets ranging from traditional stationary systems to targets that are themselves hypersonic vehicles--with all the maneuverability that this entails.</p><p>\"What kind of insane logic has led Congress to accept this ghastly scenario? Have we become so disconnected from the Earth, and from our own humanity, that we can so easily hand over the already compromised future of our planet to algorithms? As appalling as it sounds, this is precisely what approval of the defense budget has revealed. When you see a budget line item that reads \"hypersonic missile,\" assume that it will be a machine pulling the trigger.</p><p>Hypersonic Arms ControlThere also is some good news. Because hypersonics are still all experimental, we are in an ideal moment to establish risk-mitigation measures, such as negotiating a new international arms control agreement that would institute a moratorium or ban on hypersonic weapon testing.</p><p> Such a path would include calls for international transparency and confidence-building measures, such as exchanging weapons data and conducting joint technical studies.It would be in the highest interest of genuine security to do so.</p><p>Richard Speier of RAND Corporation reflects on such a prospect, \"I am optimistic about the U.S.</p><p>, Russia and China.

Feeding people with food contaminated with any poison should not be tolerated. But today's agriculture producing food as well as non-food is done with agricultural inputs that are poisonous. These foods and water contaminated with poisonous inputs may not kill humans immediately, but many of them kill gradually, they cause many diseases that are killers. Among these diseases are kidney diseases, Cancers, Diabetes, loss of immunity, high blood pressure and so on. They also disrupt natural control of unfriendly insects by friendly insects and also the control of mosquitos thus causing an increase in the number of deaths caused by mosquito diseases such as dengue, malaria and filaria. The deaths caused by these diseases are on the increase. Food produced using agrochemicals are said to be less nutritious too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So it has become essential to think of doing agriculture without the use of poisonous chemical inputs. Can agriculture be done without such inputs, all chemical inputs are poisonous, pesticides and weedicides that kill insects, microbes and plants.</p><p>These chemicals were first invented to be used during the war to fight malaria and yellow fever by killing mosquitos, when the war ended there were large factories producing these chemicals, which had to be used for some other purpose. So they were tried out as pest killers in agriculture, further these chemical factories were producing urea which was found to be useable as a fertilizer in agriculture. Chemicals were also used as weedicides. Thus they were utilised as chemical inputs in the Green Revolution. The objective of the Green Revolution was to increase food yields, hybrid seeds were invented that could absorb more fertilizer and give bigger yields. This was first applied in the case of main food crops such as rice, wheat, maize and sorghum. Dwarf plants were invented so that more fertilizer could be absorbed without the plant falling down due to the heavy weight. When more fertilizer was absorbed the plants became more susceptible to pest diseases but this could be overcome using chemical pesticides. Thus more use of chemical pesticides, fertilizer and weedicides became necessary. Although after some time the ill effects of green revolution technology were understood, the companies producing chemical inputs did not want to give up these methods that were bringing them huge profits.There were arrangements made to propagate this form of chemical agriculture worldwide. There was an international gathering in 1940s that discussed the propagation of the Green Revolution to which many country leaders were invited. They agreed to propagate it as the mainstream government strategy in agriculture.</p><p>On organisation of international Research Centres was set up under the name of CGIAR ( Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ). The purpose of these centres was to collect various varieties of indigenous seeds in each of the regions seed banks and to produce hybrid seeds out of them. These hybrid seeds could absorb more fertilizer, more water and give bigger yields. Propagation of this technology was promoted by Robert McNamara who was once defence secretary of the USA during the Vietnam War and was later the President of the World Bank. He was conscious of the fact that if hunger prevailed more countries would have (red) revolutions. To prevent this it was necessary to reduce hunger in the world and the Green Revolution was the answer.Norman Boulog who invented Green revolution (GR) was given the Nobel Prize.</p><p>CGIAR was first started in four centres but was later extended to a number of others. The agro chemical companies that were producing agro chemicals initially later became mammoth seed companies producing hybrid seeds. Now they have started working on Genetically Modified seeds. Among these companies are Cargill, Monsanto, Cyngenta, Shell, Du Pont and others. They have influenced the WTO to accept intellectual Property Rights through the TRIPs (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement).</p><p>Agriculture has also become expensive due to these reasons. For instance in Sri Lanka all chemical inputs are imported and are fossil fuel based. Since fossil fuel is a depleting resource they are expensive and have no future. Burning of fossil fuel increases global warming and leads to climate change disasters.</p><p>How do we overcome these?</p><p>It is argued that natural farming, though good cannot feed the increased population in Sri Lanka and in the world.</p><p>Is this true? Mankind has a history of around 250,000 years while the history of agriculture is around 10,000 years only. So, human beings could find their food sufficiently from nature. One may argue that Human population then was lower, even if this was true there were many more animals and plants then which were also fed by nature.</p><p>What is necessary is to maximize what is given by nature without disrupting its ability of regeneration. Nature has the ability of regeneration as one of its inherent qualities. Seeds germinate when they have moisture and warmth. Plants put out leaves that absorb sunlight and CO-2 from the atmosphere and moisture from the soil through roots. The leaves produce carbohydrates through photosynthesis. It feeds the tree and produces more branches and leaves. More sunlight is absorbed and more food is produced. It feeds animals and humans, produces flowers and fruits and more seeds thus giving birth to more plants. The leaves die and decay when they grow old and fall to the ground which is further digested by microbes and earthworms to create fertilizer. All this is done by nature free of charge and life goes on. Can this produce enough food to feed the entire human population? Before we go in to this aspect we must examine if the other form of chemical input dependent agriculture can feed all. It has certainly failed. There were 840 million people going to bed hungry every day in year 2000 according to FAO. It was promised that hunger would be reduced by half by 2015 by the MDGs. Now we have almost reached 2015 but the hungry people in the have has increased in number reaching 1.2 billion. So it is clear that present strategies have failed. Soils have got less fertile, deserts have expanded and increased, food has become more expensive and beyond the reach of the poorer people. Now agro fuels are being produced to meet the needs created by the shortage of fossil fuels that are a depleting resource. So what must be done? We have to turn back again to depend on what nature gives free.</p><p>Ecological / regenerative agriculture</p><p>To do this it is necessary to restore the ability of nature to regenerate itself. Fortunately more attention is now being given to agro ecology and regenerative agriculture. To do this the following things have to be done: Prevent soil erosion, by mulching, making contour ridges to reduce soil erosion, adopt SALT (Sloping Agriculture Land Technology) on sloping land; grow as many trees as possible growing to different canopies, to maximize the absorption of sunlight; recycle all organic matter and stop burning them; do diversified agriculture to reduce spreading of crop diseases; avoid the use of agro-chemicals that kill microbes, insects and reduce land fertility; utilize animal waste to make soil more fertile use of Jeevamurtha (a mixture of cow dung, cow urine, pulse powder, sweetener such as jaggery or fruit pulp and a handful of humus soil from the neighbourhood, allowed to ferment for one week and the resultant liquid is applied in the root area), Bio char is another organic input.</p><p>This form of ecological/regenerative agriculture does not use any poisonous chemical inputs. The overall productivity of such diversified agriculture is much more than any monoculture farming. It is much less expensive and therefore poorer and hungry people can get their food.</p><p>Adoption in Government declared Programmes</p><p>The Government of Sri Lanka has declared many programmes of rural development and food production where this form of poison free ecological agriculture can be applied. ApiWawamu Rata Nagamu intended to promote 4 million home gardens. Divineguma promoted and assisted one million home gardens,Gemi Diriya, Gamaneguma and Samurdhi were such programmes. All these expect communities to formulate their own plans. The money allocated for these programmes would be more than enough to cover the entire country.</p><p>Changing Land use patterns</p><p>It is necessary to change the land use patterns in tea, and coconut plantations. In tea plantation areas there is 25% of the land presently left uncultivated due to lack of soil fertility. This land should be given over to plantation worker families with guidance and assistance to do ecological home gardening. They will be able to get much higher productivity, diversified and more nutritious food at lower costs without poisonous inputs.</p><p>Similarly in coconut plantations in the coconut triangle it is possible to divide up land into smaller plots and given to landless farmers to do ecological farming.

With modern technology and new processes like regenerative agriculture offering the farmers the opportunity to touch new dimensions, the National Government on Saturday announced practical steps to revive the dignity of farmers who once were kings but now find themselves in mud holes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kiribath and other food items made of rice flour are a tasty part of the National New Year, which people of all races and religions will be celebrating this week. At an Aluth Sahal (new rice) festival held at the Sri Maha Bodhiya in Anuradhapura on Saturday, President Maithripala Sirisena significantly offered a bowl of organically grown rice before announcing new steps to make Sri Lanka a \"Wasa Wisa Nethi\" country and restore the dignity of the farmer community within two years.</p><p>The President, who himself hails from a Polonnaruwa farmer family, said that despite growing protests by groups apparently sponsored by vested interests, the government was determined to get the cooperation of the farming community for its mission to stop the import and use of expensive agrochemicals.</p><p>In the widely changing Budget for this year, the government announced it was withdrawing the provision of subsidised chemical fertilizer to the farmers and would instead give Rs. 25,000 to the farmer for each harvest, to encourage them to buy or make organic fertiliser from cow-dung, compost or other organic material. But farmer groups apparently sponsored by vested interests including transnational chemical corporations have been insisting they want to continue with the subsidized chemical fertiliser scheme. This produces a big harvest which is attractive but the unseen danger is that both the rice and mother earth are being polluted or poisoned. Thereby most people are eating a little poison with every meal and it is seen as one of the main reasons why more people are falling sick more often and hospitals are crowded like market places.</p><p>President Sirisena said the excessive use of imported agrochemicals was one of the main reasons for the kidney disease epidemic mainly in the rice bowl of the North Central Province. Some 20,000 farmers are reported to have died painfully during the past few years with tens of thousands of farmer families being crippled. The President said the kidney disease epidemic was producing 500 new patients every year. The government could not and would not allow this disaster to continue, whatever the agendas of the critics. He said the government hoped to educate and make the farmers aware of the hidden dangers and get their cooperation for the 'Wasa Wisa Nethi' mission.</p><p>Some farmer groups say they have no access to organic fertiliser. Among the groups collecting and marketing organic fertiliser is the Oblate Mission Services Centre in Maradana. Last month alone the mission sold about 1000 onekg packs of cow-dung fertiliser mainly for home gardens or plant nurseries. The cow-dung fertiliser is collected mainly from poor villages in the Trincomalee district's Kuchchaweli area where the enterprising priest Rev. Fr. Jesu Ramesh goes to several villages to collect the cow-dung, heat it in a furnace, powder and packet it.</p><p>Most importantly the President also announced that practical steps were being taken to raise the status of farmers. They are now selling only paddy at a varying rate which sometimes plunges to only about Rs. 20 a kg. Racketeering middle men make a huge profit and customers are forced to buy this rice at more than Rs. 100 a kg. The President said the new plan was to eliminate the middle men so that the farmers themselves could market their rice and get a better price, while the customers also could get 'Wasa Wisa Nethi' rice at a lower price. We hope this would be one of the healthiest National New Year gifts not only to the farmers but to all the people of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The cancer hospital poster tells us not to eat \"Cheena Batu\" as it causes Cancer. Malaysians call it \"Sayo Manis\" and they eat it to prevent cancer. What is going on?</p><p>Every year, at least one new hospital starts business. It is so profitable that a well-known Engineering Company has also gone into the hospital business. People are sick and need money for treatment. So new banks are opening now to rake in the profits.</p><p>The solution is simple. Just stop taking the poisons we shall mention later and wheat flour that now has no \"gullas\" because it has an insecticide. Wheat also has a problem protein, \"Gluten\" which causes the leaky gut syndrome. In the United States they are going for \"Gluten-free\" -- so the multinationals are dumping it on poor countries like Sri Lanka at low prices. The result -- bakeries and bread sellers are all over the town and the bread is even brought to your door step in three-wheelers. Kimbulas kill you in one bite but 'Kimbula Banis' will kill you slowly, your toes first then your feet and may be blindness also. Diabetes kills slowly but surely.</p><p>Mr. Seneviratne says most of us are not aware that a big transnational company adds juice extracted from beef in its chocolate. In a case at the Chennai High Court, a beauty culture product company accepted that its cream contained the oil from pig fats. A popular variety of balm has been banned in many European countries because it is a slow poison. But in Sri Lanka it is marketed in a big way. Another example is a variety of soap marketed as a bath and toilet soap. But in other countries it is used for bathing animals. Europe uses this soap for dogs but in Sri Lanka millions of people are encouraged to use it while children are abused to market it. A popular fizzy drink is in reality a toilet cleaner. It has been proved that it contains 21 types of poisons. Its sale is banned in the Indian Parliament but in Sri Lanka it is sold everywhere.</p><p>According to Mr. Seneviratne, certain transnational companies are having a big sale of some varieties of so-called health tonics here. When tested in Delhi at the All India Institute which houses the biggest laboratory in India, it was found that it is made from the waste left after oil is extracted from groundnut. When the Indian film idol Amitabh Bachchan was operated in hospital for ten hours, surgeons had to cut and remove large sections of the intestine and the surgeons had told him that the intestines had decayed due to the excessive intake of a variety of soft drinks.</p><p>Lots of people go for pizzas today. To make pizzas tasty, some companies add E-631 flavour enhancer which is made of pork or pig meat. If the following codes are mentioned on food packs then you should know what you are unknowingly consuming: E 322 - Beef E 422 - Alcohol E 442 - Alcohol &amp; chemical E 471 - Beef &amp; alcohol E 476 - Alcohol E 481 - Mixture of beef and pork E 627 - Dangerous chemical E 472 - Mixture of beef, meat &amp; pork E 631 - Oil extracted from pig fats.</p><p>Don't ignore these warnings.

Athuraliye Rathana Thera said that within three years they hoped to make tens of thousands of farmers aware of the dangers of poisoning Mother Earth and even the ground water through the excessive use of expensive agro-chemicals. The farmers had been tempted by transnational agro-chemical companies and their agents here to use these toxic agro-chemicals because they produced big harvests. But he hoped that when the farmers were made aware of the long term damage caused to Mother Earth by the use of agro-chemicals they would turn around and within three years he beleived that hundreds of thousands of acres of land would be cultivated with only organic fertilisers, bio-fertlisers and other hi-tech measures such as regenerative agriculture.</p><p>According to Presidential Secretary P. B. Abeykoon, the total amount of foreign exchange burnt in importing food to Sri Lanka is about Rs.400 billion annually. Of this Rs.60 billion had been spent on sugar and Rs.50 billion for powdered milk. About Rs.80 billion worth of agro-toxins are imported to Sri Lanka every year.</p><p>In a statement issued in connection with the launch of the programme 'a wholesome agriculture -- a healthy population -- a toxin-free nation,' Mr. Abeykoon said diabetes and other Non Communicable Diseases (NCDS) had reached pandemic proportions in Sri Lanka. Due to the injecting of hormones into meat products including chickens, girl children as young as six or seven are attaining puberty at an alarming rate, while childhood obesity is becoming bellyful.</p><p>Ven. Athuraliye Rathana told Wednesday's Rupavahini interview that almost all Sri Lanka's people were being poisoned daily in small or big doses through every meal we had.

Year 2015 is important, since the Millium Development Goals (MDGs) were to be achieved by 2015. We have almost completed this period now. The results of MDGs efforts are visible. It is clear that the most important of the MDGs, namely that of reducing world hunger by half and poverty by half by 2015 have not been achieved. Instead world hunger has increased compared to the level at which this commitment was made. It was 840 million then in 2,000 and now it has reached 1.2 billion. The disparities have increased too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In working out a Post 2015 development agenda, it is important to asses why the earlier agenda failed. If those who were responsible for fulfilling the previous agenda failed can they work out a new agenda that is likely to succeed? Isn't it too risky to give them this responsibility too? At least one has to understand why they failed to know if they could overcome the reasons for these failures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They failed because they were more interested in increasing and accumulating profits rather than reducing hunger and poverty. They were the causes of the problems, thus they could not be the solutions. This situation will continue in the future too.</p><p>Therefore, it is necessary that someone else should take the responsibility of setting up the agenda. If the present powers agree to follow such an agenda it is good. If they don't it has to be carried out without them. It may even have to be carried out amidst their opposition.</p><p>Who should formulate a Post 2015 Agenda?</p><p>Therefore, people who are worst affected by the present systems have to work out an agenda which can be carried out on their own and may be another agenda in which they could expect the cooperation of others who are not victimized by the present systems.</p><p>They must put greater emphasis on their own agenda. This agenda would be one that did not emphasize profit making and accumulation. It cannot count on the use of capital, since capital by nature gives priority to profit making and profit increasing. How do we carry out an agenda of development without depending on capital or with minimum dependence on capital? We have to depend more on what nature gives us free of charge and on the contribution of human efforts that does not depend on capital. Such an approach that depends on what nature gives cannot exploit nature destructively. In fact it has to remedy the damage that has already been done to nature through destructive exploitation.</p><p>Nature regenerates itself; if unobstructed it has the ability to regenerate the resources utilised by humans and other living beings. This ability to regenerate nature is essential for its proper functioning and survival of life. Human activity has already destroyed nature's ability of regeneration to a great extent. Therefore nature has begun to react adversely. We see this in the climate change disasters that are becoming worse every day. Unless we remedy these mistakes fast enough the very survival of life is threatened. Development therefore has to be regenerative rather than aiming at growth through excessive exploitation.</p><p>Trees absorb sunlight and Co-2 in the atmosphere and moisture through its roots and transform them into food prepared in the leaves through photosynthesis, fruits, seeds, timber and other forms of energy. Therefore, the presence of as many trees as possible helps this process. Biodiversity is essential. But we cut down forests so much that this process of transforming the sun's energy into other useful forms is obstructed.</p><p>The decaying organic matter is converted to soil fertility by microbes retaining the natural fertility of the soil. But we allow and accelerate so much soil erosion and destroy microorganisms by using weedicides that this process of maintaining soil fertility is obstructed. Similarly we obstruct the role played by insects killing them, using pesticides and also help the evolution of more resistant pests. Another damage we do is in using heavy machinery that makes the soil more compact and allow the top soil to erode by wind and rainfall rapidly. Monoculture plantations lead to spreading of diseases and make heavy use of pesticides necessary. If all these obstacles are avoided agriculture can be made regenerative. Using fossil fuel, which is a nonrenewable resource, is dangerous since we are running out of this resource rapidly. We increase global warming by burning fossil fuel and make climatic changes worse. Thus remedying the mistakes of the past must be given high priority. This is difficult for those who are making profit out of these mistakes. The agenda must therefore be made by those who are not profiting by these mistakes. There are worldwide forces that have opposed these mistakes.</p><p>For instance,</p><p>1.\"La via Campasena\" is a worldwide movement of small and marginal farmers who have fought against exploitative agriculture and for food sovereignty. It has many millions of members in a very large number of countries.</p><p>2. IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) is a worldwide network of organic farmer federations fighting against destructive forms of chemical agriculture, promoting nature farming</p><p>3. MST in Brazil is a movement of landless farmers with millions of members capturing land for landless farmers and promoting ecological agriculture.</p><p>4. Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) is a movement in India promoting ecological mixed farming systems with no external chemical inputs. There are 4 million farmers in India who are adopting the principles of ZBNF.</p><p>5. In many countries even in the West there are efforts that are promoting Eco-friendly Agriculture. Farmers who adopt these methods are given incentives.</p><p>6. Dr. Olivier De Schutter, the special rapporteur of UN on the Right to Food, has presented a paper to the UN Human Rights Council titled \"Agro Ecology and the Right to Food\" showing that it is Agro Ecology that can solve hunger in the world.</p><p>7. Agenda 21, the statement of the earth summit gave importance to sustainable agriculture in the 21st Century.</p><p>8. IAASTD ( International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development ), an international study done by 400 prominent scientists in a very large number of countries over a period of four years has said the same thing. It says that although there has been much advancement in agriculture it has made two serious errors,one of ignoring the social aspects and the other of ignoring the environmental aspects. These mistakes have to be corrected.The final IAASTD report was approved by over 60 countries and only USA and a few other countries disagreed.</p><p>9. PAN AP (Pesticide Action Network- Asia and Pacific) has done much research to show that chemical input dependent agriculture was wrong.</p><p>10. Asian Peasants Coalition is an Asian network working on the same lines.</p><p>11. Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology led by Dr. Vandana Shiva in India has done much work on these lines and has written many books.</p><p>12. World Social Forum is an initiative with a very large backing that opposes Globalization.</p><p>These movements must get together and work out a post 2015 Development agenda. Such an agenda has to mobilise millions of people worldwide for it to be effective.</p><p>Susan George was once asked if she had any faith in the future of the world. She said \"yes\". She explained that the present system cannot admit 2/3rds of the world population into it. The system expects them to disappear, since they are not needed. But this 2/3rds of \"excluded people\" were not going to quietly disappear, they were creating a world where they would be wanted and would be admitted. This was her hope for the future.</p><p>Therefore it is necessary to develop a strategy of engaging this 2/3rds of the world population in creating a new world. If human beings engage themselves in the task of remedying the mistakes of destroying the ability of regeneration of nature they would be engaged in this task of saving the world and saving themselves simultaneously.</p><p>The poor people, who go hungry since they cannot find money to buy food, have to get nature to give them free food.</p><p>This can be done by planting trees and allowing nature to grow them free of cost. Sun light is free, CO-2 absorbed from atmosphere is free, water given by nature is free, nature also gives free natural seeds and microbes make the soil fertile free of charge, if they are allowed to survive, erosion of top soil can be prevented at very little cost, insects pollinate flowers and friendly insects control unfriendly insects free of charge if they are allowed to do so. Mixed cropping instead of monocropping reduces the spread of pest damages and saves expenditure on pest control.</p><p>What is necessary is to make land available to those farmers who do regenerative agriculture. This can be done by preventing land plunder by profit makers. This is morally correct since land has to be restored back to natural fertility. Land should be able to absorb more water and retain it, thereby reducing drought losses and flood losses. This can be enhanced by reducing erosion and improving the humus content of the soil by recycling all organic matter.</p><p>Present patterns of landownership are often unhelpful. Large extents of land are owned by big land owners who utilise land for commercial monocrop farming. Heavy machinery is employed. Such use destroys land and agriculture as a whole.</p><p>Use of agrochemicals and heavy machinery run with fossil fuel becomes necessary. This type of agriculture is now recognised as unsustainable. Therefore there is a political necessity to change the present policies on form of land ownership. Land should be brought under the control of farmers who use it regeneratively.</p><p>In countries such as Sri Lanka land was not privately owned initially. Private ownership of land was introduced by British rulers in 1830s, since they wanted to plunder land for commercial crops such as tea and rubber. Domestic land lords profited by this and they plundered much land. This happened in Africa and many other third world countries too. This has resulted in disadvantageous land use and lots of people have become landless. Many poor people are driven out of villages into cities looking for other livelihoods.Now they are pushed out of cities too to beautify cities and facilitate foreign investors.This needs to be corrected and overall land use should be scientifically and ecologically planned. The best way to do this would be to give land to small scale farmers in small plots with guidance and assistance to do ecological agriculture.</p><p>In the Western countries large land holdings are utilised for large scale mechanised farming of monocrop. This is done with large agricultural subsidies given to such large farmers, allowing them to sell their products in other countries below actual cost of production. In the early stage of industrialisation this was necessary since industries needed cheap labour. This made a large population of small scale family farmers give up agriculture and move into cities. Now it is not so and urbanisation has become a problem. This has also contributed to increase in food prices.</p><p>This has created a tremendous problem in international trade too. It is useful to study if it would not be better even in the Western countries to go back to smaller scale family farming using more ecological methods. In Latin America large populations live in urban slums.</p><p>A Post 2015 Development Agenda should therefore look for ways of mobilising millions of people to do these changes in the way they deal with nature. This can be named \" healing the earth \".</p><p>Nature thus treated is able to give free food to all. Food should not be a commodity for earning profits. It should be a gift of nature to feed the hungry.</p><p>In Sri Lanka when the world food prices increased around 2007, the Government declared a programme titled \" Api Wawamu Rata Nagamu\" ( \"Let's grow and build the nation\"). The declared objective was to promote 4 million home gardens; this meant that each family had to grow its home garden.</p><p>This was a feasible programme, if it was attempted seriously, but it was not attempted seriously, it was only an election promise with no serious effort to implement it. At a subsequent election another programme of similar type was declared. This was titled \"Divineguma\" (livelihood improvement) this time the aim was to assist 1 million home gardens. With Rs. 10,000 spent on one home garden. Again the strategy was not sound. Thus proper results have not been obtained.</p><p>Need to look at the macro-ecological aspects</p><p>We have to look at the ecological aspects holistically. In Sri Lanka the centre of the country is hilly. Maximum rainfall is obtained in the hills. There are a large number of rivers that start in the hills and flow down to the plains. When the hill country was covered with forest it retained much of the top soil and rainwater was absorbed into the soil, this water flowed down the rivers and streams throughout the year and provided water for irrigation and other needs year round.</p><p>Agriculture was done in the plains utilising this water and diverting them through canals where necessary. Reservoirs were built in the plains to store this water. In each of these reservoirs there was a catchment area that collected water feeding into the reservoir, these catchments were kept forested. Irrigation systems were then planned ecologically. Seasons of cultivation were decided in accordance with the weather patterns. One way of meeting the changes in climate was by growing a diversity of crops.</p><p>In dryer areas such as the lower Uva Province, diversified crop farming was adopted by the traditional farmers. In the \"chena\"( dry land farm) they grew at least ten food crops simultaneously ( \"dasabhogawagawa\" ) This enabled them to face climatic changes since some crops remained even when some died due to lack of rain. Some crops such as millet required less water. Presently the farmers have shifted to mono crops such as maize and sugar cane and they do not cultivate during part of the year since there is not enough water.</p><p>In irrigated agricultural areas such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala and so on, traditional farmers cultivated both paddy and millet. Now this practice has been largely given up. Thus we see the necessity to change the attitudes and approaches of agriculture entirely. To do this it is necessary to introduce these changes in the education system as a whole. Private companies should not be allowed to influence and distort education to suit their profit interests.</p><p>Another important aspect is to deal with the food patterns. In most traditional countries there has been tremendous knowledge of natural food and nutritious and medicinal qualities of herbs. Much knowledge and use of uncultivated food existed.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, India and other countries there have been systems of medicine such as the Ayurveda that had tremendous knowledge of the food, nutritious and medicinal values of plants.</p><p>In the Ayurveda system the approach to health is very different from that in the Western system of medicine. In Ayurveda it says that the body comprises of three systems ( thridosha )namely the \"Va\" ( nervous system ), \"Pith\" ( digestive system) and \"Sem\" ( respiratory system ). If these systems function in proper balance the body can resist germs that enter it preventing illness even when germs enter. If these systems go out of balance ( \"dos kipeema\" ), the body goes ill. The way to cure is to bring back the balance of the systems ( \"dos samanaya\" ). This is done using various preparations made out of herbs and also by adjusting the food pattern and the habits of life. This is an entirely natural approach. The patient is advised to change the pattern of life to suit the requirements, such as avoiding breaking of rest certain types of food and so on. There were other types of treatment for other illnesses such as bone fractures, eye diseases, snake bites, mental illnesses and so on. Even ordinary people had some understanding of these health and food practices.</p><p>Religions can play a big role in formulating the thinking of people to suit the future. For instance Buddhism trains people to understand impermanence( \"anithya\" ) of all things . Since nothing is permanent, attachment or greed( \"thanha\" ) leads to suffering since what is accumulated is lost. To cultivate non-attachment people are encouraged to share ( Dana ). Accumulation therefore is foolish. This is a principle that should guide the modern world. How do we reorganise the economic system based on principles of non-accumulation and sharing. This is a contradiction that the present economic system has to overcome.</p><p>Karl Marx showed that the contradiction in the capitalist system is that while production is done socially, ownership remains in the hands of individuals. Therefore ownership has to be made social too. This can be done only by transforming the means of production to social ownership. This transformation should finally lead to a situation where each makes the full contribution to society according to his/her ability while obtaining only what she/he needs individually. Society looks after most of the needs so that individual earning becomes less necessary.</p><p>The contradictions between what we preach in religion and what we do in practice have to be overcome. It is by bringing about such changes that the present contradictions and crises in society could be overcome.</p><p>The financial crisis is due to the fact that money is allowed to circulate freely and it flows from places of less profit to places of higher profits.</p><p>It cannot balance between the money available with the goods and services that are available. This crisis is solved only when such a balance is established. Earning more money has become the guiding principle.Trade Crisis is due to the trade regulations being formulated for the interests of the biggest traders. What is needed is a fair exchange and not trade for profits of the more powerful.</p><p>Environmental crisis is due to nature being exploited too aggressively and destructively. It can be solved only by limiting production to the essentials and by preventing exploitation of nature in a manner that destroys the ability of nature to function properly in a regenerative manner. Consumption has to be reduced. It is presently expanded for trade needs. Such limited production will also reduce waste and pollution.</p><p>Another crisis is due to a very large proportion of the human population being made redundant. Human beings if allowed and encouraged to contribute to the recovery of nature and harmony in human society, any increase in human population will also increase the wellbeing of nature and society as a whole.</p><p>Hunger is not due to lack of food production to feed all. It is due to the fact that food does not get justly distributed and shared.</p><p>This can be overcome by people being enabled to produce the food they need and sharing them as needed, without making it a profit making commodity. On the whole a post 2015 Development agenda must give priority to recovery and conservation, producing and sharing as needed and not for profit making. It has therefore to be led not by profit makers but by those who are victimized in the process of profit making and by those who are genuinely concerned about the dangers.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.
