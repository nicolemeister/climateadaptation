Drawing on international evidence, I noted that recoveries following debt restructuring are often delayed when accompanied by banking crises. However, I contended that Sri Lanka avoided such a crisis due to the careful design of its domestic debt operation and effective communication by the Central Bank-factors that could support a faster recovery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I also challenged concerns about a renewed foreign exchange crisis following the resumption of external debt servicing, pointing to debt sustainability analysis (DSA) that does not support such fears.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this article, I cautiously suggest that Sri Lanka is now on the right path, driven by strong reform momentum from the Government and independent institutions. With improved economic and political stability, the country must now shift from crisis management to long-term planning. I outline key risks to sustaining this recovery and propose policy measures to address them.</p><p>Looking ahead, Sri Lankans must balance optimism with realism-remaining patient and committed to long-term goals rather than declaring early victory. With national elections now concluded, the country has a valuable window of opportunity to advance difficult reforms and ensure their benefits reach all citizens in the years to come.</p><p>Overcoming 'reform fatigue' is key</p><p>Thanks to strong political leadership and broad public support, Sri Lanka has reached the halfway point of its 48-month IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, launched in March 2023. This milestone marks a shift from economic stabilisation to a phase where people are beginning to expect real, visible improvements in their daily lives-though global economic uncertainties and domestic shocks could pose challenges.</p><p>Many past IMF programs in Sri Lanka often faltered due to political instability, economic shocks, and public fatigue with difficult reforms. To avoid repeating history, it's crucial to maintain momentum and public trust. Clear communication about the purpose and benefits of reforms, along with measurable progress, can help sustain support. Involving citizens, businesses, and civil society in the reform process fosters shared ownership and strengthens resilience.</p><p>Public support for Sri Lanka's reform agenda remains strong, shaped by the hard lessons of the 2022 crisis and a growing recognition that delaying reforms has long hindered progress. These reforms should not be viewed as externally imposed, but as long-overdue steps toward sustainable recovery. As early signs of improvement emerge, it is vital that policymakers remain committed, and the public stays engaged-even as the benefits take time to reach all segments of society. Sustaining this momentum is essential to securing a more stable, inclusive, and prosperous future. The key challenge lies in maintaining public buy-in, particularly as many have been influenced by decades of populist policies and may grow impatient if reforms do not yield immediate, broad-based gains.</p><p>The current IMF program is distinct from previous ones</p><p>The reform agenda underpins this IMF program places strong emphasis on improving public financial and debt management, strengthening governance, and implementing anti-corruption measures. Crucially, it also prioritises social protection to shield vulnerable groups from the adverse effects of fiscal consolidation. Its flexible design allows for periodic reviews and adjustments in response to evolving economic conditions. What sets this program apart is that it was negotiated during Sri Lanka's most severe socio-economic and political crisis, with public debt sustainability as a central precondition-requiring an unprecedented debt restructuring effort.</p><p>The overarching goal of this reform agenda is to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, anchored in stronger governance, greater transparency, institutional reform, and improved public sector performance. While governance challenges and limited institutional capacity remain, these are being progressively addressed as part of the broader reform effort.</p><p>A remarkable turnaround</p><p>Sri Lanka's economic recovery has exceeded expectations. Real GDP grew by 5% in 2024, driven by rebounds in construction, tourism-related services, and industry. In Q1 2025, the economy expanded by an estimated 4.8%, following 5.1% growth in Q1 2024. High-frequency indicators, including the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, services, and construction, continue to signal solid expansion. On the fiscal front, reforms are delivering results. Government revenue is on track to reach 15% of GDP in 2025-the highest in 15 years-and is expected to rise further. The primary balance is projected to reach 2.3% of GDP in 2025, helping to reduce public debt in the years ahead.</p><p>The outlook for 2025 remains positive, with growth projected near potential and deflationary pressures easing. The external position has strengthened, supported by a current account surplus, robust remittances, and a strong recovery in tourism and services exports. Gross official reserves rose to $ 6.3 billion by end-May 2025, providing about four months of import cover, while the Sri Lankan rupee remains stable, reflecting improved market confidence.</p><p>Despite this progress, near-term risks persist. Global trade tensions, Middle East instability, and volatility in energy prices and shipping costs could strain the external balance. A global slowdown may dampen tourism and exports, while climate-related disruptions threaten agriculture and rural livelihoods.</p><p>In the medium to long term, Sri Lanka must address structural challenges such as low labour productivity, climate vulnerability, weak governance and institutional capacity constraints. Tackling these issues is essential to sustaining growth, enhancing resilience, and ensuring the recovery is inclusive and durable.</p><p>Preparing the economy for the long road to recovery</p><p>Transitioning from stabilisation to long-term growth requires a bold, forward-looking agenda to promote growth enhancing structural reforms. By institutionalising reforms, investing in people and innovation, and building resilience against future shocks, Sri Lanka can lay the foundation for an equitable and sustainable future.</p><p>1. Continued efforts to institutionalise macroeconomic stability</p><p>Sri Lanka has made significant strides in institutionalising reforms aimed at ensuring long-term fiscal and economic stability. Key achievements include the establishment of a credible medium-term fiscal framework to uphold fiscal discipline, enhanced monetary policy independence to anchor inflation expectations, the accumulation of external buffers through adequate foreign reserves and a flexible exchange rate regime, and improved debt transparency and management to prevent future crises.</p><p>Looking ahead, the continued institutionalisation of these reforms is essential to ensure their durability beyond the current IMF program cycle. Sustained commitment to increasing government revenue, maintaining expenditure within statutory limits, and achieving a primary balance consistent with debt sustainability remains critical. Equally important is the improvement of governance in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which is vital for long-term fiscal sustainability.</p><p>The full implementation of the Public Financial Management (PFM) Act by the end of 2025 will mark a major milestone. It will mandate the publication of a comprehensive Fiscal Strategy Statement, a Fiscal Risk Statement, and a medium-term PFM Reform Strategy. Embedding these reforms into legal and institutional frameworks will help safeguard fiscal discipline, enhance public trust, and build resilience against future shocks.</p><p>Public sector reform should focus on enhancing service delivery through digitalisation, performance-based management, and institutional streamlining. Modernising the tax system is also essential to raise Sri Lanka's low tax-to-GDP ratio. This should include broadening the tax base, simplifying tax codes, and improving compliance through digital tools and risk-based audits.</p><p>SOE reform is crucial to reducing fiscal risks, especially from loss-making entities in the energy and transport sectors. The government is restoring cost-recovery pricing, limiting SOE borrowing, and drafting a new SOE law aligned with the PFM Act to institutionalise governance, transparency, and accountability. These reforms are vital to unlocking sustainable growth and restoring public confidence.</p><p>The Central Bank remains committed to price stability while ensuring financial system stability. Inflation expectations have been anchored through data-driven policy and the cessation of monetary financing. Strengthened by the Bank of Sri Lanka Act of 2023, the Central Bank now enjoys greater policy independence. Its equity position has improved, and official reserves are growing through foreign exchange purchases, supported by a flexible exchange rate regime.</p><p>Sri Lanka's financial system remains stable and well-capitalised. Credit growth is supporting economic recovery, and non-performing loans are beginning to decline. The Central Bank is enhancing its supervisory and regulatory frameworks, including reforms to the Finance Business and Leasing Acts and the introduction of a Rescue and Insolvency Bill. Governance reforms are also aligning state-owned banks with private sector standards through independent boards and stricter oversight.</p><p>2. Reducing debt overhang</p><p>Sri Lanka's debt sustainability has improved significantly following comprehensive restructuring efforts, including both bilateral and private creditors. A key institutional milestone is the establishment of the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) under the Public Debt Management Act of 2024. This office will centralise debt management functions and align borrowing decisions with a medium-term debt strategy, enhancing coordination and transparency. Debt transparency has also advanced, with the Ministry of Finance now publishing quarterly debt reports that include both direct and contingent liabilities. Despite this progress, public debt levels remain high, constraining fiscal space for essential development spending. Interest payments continue to consume a substantial portion of Government revenue, crowding out investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.</p><p>An added layer of complexity stems from the inclusion of macro-linked bonds (MLBs), which adjust debt service obligations based on economic performance. If Sri Lanka exceeds the growth thresholds specified in the MLB agreements, debt service costs will increase starting in 2028. While this has raised concerns about potential balance of payments pressures, the impact of triggering the highest MLB adjustment is expected to be modest (see Figure 1). Moreover, improved macroeconomic conditions could help offset the additional debt service burden.</p><p>Nevertheless, building adequate external buffers remains essential. In the face of global uncertainties, any shortfall in foreign reserves or export earnings could strain Sri Lanka's capacity to meet external obligations once full debt servicing resumes. Until market access is fully restored, stable remittance inflows, robust export performance, and continued access to concessional financing will be critical to mitigating these risks.</p><p>3. Deepening governance reforms</p><p>To secure long-term stability and inclusive growth, Sri Lanka must now deepen its structural governance reforms. The authorities remain committed to advancing anti-corruption and governance initiatives, with the implementation of the Anti-Corruption Act already underway. This process is supported by annual updates to the Government Action Plan and quarterly progress reviews to ensure accountability and momentum.</p><p>A major milestone was the enactment of a comprehensive Asset Recovery Law in April 2025, alongside efforts to strengthen the asset declaration system. Amendments to the Strategic Development Projects Act and the Port City Act-expected before end of 2025-will introduce transparent, rule-based criteria for granting tax incentives, enhancing investor confidence and reducing discretion.</p><p>To curb revenue leakages, the Government is introducing new Customs legislation and has established a dedicated Tax Crimes Investigation Unit. Public financial management is being reinforced through a forthcoming Public Procurement Law and enhanced oversight of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The proposed Public Asset Management Bill and amendments to the National Audit Act will further strengthen transparency, accountability, and enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>Sri Lanka is also enhancing its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) framework under the 2023-2028 national policy. Reforms include updates to the Companies Act to align with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and improve beneficial ownership transparency. Additional measures are being implemented to strengthen financial intelligence, enhance money laundering investigations, and improve risk-based supervision of financial institutions.</p><p>4. Enhancing trade and investment</p><p>To strengthen economic resilience and reduce vulnerability to external shocks, Sri Lanka must diversify its export base beyond traditional sectors such as tea, garments, and tourism. Emerging sectors like information and communication technology (ICT), logistics, agritech, and green industries offer promising pathways for sustainable and inclusive growth. Agritech and value-added agriculture can enhance rural livelihoods and food security, while green industries-such as renewable energy and sustainable manufacturing-can position Sri Lanka as a competitive player in the global green economy.</p><p>Improving trade facilitation is equally critical. Sri Lanka ranked 73rd out of 139 countries in the World Bank's 2023 Logistics Performance Index (LPI), a notable improvement from 92nd in 2018. However, further progress is needed in areas such as Customs efficiency, port infrastructure, and shipment reliability. Key priorities include digitalising customs processes, reducing clearance times, and deepening regional trade integration-particularly through platforms like the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and potential free trade agreements with ASEAN and the European Union.</p><p>Attracting foreign direct investment requires a stable, transparent, and investor-friendly environment. While recent reforms help improve business registration and land access, challenges remain in investor protection, contract enforcement, and regulatory predictability. Strengthening land rights, simplifying administrative procedures, and enhancing the capacity of commercial courts are essential next steps.</p><p>Reforms to the Strategic Development Projects Act and the Port City Act, along with the rollout of a single-window investment facilitation system, aim to improve transparency and streamline approval processes. Aligning investment policies with green and digital economy goals will be key to attracting high-quality, sustainable investment and positioning Sri Lanka as a regional hub for innovation and logistics.</p><p>5. Promoting private sector-led growth</p><p>Private sector growth in Sri Lanka faces several structural challenges that must be addressed to unlock its full potential. These include inadequate infrastructure, limited access to finance, regulatory inefficiencies, and gaps in human capital and innovation. Despite Sri Lanka's strategic location, underinvestment in critical infrastructure-such as ports, energy, and transport-continues to constrain competitiveness.</p><p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for over 75% of businesses, face persistent barriers to affordable credit. This highlights the need for financial sector deepening, fintech innovation, and stronger credit infrastructure. At the same time, regulatory complexity, slow contract enforcement, and bureaucratic red tape hinder business operations. A mismatch between workforce skills and market demands, coupled with low investment in research and development (R and D), further limits innovation and productivity.</p><p>To foster private sector-led growth, Sri Lanka must take a multi-pronged approach: Streamlining regulations and digitising business processes will help reduce costs, delays, and administrative burdens. Establishing a single-window clearance system will be key to improving the ease of doing business. Expanding access to finance-particularly for entrepreneurs in underserved regions-remains critical. This should include scaling up digital financial services, introducing credit guarantee schemes, and promoting inclusive lending models.</p><p>Building a knowledge-based economy will require increased investment in research and development, support for incubators and accelerators, and policies that promote digital skills, e-commerce, and technology adoption-especially among SMEs. By addressing these structural barriers, Sri Lanka can create a more dynamic, inclusive, and innovation-driven private sector that serves as a key engine of sustainable economic growth.</p><p>6. Investing in human capital</p><p>Investing in human capital through education, health, and social protection is essential to building a productive, inclusive, and future-ready workforce capable of driving long-term economic growth.</p><p>Education reform is essential to preparing Sri Lanka's workforce for the future. While the country has achieved high literacy and school enrolment rates, its education system must be modernised to meet the evolving demands of the labour market. Reforms should prioritise aligning curricula with future-ready skills-particularly in STEM, digital literacy, and critical thinking. Expanding vocational and technical education, enhancing teacher training and performance, and integrating digital learning tools are also critical to improving learning outcomes. Stronger collaboration between the private sector, universities, and training institutions can help bridge the gap between education and employment, ensuring that graduates are equipped with the skills employers need.</p><p>Health system strengthening is fundamental to productivity and inclusive development. While Sri Lanka's public health system is robust, challenges persist in service quality, regional disparities, and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Priorities include strengthening primary healthcare, investing in health infrastructure, and expanding access to mental health services. Leveraging digital health solutions and improving health data systems can enhance service delivery and resource allocation.</p><p>An effective social protection system is critical for reducing poverty, managing economic shocks, and promoting inclusive growth. Historically, Sri Lanka's safety nets have been fragmented and poorly targeted. Current reforms aim to build a unified, data-driven system that prioritises the most vulnerable. Under the IMF program, the Government met its social spending target by March 2025 after resolving technical delays. Payments to vulnerable groups have been increased and extended, with retroactive payments underway. The second round of applications is nearing completion, and the digital welfare registry is being upgraded to improve targeting. By end-2025, 1.6 million households are expected to benefit.</p><p>To reduce long-term dependency, a World Bank and ADB-supported empowerment program will provide livelihood support to 1.2 million beneficiaries over the next three years, helping transition from welfare to self-reliance.</p><p>7. Building climate and disaster resilience</p><p>Building climate and disaster resilience is essential to safeguarding Sri Lanka's development gains and ensuring a sustainable, inclusive future. By investing in green infrastructure, mobilising climate finance, and strengthening disaster preparedness, the country can reduce vulnerability, protect livelihoods, and enhance long-term economic stability.</p><p>Sri Lanka faces increasing climate risks-including floods, droughts, and coastal erosion-making climate-resilient infrastructure a national priority. Key areas for investment include expanding renewable energy, promoting sustainable transport, and adopting climate-smart agricultural practices to enhance food security and rural resilience.</p><p>Mobilising climate finance is critical to support these efforts. This should include tapping into international climate funds, issuing green bonds, and fostering public-private partnerships. Strengthening institutional capacity will be essential to effectively access, manage, and deploy these resources.</p><p>With many districts exposed to natural hazards, disaster preparedness must be elevated as a core development priority. This requires improving early warning systems, investing in adaptive infrastructure, and integrating climate risk assessments into national planning and public investment decisions.</p><p>8. Managing risks of demographic transition</p><p>Sri Lanka is undergoing a significant demographic transition, characterised by a declining fertility rate and a rapidly aging population. This shift presents long-term challenges for labour supply, labour productivity economic growth, and fiscal sustainability. With population growth at a historic low of 0.5% (see Figure 2), the 2024 Census of the Department of Census and Statistics provides a timely opportunity to realign development strategies with emerging demographic realities.</p><p>To address a shrinking workforce and rising dependency ratios, Sri Lanka must take proactive steps to boost labour force participation-particularly among women-while retaining skilled youth. Expanding access to childcare, promoting flexible work arrangements, and enforcing workplace equality are essential to unlocking women's economic potential. The Proposed Employment Act is expected to enhance labour market flexibility and increase women's participation in the workforce.</p><p>Urbanisation adds another layer of complexity, requiring inclusive urban planning, affordable housing, and efficient transport systems. Developing secondary cities and integrating demographic data into urban policy will be critical to building a resilient, future-ready economy that can adapt to demographic shifts.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Sri Lanka has made notable progress in stabilising its economy, with early gains from fiscal and monetary reforms. Revenue collection is improving, inflation has eased, and debt sustainability has strengthened following successful debt restructuring efforts. However, sustaining this recovery will require the full and timely implementation of deep structural reforms already underway.</p><p>Institutionalising fiscal discipline and building resilience to external shocks-anchored by strong political commitment and public support-remain critical. Key priorities include strengthening public financial management, modernising the tax system, reforming state-owned enterprises, and enhancing governance and transparency. Equally important are investments in human capital, export diversification, and private sector development to drive inclusive and sustainable growth. Proactively addressing emerging risks-such as demographic shifts and climate change-will also be essential. As Sri Lanka prepares to resume full debt servicing in 2028 amid a complex global environment, maintaining reform momentum and public trust will be vital to securing a durable, inclusive, and future-ready recovery.</p><p>Sri Lanka now has a historic opportunity to make the current IMF-supported program the last one it will ever need. By fully implementing the structural reforms underway and embedding them into strong legal and institutional frameworks, the country can break the cycle of repeated external assistance. Achieving durable macroeconomic stability, restoring investor confidence, and building robust domestic institutions will lay the foundation for self-reliance. With sustained political commitment, public support, and a clear long-term vision, Sri Lanka can transition from crisis management to resilience-ensuring that future growth is driven from within, not dependent on external bailouts.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["7.

However, for many, this time also marks the start of allergy season in the United States, which can begin as early as February in warmer regions and persist through early summer. Tree pollen usually kicks things off in early spring, followed by grass pollen in late spring and summer. Later in the year, fall allergies-primarily triggered by weed pollen, such as ragweed-begin in late summer and continue into autumn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 25.7 percent of U.S. adults were diagnosed with seasonal allergies. That means about a quarter of Americans suffer from watery eyes, a tickly throat, and a runny nose. Pollen can make breathing outdoor air difficult. However, it's getting worse: With climate change altering weather patterns and triggering an earlier and more prolonged high pollen count, we may all be experiencing more sneezing and breathing-related health issues than usual.</p><p>'If you live with seasonal allergies and feel like the pollen seasons feel longer and longer every year, you may be right,' writes Paul Gabrielsen, of the University of Utah. '[P]ollen seasons start 20 days earlier, are 10 days longer, and feature 21 percent more pollen than in 1990-meaning more days of itchy, sneezy, drippy misery.'</p><p>But it's not just happening in the U.S., and the impacts can be fatal. In November 2016, a rare and deadly event known as 'thunderstorm asthma' struck Melbourne, Australia, overwhelming emergency services as thousands experienced sudden, severe breathing problems. Hospitals saw a massive surge in asthma-related cases, with 10 deaths and many more struggling to breathe within minutes of the storm. Scientists later explained that storm activity had broken up pollen particles, releasing allergenic proteins into the air that triggered asthma attacks, even in people with no prior history of the condition.</p><p>Allergy specialist Dr. Kari Nadeau, chair of the Department of Environmental Health at the Harvard School of Public Health, blames global warming. 'There are these extreme, chaotic conditions that climate change is associated with,' Nadeau told Boston 25 News in March 2023. 'And that warming is adversely affecting our pollen seasons.</p><p>'Trees are getting the wrong message, and they're releasing pollen earlier in the season,' said Nadeau. 'So my patients, for example, otherwise would have started allergy season in March, now they're having allergy season start in January-February.'</p><p>Pollen: A Pervasive Problem</p><p>Hay fever isn't new. It was first described in 1819 when physician John Bostock presented a novel case to the Medical and Chirurgical Society, calling it a 'case of a periodical affection of the eyes and chest.' It was the first recorded description of what he later called 'catarrhus aestivus,' or summer catarrh, which would become what we know today as hay fever.</p><p>Since the first reported case in 1819, however, hay fever has become increasingly common. In 2024, hay fever affected 10-40 percent of the world's population. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994), which collected information from nearly 40,000 people in the United States, showed that 26.9 percent and 26.2 percent of the population were allergic to perennial ryegrass and ragweed respectively-percentages at least twice as high as in the previous survey (1976-1980).</p><p>It's the pollen that's to blame for allergy symptoms. Plants must join sex cells to reproduce. Pollen carries the male sex cells, so it must be transferred to the female plant in some way. Many plants use insects, such as bees, to transfer their pollen to other plants, while others rely on wind. The plants that are wind-pollinated produce tiny, light pollen that can be carried on a breeze-fantastic for their reproduction, disastrous for our respiration.</p><p>The Immune Response and Climate Change</p><p>When we inhale pollen grains, they can trigger an immune response in which our body attempts to defend itself against them. Our immune system can overreact to harmless pollen; the sneezing, watery eyes, and histamines that make your nose itchy are designed to kill or eject the pollen. If you're prone to allergic rhinitis, the more pollen you're exposed to, the worse your symptoms may be.</p><p>Not every hay fever sufferer is allergic to every pollen. It tends to be seasonal: In the spring, tree pollens like those from the birch, oak, and mountain cedar cause the most problems, followed by grass and weeds like mugwort and nettle in the summer with weeds like ragweed (the leading cause of hay fever in the U.S.) and fungus spores following in autumn.</p><p>However, the primary factor, climate change, impacts hay fever throughout the year. Climate change can increase the release and potency of certain types of pollen, leading to more severe hay fever.</p><p>In 2015, the World Allergy Organization, a group comprising 97 medical societies from around the world, released a statement warning that climate change would impact the timing, duration, and severity of pollen seasons.</p><p>'The strong link between warmer weather and pollen seasons provides a crystal-clear example of how climate change is already affecting people's health across the U.S.,' said William Anderegg, a biologist at the University of Utah, about his team's research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2020.</p><p>'A number of smaller-scale studies-usually in greenhouse settings on small plants-had indicated strong links between temperature and pollen,' notes Anderegg. 'This study reveals that connection at continental scales and explicitly links pollen trends to human-caused climate change.'</p><p>Warmer Weather Means More Pollen</p><p>The first culprit is the rise in temperature caused by climate change. Compared to previous decades, plants now bloom earlier and produce pollen for a more extended period of the year. According to Sanjiv Sur, MD, director and professor of Allergy and Immunology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, 'There's no question [that] as there's global warming, the pollen season is increasing.'</p><p>A 2015 study published in Global Change Biology showed that, between 2001 and 2010, the U.S. pollen season started on average three days earlier than it did in the 1990s. A 2024 article by the Association of American Medical Colleges stated that over the past several decades, the pollen season has extended by as much as three weeks in some areas of North America. What's more, the Global Change Biology study found that the amount of airborne pollen increased by more than 40 percent. 'These changes are likely due to recent climate change and particularly the enhanced warming and precipitation at higher latitudes in the contiguous United States,' concluded the researchers.</p><p>This may also be contributing to the increase in people suffering from hay fever. One estimate predicts that by the 2050s, that number will reach four billion.</p><p>Pollen Problem Fueled by Carbon Dioxide</p><p>While warmer temperatures have led to earlier and longer pollen seasons, as well as more potent pollen, rising carbon dioxide levels are also contributing to plants producing more pollen. Plants feed on carbon dioxide, so when there's an abundance of it, they can go wild, producing pollen. This, coupled with warmer temperatures, is ideal for plant growth and reproduction, which means more allergens for us.</p><p>Take, for example, the invasive and highly allergenic plant ragweed. In 2000, Lewis Ziska, an expert on climate change and its impact on plants, led a research team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture that grew ragweed in the lab under three conditions: pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide, current levels, and the higher levels expected in the 21st century. They found that exposure to current levels increased the amount of pollen the ragweed produced by 131 percent compared to pre-industrial carbon dioxide levels. Under predicted future carbon dioxide levels, it skyrocketed to 320 percent. The researchers concluded that, 'the continuing increase in atmospheric CO2 could directly influence public health by stimulating the growth and pollen production of allergy-inducing species such as ragweed.'</p><p>Ziska says the intensity of an allergic reaction depends on the amount of pollen released, the duration of exposure, and the allergenicity of the pollen. In ragweed, these three factors work strongly together. 'What's unique about ragweed is that it produces so much pollen-roughly a billion grains per plant,' he wrote in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives in 2016. 'And the Amb a 1 protein [in the pollen coat] is also highly reactive with the immune system.'</p><p>No Escape for the City</p><p>Though it might seem that hay fever would be less of a problem in the city, away from all the trees and weeds, the opposite appears to be true. Similar results have been observed outside the lab: In downtown Baltimore, where it's 3\u00b0C warmer and contains 30 percent more carbon dioxide than the countryside, ragweed 'thrived, growing bigger and puffing out larger plumes of pollen than its country counterpart,' reported Rachel Becker in The Verge.</p><p>Ragweed may thrive in our cities, but there's a bigger-and taller-problem: The trees planted to provide shade and beauty are making our allergies worse.</p><p>'Many people believe that the more trees you have in a city's green infrastructure, the more they act as a biofilter,' said Amena Warner of Allergy UK, as reported by The Ashland Chronicle. 'But are they the right kind of trees? In urban areas, particularly in London, there's a lean towards planting birch trees, which are highly allergenic. When they're in cities, people can't escape the pollen easily, and it's virtually indestructible unless it's wet.'</p><p>That means the pollen that collects on your clothes, on the bottom of your shoes, and in your hair during your afternoon stroll could plague you until it rains or is washed away. That, says Warner, extends the time you're in contact with pollen, even out of pollen season. The UK has the third-highest rates of allergic rhinitis and asthma prevalence globally, which is why Allergy UK is deeply concerned about this issue.</p><p>'It's important that the right tree is planted in the right place,' said Warner. 'We want to raise awareness of why planting allergenic birch trees in urban areas can increase hay fever and other respiratory conditions.'</p><p>So, if we know that pollen from birch trees (and many others) causes allergic reactions, why are they still prevalent on our city streets? 'Mainly because they seem to be fashionable,' said Warner. 'They have this lovely silvery bark, and they're long and graceful with a beautiful sweeping canopy that gently sways in the wind. And they don't drop fruit-in a city, you want trees with a low cleanup cost.'</p><p>Keeping Hay Fever at Bay</p><p>There are alternatives; not all tree pollen is allergenic. In 2010, a report by the National Wildlife Federation called on states, communities, and homeowners to 'undertake smart community planning and landscaping with attention to allergenic plants and urban heat island effects to limit the amount of pollen and other allergens that become airborne.'</p><p>One way to mitigate the impact of hay fever in cities would be to utilize the Ogren Plant Allergy Scale (OPALS), which rates trees based on allergen level. When choosing your tree, whether it's in your garden or on the street, opt for a low-allergen variety that won't trigger sneezing.</p><p>As the climate continues to change and we see an increase in hay fever, we'll also notice a bigger impact on public health, not least because an estimated 30 percent of people with allergic rhinitis develop asthma later on. While urban planning may be beyond our control, there are some steps we can take to mitigate the pollen problem.</p><p>David Mizejewski, a naturalist at the National Wildlife Federation and a long-time allergy sufferer, gave readers of the Federation's 2010 report some advice:</p><p>- Get an allergy test-that way, you can decide when it is best to go outside</p><p>- Ask your doctor about allergens and what medication to take</p><p>- Check daily pollen counts and go out when they're low</p><p>- Wash your clothes and yourself to remove trapped pollen, and use nasal sprays</p><p>- Choose non-allergenic plants for your garden</p><p>- Plant female trees and shrubs (it's the males that produce pollen)</p><p>It's important to remember that people with allergic rhinitis can develop asthma, which can be serious.

With a target of $ 8 billion, achieving this requires clear policies, infrastructure development, and proactive Government support. The sector also provides over 350,000 direct jobs and sustains millions more, making it a key driver of economic and social stability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the immediate priorities is advocating for solutions to high energy costs, which place Sri Lanka at a disadvantage compared to competitors like Bangladesh and Vietnam. Lobbying for a stable energy pricing policy and encouraging investments in renewable energy, will be key in improving cost efficiency. Operational inefficiencies in the utility sector must also be resolved to ease financial pressure on manufacturers. Another key focus is fast-tracking the Eravur Fabric Park to reduce dependence on fabric imports, lower production costs, and enhance lead times. Streamlined approvals and investor incentives are crucial to ensuring its swift completion.</p><p>Policy stability remains a pressing concern, with frequent changes in currency regulations, VAT increases, and the removal of SVAT disrupting cash flows and the stability of the on island supply chain manufacturers. Strengthening bilateral and regional trade agreements with India, China, and Japan will help diversify export markets and reduce reliance on the US, which currently accounts for about 40% of exports.</p><p>Q: How do you envision leveraging technology, innovation, and workforce development to strengthen Sri Lanka's position as a trusted apparel sourcing destination under your leadership?</p><p>During my tenure, I will continue to support Sri Lanka's apparel industry to harness technology, innovation, and workforce development to reinforce our position as a trusted global sourcing destination. We need to embrace digital transformation, integrating AI, automation, and data analytics to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and transparency across the supply chain. We need to catch up with the competition and harness innovation to drive our competitive edge as a country, from smart manufacturing to sustainable materials, ensuring we meet evolving global standards.</p><p>At the heart of this transformation is our workforce. Investing in skills development, upskilling, and ethical labour practices will empower our people, fostering a culture of excellence and adaptability. Sri Lanka has been recognised and respected for our deep-rooted commitment to quality, sustainability, and ethical manufacturing. We need to make sure that we not only retain but strengthen this reputation as a premier apparel hub. Our goal is clear: to be the preferred partner for global brands seeking reliability, innovation, and responsible sourcing in a rapidly evolving fashion landscape.</p><p>Q: The apparel industry has faced numerous challenges in recent years. What strategies will you implement to diversify Sri Lanka's export markets and ensure the industry remains resilient in a rapidly evolving global landscape?</p><p>Sri Lanka's apparel industry must diversify its export markets to reduce reliance on the US, which currently accounts for 40% of exports. Expanding trade with underrepresented regions-such as the UK (14.17%), the EU (27.27%), APAC (e.g., India at 1.52%), and the Middle East (0.99%)-is crucial. Securing an Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with APAC nations, and Canada will open new opportunities and enhance market resilience.</p><p>Improving supply chain efficiency is another priority. With Sri Lanka ranked 73rd in the 2023 Logistics Performance Index, and advocating for streamlined port operations and digitised customs processes will be key. Collaborating with policymakers to reduce export delays and strengthen road and rail connectivity will further enhance competitiveness.</p><p>The industry must also move up the value chain by focusing on premium segments such as athleisure, adaptive wear, and technical textiles. Investing in blockchain-based traceability will help meet growing demand for transparency, particularly in EU markets. These strategies will ensure Sri Lanka's apparel sector remains agile and globally competitive.</p><p>Q: Given the importance of Government support for the apparel sector, what key policies do you plan to advocate for to enhance ease of doing business and improve Sri Lanka's supply chain capabilities?</p><p>One of the biggest concerns facing the export industry right now is the proposed removal of the SVAT scheme. The removal of SVAT could end up crippling the apparel industry which is already subject to very high rates of taxation and other costs of manufacturing, when compared to our regional competitors. There will be a large impact, not only on the cash flow of the large exporters, but also the longevity of the supply chain and the SMEs.</p><p>We also have to continue to advocate for policies that streamline business processes and improve supply chain capabilities.

A commitment to transforming the lives of Sri Lankans, particularly through initiatives that enhance housing and utilities for low-income families, is commendable. Improving living standards for these communities is crucial for overall quality of life and social equity. The upcoming Annual Sessions of the Sri Lanka Institute of Urban Designers (SLIUD) will critically examine the current urban landscape, focusing on both cities and suburbs. One of our primary objectives is to promote a comprehensive and planned urban transformation that respects the rights of low-income communities, particularly those residing on occupied lands. Our goal is to create user-friendly, attractive, and sustainable environments that serve all citizens,\" said Prof. Wijesundara.</p><p>Local communities</p><p>Previous public forums have highlighted the necessity of collaboration with local communities in property development. This approach, coupled with a commitment to minimising profit-driven motives, is essential for creating spaces that prioritise community well-being.

However, the urban design profession has yet to be effectively consulted by the government in tackling sustainable urban development and community planning challenges. Mostly, the relevant organisations and political authorities are unaware of the need for urban design in the development programmes. Our cities still fall short of becoming socially cohesive, equitable, environmentally sustainable, culturally vibrant, with aesthetically pleasing spaces, as planning often lacks design excellence and community involvement.</p><p>There is significant concern regarding the trend of applying fully western urban development models in Sri Lanka, a country that is both tropical and culturally distinct. Therefore, there is a pressing need for practical input and guidance for Sri Lanka at this critical juncture.

This scenario is not as unlikely as you might think. Global supply chains, largely unseen by ordinary consumers, work 24/7 across the globe to ensure that products are available at reasonable prices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These supply chains are more fragile than they might appear. Recent events have shown just how vulnerable international trade is to disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted maritime operations, causing delays and congestion that rippled through global supply chains. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted the global food supply, driving up food prices, reducing grain exports, and exacerbating food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where transport costs can account for up to 50% of food prices. More recently, attacks on shipping in the Gulf of Aden have disrupted critical maritime trade routes, resulting in increased shipping costs and delays.</p><p>The potential impact goes far beyond your kitchen pantry. Supply chain disruptions can affect anything-electronics, automobiles, medical supplies, factory equipment, consumer goods, and more-and without warning. The resulting inventory shortages, operational inefficiencies, production delays, and increased costs can wreak havoc on economies, especially in developing countries.</p><p>Container ports to the rescue</p><p>Nobody knows what threats will appear in the future. But we do know that container ports-the indispensable hubs of global commerce-can play a role in protecting global trade from unforeseen disruptions.</p><p>Container ports are the lifelines of global trade, particularly for developing countries. Over 80% of international trade is transported via sea routes, with a substantial portion carried in containers. Efficient container ports reduce the cost and time associated with importing and exporting goods, making exports more competitive and lowering import prices. High-performing ports attract foreign investment, support local industries, create jobs, and boost income levels, fostering sustainable economic development.</p><p>How can container ports protect global trade from unforeseen disruptions? Consider the following:</p><p>Investing in port facilities can expand their capacity to handle increased shipping volumes and support smoother, faster operations.</p><p>Adopting advanced digital technologies can streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and improve data exchange, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing the impact of disruptions.</p><p>Building connections with inland transportation networks like railways, roads, and waterways ensures seamless movement of goods from ports to their final destinations.</p><p>Collaborating with stakeholders such as shipping lines, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders to better manage disruptions and maintain continuity in port operations.</p><p>Investing in green infrastructure and following environmental regulations can mitigate climate impacts on ports.</p><p>Building the resilience of ports requires reliable and consistent data. Accurate performance metrics can help governments and other stakeholders identify inefficiencies and target specific areas for improvement. Good data allows for informed decision-making, enabling ports to implement strategic interventions that boost resilience and efficiency. This approach ensures that investments in infrastructure, technology, and processes are directed where they are needed most, which helps protect global trade against unforeseen disruptions.</p><p>The Container Port Performance Index</p><p>Since 2020, the World Bank and S and P Global Market Intelligence have published the Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) to provide insights into the efficiency of container ports worldwide. By measuring and ranking the performance of over 400 global ports, the CPPI helps stakeholders identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. The CPPI uses indicators such as operational efficiency, measured by vessel turnaround time and cargo handling speed. It also evaluates infrastructure quality, including sufficient draught, quay, and dock facilities. Connectivity to inland transportation networks, the cost-effectiveness and quality of port services, the adoption of advanced digital technologies, and effective customs and container clearance procedures are also critical factors in the index.</p><p>Enhancing resilience through the CPPI</p><p>Focusing on these indicators can help governments and stakeholders make informed decisions to improve port performance, driving economic growth and competitiveness.</p><p>The CPPI can also help governments build port resilience to protect global supply chains from unforeseen disruptions. CPPI data can:</p><p>Identify performance gaps: The CPPI helps stakeholders pinpoint areas where a port may be underperforming. This detailed analysis enables targeted interventions to address inefficiencies, reduce delays, and optimize operations. By showcasing top-performing ports, the CPPI facilitates the adoption of best practices, promoting innovative solutions and industry standards that can significantly boost port performance.</p><p>Support investment decisions: The CPPI provides policymakers and investors with a data-driven foundation for making informed decisions regarding infrastructure development and resource allocation. Understanding which ports excel-and why-allows stakeholders to prioritize investments in areas that will yield the highest returns in terms of efficiency gains and economic impact.</p><p>Foster collaboration and policy development: The CPPI fosters greater collaboration among various stakeholders involved in port operations. By providing a standard set of performance indicators, the index facilitates discussions and partnerships between port authorities, shipping lines, regulatory agencies, and other entities. This collaborative approach is essential for developing cohesive policies and strategies that address systemic challenges and promote sustainable port development.</p><p>Drive digital transformation: Digitalization is a key driver of port efficiency. The CPPI underscores the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to improve operations. By highlighting ports that have successfully implemented digital solutions, the CPPI encourages other ports to embrace digital transformation. This shift towards digitalization can streamline processes, enhance data accuracy, and reduce operational costs, leading to more efficient and resilient port operations.</p><p>Container ports are indispensable for maintaining the stability and efficiency of global supply chains, particularly in developing countries where they drive economic growth. By investing in port infrastructure and efficiency and closely monitoring performance through key indicators-like those provided by the CPPI-countries can harness the full potential of their ports and protect supply chains from future disruptions.

From camping to beach lounging, tourism provides countless opportunities for individuals to learn about the natural world and experience it firsthand. When people connect with nature during their travels, it can inspire them to appreciate nature and become part of the conservation effort. The Great Barrier Reef, Yellowstone, Amazon Rainforest are internationally known hotspots. One of the top reasons that tourists are drawn to destinations such as these is because of their rich biodiversity and unique landscapes. Wildlife tourism supports nearly 22 million jobs around the world and contributes more than $120 billion to global GDP. This growing interest in wildlife tourism and the economic benefits that come along with it can change community attitudes towards conservation. Wildlife remains a major concern for the international and local communities. Among the multiple risks that menace wildlife are: diseases, climate change and actions of humans- such as poaching and illegal trafficking. Wildlife represents biodiversity essential for our health and the well-being of the whole planet.</p><p>A wildlife corridor is a link of wildlife habitat, generally native vegetation- which joins two or more larger areas of similar wildlife habitat. Corridors are critical for the maintenance of ecological processes including allowing for the movement of animals and the continuation of viable populations. By providing landscape connections between larger areas of habitat, corridors enable migration and interbreeding of plants and animals. In Sri Lanka most of the conflicts related to wild elephants stems from unprotected wildlife corridors that have seen selfish human intrusion.</p><p>Wildlife corridors are a key artery in wildlife tourism. These corridors play an important role in the maintenance of biodiversity. It is important, that vegetation remnants and vegetated corridors are maintained and enhanced as a network across all lands both private and public. In this way private landscapes can contribute to wider landscape conservation efforts by enhancing and linking existing reserves and conservation networks. As these vegetation patches are reduced in size and become increasingly isolated, the on-going viability of ecosystems and individual populations of species within them is affected.</p><p>Management of a corridor should aim to retain and enhance the existing vegetation cover and wildlife habitats. The acceptance that human development needs to be adapted to preserve and enhance the natural processes of ecosystems is reflected in the increasing reference of the term \"green infrastructure.\" How many of Sri Lankas tourism projects are planned on this concept? The concept of green infrastructure supports that spatial planning and territorial development consciously integrate the need to protect and enhance nature and natural processes.</p><p>In Cambodia, for instance, ecotourism is motivating communities to conserve critically endangered bird species, such as the giant ibis and white-shouldered ibis. Thousands of tourists come from across the world to see these iconic species. The prudent tour operators incentivizes community-based conservation in the region by training and employing locals as guides and ecotourism providers, and requiring visitors to donate to village development projects. In return for this income and employment, community members agree not to hunt or cut down trees. This is how to create a win-win situation. We are aware of the news reports of leopard deaths, and how they could have been avoided in Sri Lanka. Why does this cycle repeat? Many wild elephants have died this year, another cause for deep concern.</p><p>Due to the popularity of coastal tourism in particular, reef-based activities such as scuba diving, snorkeling, boat trips and whale watching are a particularly important source of economic revenues. In fact, it is estimated that coral reefs generate $36 billion in global tourism value per year. Many countries rely on the income that comes from marine-based tourism and see the importance of protecting their coastlines, coral reefs, and beaches. Kalpitiya in Sri Lanka boasts itself as an alluring whale watching destination. Does the fishing community in Sri Lanka care about sustainability and protecting the marine domain, as they struggle to make ends meet amidst challenges? Greater effort must be made to protect our sensitive coral reefs.</p><p>While park rangers and guards play a critical role in patrolling sensitive environments, tracking ecosystem health, and warding off threats, it is often impossible for them to monitor such vast areas by themselves. The mere presence of tourists in natural areas can protect wildlife by providing an extra set of eyes on the ground. In fairness to Sri Lankan wildlife rangers and guards they need enhanced welfare, job respect and access to modern technology i.e drones to trace invasive elephants or track leopards. They do an excellent job with limited resources, in comparison to other countries. The Department of Wildlife Conservation, Department of Forest Conservation and Department of Coastal Conservation are key stakeholders and guardians of Sri Lankas flora, fauna and forests.</p><p>Globally, wildlife watching particularly overlaps with ecotourism, which is a form of tourism based on the principles of making an active contribution to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage. It must extend to involving local and indigenous communities in its planning, development and operation, also contributing to their well-being. Some destinations face gross overcrowding, such as South Africa's Krueger National Park or the Masai Mara in Kenya where you have tourists looking at other tourists, instead of at lions. Wildlife watching can also include appropriately operated mass tourism activities. European tourists are increasingly concerned with the well-being of wildlife and are willing to pay more to see animals in the wild instead of visiting zoos. Feeding animals or making them do tricks is considered unacceptable, because it is not how the animals behave naturally and is not good for their well-being. Wildlife enthusiasts are often loyal and come to the same destination multiple times. As these tourists are more informed about wildlife, they also tend to have higher sustainable awareness. Many of these tourists are members of nature-related organizations.</p><p>A constant conflict in Sri Lankan wildlife parks is the number of safari vehicles allowed and their impact. Much has been written on this topic by others so I will refrain. Congratulations to the Ridiyagama Wildlife Park (Hambantota) for introducing a new and adventurous way to enjoy wildlife. I have written on this beautiful park last year.</p><p>Much of the wildlife that tourists want to watch is located in rural areas. These tend to be poorer than urban areas, and to offer fewer employment opportunities. In these areas, wildlife watching tourism can potentially provide an alternative source of income and employment i.e In Mannar where seasonal tourism is generated by the presence of migratory birds, with the flamingoes dominating the list. For tourism to be viable and profitable, it needs to meet the standards that are expected by the market including in the ways that it is designed, priced and marketed, the reliability and quality of the services and experiences that are offered. Most tourism marketing talks about Wilpattu and Yala National parks but how many have visited other parks like Chundikkulam National Park - Kilinochchi (sanctuary status given 1938), Angammedilla National Park and Ussangoda National Park?</p><p>Because of its economic importance and influence, globally tourism can trigger environmental innovation through the advancement of green infrastructure, processes and technologies. For instance, tourism can lead the way in the development of renewable energy infrastructure, like wind and solar farms in rural areas that would not usually be exposed to clean energy. This must be done without disturbing the local way of life. Ideally, ecotourism should facilitate the involvement and experiences of indigenous people as integral to the travel experience by using and acknowledging their role as stewards of the environment. This is an industry that is potentially sustainable, capable of providing local peoples with the opportunity to manage their engagement with the outside world to their own benefit. The cultural diversity and knowledge of indigenous peoples can bring innovative experiences for tourism. This is true for Sri Lanka and her ancient Veddah community. Most travel agencies display photos of Veddah people on their websites, but what do these companies genuinely give back to sustain the traditional way of life? Only a few corporates have had good CSR engagements to sustain the Veddah of Sri Lanka. Sadly many 'duplicate' Veddahs have also emerged for exotic photo shoots.</p><p>For ecotourism to deliver on its promise, advocates must honour the commitment to create the conditions under which indigenous societies can exercise self-determination. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) defines cultural tourism as 'a type of tourism activity in which the visitors essential motivation is to learn, discover, experience and consume the tangible and intangible cultural attractions/products in a tourism destination'.</p><p>Many disregard local communities in the initial tourism planning. This has caused resentment among community members and unwilling to take part in the tourism activities as they are excluded in the process of tourism planning. Empowerment consists of four dimensions: economic, psychological, social and political aspects; these stress the value of control and benefit-sharing of tourism development by local communities. Agro- Tourism is also a new concept that beautifully supplements wildlife tourism- if planned and done properly. Sri Lanka has tremendous natural resources and creative stakeholders in tourism. Tourism has been resilient in every crisis situation, and can bounce back with amazing results. All tourism stakeholders at every level must be better empowered to reach new heights of success, with sustainable tourism at its foundation and Government policies that support these measures.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

This cycle is the gap between SDG ambition and meaningful progress.</p><p>After three years of concurrent crises, including a severe debt crisis that crowds out investment in social protection and energy transitions, developing countries are trapped in relentless pursuit of economic growth. Under current trends, the default growth trajectory for most developing countries is showing further turmoil in one or more of the economic, social, political and environmental spheres.</p><p>Based on new projections, the reports show that in the last three years, 72 out of the 95 economies increased their carbon emissions, with 38 of them exceeding a 10 percent increase. At the same time, only one in five countries reduced poverty levels since 2019, while poverty either remained the same or increased in 72 out of 95 countries.</p><p>Calling for support for developing countries, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: 'The 'development we want' - driven by human development, sustainable economic growth and continuous innovation, is frequently held hostage by the 'growth we get' driven by fossil fuel and mineral extraction, high commodity prices and unsustainable debt. SDG Insights is yet more evidence that clearly articulates this key issue faced by many developing countries. As we approach the UN Sustainable Development Summit, UNDP urges international action to achieve environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth - this will not be achieved by trickle-down economics or a quick fix.

It will require an overhaul of the international financial architecture and of domestic policies to enable countries to better align their fiscal and financial resources to the SDGs - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner</p><p>The SDG Insights highlight the importance for developing countries to invest in enabling environments for digital and green transitions. This requires institutional effectiveness, functioning justice systems and strong governance. The research lays out the strategies and tactics that countries are using to accelerate the SDGs, putting the focus on policy choices that drive progress across multiple SDGs.</p><p>UNDP Director of SDG Integration Laurel Patterson said: 'By zeroing in on what's happening at the national level, our analysis reveals that governments' national priorities like jobs, infrastructure, cities and institutions can drive broader realignment of social, environmental, and economic progress. But to do so, these priorities must be linked with specific combinations of SDGs. This ultimately could change the patterns of growth.'</p><p>For example, more than half of the reports elevate decent work for all as a top priority for development. But countries like Egypt and Zambia are pinpointing the connections that amplify impact across several SDGs -promoting inclusion, youth empowerment and opportunities for women as policy combinations that ensure job creation is a driver of fair and sustainable outcomes. Countries also prioritize resilient infrastructure and sustainable cities, particularly in the Asia and Pacific regions, as they have a clear impact on multidimensional poverty and intersect with other sustainable development priorities related to both climate and financing.

Urban areas are currently home to 4.2 billion people, and urban populations expected to grow by an additional 2.5 billion people by 2050. All regions of the world are expected to urbanise throughout the next decades, but urbanisation is likely to be faster and include larger numbers of people in developing countries, particularly in the African and Asian region. South Asia, to which Sri Lanka belongs, is projected to be the second most rapidly urbanising region in the world behind Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As centres of population and human activity, cities are responsible for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, which makes them critical contributors to climate change. For this reason, shaping the future of cities is central to solving the global climate crisis as well as to address biodiversity loss and the need for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Cities can reduce emissions and help mitigate climate change-for example through their infrastructure, the transport sector, buildings, energy usage, commercial activity, industry etc.-, but they can also enhance adaptive capacities of billions of people by providing them with the tools and enabling environment to better withstand climate change.</p><p>Cities as climate hotspots</p><p>Urban areas are potential catalysts for climate action, but they are also exposed and vulnerable to climate-related hazards and a multitude of short- and long-term impacts. For example, heat waves and heat stress, heavy rains, floods, storms, wildfires, and high winds already threaten cities around the world, while long-term processes such as sea level rise or water scarcity are expected to further affect urban areas throughout the 21st century.</p><p>This interconnection between cities and climate change is increasingly acknowledged in scientific literature and key global reports. For instance, climate change is prominently featured in the World Cities Report 2022 published by UN-Habitat, while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has dedicated a separate chapter on cities and human settlements in its latest assessment report (AR6).</p><p>The IPCC report highlights that 'in all cities and urban areas, the risk faced by people and assets from hazards associated with climate change has increased,' disrupting infrastructure and essential services as well as the links between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The IPCC report outlines that globally, 'the most rapid growth in urban vulnerability and exposure has been in cities and settlements where adaptive capacity is limited-especially in unplanned and informal settlements in low- and middle-income nations and in smaller and medium-sized urban centres.'</p><p>How cities manage these growing climate risks and protect especially their most vulnerable population groups will make a crucial difference going forward. Factors such as governance capacity, financial support, awareness, and available technology play a role for this response, but also social and cultural factors, skill-building, entrepreneurship, welcoming migrants, dealing with legacy infrastructure and its constraints, harnessing innovation, and integrating natural ecosystems into urban planning and development.</p><p>Merging urban and natural ecosystems</p><p>Urban areas can be seen as artificial ecosystems of their own which are characterized by complex systems of human interaction, employment, supply and value chains, markets, infrastructure, services, transport, communication, sanitation, water management, food provision, storage, and many other elements. However, they are also connected to the natural environment and non-human ecosystems, for example forests, urban wetlands, rivers and estuaries, lakes, beaches, or parks.</p><p>These ecosystems provide a multitude of services that can make a key difference in quality of life, human wellbeing, and climate or disaster risk reduction. For one, air and water quality can be significantly improved by wetlands, trees, and green spaces inside an urban area. Furthermore, natural ecosystems can provide provisioning services, regulate other aspects of the environment, and serve as sites for recreational activities or tourism. They also have the potential to protect human communities, infrastructure, and assets from disaster events and unexpected shocks-such as floods or storms-and reduce coastal erosion and land degradation. Finally, they can also serve as habitats for biodiversity and urban wildlife, especially in tropical countries such as Sri Lanka.</p><p>The IPCC report refers to evidence from cities around the world, including Colombo, on the effectiveness of risk reduction through zoning and land use to 'protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect.'

However, if migrants can be integrated into the fabric of the urban centre-with access to infrastructure, services, utilities, social protection, employment, and skills development-, they have the potential to enhance adaptation by making economic, social, and cultural contributions and strengthen rural-urban linkages that can make the entire region more resilient.</p><p>Transforming cities to become more climate-resilient and adapt to the current and projected impacts of climate change presents a key challenge for the 21st century. Climate-related disasters and long-term impacts will put millions at risk, including the most vulnerable population groups.

Last summer in the US, when older people fell down on tar during heat waves, they had to be treated first for burns. Scientists believe that July 2023 was the hottest month on record. Last year, we read of multiple disasters worldwide: extreme heat waves in the USA, various parts of Europe and Asia; over 4,000 wildfires which raged in Canada, as well as a devastating one in Hawaii; and severe monsoons which caused extreme floods in many parts of Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of the above are attributed to global warming and climate change. Our actions that emit greenhouse gases have increased the Earth's temperature faster since 1970, than any other period in the last 2000 years. This global warming has wrought havoc on the Earth's climate - such as warming oceans and resulting cascading impacts such as melting icebergs, sea level rise, coastal flooding, and saltwater going up rivers, all of which disrupt livelihoods, food and water security.</p><p>The most challenging impact of global warming has been long-term shifts in the Earth's weather patterns. There are more intense and frequent extreme weather events - such as storms, cyclones, floods and droughts, often leading to erosion and landslides. Erratic (out-of-season) rainfall, failure of monsoons and seasonal shifts have serious effects on agriculture, causing crop failure and therefore, affecting food security.</p><p>These effects of climate change are bad enough, but they are exacerbated by other human activities - namely, habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation, pollution, and introduction/spread of invasive alien species. For example, deforestation of catchment forests upstream results in erosion, and sometimes, slope instability, which, in turn, leads to landslides and downstream floods. There was a recent news item from the National Building Research Organisation that because of deforestation coupled with heavy rains, 1/5th of Sri Lanka is landslide-prone. Poor agriculture practices that leave soil exposed to heat when there is a drought, worsen its impacts. Relying on monocultures of crops when there are seasonal shifts (delayed monsoons, for example) can increase food insecurity.</p><p>Any process that emits CO2 is called a carbon source, and green plants that absorb carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis, are known as carbon sinks.</p><p>There are two ways of dealing with climate change. Human action/s to reduce emissions or to reduce carbon sources/enhance carbon sinks is called climate change mitigation. These actions include switching to clean energy, reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing energy efficiency. However, even if, today, everyone, everywhere stopped all emissions of greenhouse gases, the temperature of the surface of the Earth would not cool for thousands of years to levels before the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, adjusting to observed or predicted climate change also becomes necessary. This is known as climate change adaptation. Adaptation could be as simple as growing drought-tolerant crops in the dry zone.</p><p>In December 2023, leaders of governments of the world met at the 28th Conference of Parties (COP). After contentious debates, negotiations and compromise, they agreed to 'transition away from fossil fuels'. Some hailed this outcome as 'the beginning of the end of fossil fuels', others were deeply disappointed with the wording and that the proposed transition was not given a time frame.</p><p>Without waiting to see what will happen about shifting from fossil fuels at the global scale, what can we, the public, do?</p><p>Look to nature for solutions</p><p>Look, for example, at trees. Their leaves and canopies slow the rate of rainfall falling to the forest floor. Leaf litter functions like a gigantic sponge soaking the water up and slowing its release into the soil. This is a natural method of regulating floods and recharging groundwater. The roots of trees hold soils together. Without leaf litter and roots, rain falling on bare soil flows fast over the surface, resulting in erosion. Heavy rain falling on large areas of bare soil on slopes could cause landslides. Catchment forests reduce the risk of floods by increasing the amount of rainfall soaked into the soil, reducing and delaying the highest flows of floodwaters.</p><p>Meanwhile, green plants serve as nature's carbon sinks by removing carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis. During this process, they also replenish the oxygen that we breathe.</p><p>Nature has provided us with a ready-made solution for climate change adaptation. Why then, are we not looking to nature and using these solutions?</p><p>Nature-based Solutions (NbS) involve working with nature to address challenges of communities and societies, to provide benefits for both human well-being and biodiversity. This approach aims for a win-win both for us humans, as well as for biodiversity.</p><p>Compared to hard engineering solutions, NbS provide additional benefits called co-benefits as shown in the diagram above.</p><p>In contrast, the construction of a gabion retaining wall in a river or canal - for the prevention of erosion - may also provide clearer water but no other benefits.</p><p>The other difference is that NbS are cost-effective. In the mid-hills of Nepal, erosion and resultant landslides were common along many rural roadsides built without any safeguards to control erosion. A native plant - broom grass (Thysanolaena nees) - is a hardy perennial, with a network of roots that holds the soil together. When villagers planted broom grass along roadsides, this simple action significantly reduced erosion and landslides. An important co-benefit was that once this grass grew to about two metres, it could be cut and sold - as fodder for livestock, fuel and for brooms - which increased the household income of villagers. A standard cost-benefit analysis showed that over time, NbS were less expensive than hard engineering because there is far less maintenance necessary. But when the co-benefit of the income that communities earned was included, NbS were shown to be much cheaper than hard engineering solutions.</p><p>In the high Andes Mountains of Peru, livestock are grazed in high-elevation, wet, montane grasslands. There now are recurring droughts. With community participation, a pasture and water management plan was developed to ensure better management of water and establish a rotational grazing pattern (to avoid overgrazing). The ecosystem service of provision of year-round water was restored. Better management increased milk yield, fetching more income. The improved growth of grasses has also contributed to the conservation of threatened species - such as the vulnerable Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) and the Per\u00favian guemal (Hippocamelus antisensis) - another win-win for people and biodiversity.</p><p>Urban areas are most at risk from heat waves. They act as heat islands - trapping the sun's heat in concrete in buildings and the surfaces of roads. Green infrastructure (such as corridors of vegetation), green spaces (parks, grasslands and urban wooded areas), green walls and green roofs are extremely effective in reducing ambient heat. Increasing blue infrastructure (such as natural or artificial ponds and lakes) has the same effect. Barcelona, in Spain, increased tree coverage from 5% to 30% and reduced temperatures so much, that the city saved 10 million USD in annual bills for air conditioning.</p><p>Most cities have impermeable systems - such as tar, concrete, stone, brick, and roofing - that prevent water from filtering through the ground. The sponge city concept uses blue infrastructure to absorb rainwater, which is then naturally filtered by the soil to reach aquifers. Sponge cities are connected by open green spaces and waterways, which naturally retain and filter water. They also have green roofs that can retain and filter rainwater before releasing it into the ground. Also important in sponge cities are permeable roads and pavements, bio-swales (landscaped areas that collect stormwater runoff, filtering out pollution and letting the water soak into the ground) and bio-retention systems (depressed, landscaped areas for the discharge of stormwater). In a sponge city, in addition to providing natural flood control, co-benefits such as cooling, enhancing urban biodiversity and increasing recreation are also achieved.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, I think that we have long since forgotten to look to nature for solutions, in our unending quest for development, although traditionally, NbS were successfully implemented, using observation and common sense.</p><p>Colombo has the distinction of becoming the world's first Ramsar Wetland City. It is in the floodplain of the left bank catchment of the Kelani Ganga and historically, was built on, around and interwoven with wetlands. However, now only about 2,000 ha of these wetlands - natural, giant sponges - remain. Some wetland parks, set up for the conservation of these critical soakage areas for the capital, are now being pruned and tamed as venues for wedding photographs. Sri Lanka had a ready-made sponge city......... but we have reclaimed it, dredged it, filled it and built infrastructure and roads, so that, often, with monsoonal rains, Colombo floods.</p><p>A recent article in the Sunday Times stated that 214 trees posing danger to people have been removed by the Colombo Municipal Council. Assuming that these are all old trees (about 30 years old), with trunks at least metre in a diameter, and that all plant species absorb an equal amount of carbon, these trees that were cut, stored about 4,639 tons of carbon. We should have maintained and looked after those magnificent trees so that they did not pose a threat to people. Instead, these natural carbon sinks were grossly neglected, and we must now forgo the immense benefits they provide us.</p><p>We Sri Lankans must do better. Perhaps we must see green plants as tiny carbon-guzzling, oxygen-generating machines, just as we know that vehicles are petrol-consuming carbon-dioxide-releasing machines. What if each of us pledges to plant and look after a native herbaceous plant, a shrub or a tree, and tend it? Those who own estates or large gardens can plant trees, others with small gardens can plant shrubs, while those who live in apartments can grow plants in pots. Even if 1% of our population fulfils this pledge and plants trees and tends them, then we will have 221,810 more carbon sinks, absorbing an estimated 4,807,835 tons of carbon in their lifetime, absorbing the emissions for a year from one million cars.</p><p>As Jane Goodall says 'What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.'</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Urban areas are most at risk from heat waves.

These challenges are distinct but also deeply interconnected in complex and multidirectional ways. They have in common that they threaten to overwhelm coping capacities and seriously impact human economies and societies, turning them from challenges into crises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This multitude of global crises, which includes the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis, and the pollution crisis, can be described as a polycrisis that affects multiple systems at the same time and in ways that influence and exacerbate each other. A polycrisis does not have a single cause and, therefore, no singular solution. However, the interconnected nature of its constituent crises means that actions taken in one sphere-for example, climate action or environmental conservation-have the potential to produce powerful synergies and co-benefits. In other words, while there is feedback between the crises, there is also the potential for feedback between solutions.</p><p>Global processes to address global challenges</p><p>Countries such as Sri Lanka can greatly benefit from integrating their strategies and plans and harnessing synergies between development, climate action, biodiversity conservation, pollution reduction, and key sectoral interventions. However, uniting these different processes-each with their own institutional setups, policy frameworks, finance streams, evidence bases, and actors-is not an easy task.</p><p>Toward the end of 2022, the need to address the polycrisis in a holistic fashion is becoming increasingly obvious, with multiple important summits happening in close succession. In November 2022, the 198 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with a total of 45,000 people attending the two-week conference (UNFCCC COP27). Only a week later, the first session of a new Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay, with more than 2,500 delegates from 147 countries (INC-1). Finally, representatives of 188 governments gathered in December in Montreal for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), which concluded with the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).</p><p>Climate change is explicitly mentioned in the GBF, with three targets directly referring to climate change and the need to optimise 'co-benefits and synergies of finance targeting the biodiversity and climate crises.' Similarly, the COP27 cover decision (the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan) addresses biodiversity and ecosystem conservation in multiple places and contains dedicated sections on forests and oceans, as well as an acknowledgement of the urgent need to harness synergies for addressing the 'interlinked global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss in the broader context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.'</p><p>Synergetic solutions for complex challenges</p><p>The above-mentioned conferences are not the only important events of the year-for example, COP15 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the third 'Rio Convention,' took place in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in May-, and a multitude of other planning and implementation processes took place on the regional, national, and local level. However, many of these processes aim to address the same underlying causes in similar timeframes (with target years 2030 and/or 2050) in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and the need for economic growth and recovery after COVID-19 and global supply chain disruptions.</p><p>For example, there are clear parallels between the global frameworks for climate action and biodiversity conservation. Both the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) have similar governing bodies (their respective Conferences of the Parties) and mechanisms for communicating national commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans), as well as overlapping funding mechanisms (Green Climate Fund and Global Environmental Facility) and related science-policy bodies (IPCC and IPBES).</p><p>Nature-based solutions and planetary health</p><p>The GBF aims to protect 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030, reduce the extinction of threatened species, and focus on the sustainable use and management of biodiversity and natural resources. The UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also adapting to the unavoidable effects of climate change to protect people, livelihoods, and ecosystems. In addition, there is an urgent need to manage waste and plastic pollution, stop desertification, and prevent soil degradation.</p><p>To do this, it is possible to identify and utilise synergies between national commitments under different global frameworks. Actions on climate change and biodiversity can complement each other, address common causes and impacts, and target co-benefits through multidisciplinary cooperation.</p><p>The advantages of coordinated and synergetic actions are multifold. If a polycrisis is addressed through holistic interventions, it can help to use resources more efficiently, avoid redundancies and duplication of efforts, enhance knowledge-sharing, and improve access to different funding sources, technology transfer, and other means of support. Policy coherence is an important element that guides implementation, and reporting on progress can be done more comprehensively and efficiently.</p><p>Nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based adaptation can help to bridge the gap between these different targets and address multiple crises simultaneously. For example, this could be in the form of green infrastructure or ecosystem services, but also revolving around investment in a blue economy or green finance, including tools and instruments such as ecosystem discounts, green or blue bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, or carbon credits.</p><p>Whether it is on the local, national, regional, or global level, there is a significant potential to identify synergies and try to design actions around them that can support economic growth and recovery, contribute to the conservation of nature, strengthen human and planetary health, mitigate climate change, and build the long-term resilience of all systems.</p><p>(The writer works as Director - Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

Sea level rise, erosion, and storms affect the coastal zone while agricultural areas are threatened by erratic rainfall, droughts, floods, and soil degradation. Across the country and across key economic sectors, climate change already impacts livelihoods, lives, and human wellbeing, and is projected to become more severe in the coming decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka is also blessed with a rich biodiversity and a multitude of productive ecosystems. From cloud forests to grasslands, and from lowland rainforests, lakes, and coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, the island is home to a significant range of habitats and associated species of animals and plants, many of which are endemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Particularly in light of the new Global Biodiversity Framework and the intergovernmental climate negotiations, how can Sri Lanka's natural wealth help the country to address challenges such as climate change while also facilitating economic recovery and sustainable development?</p><p>The benefits of biodiversity</p><p>There are at least three ways in which biodiversity and ecosystems can be part of the solution and help to increase the resilience of human communities and systems.</p><p>First off, ecosystems provide a range of benefits, some of which can be directly expressed in monetary terms. These ecosystem services include provision of goods and ingredients for consumption, medicine, cosmetics, construction, and other purposes, prevention of erosion, regulation of air and water quality, protection against floods, storage of water, tourism and recreation opportunities, and many more.</p><p>Mangrove ecosystems, for example, have been estimated to provide services worth up to $ 50,000 per hectare in some cases, with $ 15,000 as the average value. Beyond these valuated benefits, natural ecosystems serve as animal habitats and hold intangible and hard-to-quantify aesthetic, cultural, or spiritual value, create a sense of place, and can improve mental health and resilience of nearby communities.</p><p>Secondly, while healthy ecosystems automatically provide the above-mentioned benefits to the environment, wildlife, and human communities, they can also be harnessed in targeted ways. Towards this end, ecosystem services can be incorporated into planning processes in direct, indirect, or hybrid ways.</p><p>Such nature-based solutions can, for example, take the form of green infrastructure such as green roofs, rain gardens, urban forests, urban wetlands, or urban agriculture that improve the resilience of human settlements by contributing to disaster risk reduction, flood control, food security, and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>Beyond improving cities and infrastructure, nature also offers ways to directly boost economic growth in sustainable ways. For an island nation like Sri Lanka, investing in a blue economy holds significant potential. Blue economy measures could include ecosystem solutions in the fisheries sector, seaweed or seagrass cultivation, coastal zone management, aquaculture, coastal and marine tourism, ocean-based transportation, or renewable ocean energy.</p><p>On land, integrated nature-based solutions can transform food systems and enhance productivity, production diversity, and resilience through agroforestry, or work towards more sustainable, cost-effective, and circular land and water management.</p><p>Thirdly, actions related to ecosystem conservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and assisted growth can help to mobilise much-needed finance and investment. There are various financial instruments and mechanisms that connect to natural ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, including green bonds, ecological restoration bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, impact investing, carbon credits (both on the voluntary market and in relation to a centralised mechanism being set up under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement), biodiversity offsets (for instance, for afforestation or habitat restoration), natural capital finance, resource efficiency financing, or bioprospecting (the exploration of biodiversity for commercially valuable genetic and biochemical resources).</p><p>Other mechanisms that can incentivise ecosystem conservation and link them to economic growth are payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanisms, ecosystem discounts for insurance premiums, eco-index insurance, or green mortgages.</p><p>Possible sources of finance for such interventions are varied and operate across all scales. Depending on available funding, nature-based solutions could take the form of national-level projects or public works, but also nature-based microfinance for local projects, such as in ecotourism or sustainable agriculture. Nature-based crowdfunding, donations, sale of conservation easements, special levies, or land trusts are potential other sources of biodiversity finance.</p><p>Aligning national and global goals</p><p>As highlighted in my previous column, the climate and biodiversity crises are neither separate nor are they confined to the country level. They are deeply interconnected global challenges-part of what can be called a 'polycrisis'-but must be addressed first and foremost through local and national action.</p><p>Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, global goals relate to climate change mitigation (emission reduction and curbing of temperature rise), adaptation (changing systems to avoid adverse impacts and seize positive opportunities), addressing loss and damage (support for those affected by climate impacts beyond adaptation limits), and providing support for developing countries, including through finance and technology transfer.</p><p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) adopted last month, global goals focus on biodiversity conservation and protected areas, halting species extinction, preserving genetic resources, halving food waste, and strengthening sustainable biodiversity management and usage. Furthermore, the GBF aims to mobilise at least $ 200 billion per year in financial flows from all sources to support these goals and ensure that adequate means of implementation are available to all Parties, particularly developing countries.</p><p>Individual countries communicate their contributions to these overarching goals through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Sri Lanka's NDCs, for example, include sectors such as forestry, water, biodiversity, and coastal and marine, while the country's NBSAPs reference climate impacts, biodiversity valuation, sustainable use of biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, and equitable sharing of biodiversity benefits, among other things.</p><p>Both documents contain targets related to the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of soil, water, forests, wetlands, agrobiodiversity, and coastal and marine areas. Conserving natural ecosystems and biodiversity contributes to achieving these targets as well as mitigating climate change by acting as carbon sinks.</p><p>If national, local, and sector-specific plans and interventions are aligned with these commitments, they can better access finance from global funds (such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environmental Facility), multi- and bilateral entities, financial markets, the private sector, the insurance industry, repurposed subsidies, and other countries.</p><p>With the new biodiversity finance target, pledges made to several funds at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, and a new upcoming global goal for climate finance, there is an important window of opportunity to link action on biodiversity and climate change.</p><p>Identifying synergies</p><p>Sri Lanka is endowed with valuable natural capital in the form of diverse ecosystems, fauna, and flora. Building on this capital in line with national and global commitments can provide a pathway to attract investment, access finance from a multitude of sources, and design interventions and policies with strong co-benefits and synergies.</p><p>If concrete, transparent, and well-designed actions are taken on different levels, they can not only prevent further biodiversity loss and preserve biodiversity benefits for future generations, but also utilise the full potential of ecosystems to address climate change, support economic growth, and mobilise investment from a multitude of sources.</p><p>(The writer works as Director - Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

However, there is a range of possible actions and interventions to mitigate increasing temperature, counteract the urban heat island effect, and cool down cities to protect humans, animals, and the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban heat in the context of climate change</p><p>Average temperatures are rising around the globe, and every new decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the previous one. As reported by the State of the Global Climate 2021 published by the World Meteorological Organization in May, 'the most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, were the seven warmest years on record,' and global mean temperatures in 2021 were '1.11 \u00b1 0.13 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average.'</p><p>The report further states that 'the acute impacts of weather and climate are most often felt during extreme meteorological events such as [...] heatwaves,' and that heatwaves and extreme heat had devastating effects and caused deaths across different world regions, which in many cases would have been 'virtually impossible without climate change.'</p><p>Global warming leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves as well as extended periods of high temperatures, which can harm human health, wellbeing, and livelihoods. In particular, already vulnerable or weakened groups, such as the elderly, children, or the economically disadvantaged, are at risk of severe impacts that can worsen chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions and even lead to death. Furthermore, natural ecosystems, biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and many other aspects of human society and economy can be adversely affected by heatwaves and heat stress.</p><p>Due to the 'urban heat island effect,' cities and urban agglomerations are hit especially hard by these rising temperatures. They become hotter than rural areas because of their population density, the higher concentration of 'sealed' surfaces that absorb and retain heat, and other factors such as air pollution. For Colombo, it has been estimated that average temperatures may have already risen by 1.6 degrees Celsius due to the heat island effect, which would be significantly higher than the global average. For Sri Lanka as a humid tropical country, this poses the danger of lethal 'wet bulb' temperatures, which are caused by a combination of high temperature and humidity and prevent the human body from cooling itself by evaporating sweat.</p><p>The 11th World Urban Forum (WUF11), which just took place in Katowice, Poland, also highlighted the importance of recognising and addressing climate change in urban planning. Building resilience for sustainable urban futures, transforming cities through innovative solutions, and enhancing climate adaptation and nature-based solutions were among the key dialogue topics of the five-day global conference, which is convened every two years by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).</p><p>Adapting to urban heat and building resilience</p><p>The urban heat island effect in the context of rising global temperatures poses a serious threat that needs to be addressed by incorporating heat stress management into policies and action plans and address impacts to health and productivity through social protection schemes and infrastructure development. Weather forecasting, early action, and monitoring can also play a big part in enhancing heat wave response, especially if they are combined with awareness creation and education on potential risk factors, symptoms, responses, and treatment options. Other collective resilience-building measures can include heat hotlines, community check-ups, or community cooling centres.</p><p>In addition to this, heat adaptation encompasses a range of nature-based interventions and actions. For one, making cities greener tends to make them cooler as well, as plants provide shade as well as cooling through evapotranspiration. This can include urban forestry-planting more trees and generally increasing the vegetation cover-as well as the development of green corridors, parks, and rooftop gardens. Such green infrastructure also offers a range of co-benefits beyond lowering temperatures for cities, including erosion control, emission reduction, and improvement of air quality.</p><p>Heat-resilient cities can be green, blue, or blue-green. Urban wetlands are powerful nature-based solutions for managing heat stress as well as water quality and protecting against flooding and stormwater runoff. Revitalising urban streams, watercourses, or lakes can also pay off in many ways, including by providing cooling and other ecosystem services. Other possible actions include cool roofs and pavements-using materials that reflect more solar energy and enhance water evaporation-or infrastructure planning that takes into account 'natural' wind and urban ventilation corridors.</p><p>What many of these solutions have in common is that they view the urban environment as an ecosystem that consists of more than just streets and buildings, and which is deeply interconnected with natural and social systems. They aim at creating greater awareness and enhance adaptive capacities while also conserving natural ecosystems, which can serve as a low-cost way to protect the natural environment as well as human communities from heat stress and heat-related impacts. With holistic and integrated planning, cities like Colombo can reduce days of extreme heat and avert heat-related deaths as well as other serious impacts to labourers, families, the urban poor, and vulnerable groups.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["For one, making cities greener tends to make them cooler as well, as plants provide shade as well as cooling through evapotranspiration.

Climate finance, sustainable finance, and green finance have great potential to scale up investment and harness synergies to not only survive climate change but turn it into an opportunity for transformative growth and prosperity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following will wrap up and connect three guest columns on climate finance and resilience published over the last weeks, which have focused on the foundations of a sustainable financial system as well as access to funding in the context of ecosystems, nature-based solutions, and a just transition. Bringing these elements together can help individuals, companies, and governments to develop plans and policies that maximise investment flows and lead to optimal socio-economic outcomes.</p><p>Mainstreaming adaptation and risk finance</p><p>Science has made it clear that vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka can no longer achieve optimal socio-economic outcomes and sustainable development without investing in climate resilience and risk management. The Sixth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year states that 'overall adverse economic impacts attributable to climate change, including slow-onset and extreme weather events, have been increasingly identified,' and that 'global aggregate net economic damages generally increase non-linearly with global warming levels.' Rising temperatures and progressive climate change impacts will severely affect economies around the world, particularly those that are already vulnerable and have limited financial resources available.</p><p>To avoid and adapt to this, systems transitions are needed for energy generation, infrastructure, land use, industry, society, and key economic sectors such as food systems, export products, trade, tourism, or the garment and textile industry. These sectors are vulnerable to climate change, but they can also offer solutions and serve as levers of change. By building on existing natural resources and human capacities-including ecosystem services, green infrastructure, and local and traditional knowledge-as well as investing in innovation and transformative adaptation, vulnerable sectors can turn from liabilities into engines of growth.</p><p>However, a large-scale transition requires significant resources, including in the form of finance, technology, and technical expertise. Domestic public funds are unlikely to be sufficient for this, especially as they are already strained due to the increasing intensity and interconnected nature of climate risks and economic impacts. The IPCC report highlights this as well, stating that 'adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages and through impeding national economic growth.' To close the looming finance and protection gaps, it is therefore vital to secure and scale up bilateral, multilateral, and private sector funding from a range of sources.</p><p>Foresight and planning for long-term resilience</p><p>There are multiple avenues of financing that can be explored in the context of climate change adaptation, resilience-building, and economic recovery. As outlined in the three previous columns, natural ecosystems and biodiversity can be harnessed to attract funding, while the framework of a just transition can serve to accelerate economic transformation and stimulate growth. However, policy coherence and early, anticipatory action that pre-empts or prevents shocks are equally important factors to survive in a changing climate.</p><p>Currently, countries across the world are mostly reacting and responding to climate shocks and other unexpected events on an ad-hoc basis without pre-arranged resources. Anticipatory and risk-informed investment for resilient economic growth can minimise these shocks and greatly enhance the ability of key stakeholders to deal with them. Through investment in a climate-smart and resilient economy as well as the use of diverse financial instruments, including insurance and insurance-linked instruments, early action finance, or national contingency funds, countries can save money, protect lives and assets, and adapt in proactive ways to seize emerging opportunities.</p><p>For example, countries can use different kinds of bonds-such as sustainability bonds, climate bonds, green bonds, resilience bonds, or the new category of blue bonds-to raise funds for starting or scaling up projects that commit to climate-smart, sustainable, green, and/or resilient outcomes. These debt instruments are usually asset-backed or ringfenced to ensure that funds will go towards their intended purpose, and they present a powerful opportunity to invest in projects that offer a return of investment beyond merely repaying the loan with interest. Financial market instruments like these bonds can help actors to fulfil their social and environmental responsibilities, enhance the economy by harnessing domestic renewable energy resources and nature-based solutions, and prevent vast losses and damages.</p><p>Pathways to prosperity</p><p>In the context of today's world and pathways into the future-such as the climate change scenarios projected by the IPCC-, it is critical to look ahead. Societies and economies need to develop long-term plans on how they can become climate-resilient, adapt to and benefit from the anticipated changes, absorb shocks, and access the finance necessary to transition. These plans should be integrated with a holistic and flexible policy framework that removes investment barriers, precision-channels resources to where they are needed, and encourages sustainable, climate-friendly, and resilient entrepreneurship across key sectors.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["To avoid and adapt to this, systems transitions are needed for energy generation, infrastructure, land use, industry, society, and key economic sectors such as food systems, export products, trade, tourism, or the garment and textile industry.

There are serious concerns in several countries - mostly in Asia, Africa and Latin America - over the suspension of assistance for bilateral and multilateral projects for political reasons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the eve of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, designated as COP27, which will begin on Sunday (November 6) at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt, some Western countries declared resumption of assistance to environmental programmes in Brazil after the election of President LuizInacio Lula da Silva. Although one can be happy with the decision to resume assistance, at the same time the audacity to acknowledge that the assistance to environmental programmes were suspended due to political reasons cannot be accepted by the civilized world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During a recent meeting with World Agroforestry officials, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said that Climate Change will play an enormous role in shaping ecosystems and livelihoods in Sri Lanka in the decades to come and it is essential to build awareness and resilience to mitigate the adverse effects on ecosystems.</p><p>Sri Lanka's commitment to agroforestry preservation has been hailed by Dr. Tony Simons, Director General, World Agroforestry, International Center for Research and Agroforestry (ICRAF). Discussing the issue with the Prime Minister, Dr. Simons said, \"For centuries, Sri Lanka has skillfully harnessed the power of nature through traditional agroforestry practices, and it can set an example by continuing to place a high priority on addressing environmental, food security and social development issues.\"</p><p>ICRAF Director General thanked the Prime Minister for the confidence, trust and status bestowed on ICRAF by the Sri Lankan Government in hosting ICRAF in Sri Lanka. \"We are excited at the prospect of supporting the Government of Sri Lanka in a new phase of renewal and green infrastructure development, leveraging on the human, natural and social capital that this beautiful country has in abundance,\" he said.</p><p>Third world countries plan to raise the issue of political conditions on environment assistance at the COP 27 in Egypt. Earlier this week, Norway announced it would resume sending Amazon protection subsidies to Brazil following LuizInacio Lula da Silva's election victory.</p><p>\"We note that during the campaign he (Lula) emphasized the conservation of the Amazon forest and the protection of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon,\" Norway's Environment Minister Espen Barth Eide said. The subsidies were halted in 2019 when Brazil was under the Presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. \"This is why we are eager to make contact with Lula's teams, as quickly as possible, to prepare for a resumption of the historically good collaboration between Brazil and Norway.\"</p><p>Norway was the biggest donor to the Amazon Fund for Forest Conservation and Climate Protection, considered one of the main tools to reduce deforestation in the planet's biggest tropical forest.</p><p>But like the fund's other main donor Germany, Norway halted its aid to Brazil in 2019 after far-right leader Bolsonaro took power.</p><p>This is a violation of the principles of the European Structural and Investment Fund. The ESI Fund says its policies will be pursued in line with the principle of sustainable development and promotion of the aim of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment.</p><p>According to the European Commission's website, \"the 27 EU Commissioners have the ultimate political responsibility for ensuring that EU funds are spent properly.\" It is high time that the EU Commissioners live up to that responsibility. Otherwise, the environment of my country will be devastated completely.</p><p>Most of the developing countries accept the principle that Climate Change threatens the effective enjoyment of a range of human rights including those to life, water and sanitation, food, health, housing, self-determination, culture and development. However, they strongly feel that stopping grants for environmental projects on political issues is unfair.</p><p>Prime Minister Gunawardena told the ICRAF delegation that the current Food Security Programmes has been launched with specific safeguards on environment preservation. ICRAF Country Director Laksiri Abeysekera said the ICRAF has experience of developing smallholder farmer-focused innovations and technologies that would be offered to adapt to Sri Lankan needs to support livelihoods and improve ecosystem resilience in the face of various kinds of challenges.</p><p>Dr. Simons explained that the Host Country Agreement signed with Sri Lanka offers ICRAF even more scope - and responsibility - to contribute to Sri Lanka's development agenda by supporting local expertise with the latest in agricultural science. \"We stand ready to assist the Government, institutions and people of Sri Lanka in creating a greener and more vibrant future for all,\" he said.</p><p>Such assistance, without strings, will go a long way to support agricultural programmes in countries like Sri Lanka while ensuring preservation of environment.</p><p>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) was signed three decades ago. Almost everyday, the people watch shocking news of devastating floods, depressing droughts, cyclones, forest fires and other climatic natural disasters that give the impression that little meaningful action has followed the adoption of UNFCCC. The carbon intensity of the global energy system has decreased by less than 1% since the UNFCCC was established. Global electricity generation is still dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy contributing only 8.2% to the global total.</p><p>According to climate organisations, current strategies of 15 of the largest oil and gas companies would lead to production exceeding levels needed to limit the global average surface temperature rise to 1.5degC by 37% in 2030, and 103% in 2040. Therefore, emissions from the oil and gas sector need to be reduced drastically to enable a healthy future. With the increasing global energy demand, energy-related emissions also reached a historical high in 2021. But current policies have put the world on track to a catastrophic 2.7degC increase by the end of the century. Reducing deforestation is one of the solutions put forward by the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with the targets of the Paris Accord.</p><p>Brazil President-elect Lula said after his country was \"ready to reclaim its place in the fight against the climate crisis, especially the Amazon.\"</p><p>He vowed to \"fight for zero deforestation.\" Elle Hestnes Ribeiro, of the Brazil programme of Rainforest FoundationNorway, acknowledged Lula has very good intentions for the Amazon rainforest. \"But he faces a political situation in Brazil that will make his work challenging,\" she said. \"He will therefore be dependent on international aid, and the Amazon Fund is essential for this,\" she said.</p><p>The assistance for climate related activities must be free of political conditions.

Mostly due to human activity, wetlands have been destroyed or degraded at alarming rates, with approximately 35% of the world's wetlands lost between 1970 and 2015. It is vital to understand the role these ecosystems play for the environment, biodiversity, the climate, and human communities, and take action to save them from disappearing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wetlands can be described as areas where water either covers the soil or is present at its surface, defining its biogeochemistry and providing unique habitats for plants and animals. They form where water accumulates in depressions, where groundwater comes to the surface, or in transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some wetlands are flooded year-round, others retain water in the soil and only flood due to seasonal rainfalls or the tides. From marshes to swamps, and from peatlands to mangrove forests, wetlands comprise a range of diverse ecosystems and host a rich biodiversity of plants and animals.</p><p>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, which Sri Lanka ratified in 1990, summarises these criteria into the following definition: '[Wetlands are] areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.'</p><p>Wetland ecosystems in Sri Lanka</p><p>Sri Lanka is home to many wetland ecosystems under the above definition, including coastal salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, rivers, streams, freshwater swamp forests and marshes, flood plains, villus, lagoons, estuaries, paddy fields, reservoirs, tanks, and salt pans. The 1989 Asian Wetland Directory identified 41 wetland sites of international importance covering 274,000 hectares in the country, which was further solidified by the Central Environmental Authority's 1999 Wetland Atlas of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Many Sri Lankan communities depend on or benefit from the products and services provided by wetland ecosystems. This includes water supply and transportation, flood mitigation and retention, control of coastal erosion, sediment retention, water purification and regulation, carbon sequestration, habitat for flora and fauna, recreation, tourism, and provisions of agricultural products, medicinal herbs, raw materials, hydroelectricity, fish and crustaceans, and salt. In addition to direct environmental and economic benefits, wetlands also provide many indirect advantages and hold significant cultural value, enhancing human wellbeing, safety, and quality of life.</p><p>However, wetlands also face serious threats, such as habitat degradation or deterioration, land reclamation, pollution and waste, loss of biodiversity, spread of invasive alien species, and climate change. Many wetland species of plants and animals are already endangered or threatened, and human activity as well as rises in ocean temperature, ocean acidification, sea level rise, changes in rainfall patterns, droughts, or storms can all have devastating impacts on the overall ecosystems.</p><p>Wetlands and climate change</p><p>The impacts of climate change directly and indirectly threaten wetlands in Sri Lanka and across the world. Extreme weather events and long-term climate processes can affect the integrity and balance of wetland ecosystems and cause them to deteriorate or be destroyed, affect communities that depend on them, and expose areas to greater climate risks by reducing flood and storm protection.</p><p>However, wetlands are not only sensitive to climate change but also one of the most potent tools available for both climate change mitigation and adaptation. When it comes to mitigation--i.e., the removal of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere--, wetlands are among the most efficient carbon sinks in the world. Hectare by hectare, they can store more tonnes of carbon in their soil and vegetation than almost any other ecosystem, several times as much as temperate forests, tropical forests, savannahs, grasslands, or croplands.</p><p>With regard to climate change, wetlands offer more than just their great mitigation capacity. Their variety of services and materials can help communities to withstand climate impacts in low-cost, natural ways and provide them more diverse and robust livelihoods. Mangrove forests, for example, protect coastlines and shield coastal communities from erosion, storms, flood surges, and even tsunamis. Urban wetlands can clean up polluted water, slow and store flood water, and serve as green infrastructure that reduces climate risks without requiring huge investments or maintenance. Other wetlands can recharge depleted groundwater and provide a water supply during droughts or support habitats for many species of economic importance.</p><p>A solution to the challenge of climate change</p><p>To protect wetlands, it is key to understand their importance, understand their role in hydrological and ecological cycles, and understand their significance for human communities and vulnerable groups, including issues related to sustainable development, livelihoods, food security, gender, or youth. Based on scientific understanding and evidence, wetlands can then be effectively protected, rehabilitated, and restored in collaboration with local stakeholders and the support of national policies, local and national plans, and international instruments such as the Ramsar Convention.</p><p>This World Wetland Day offers an opportunity to reflect on potential actions to enhance wetland conservation and spread awareness on their vast potential as climate solutions: for mitigation, for adaptation, for managing climate risks, for protecting biodiversity, and for building long-term resilience of humans, nature, and the planet.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Their variety of services and materials can help communities to withstand climate impacts in low-cost, natural ways and provide them more diverse and robust livelihoods.

The Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. 170 countries have ratified the Ramsar Convention (including Sri Lanka in 1990), and over 2,300 Ramsar sites with a total surface area of 252 million hectares have been declared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2 February 2022 is the first year that World Wetlands Day will be observed as a United Nations international day, following its adoption by the General Assembly on 30 August 2021. The theme for the 2022 edition is Wetlands Action for People and Nature, and it highlights the importance of actions that ensure that wetlands are conserved and sustainably used. It's an appeal to invest financial, human and political capital to save the world's wetlands from disappearing and to restore those we have degraded.</p><p>In October 2018, the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Ramsar Convention unveiled the first 18 cities that were chosen world-wide: and Colombo is the only South Asian city and the only capital among them. Rebranding cities as wetland cities under the Ramsar Wetland Accreditation scheme is an initiative that began in 2012. Accordingly, cities located in the vicinity of wetlands and dependent on wetlands are encouraged to utilise urban and peri-urban wetlands sustainably. Colombo is not merely a city that happens to be near wetlands. It is not merely a city surrounded by wetlands. Since its founding at the heart of the Kelani River delta, wetlands have been an integral part of Colombo, and it is not possible to think of the city without them.</p><p>Collectively known as the Colombo Wetland Complex (CWC) it spreads across Diyawannawa, Beddagana, Thalawathugoda, Kotte, Kolonnawa, Thalangama and Ambatale. They are also home to over 280 species of animals and 250 species of plants, many of which are unique to wetland environments. A number of policies, strategies, plans, and acts are in place to recognise the importance of Colombo's wetlands and facilitate integrated management plans for them, including an extensive CWC study in 2015 and the Wetland Management Strategy 2016.</p><p>Why recreate, when you can protect? Wetlands currently cover about 20 square kilometres of the Colombo Metropolitan Area, but they have been degraded and lost at a rate of 1.2% (58 acres) per year. In some parts of the city, up to 60% of wetland extent has been lost since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are solid waste dumping, untreated domestic wastewater, invasive species, algal blooms downstream from farms, and indiscriminate land filling.</p><p>The CWC provides refuge for 39% of the storm water - storing and then slowly releasing the excess water over a long period of time. In doing so the wetlands help maintain soil moisture balance. More than 50% of the city falls within the catchment of the CWC, which provides Colombo with green lungs allowing Colombo to enjoy a kind of natural air conditioning. Colombo's wetlands act as a buffer by trapping and removal of particulate matter in the air. It cools the city, cleans its water and air, protects it from flooding, and improves human quality of life. This has direct health benefits for the city's inhabitants - the wetlands reduce the incidence of cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases, coughing, bronchitis, and lung cancer.</p><p>The Thalangama wetland is home to two man-built reservoirs (tanks) namely Thalangama Tank and Averihena Tank, both just 300 metres apart and is protected by a Gazette in which the only permitted uses are fishing, birdwatching and cultivation. It is the duty of the Minister of Environment and the CEA to defend this gazette and these wetlands from the proposed elevated highway which the RDA is attempting to bull-doze through over 3 km of this Environmental Protected area. Residents had to rush to court with a Writ to defend this gazette. But what did the Minister then do? He surreptitiously publishes an amendment to this Gazette including 'Elevated Highways' under 'permitted uses'! It will be very interesting to read the Minister's message on World Wetlands Day.</p><p>The designation of Colombo as a Ramsar Wetland City is a milestone achievement and an incredible opportunity to double down on measures to protect and restore the city's wetlands. With increased public awareness, international support, and combined government and citizen action, Colombo can embrace its green infrastructure and the advantages of urban wetlands. Preserving Colombo's wetlands is a long-term investment in sustainable urban infrastructure that will pay off in many ways. Very soon, Sri Lanka will have to justify the retention of Colombo's Wetland City status. Till then, it is up to all stakeholders to work toward this goal and make the city a global leader in wetland conservation.</p><p>'Misconception of development as synonymous to large-scale infrastructure development programs at the cost of the environment is one of the largest threats to our wetlands right now. While the right to development is unarguably important, policy making should not be clouded with the misconception of developing now and cleaning up later.'</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["It will be very interesting to read the Minister's message on World Wetlands Day.

Living with the novel coronavirus has been a challenge like no other but the world is adapting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result of eased lockdowns and the rapid deployment of policy support at an unprecedented scale by central banks and governments around the world, the global economy is coming back from the depths of its collapse in the first half of this year. Employment has partially rebounded after having plummeted during the peak of the crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This crisis is however far from over. Employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels and the labour market has become more polarised with low-income workers, youth and women being harder hit. The poor are getting poorer with close to 90 million people expected to fall into extreme deprivation this year. The ascent out of this calamity is likely to be long, uneven and highly uncertain. It is essential that fiscal and monetary policy support is not prematurely withdrawn, as best possible.</p><p>In our latest World Economic Outlook, we continue to project a deep recession in 2020. Global growth is projected to be -4.4 percent, an upward revision of 0.8 percent compared to our June update. This upgrade owes to somewhat less dire outcomes in the second quarter, as well as signs of a stronger recovery in the third quarter, offset partly by downgrades in some emerging and developing economies. In 2021 growth is projected to rebound to 5.2 percent, -0.2 percent below our June projection.</p><p>Except for China, where output is expected to exceed 2019 levels this year, output in both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies is projected to remain below 2019 levels even next year. Countries that rely more on contact-intensive services and oil exporters face weaker recoveries compared to manufacturing-led economies.</p><p>The divergence in income prospects between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies (excluding China) triggered by this pandemic is projected to worsen. We are upgrading our forecast for advanced economies for 2020 to -5.8 percent, followed by a rebound in growth to 3.9 percent in 2021.</p><p>For emerging market and developing countries (excluding China) we have a downgrade with growth projected to be -5.7 percent in 2020 and then a recovery to 5 percent in 2021. With this, the cumulative growth in per capita income for emerging-market and developing economies (excluding China) over 2020-21 is projected to be lower than that for advanced economies.</p><p>This crisis will likely leave scars well into the medium term as labour markets take time to heal, investment is held back by uncertainty and balance sheet problems and lost schooling impairs human capital.</p><p>After the rebound in 2021, global growth is expected to gradually slow to about 3.5 percent into the medium term. The cumulative loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected path is projected to grow from 11 trillion over 2020-21 to 28 trillion over 2020-25. This represents a severe setback to the improvement in average living standards across all country groups.</p><p>There remains tremendous uncertainty around the outlook with both downside and upside risks. The virus is resurging with localised lockdowns being reinstituted. If this worsens and prospects for treatments and vaccines deteriorate, the toll on economic activity would be severe and likely amplified by severe financial market turmoil.</p><p>Growing restrictions on trade and investment and rising geopolitical uncertainty could harm the recovery. On the upside, faster and more widespread availability of tests, treatments, vaccines and additional policy stimulus can significantly improve outcomes.</p><p>More action is needed</p><p>The considerable global fiscal support of close to US $ 12 trillion and the extensive rate cuts, liquidity injections and asset purchases by central banks helped saved lives and livelihoods and prevented a financial catastrophe.</p><p>There is still much that needs to be done to ensure a sustained recovery. First, greater international collaboration is needed to end this health crisis. Tremendous progress is being made in developing tests, treatments and vaccines but only if countries work closely together will there be enough production and widespread distribution to all parts of the world.</p><p>We estimate that if medical solutions can be made available faster and more widely relative to our baseline, it could lead to a cumulative increase in global income of almost US $ 9 trillion by end-2025, raising incomes in all countries and reducing income divergence.</p><p>Second, to the extent possible, policies must aggressively focus on limiting persistent economic damage from this crisis. Governments should continue to provide income support through well targeted cash transfers, wage subsidies and unemployment insurance. To prevent large-scale bankruptcies and ensure workers can return to productive jobs, vulnerable but viable firms should continue to receive support-wherever possible-through tax deferrals, moratoria on debt service and equity-like injections.</p><p>Over time, as the recovery strengthens, policies should shift to facilitating reallocation of workers from sectors likely to shrink on a long-term basis (travel) to growing sectors (e-commerce). Workers should be supported through this adjustment with income transfers, retraining and reskilling.</p><p>Supporting reallocation will also require steps to speed up bankruptcy procedures and resolution mechanisms to efficiently tackle firm insolvencies. A public green infrastructure investment push in times of low interest rates and high uncertainty can significantly increase jobs and accelerate the recovery, while also serving as an initial big step towards reducing carbon emissions.</p><p>Emerging market and developing economies are having to manage this crisis with fewer resources, as many are constrained by elevated debt and higher borrowing costs. These economies will need to prioritise critical spending for health and transfers to the poor and ensure maximum efficiency. They will also need continued support in the form of international grants and concessional financing and debt relief in some cases. Where debt is unsustainable it should be restructured sooner than later to free up finances to deal with this crisis.</p><p>Lastly, policies should be designed with an eye toward placing economies on paths of stronger, equitable and sustainable growth. The global easing of monetary policy, while essential for the recovery, should be complemented with measures to prevent build-up of financial risks over the medium term and central bank independence should be safeguarded at all costs.</p><p>Needed fiscal spending and the output collapse have driven global sovereign debt levels to a record 100 percent of global GDP. While low interest rates alongside the projected rebound in growth in 2021 will stabilise debt levels in many countries, all will benefit from a medium-term fiscal framework to give confidence that debt remains sustainable.

'It has long played an important role in global economic growth, and now plays an equally important role in digital innovation,' he continued, citing the fact that many APAC countries have elevated digital transformation to a strategic policy level and are actively going green.</p><p>'Huawei has deep roots in APAC. We have been serving our customers here for over 30 years, and we are proud to support digital development in the region. Moving forward, we will keep investing heavily in innovation to help our partners in the region meet their strategic development goals. In 2022, we will increase our support for a Green and Digital APAC by promoting digital infrastructure, low-carbon development, and digital inclusion.'</p><p>ASEAN Foundation Executive Director Yang Mee Eng said: 'Only a strong digital talent team can achieve an inclusive and resilient digital Asia-Pacific region.

He went on to say, 'As we look for novel solutions and technical breakthroughs to drive transformation across industries in Indonesia, we've just signed a strategic milestone with Huawei to scale up Indonesian digital talent and power up local startups, paving the way for optimum use of technologies as a springboard for industries to recover together and recover stronger.'</p><p>Malaysia's Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation Dr. Adham Bin Baba spoke about how digitalisation applications have gained so much prominence that they are not just a dream but a need. Malaysia has recently launched the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (MyDIGITAL), which will further strengthen and elevate the sustainable development of the digital economy by providing a collaborative platform and market demand for digital solutions developed and deployed by local digital technology startups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) both in the form of devices and systems as well as software encompassing programs and artificial intelligence. This will place Malaysia on the trajectory to become a high-tech producer nation.</p><p>Bangladesh's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mustafa Jabbar explained that Bangladesh's communications industry has grown rapidly since the Digital Bangladesh Strategy was proposed in 2008. Mobile broadband coverage in the country has jumped from 0% to 98.5%, and the user base has expanded from 40 million in 2018 to 180 million today. 'This has greatly changed the lives of Bangladeshi people, but none of this would have been possible without the support of all industry and ecosystem partners,' added Jabbar.</p><p>How Huawei is supporting the growth of Asia-Pacific's digital economy</p><p>Huawei's Asia Pacific Region President Simon Lin gave a speech on the abundance of digital opportunities in APAC.

The magnitude has been particularly acute due to the vast proportion of the population living at the margins, fragmented coverage of social protection, pervasive informality in economic activities and employment, and wide gaps in public health infrastructure. In South Asia, the pandemic is estimated to have led to 62-71 million new poor in 2020 and 48-59 million new poor in 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tourism, an important sector in all South Asian economies-particularly for the Maldives-has been severely hit too, destroying the livelihoods of millions dependent on it and related activities. The pandemic also severely impacted small and medium enterprises, which are the backbones of South Asian economies and make a substantial contribution to GDP, employment and exports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crisis has accentuated historic inequalities and vulnerabilities - and is likely to reverse years, if not decades, of gains in poverty reduction, undermining the progress made by South Asian nations towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>While the economic harm is far from undone, recovery continues in South Asia, with strong growth in production activities and exports. As South Asia recuperates, it has an opportunity to leverage the crisis to build back more equitable, sustainable and resilient societies. Recovery paths and new growth strategies should be informed by lessons learned from - and innovations introduced during - the crisis.</p><p>Regional cooperation</p><p>Among other unfolding opportunities, enhanced regional cooperation provides a platform upon which South Asia can build unique clout. Despite the advantages of proximity, structural and cultural familiarities, shared developmental priorities and multiple institutional frameworks for regional cooperation, South Asia is among the world's least economically integrated regions. It has an opportunity to reinvent itself and emerge as an integrated regional economy with improved trade, supply chain and other economic exchanges such as shared infrastructure and cross-border movement of human and capital resources across the region.</p><p>Addressing historical mismatches in cross-border trade and labour markets, harnessing the shared internal economy of the region for inputs, markets and consumption, and strengthening regional institutions and agreements could unlock existing and hitherto untapped economic opportunities. With the ongoing redistribution of global supply chains, a regional supply chain could have significant payoffs. In particular, regional economies must collaborate to implement in full the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). A concerted and shared approach to advancing economic integration can facilitate efficiency-seeking industry restructuring throughout the region to promote economies of scale, specialisation and competitiveness.</p><p>New services economy</p><p>Historic opportunities arising in today's moments of crisis will not be available once old patterns take root again. For South Asia, one such opportunity can be the emergence of the new services economy.</p><p>With digital technologies taking centre stage during the pandemic, the services economy got a significant boost worldwide. Both directly and through their spill-over effect on other sectors, services play an important role in raising export revenues, boosting productivity and generating jobs. Digital technologies such as 5G, robotics, 3-D printing and virtual reality have made services more tradable, scalable and uniform, independent of the proximity burden. The pandemic also boosted the region's e-commerce sector, which typifies South Asia's new digital platform economy.</p><p>The new services economy can drive development in South Asia. However, fully unleashing these opportunities relies on reforms in the institutional and regulatory environment, creation of conducive digital infrastructure and relevant reskilling/upskilling. Market-oriented training programmes to improve the quality of technical skills needed for these sectors will be critical.</p><p>A green recovery</p><p>South Asian countries have another unique opportunity - to place green recovery at the heart of post-pandemic economic planning and build greener and more sustainable cities. Pursuing a green recovery can strengthen South Asia's long-term economic competitiveness while helping ensure an environmentally resilient future. Green recovery planning can also foster new collaborations and public-private partnerships within and between South Asian nations.</p><p>The COP26 summit recently focused the world's attention on the urgent need to tackle Climate Change. Amid consensus on the urgency and magnitude of the transformation needed to decarbonise the global economy and reduce climate impacts, South Asia's role and contributions will be critical for the world to achieve current targets.</p><p>South Asian nations can leverage multiple opportunities for cross-country collaboration in their green transition, such as sharing lessons and best practices, joint capacity-building exercises and regional emissions reduction strategies. Multiple regional economies are already leading on climate-impact mitigation and adaptation:</p><p>India recently announced the establishment of a National Hydrogen Mission. India's ambitious five-part \"Panchamrit\" pledge to reach net-zero by 2070 was one of the most important announcements at Glasgow.</p><p>Bangladesh launched the world's first country investment plan to tackle Climate Change and has been leading in building coastal resilience.</p><p>Pakistan achieved a landmark 9 per cent reduction in climate-altering carbon emissions thanks to massive afforestation programmes and nature-based interventions such as the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami and the Protected Areas Initiative. By 2030, Pakistan aims to shift to 60 per cent renewable energy and 30 per cent electric vehicles and completely ban imported coal.</p><p>Nepal is the first co-recipient country of a Green Climate Fund grant for national adaptation planning. The country's community-based forest management programs have helped reduce deforestation by 40 per cent.</p><p>Bhutan is the world's first carbon-negative country.</p><p>Going forward, nations need to explore concrete opportunities to integrate green, inclusive and resilient COVID-19 recovery packages into national development plans. Long-term policy changes to support Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) implementation, mainstreaming adaptation measures to guide national and subnational development strategies and enhancing private sector participation can help South Asia set a robust green recovery agenda.</p><p>However, key reforms will be critical for South Asia to pursue a green recovery and growth future, including access to clean energy, green infrastructure and green financing, fossil fuel subsidy reform and pricing, risk-informed urban planning, sustainable infrastructure and transport systems, and local community participation. By working with and supporting each other, South Asian countries can enhance global progress on climate action while unlocking new investments and partnerships for their own green transition.</p><p>South Asia has a rare opportunity to not only address the short-term public health challenge but also become an important axis of power and influence in the new global order. The World Economic Forum stands to partner with the region to help shape the contours of a new world order with a better, brighter and more sustainable future for all.</p><p>(Viraj Mehta is Head of Regional Agenda - India and South Asia, World Economic Forum, and Suchi Kedia is Community Specialist, Regional Agenda - India and South Asia, World Economic Forum)</p><p>- The Print</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

A ton of carbon dioxide emitted anywhere has the same greenhouse effect everywhere. National regulation cannot by itself correct the misalignment of incentives, owing to the free-rider problem across governments. Hence the need for an international accord like the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p>Biden and other world leaders must also tackle the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Beyond measures to address the pandemic itself, advanced economies must agree above all on joint fiscal stimulus, as they did at the 1978 Bonn summit of G7 leaders and at the 2009 G20 meetings under the leadership of the United Kingdom's then-prime minister, Gordon Brown.</p><p>The IMF recently estimated that if those G20 countries with the greatest fiscal space simultaneously increased infrastructure spending by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2021 and one percent of GDP in subsequent years - and if those with more limited fiscal space invested one-third of that - they could lift global GDP by nearly two percent by 2025, compared with a boost of just below 1.2% under an unsynchronized fiscal approach.</p><p>A coordinated fiscal expansion (with substantial funds spent, one hopes, on green infrastructure investment and the fight against COVID-19) would thus help to ensure a faster global recovery of GDP and employment, and minimise the danger of a W-shaped recession.</p><p>Moreover, a simultaneous stimulus need not adversely affect any G20 country's trade balance.</p><p>With interest rates near zero, the US and other advanced economies do not feel constrained in their ability to borrow, even as debt-to-GDP ratios rise. But emerging-market and developing economies (EMDEs) - especially those that already had unsustainable debt burdens before the pandemic struck - have much less room to maneuver.</p><p>Many EMDEs will need to have their debts restructured. Until now, the international community's response has mostly consisted of the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which was limited in scope. The scheme kicked the can down the road by merely postponing (as opposed to reducing) debt-service obligations, and it did not include private debt.</p><p>The world's largest economies must urgently lead and coordinate on this issue. G20 leaders recognized at their November 21-22 summit that DSSI-eligible countries need more than bilateral official debt relief. But they made little tangible progress.</p><p>Moreover, many African countries worry that well-intentioned efforts at coordinated debt restructuring will hurt their ability to continue accessing international capital markets. The poorest countries also need new concessional loans and grants. Proposals are back on the table to issue a new tranche of Special Drawing Rights (the IMF's reserve asset) and to direct the liquidity to emerging markets.</p><p>On trade, many Democrats will urge Biden to continue to pursue some of Trump's objectives, but to work with US allies rather than against them. One such goal is to reduce the need for foreign corporations to share proprietary technology with domestic partners as the price of access to China's market.</p><p>An intelligent US strategy might have been to stay in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and hold out to China the prospect of someday joining if it followed the rules, which were written mostly by America. The other TPP countries have gone ahead without the US, which could still catch up by rejoining.</p><p>But it may be too late for that. While the US was sleeping, China organised its own Asia-Pacific trade bloc, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. At this point, straightforward reciprocal tariff cuts may be a more promising option for the US than messy and hard-to-enforce 'deep integration.'</p><p>Recent high-level appointments to the incoming Biden administration are committed internationalists. The US will presumably allow the WTO to function again. But international trade agreements are unlikely to be high on its list of priorities, and committed devotees of the open rules-based trading system will have to recalibrate their ambitions. Furthermore, America's friends and allies have lost some of their enthusiasm for letting it conduct the international orchestra. But, at a minimum, they will be happy to have it back as an important and constructive player.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["5 percent of GDP in 2021 and one percent of GDP in subsequent years - and if those with more limited fiscal space invested one-third of that - they could lift global GDP by nearly two percent by 2025, compared with a boost of just below 1. 2% under an unsynchronized fiscal approach.

The pandemic is yet to be defeated and virus cases are accelerating in many countries. Recoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support and more reliance on tourism do less well.</p><p>The upgrades in global growth for 2021 and 2022 are mainly due to upgrades for advanced economies, particularly to a sizeable upgrade for the United States (1.3 percentage points) that is expected to grow at 6.4 percent this year. This makes the United States the only large economy projected to surpass the level of GDP it was forecast to have in 2022 in the absence of this pandemic. Other advanced economies, including the euro area, will also rebound this year but at a slower pace. Among emerging markets and developing economies, China is projected to grow this year at 8.4 percent. While China's economy had already returned to pre-pandemic GDP in 2020, many other countries are not expected to do so until 2023.</p><p>Daunting challenges ahead</p><p>These divergent recovery paths are likely to create wider gaps in living standards across countries compared to pre-pandemic expectations. The average annual loss in per capita GDP over 2020-24, relative to pre-pandemic forecasts, is projected to be 5.7 percent in low-income countries and 4.7 percent in emerging markets, while in advanced economies the losses are expected to be smaller at 2.3 percent. Such losses are reversing gains in poverty reduction, with an additional 95 million people expected to have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections.</p><p>Uneven recoveries are also occurring within countries as young and lower-skilled workers remain more heavily affected. Women have also suffered more, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Because the crisis has accelerated the transformative forces of digitalisation and automation, many of the jobs lost are unlikely to return, requiring worker reallocation across sectors-which often comes with severe earnings penalties.</p><p>Swift policy action worldwide, including US $ 16 trillion in fiscal support, prevented far worse outcomes. Our estimates suggest last year's severe collapse could have been three times worse had it not been for such support.</p><p>Because a financial crisis was averted, medium-term losses are expected to be smaller than after the 2008 global financial crisis, at around 3 percent. However, unlike after the 2008 crisis, it is emerging markets and low-income countries that are expected to suffer greater scarring given their more limited policy space.</p><p>A high degree of uncertainty surrounds our projections. Faster progress with vaccinations can uplift the forecast, while a more prolonged pandemic with virus variants that evade vaccines can lead to a sharp downgrade.</p><p>Multispeed recoveries could pose financial risks if interest rates in the United States rise further in unexpected ways. This could cause inflated asset valuations to unwind in a disorderly manner, financial conditions to tighten sharply and recovery prospects to deteriorate, especially for some highly leveraged emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>Working together to give people a fair shot</p><p>Policymakers will need to continue supporting their economies while dealing with more limited policy space and higher debt levels than prior to the pandemic. This requires better-targeted measures to leave space for prolonged support if needed. With multispeed recoveries, a tailored approach is necessary, with policies well-calibrated to the stage of the pandemic, the strength of the economic recovery and the structural characteristics of individual countries.</p><p>Right now, the emphasis should be on escaping the health crisis by prioritising healthcare spending-on vaccinations, treatments and healthcare infrastructure. Fiscal support should be well targeted to affected households and firms. Monetary policy should remain accommodative (where inflation is well behaved), while proactively addressing financial stability risks using macroprudential tools.</p><p>As the pandemic is beaten back and labour market conditions normalise, support such as worker retention measures should be gradually scaled back. At that point, more emphasis should be placed on reallocating workers, including through targeted hiring subsidies and reskilling of workers. As exceptional measures such as moratoria on loan payments are withdrawn, firm insolvencies could rise sharply and put one in 10 jobs at risk in many countries. To limit long-term damage countries should consider converting previous liquidity support (loans) into equity-like support for viable firms, while developing out-of-court restructuring frameworks to expedite eventual bankruptcies. Resources should also be devoted to helping children catch-up on lost instructional time during the pandemic.</p><p>Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output. The priorities should include green infrastructure investment to help mitigate climate change, digital infrastructure investment to boost productive capacity and strengthening social assistance to arrest rising inequality.</p><p>Financing these endeavours will be more difficult for economies with limited fiscal space. In such cases, improving tax capacity, increasing tax progressivity (on incomes, property and inheritance taxation), deploying carbon pricing and eliminating wasteful expenditures will be essential. All countries should anchor policies in credible medium-term frameworks and adhere to the highest standards of debt transparency to help contain borrowing costs and eventually reduce debt and rebuild buffers for the future.</p><p>On the international stage, first and foremost, countries need to work together to ensure universal vaccination. While some countries will get to widespread vaccinations by this summer, most, especially low-income countries will likely have to wait until end-2022. Speeding up vaccinations will require ramping up vaccine production and distribution, avoiding export controls, fully funding the COVAX facility on which many low-income countries rely for doses and ensuring equitable global transfers</p><p>of excess doses.</p><p>Policymakers should also continue to ensure adequate access to international liquidity. Major central banks should provide clear guidance on future actions with ample time to prepare, to avoid \"taper-tantrum\" kinds of episodes as occurred in 2013. Low-income countries will benefit from further extending the pause on debt repayments under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and operationalising the G20 Common Framework for orderly debt restructuring. A new allocation of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights will provide needed liquidity protection in highly uncertain times.</p><p>Even while all eyes are on the pandemic, it is essential that progress is made on resolving trade and technology tensions. Countries should also cooperate on climate change mitigation, on modernising international corporate taxation and on measures to limit cross-border profit shifting, tax avoidance</p><p>and evasion.</p><p>Over the past year, we have seen significant innovations in economic policy and massively scaled-up support at the national level, particularly among advanced economies that have been able to afford these initiatives. A similarly ambitious effort is now needed at the multilateral level to secure the recovery and build forward better. Without additional efforts to give all people a fair shot, cross-country gaps in living standards could widen significantly and decades-long progress in global poverty reduction could reverse.</p><p>(Gita Gopinath is Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

We are confined to our homes. Weaknesses in healthcare systems have been exposed. Jobs are uncertain. Women are bearing the burden of providing informal care within families. Millions are being pushed back into poverty. Stock markets are reeling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We long for normality. But when life was normal we were already in crisis - a climate crisis. Returning to that status quo isn't an option. Instead, we should ensure our decisions to tackle this pandemic do not compound the climate crisis. Rather, they should help shape an inclusive and sustainable future for all.</p><p>Now is the time to ramp up our actions on resilience so that our society can beat the COVID-19 crisis and reduce the impact of climate threats.</p><p>Following five approaches can drive this shift</p><p>First, use the opportunity to tackle the climate crisis head-on, as well as the pandemic. Though national borders are closed, global solidarity is high. Time and resources are in short supply. We do not have the luxury nor the financing to deal with each crisis separately. More importantly, dealing with the impact of both requires us to urgently address underlying vulnerabilities - poverty, limited social safety nets, weak health systems and structural gender inequalities.</p><p>Tackling issues together can redouble resilience. For example, more resilient healthcare systems would cope better during pandemics. They could also deal more effectively with diseases caused by climate change, such respiratory ailments due to higher temperatures and waterborne illnesses from changes in precipitation.</p><p>Second, reforms, tax cuts, subsidies and incentives designed to help economies recover should also examine the implications for longer-term climate-resilient development. Sustainable recovery will require a long-term systemic shift so that short-term fixes don't have adverse consequences for the environment and equity.</p><p>Actions for climate resilience have always prioritised long-term thinking. Still, climate risk information has only very rarely found its way into fiscal policy and management processes. Now is the time to make this happen. Proposed reforms to meet immediate needs should also promote green infrastructure, create jobs in sectors that reduce carbon emissions and incentivise actions such as business continuity planning across supply chains that promote longer-term sustainability and equity by addressing climate risks.</p><p>Third, measures should have an explicit focus on the poor and marginalised. The pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on poor and marginalised populations. These people are already burdened with the ill-effects of climate-related shocks and stresses such as salinity intrusion at coastal areas and urban \"heat islands\" endured by outdoor workers.</p><p>To prevent millions slipping back into poverty, a sharp focus on strengthening the resilience of the poor will be needed. This calls for tailored solutions to support the chronic and near poor in both urban and rural areas. Large-scale pro-poor development programmes should proactively introduce explicit resilience-building measures. Technical and vocational education and training programmes can build skills for climate-friendly livelihoods, such as producing drought-resistant high-value crops. Cash-for-work programmes can help protect wetlands and mangroves.</p><p>Equally important is to invest in social protection systems with adaptive features. For example, using climate risk information to target vulnerable populations and flexibly allowing cash transfer programmes to add temporary new beneficiaries can cushion the impacts of a crisis. It will be important to strengthen linkages between various programmes - public health, community infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods, microfinance - to deliver resilience solutions.</p><p>Fourth, let's take a transformational approach to resilience. The effects of climate change are not linear. Therefore, additive incremental actions taken to combat a pandemic won't necessarily protect assets, livelihoods and well-being over the long term.</p><p>Instead, we need to address the systemic, structural and gendered dimensions of vulnerability. The focus should be on underlying inequalities, balancing bottom-up and top-down planning approaches and requiring behavioural and lifestyle changes. For example, investments to support populations in urban informal settlements should involve communities, especially women, in decision-making about selection, construction and maintenance of water supply and sanitation infrastructure.</p><p>We can promote behavioural change through improved hygiene and by forming self-help groups to kick start sustainable livelihoods in climate-friendly roles such as management of wetlands and mangroves.</p><p>Finally, invest in communities. Managing any crisis boils down to individual communities - their capacity, resources and level of preparedness. Communities that are well informed about risks and involved in local decision-making can play critical roles in helping local governments to identify and serve vulnerable populations.</p><p>This can improve the targeting of resources and distribution of food. Self-help groups have spread awareness about climate and disaster risks, performed caregiving roles and implemented farm-to-home models to deliver agricultural produce. Grassroots women's groups are better aware of local vulnerabilities and can ensure that government support reaches the last mile.</p><p>Building the adaptive capacity of communities requires sustained investments in organising communities and empowering them economically and socially. The Global Commission on Adaptation has estimated that investing US $ 1.8 trillion globally from 2020 to 2030 in resilience-building measures could generate US $ 7.1 trillion in total new benefits.</p><p>It pays to invest in resilience. Let's make those investments now so our communities can thrive-before, during and after crises.</p><p>(Preety Bhandari is Chief of the Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Thematic Group concurrently Director, SDCD.

Furthermore, this joint initiative once implemented in compliance with IMF conditions, is expected to increase investors' confidence and also in securing additional resources from the IMF, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other such agencies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amidst all these, there appears to be a silver lining in the dark financial clouds that hovering over Sri Lanka at present where even an adversity of this magnitude could be turned into an excellent medium or long-term investment opportunity. The silver lining in the dark horizon is that the leading international donor agencies are steadily moving towards 'sustainable financing' in compliance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in the present green economic era.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sustainable finance roadmap for Sri Lanka</p><p>Sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria (developed by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment - PRI) into account, when making investment decisions in the financial sector. These in turn will lead to more long-term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects.</p><p>Sri Lanka too joined this bandwagon in developing a Roadmap for Sustainable Finance way back in 2016/2017. It is aimed at integrating ESG criteria into financial decision-making processes in order to help build a more resilient and sustainable green economy. These sustainable finance practices are expected to promote assistance to make the businesses greener, climate-friendly, and socially inclusive.</p><p>This Sustainable Finance Road Map for Sri Lanka was prepared through an inclusive multi-stakeholder process and launched in 2019 with financial assistance from the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) from the UNDP and technical support from the International Finance Corporation. In this 'new normal' era of post-pandemic banking, sustainable finance is expected to become a key mover in achieving social, economic, and environmental goals in a green economic milieu.</p><p>The Biodiversity Finance Plan (BFP) for Sri Lanka (2018-2024) prepared collectively by the then Ministry of Finance and Media, The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment in 2019, intends to support sustainable biodiversity management efforts of Sri Lanka by mobilising finance for investing in biodiversity by both the public and private sector.</p><p>A considerable amount of background preparatory work detailed in three technical reports (i.) Policy and Institutional Review, (ii.) Biodiversity Expenditure Review, and (iii) Financial Need Assessment, has gone into developing this Biodiversity Finance Plan for Sri Lanka. It is expected to achieve national biodiversity targets that include conservation, sustainable management, and equitable distribution of benefits among all stakeholders, the three main pillars of the Convention on Biodiversity.</p><p>During this process, the national biodiversity and climate change-related strategic plans viz. National Biodiversity Action plan (NBSAP 2016-2022), National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP 2018-2022), National Action Program for Combating Land Degradation in Sri Lanka (NAP-CLD 2015-2024), and National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change Impacts in Sri Lanka (2016-2025) have been consulted for estimating the financial gap constraining investment needed for their effective implementation.</p><p>In addition, the vision of the BFP is directly linked to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 13: Climate Action; Goal 14: Life below Water, and Goal 15: Life on Land. It is indirectly linked to several other SDGs such as Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.</p><p>The BFP has been designed to meet the biodiversity financing needs of the country by mobilising resources for investing in conserving biodiversity, promoting its sustainable use, and equitable sharing of its benefits. This is to be achieved with the participation of all major stakeholders - the Government, the corporate sector, and the community.</p><p>Thirteen different finance solutions viz. sustainable standards and certification, eco-labels, green lending, corporate social responsibility, lotteries, payment for ecosystem services, green bonds, ecotourism, conservation license plates, carbon markets, lobbying for public budget allocations, and diaspora savings and investment, have been identified based on the information given in national and sectoral planning documents of Sri Lanka. Each of these has been elaborated on in some detail with action plans in the BFP 2018-2022 document.</p><p>Most of the prioritised financial solutions listed above are already in operation, though at a modest scale. They need to be scaled up with judicious resource mobilisation to be more responsive to the conservation and sustainable development, equitable sharing of biodiversity and ecosystem service benefits. Consequently, with all this background preparative work accomplished, Sri Lanka is in a strong position to make the current adversity into an opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>Green bonds</p><p>One of the fastest developing financial or refinancing solutions on a global scale is coming from issuance of sustainability-linked international sovereign green bonds and other similar instruments such as sustainability-linked bonds, climate bonds and social bonds (Figures 2 and 3). The repayment of debt using these green bonds and the like is tied to the achievement of institutional environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets, such as greenhouse gas emission reductions. The growth of green bonds in the global capital markets has been explosive in recent times and is increasingly attracting attention of the corporate entities around the globe. Global Green Bond investments have topped $ 500 billion in 2021 for the first time and it is expected to reach $ 1 trillion this year.</p><p>Most of the green bonds in the world have been issued to finance relatively large projects in the areas of Renewable Energy, Transport, Pollution Prevention and Control, Water and Waste Management, Environmentally Sustainable Land-use, Agriculture and Forestry, Reduction in Carbon Emission, and Green Infrastructure, and since of late for Biodiversity Conservation.</p><p>Governments, major financial centres and central banks world over are greening their financial systems by developing green bond guidance, green taxonomies, regulation, and reporting guidelines. Investors worldwide are waking up to the importance of incorporating biodiversity as part of ESG risk assessments and their effective management. This is due in part to the increasing focus on this topic since the United Nation's Intergovernmental Science-Policy platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (UN-IPBES) produced its landmark Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in May 2019, casting the spotlight on the alarming declines of biodiversity worldwide.</p><p>Although Sri Lanka has not yet availed herself of this innovative financial solution of investing in Green Bonds, it is ideally placed to benefit from this emerging opportunity, for Sri Lanka being one of 36 global hotspots of biodiversity. Sri Lanka has actively participated in sustainability-focused investments through the Sustainable Banking Network of the International Finance Corporation, and it is a fortuitous coincidence that the present Governor of the Central Bank, himself, has taken an active role in this global network activities in the past (see photo).</p><p>The Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the financial sector, in general, have been moving in the direction of sustainable financing with the preparation of the required technical details listed earlier. The latest addition to it is the 'Sri Lanka Green Finance Taxonomy' (a classification system established to provide guidelines for integrating sustainability into investment decisions), published by the Central Bank on 6 May 2022. Green Bond Principles (GBP) is one of several well-known taxonomies that provide guidelines specific to green bonds.</p><p>Consequently, Sri Lanka has already put in place the necessary institutional infrastructure in financial markets for entering into green bond initiatives. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has been raising international finance by issuing bonds since 2007. As such, the government and the financial institutions are quite familiar and well equipped with the necessary groundwork to enter the international (green) bond market. The BFP reports that the Government of Sri Lanka recommends the issuing of international sovereign green bonds as a sustainable finance solution to mobilise relatively large sums of debt capital for investing in large-scale biodiversity projects, combatting land degradation, arresting habitat and species loss, maritime reef conservation, coastal conservation, and sustainable energy.</p><p>All these project documents (viz. NBSAP, NRIFAP, NAPCLD, and NAPCCI) prepared with broader consultation and supported by the respective UN agencies are therefore, consistent with the global conventions as well as national-level policies and strategies on biodiversity, climate change, and land degradation. The Wildlife and Forest Conservation Departments have carried out several biodiversity and ecosystem management projects including the preparation of two pilot scale novel Landscape Management Plans - one for Sinharaja Rain Forest Complex and the other for Hurulu-Kaudulla-Kantale forest complex with financial support from the Ecosystem Conservation and Management Project (ESCAMP 2018-2022) of the World Bank. These plans are available as excellent opportunities for consideration in raising funds from international capital markets for restructuring at least some of the ISBs into Green Bonds. Similarly, Forestry Sector Master Plan first prepared in 1995 is being revised to meet the present-day forestry sector needs which again, together with NBSAP, NRIFAP, NAPCLD, and NAPCCI are good candidates for similar capital investment considerations during the debt restructuring process.</p><p>Green energy</p><p>With respect to sustainable energy, especially the generation of electricity has become one of the most critical issues at present in Sri Lanka. The UNDP and ADB joint assessment of 'Sri Lanka's Power Sector - 100% Electricity Generation through Renewable Energy by 2050' provides opportunities for green-bond solutions, among others in this area. Sri Lanka being one of the forty-three countries of the Climate Vulnerable Group which are disproportionately affected by climate change, has signed the declaration at the 22nd COP meeting of UNFCCC in Marrakech, Morocco in 2016 to reach these ambitious renewable electricity generation targets by 2050.</p><p>However, the UNDP-ADB joint assessment records that the Long-term Generation Expansion Plan (LTGEP) for Sri Lanka, 2015-2034 (http:// pucsl.gov.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Long-Term-Generation-Plan-2015-2034-PUCSL.pdf) envisages adding at least two more coal-fired power plants, one in Trincomalee (2 x 300 MW) in 2029 onwards and the other in the Southern Region (3 x 300 MW) from 2027 onwards. The report however cautions that stiff resistance from local communities and possible litigation moves by environmental groups may lead to change this long-term generation plan.</p><p>According to the same report (table 41: p 113), several thermal power plants are likely to be retired from operation due to their age-related malfunctioning and these capacities also will need urgent replacements to ensure Sri Lanka's growing electricity demands. Therefore, actual future coal-based capacity addition to our national grid may be much lower than planned. The same report adds that by 2050, the 100% Renewable Energy scenario can potentially save $ 18-$ 19 billion on imported coal as compared with the base case scenario, which relies heavily on coal.</p><p>The Ceylon Electricity Board's long-term generation planning is based on the 'least cost principle' which has led to its focus on significantly cheap coal-based capacity development. However, they have not considered the environmental and health cost externalities in their calculations. Inclusion of the cost of carbon emission, air-quality and health related issues and other externalities would provide a more realistic picture of benefit/cost of the use of coal for electricity generation. Unfortunately, the natural resource economists have not yet brought these environmental and health costs associated with coal-fired power plants in Sri Lanka to the attention of the CEB. Alternatively, it may be that the information available either from Sri Lanka or our neighbouring countries have not been taken into consideration in the calculation of 'least cost'.</p><p>Unless these developments are taken into consideration, the roadmap developed as a part of the LTGEP, while making provisions for increased adoption of renewable energy in the electricity generation mix, is unlikely to be the basis on which the Sri Lanka can transform its power sector into a 100% RE sector by 2050. Consequently, there is a pressing need for updating the LTGEP with the global shifts to renewable energy sources mandated by the Sri Lankan government in compliance with the UNFCCC recommendations. Such projects could be very attractive for international donors, and they may rank very high in eligibility for Green Bond investments.</p><p>Furthermore, the COP 26 meeting of the UNFCCC held in Glasgow in 2021 set a new gold standard on the 'Paris Alignment of international public finance' to move away from Coal - the single biggest contributor to climate change - by the end of 2021. Sri Lanka along with Chile, Montenegro and their European partners pledged that no new Coal Power Plants to be constructed in their respective countries. Alok Sharma, the British minister of State at the cabinet office who was also the COP 26 president announced that more than 40 countries reached a deal and pledged to phase out coal - the dirtiest fossil fuel - by the 2040s. Two notable exceptions apparently had been the USA and China although the US has pledged to end public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad without any carbon capture and storage technology, by the end of 2022.</p><p>In light of these recent developments, there is more than a silver lining in our gloomy horizon that Sri Lanka can capitalise on its current debt restructuring process to transform some of her International Sovereign Bonds to Green Bonds for funding Non-conventional Renewable Energy projects through effective engagement at the future negotiations with the IMF and the lenders/creditors. These projects typically involve renewable energy generation and emission reductions among a host of other benefits. Shifting from a coal power to a solar power project in Sampur in eastern Sri Lanka may be one such project put forward by the National Thermal Power Corporation of India recently although the details of the agreement have not been made public, as yet.</p><p>There is an enormous potential for Sri Lanka to tap into these green/sustainability bond markets to finance its infrastructure projects/investments such as in waste management, renewable energy projects, biodiversity conservation, public transportation, climate change adaptation and mitigation. As shown above, large/medium/small scale green investment project plans have already been prepared and the sustainable financing infrastructure is already in place, and what is needed is a matter of prioritising these differently sized projects in consultation with appropriate stakeholder groups.</p><p>Sri Lanka is a relatively small island with unparalleled diversity of physical, biological and cultural features. Most of her leading agricultural exports (tea, rubber and spices) are in the hands of a diverse set of smallholders which, in a way, are more resilient to cataclysmic changes that may come with the vagaries of the climate from time to time. Therefore, the biodiversity finance projects need not only conserve and sustainably utilise the natural resources but also take adequate measures to distribute the benefits equitably among these smallholders who had been the backbone of the Sri Lankan enterprise. Sri Lanka is known world over as a 'paradise of smallholders' and the preservation of that cultural tradition is more important in the future.</p><p>Finally, although Sri Lanka has been caught somewhat unawares in a violent tropical thunderstorm (its origin perhaps be rooted in extra-tropical climes), the charting out of it seems to be reasonably well laid out by the technocrats with the support from the international agencies. In order to steady the ship in these viciously turbulent waters, we obviously need a matching political leadership with a clear vision, honesty, integrity, calm but stern demeanour and above all strong and selfless commitment to steer the ship out of the rough seas to calmer waters. The least we need at this critical moment of despondency is a mutiny on board the ship which will only help those prying to grab the best of - as some would call it - 'this unsinkable aircraft carrier' in the Indian Ocean.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["The growth of green bonds in the global capital markets has been explosive in recent times and is increasingly attracting attention of the corporate entities around the globe.

Sri Lanka ranks the highest in the South Asia Region in the World Bank Human Capital Index for the second time in a row.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, as in other countries, the loss of jobs and incomes incurred by the pandemic has been severe. While workers in almost every sector have been affected, informal workers who make up about 70% of the workforce, and especially those in the industries and low-end services such as trade, are likely to be the most affected.</p><p>The apparel industry, which employs about half a million workers, has been reportedly forced to cut a significant number of jobs. Tourism, an emerging driver of jobs and growth in recent years, has taken a sizeable hit, just when it was recovering from the shock of the devastating April 2019 attacks.</p><p>As a result, poverty levels (measured by the World Bank's $3.20 poverty line in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity terms) are expected to rise to 13%, up from 8.9% in 2019. This implies that about 890,000 more people would become newly poor and many of them from the poorest regions in Sri Lanka.</p><p> This is a significant setback that would imply a reversal of more than five years' worth of progress in improving welfare.The Government of Sri Lanka took swift action to enact measures to safeguard people's health and counter their reversal of fortunes.</p><p> Now, moving forward, the focus is rightly on building back better and rebuilding people's lives.The World Bank is a long-term partner to the people and Government of Sri Lanka.</p><p> To help the country get back on the road to resilience, we are working closely with the Government on three ways to reverse the rising tide of poverty brought on by the COVID-19 crisis. Protecting the poor and vulnerableFirst, by protecting the poor and vulnerable.</p><p> The economic burden induced by the pandemic is not borne evenly and it is critical to protect the poorest and the most vulnerable from falling into greater hardships. This requires efforts to regularly monitor the impact of the crisis on firms and the labor market in order to support timely interventions.</p><p>The World Bank is rolling out a phone-based monitoring survey in the South Asia region to track the crisis impact on jobs and earnings that can inform its operational response to the crisis. As part of the crisis response, we are grateful for the opportunity to support Government's efforts to revisit its social safety net program and develop a long-term strategy for social protection.</p><p>One critical success will be the creation of the central online portal, a \"one-stop shop\" for all the country's welfare programs, in order to better identify the needs of poorer households, reduce overlaps, eliminate leakages, and make it easier for the Government to deliver rapid assistance to those in need.

Sri Lanka ranks the highest in the South Asia Region in the World Bank Human Capital Index for the second time in a row.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, as in other countries, the loss of jobs and incomes incurred by the pandemic has been severe. While workers in almost every sector have been affected, informal workers who make up about 70% of the workforce, and especially those in the industries and low-end services such as trade, are likely to be the most affected.</p><p>The apparel industry, which employs about half a million workers, has been reportedly forced to cut a significant number of jobs. Tourism, an emerging driver of jobs and growth in recent years, has taken a sizeable hit, just when it was recovering from the shock of the devastating April 2019 attacks.</p><p>As a result, poverty levels (measured by the World Bank's $3.20 poverty line in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity terms) are expected to rise to 13%, up from 8.9% in 2019. This implies that about 890,000 more people would become newly poor and many of them from the poorest regions in Sri Lanka.</p><p> This is a significant setback that would imply a reversal of more than five years' worth of progress in improving welfare.The Government of Sri Lanka took swift action to enact measures to safeguard people's health and counter their reversal of fortunes.</p><p> Now, moving forward, the focus is rightly on building back better and rebuilding people's lives.The World Bank is a long-term partner to the people and Government of Sri Lanka.</p><p> To help the country get back on the road to resilience, we are working closely with the Government on three ways to reverse the rising tide of poverty brought on by the COVID-19 crisis.Protecting the poor and vulnerableFirst, by protecting the poor and vulnerable.</p><p> The economic burden induced by the pandemic is not borne evenly and it is critical to protect the poorest and the most vulnerable from falling into greater hardships. This requires efforts to regularly monitor the impact of the crisis on firms and the labor market in order to support timely interventions.</p><p>The World Bank is rolling out a phone-based monitoring survey in the South Asia region to track the crisis impact on jobs and earnings that can inform its operational response to the crisis. As part of the crisis response, we are grateful for the opportunity to support Government's efforts to revisit its social safety net program and develop a long-term strategy for social protection.</p><p>One critical success will be the creation of the central online portal, a \"one-stop shop\" for all the country's welfare programs, in order to better identify the needs of poorer households, reduce overlaps, eliminate leakages, and make it easier for the Government to deliver rapid assistance to those in need.   The Government took swift action to enact measures to safeguard people's health and counter their reversal of fortunes.</p><p> Now, moving forward, the focus is rightly on building back better and rebuilding people's lives.

In the near future, the world may need to resort to lockdowns again - this time to tackle a climate emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shifting Arctic ice, raging wildfires in western US states and elsewhere, and methane leaks in the North Sea are all warning signs that we are approaching a tipping point on climate change, when protecting the future of civilisation will require dramatic interventions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under a 'climate lockdown,' governments would limit private-vehicle use, ban consumption of red meat, and impose extreme energy-saving measures, while fossil-fuel companies would have to stop drilling. To avoid such a scenario, we must overhaul our economic structures and do capitalism differently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many think of the climate crisis as distinct from the health and economic crises caused by the pandemic. But the three crises - and their solutions - are interconnected.</p><p>COVID-19 is itself a consequence of environmental degradation: one recent study dubbed it 'the disease of the Anthropocene.' Moreover, climate change will exacerbate the social and economic problems highlighted by the pandemic. These include governments' diminishing capacity to address public-health crises, the private sector's limited ability to withstand sustained economic disruption, and pervasive social inequality.</p><p>These shortcomings reflect the distorted values underlying our priorities. For example, we demand the most from 'essential workers' (including nurses, supermarket workers, and delivery drivers) while paying them the least. Without fundamental change, climate change will worsen such problems.</p><p>The climate crisis is also a public-health crisis. Global warming will cause drinking water to degrade and enable pollution-linked respiratory diseases to thrive. According to some projections, 3.5 billion people globally will live in unbearable heat by 2070.</p><p>Addressing this triple crisis requires reorienting corporate governance, finance, policy, and energy systems toward a green economic transformation. To achieve this, three obstacles must be removed: business that is shareholder-driven instead of stakeholder-driven, finance that is used in inadequate and inappropriate ways, and government that is based on outdated economic thinking and faulty assumptions.</p><p>Corporate governance must now reflect stakeholders' needs instead of shareholders' whims. Building an inclusive, sustainable economy depends on productive co-</p><p>operation among the public and private sectors and civil society. This means firms need to listen to trade unions and workers' collectives, community groups, consumer advocates, and others.</p><p>Likewise, government assistance to business must be less about subsidies, guarantees, and bailouts, and more about building partnerships. This means attaching strict conditions to any corporate bailouts to ensure that taxpayer money is put to productive use and generates long-term public value, not short-term private profits.</p><p>In the current crisis, for example, the French government conditioned its bailouts for Renault and Air France-KLM on emission-reduction commitments. France, Belgium, Denmark, and Poland denied state aid to any company domiciled in a European Union-designated tax haven, and barred large recipients from paying dividends or buying back their own shares until 2021. Likewise, US corporations receiving government loans through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act were prohibited from using the funds for share buybacks.</p><p>These conditions are a start, but are not ambitious enough, either from a climate perspective or in economic terms. The magnitude of government assistance packages does not match firms' requirements, and the conditions are not always legally binding: for example, the Air France emissions policy applies only to short domestic flights.</p><p>Far more is needed to achieve a green and sustainable recovery. For example, governments might use the tax code to discourage firms from using certain materials. They might also introduce job guarantees at company or national level so that human capital is not wasted or eroded. This would help the youngest and oldest workers, who have disproportionately suffered job losses owing to the pandemic, and reduce the likely economic shocks in disadvantaged regions already suffering industrial decline.</p><p>Finance needs fixing, too. During the 2008 global financial crisis, governments flooded markets with liquidity. But, because they did not direct it toward good investment opportunities, much of that funding ended up back in a financial sector unfit for purpose.</p><p>The current crisis presents an opportunity to harness finance in productive ways to drive long-term growth. Patient long-term finance is key, because a three-to-five-year investment cycle doesn't match the long lifespan of a wind turbine (more than 25 years), or encourage the innovation needed in e-mobility, natural capital development (such as rewilding programmes), and green infrastructure.</p><p>Some governments have already launched sustainable growth initiatives. New Zealand has developed a budget based on 'wellbeing' metrics, rather than GDP, to align public spending with broader objectives, while Scotland has established the mission-oriented Scottish National Investment Bank.</p><p>Along with steering finance toward a green transition, we need to hold the financial sector accountable for its often-destructive environmental impact. The Dutch central bank estimates that Dutch financial institutions' biodiversity footprint represents a loss of over 58,000 square kilometers (22,394 square miles) of pristine nature - an area 1.7 times larger than the Netherlands.</p><p>Because markets will not lead a green revolution on their own, government policy must steer them in that direction. This will require an entrepreneurial state that innovates, takes risks, and invests alongside the private sector. Policymakers should therefore redesign procurement contracts in order to move away from low-cost investments by incumbent suppliers, and create mechanisms that 'crowd in' innovation from multiple actors to achieve public green goals.</p><p>Governments should also take a portfolio approach to innovation and investment. In the United Kingdom and the United States, wider industrial policy continues to support the information-technology revolution. Similarly, the EU's recently launched European Green Deal, Industrial Strategy, and Just Transition Mechanism are acting as the motor and compass for the pound 750 billion ($888 billion) 'Next Generation EU' recovery fund.</p><p>Finally, we need to reorient our energy system around renewable energy - the antidote to climate change and the key to making our economies energy-secure. We must therefore evict fossil-fuel interests and short-termism from business, finance, and politics. Financially powerful institutions such as banks and universities must divest from fossil-fuel companies. Until they do, a carbon-based economy will prevail.</p><p>The window for launching a climate revolution - and achieving an inclusive recovery from COVID-19 in the process - is rapidly closing. We need to move quickly if we want to transform the future of work, transit, and energy use, and make the concept of a 'green good life' a reality for generations to come. One way or the other, radical change is inevitable; our task is to ensure that we achieve the change we want - while we still have the choice.</p><p>Mariana Mazzucato, Professor of Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London and Founding Director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, is the author of The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy and The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["But, because they did not direct it toward good investment opportunities, much of that funding ended up back in a financial sector unfit for purpose.

A historic year of floods in South Asia", "published": "2020-12-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka, Dec. 12 -- The current year 2020 has been a record year for flooding in the Asia-Pacific region, with cities in East, Southeast, and South Asia seeing economic losses, loss of life, and widespread displacement due to heavy rains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The figures are staggering - in China alone, 2.7 million were evacuated and 63 million were affected, while Nepal has experienced 4,500 landslides, and, at one point, one-third of Bangladesh was underwater. Another 17 million were affected by flooding in South Asia. Floods also impacted parts of Indonesia, and in the past month, Vietnam and the Philippines have also been hit. Altogether, they highlight the need to scale up solutions to help fast-growing cities build flood resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Low-lying developing countries and cities in Asia are facing a 1-2-3 punch,\" said Sally Yozell, Director of the Environmental Security Program at The Stimson Center, a Washington D.C., based research center. \"Massive storms, flooding, sea level rise, all on top of the social and economic issues that many coastal communities have - it's extreme.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there is a growing awareness that nature-based and community solutions are needed to increase flood resilience in the most vulnerable cities, scaling up and redirecting climate and adaptation finance remains a challenge across the region.</p><p>Climate change models predict that, in Asia, rainfall during the wet season will become more concentrated while the dry season becomes longer. \"We are talking about some 15 to 20 percent more intense events in terms of the accumulated rainfall,\" said Giriraj Amarnath, research group leader for the water risks and disasters program at the International Water Management Institute, based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. \"It's also estimated that these kinds of events are three times more likely, now, due to climate change.\"</p><p>Flooding alone is not an issue. It can provide benefits for agricultural and fishing production around and near cities. But climate change has made regular seasonal patterns less predictable, straining the capacity of landscapes and urban infrastructure to adapt.</p><p>While science has gotten better at connecting specific extreme weather events to climate change, for now, it is too soon to estimate just how much worse, or intense, this year's floods were due to climate change. One thing is clear, though - climate change will likely mean that these kinds of extreme flooding events will become more common in Asia.</p><p>\"The impact we have seen across parts of Asia this year fits very much with the trends we have been seeing for many years,\" said Matthew Cochrane, spokesperson at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"Today, climate and weather-related events account for nearly nine out of all 10 disasters.\"</p><p>Human impacts and solutions</p><p>When it comes to flooding, Asia, due to the presence of large populations in vulnerable, coastal cities, and growing urbanization, is the continent of most concern.</p><p>A study published in \"Nature Communications\" last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable population found in China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. Another study published this past July in Nature's \"Scientific Reports\" found that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be in Asia, especially in growing coastal cities such as Shanghai, China with 27 million, Bangkok, Thailand with eight million, and Kolkata, India with 14 million.</p><p>\"When people migrate in Asia, they are more likely to end up staying in parts of the city that are not planned, areas that also tend to get flooded,\" said Soumya Balasubramanya, research group leader for economics at IWMI. \"More people moving to the cities essentially means more people who are vulnerable to these sorts of disasters.\"</p><p>While floods make headlines, even smaller changes in precipitation patterns have real social and economic impacts. Bangladesh is ranked high on lists of countries that will be most adversely impacted by climate change, due to its large population residing in low-lying, coastal, or delta regions. There, Kaiser Rejve with the humanitarian organization CAREBangladesh has seen these changes yearly.</p><p>\"The frequency of floods (since 1998) has increased with floods now starting earlier in the year and also later in the year, damaging agricultural pursuits and negatively affecting food security and livelihood,\" Rejve said. Of the 28 districts impacted were the cities of Sirajganj, Tangail, and suburbs of the capital, Dhaka.</p><p>Bangladesh is also a major recipient of aid aimed at both increasing resilience to floods and preparing for future climate-related disasters. There is growing awareness that traditional big project solutions, including building sea walls, are not enough. That is why, in 2019, The World Bank and the World Resources Institute released a report calling for a shift from a focus on gray infrastructure - sea walls, but also dams and traditional wastewater management systems - toward greater integration with green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, which they argue can, together, better flood resilience and water security. These include measures such as mangrove and wetlands restoration, absorbent urban surfaces, and building sponge cities that absorb water.</p><p>Another challenge is getting actionable data into decision-makers' hands. Climate-related flood risk is especially challenging as it often requires integration between various government ministries and international actors. That is why, in June, The Stimson Center released its Climate and Ocean Risk Vulnerability Index, or CORVI, tool.</p><p>\"CORVI is a planning tool,\" Yozell said. \"If you focus on just one focal area - sea level rise, or drought, or heat - but do not look at them all collectively, you are missing the forest for the trees.\"</p><p>CORVI hopes to help cities avoid scenarios, like that took place in Jakarta in 2015, when the Ciliwung river flooded. The capital of Indonesia, and a megacity with approximately 10 million residents in the city and around 34 million in the Greater Jakarta area as of 2018, has been subject to increasingly severe floods due to over-development and groundwater discharge, and embarked on a plan to restore river flow within the city.</p><p>\"The Ciliwung river flow was deemed essential to mitigating flooding in the short term, so thousands of households were displaced,\" said Gavin Shatkin, a professor at Northeastern University, who researches flood resilience in Indonesia.</p><p>The displaced were from low-income communities, and the resulting backlash led to several court cases, and played a role in the Jakarta Governor being voted out in 2017, showing the risk of ignoring socioeconomic factors when designing flood resilience programs. Jakarta is also sinking, so to help alleviate the problem, along with several related urbanization issues, the government is relocating the functions of government to a new capital city on the island of Borneo, a plan now on hold due to COVID-19. Jakarta will still be the financial and business center of Indonesia.</p><p>Financing resilience</p><p>A report released by the Flood Resilience Alliance in July 2020 found that adaptation funding was falling far short of promises, and that climate-vulnerable countries were not receiving preferential treatment from donors.</p><p>Balasubramanya believes that the millions who saw their homes destroyed and livelihoods damaged during 2020's historic floods is a wake-up call to the global community to do something now to quickly scale and fund flood resilience.</p><p>\"A disproportionate share of money, including public and private financing, has gone to the infrastructure side,\" Balasubramanya said. She said she would like to see the process for low-income countries to access development aid for flood risk prevention to be made much simpler and faster. Flexibility is also key.</p><p>\"The development of human capacity is going to require significant investments in increasing the capacities and capabilities of local populations to participate in things like early warning systems, climate-smart agriculture, and restoring wetlands.\"</p><p>Visit the resilientfutures.devex.com series for more coverage on the practical ways cities can build resilience and reduce disaster impact.

The waterlogged urban space was a result of extreme weather but also the rapid loss of a vital natural asset to the metropolitan region - wetlands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past, these wetlands were thought of as wastelands, hot spots for disease, ideal locations for infilling and urban development. That changed when a World Bank study, in collaboration with the Sri Lankan government, revealed that restoring and rehabilitating current wetlands could enable ponds and basins to absorb up to 40% of the water during some flood events. It was then that Colombo made it a goal to conserve its urban and peri-urban wetlands. There is now increasing recognition that the wetlands of Colombo provide not just important disaster risk-reducing functions but a range of other services that support peoples' livelihoods and wellbeing.</p><p>To conserve the vital green infrastructure, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation  and  Development Corporation's Wetland Management Division developed the Wetland Management Strategy (WMS) in 2016.Now, with the help of the Sri Lanka-based International Water Management Institute (IWMI), who have been conducting wetland research in South Asia and Africa for years,Colombo has been honoured as one of the first 18 sites awarded the Ramsar Wetland City Accreditation.

Adopting a strategy like this requires continued capacity building. Colombo will need to maintain its training of staff on wetland values,as well as identifying, empowering and securing local communities' benefits from wetlands.</p><p>Third, Colombo's new status brings an opportunity for greater international exposure.

Our team from the World Bank was accompanying Sri Lankan officers visiting New Orleans in October 2019, to learn from the city's post-Hurricane Katrina flood risk-management efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We could see what the family must have seen after the flood waters receded-broken furniture, a piano, paintings, and toys including a stuffed teddy bear. We could almost feel the chaos and grief that must have followed after the floodwalls failed, releasing thousands of cubic yards of sand and millions of gallons of water at the breach site of London Avenue Canal Floodwall.</p><p>On 29 August 2005, three major levees broke, flooding 80% of the city. Hurricane Katrina caused 1,500 deaths, damaged 135,000 houses, and brought $150 billion in financial impacts. The city's population fell by half in the immediate aftermath of the storm.</p><p>Lessons for Sri Lanka?</p><p>Half of New Orleans lies below sea level and the City of New Orleans is continuing to sink, making it more vulnerable to storms. What lessons can this highly flood prone city offer to Sri Lanka?</p><p>Sri Lanka, with its large coastline, is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts. Under a worst case scenario, GDP could decline by 7.7%, and 90% of the country's population could be at medium to high risk of climate impacts by 2050.</p><p>The Sri Lankan Government is rightly giving a very high priority to improvements in climate and disaster resilience. The country has initiated many innovative projects. The recently approved Climate Resilience Multi-Phase Programmatic Approach Project aims at improving flood warning and response, and risk reduction measures in key river basins of Sri Lanka. The new project successfully builds on the Climate Resilience Improvement Project and many past initiatives.</p><p>With heavy ongoing investments in climate resilience and flood risk management, now is the critical time for Sri Lanka to build an effective flood- and climate-resilience system, benefitting from global experiences.</p><p>The study tour highlighted three key lessons for Sri Lanka.</p><p>1. Assess the risk of failure of planned flood mitigation measures and minimise any negative impacts</p><p>Critical floodwalls failed during Hurricane Katrina due to several unexpected consequences of a flood protection strategy that relied heavily on floodwalls and pumps. The approach provided a false sense of security to citizens, who stopped individual risk mitigation measures (such as raising houses on stilts), thereby aggravating flood impacts in 2005.</p><p>Post Hurricane Katrina New Orleans has focused on reducing flood risk rather than providing absolute flood protection. This includes rebuilding levees and major flood gates to withstand extreme events with improved engineering designs (extended foundation and proper anchorage in ground) to minimise potential damages in case of failure or overtopping.</p><p>2. Develop an inclusive and effective flood preparedness system, keeping citizens in charge</p><p>During Hurricane Katrina, many citizens living in flood-affected areas of New Orleans could not be evacuated on time. Understanding the critical importance of flood preparedness, the city of New Orleans has developed a timeline-based disaster response and evacuation plan that includes improved planning and evacuation of high-risk citizens during emergency.</p><p>This includes improving capacity to evacuate the city's high-risk population on short notice, massive community awareness campaigns-such as NOLA Ready - and training of volunteers. Innovative programs are in place for special needs citizens to ensure that they are alerted and evacuated in times of emergency.</p><p>A major focus is on communicating flood risk to individual homeowners so that they can make more informed decisions about retrofitting their homes. NOLA Ready's website has a dedicated webpage which provides homeowners with details of flood risk in their property, suggestions to improve flood resilience, and available resources.</p><p>3. Consider green infrastructure</p><p>Post Hurricane Katrina New Orleans is gradually starting to invest in the development of green areas that can absorb excess storm water to reduce flood impacts and help recharge ground water. Green infrastructure or Nature Based Systems not only support drainage (gray) infrastructure but can also potentially reduce flood risk in a cost effective way. Research is currently ongoing in New Orleans on measures to reduce impacts from mosquitoes and other water borne diseases in planned green areas.</p><p>No time left for poor decisions</p><p>As we left New Orleans, we couldn't help thinking about the Flooded House Museum, which has been preserved to remind people about the fatal impacts from Hurricane Katrina. The city seemed to have learned many lessons from the bitter experience, and has improved planning, engineering design, coordination, and public awareness on flood risk management.</p><p>The study tour to New Orleans offered a great opportunity for the Sri Lankan delegation to learn from post Hurricane Katrina efforts. Eng.

On top of it, millions of saplings have been planted, although with an extremely low success rate, over the past several years to mark the birthdays of political leaders of the ruling party. The environmental situation in the country is, however, deteriorating day by day, with environmental issues assuming alarming proportions. Burgeoning population, migration from rural to urban areas, unscientific and irrational urbanisation, uncoordinated and ad hoc industrial growth and poor waste management along with poor implementation of environmental policies have, among others, contributed to the above situation.</p><p>Against this backdrop, it seems fitting that a 'blue-green budget' was recently presented for 2018. Under the circumstances, it is apposite to look at new concepts, strategies and emerging trends in infrastructure development in other countries to promote green cities and green growth, striking a balance between economic development and environment.</p><p>Cities and towns as a major source of environmental pollution and ecological footprint</p><p>Cities, which occupy only 3% of the Earth's land surface, accommodate half the human population, use 75% of the resources, and account for 70% of the CO2 emissions, contributing to an enormous carbon footprint (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cepal.org/en\">https://www.cepal.org/en</url>/ /37700-are-we-building-competitive-and-liveable-cities). Migration from rural to urban areas and urbanisation occur unabated adding to the ecological footprint, exerting unmanageable pressure on the planet.</p><p>Therefore it is a formidable challenge to provide essential services and amenities to a rapidly expanding urban population and maintain habitability and competitiveness of local cities in a globalised environment while minimising the ecological footprint. City infrastructure has a profound effect on environmental health, habitability and competitiveness of cities. Because of the long lifespan and heavy capital outlay involved, it is of utmost importance to correctly and smartly plan, design and build infrastructure, taking into account environmental sustainability, competitiveness and quality of life.</p><p>Global trends and developments in urban planning and development</p><p>Eco-efficiency is an important parameter used widely in infrastructure development. It is a management philosophy that seeks to develop synergy between economy and environment thereby reducing the use of resources such as land, water, energy and raw materials and generation of waste and pollution. It will thus maximise return on investment and promote green growth and green economy. Stated differently, eco-efficiency aims at maximising environmental sustainability, competitiveness and quality of life. This concept is being vigorously pursued in many cities of Europe, North America and Asia, especially Japan, Singapore and Malaysia, to establish eco-efficient and socially inclusive infrastructure with a view to building clean, green, healthy and smart cities.</p><p>People rarely think of forests, wetlands, groves, grasslands, water ways, ponds, coral reefs, and other natural ecosystems as forms of infrastructure. But, they are. Forests, for instance, prevent silt and pollutants from entering streams that provide freshwater to downstream cities and enterprises, and act as a natural water filtration system. Thus they are a form of 'green infrastructure' that can serve the same purpose as 'grey infrastructure' the human-engineered solution that often involves concrete, bitumen and steel.</p><p>Green infrastructure has been successfully used to improve the habitability and environmental sustainability of many cities in the world. Restoration of mangroves rather than building dikes to protect shorelines from storm damage in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, upstream landscape conservation and restoration as an alternative to conventional water treatment technologies in Bogota, Columbia, and conserving and fostering mangroves, dunes and coral reefs in the Andaman Islands instead of building a sea wall are to name, but a few.</p><p>Another noteworthy feature of green infrastructure is that it is often far less costly than grey infrastructure. For instance, New York City evaluated two schemes to manage its storm water flow, one a green infrastructure comprising stream buffer restoration, green roofs, bio-swales and landscape elements designed to remove silt and pollution from surface run off, and the other a grey infrastructure comprising tunnels and storm drains. Adopting the former helped to cut cost by more than $1.5 billion, but with comparable outcome.</p><p>Another emerging concept regarding infrastructure in urban areas is Blue Green Cities. Here water resources and green space are integrated for improved environmental health, quality of life and sustainability by combining and protecting hydrological and ecological functions and the values of urban landscape. That will enhance the evaporative cooling effect from a matrix of green corridors, street trees, green or living roofs and walls and water bodies. It will also improve hydrological performance through high evaporation, high infiltration and low surface run-off. All of these benefits are of prime importance.</p><p>Urban planning and development in Sri Lanka</p><p>While many countries in the world are responding to change by building liveable, competitive and sustainable green cities based on eco-efficient and socially inclusive infrastructure, we seem to be clinging on to grey infrastructure. A look at the infrastructure landscape including new constructions in many towns in our country will show that it predominantly constitutes grey infrastructure built of concrete, mortar, bitumen and steel along with impervious paving of gardens, paths and premises devoid of open areas and green spaces. Such infrastructure, in the name of 'development' and urbanisation, is progressively eating into the remaining limited green spaces of towns, adding to environmental issues and climate change. The highly contagious fashion and passion to pave indiscriminately roadsides, footpaths, jogging tracks, gardens, premises of offices and business establishments has taken grip of our country.</p><p>Recently I painfully observed how a long and wide stretch of green space on the coast of Weligama was replaced with impervious pavers, an environmental disaster. Impervious concrete and asphalt areas are rampant in the infrastructure landscape of our country. For instance, the Kotuwegoda Beach Park is practically the only resort for leisure, relaxation, recreation and social interaction at Matara; however, over 35% of its area is covered by impervious concrete and asphalt particularly for purpose of parking buses as well as heavy vehicles.</p><p>A survey by Dr. Chaminda Kumara and his team of the University of Ruhuna revealed that the visitors to the park disliked the concrete and asphalt covered areas as they were inhospitable, particularly during the day and desired more green space in the park. Studies by Dr. Sunanda Kodikara and his team of the same University found that, at noon, the ambient temperature over concrete paved areas was about 3-5\u00b0C higher than that over grass cover. Besides, such impervious cover seal off the soil preventing infiltration of rainwater and recharge of groundwater aquifers and increasing run-off to overstretch drains and sewers and thereby contribute to flash floods.</p><p>For this reason, prior permission from the relevant authorities is mandatory in some countries for paving land with impermeable material. For instance, in the UK prior permission from the relevant authority is necessary even in private property if the area to be paved exceeds 5 m2. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paving.org/index.php/planning-permission-for-paving-a-garden/\">https://www.paving.org/index.php/planning-permission-for-paving-a-garden/</url>). Why do we not adopt such practices as appropriate to curtail the menacing growth of paved areas which contribute to flash floods, poor recharge of ground water aquifers and rise in ambient temperature?</p><p>Sri Lanka being an island nation, the recharge of groundwater aquifers is of prime importance, particularly in coastal areas, to minimise the intrusion of salt water. This matter should receive utmost attention in the light of rising sea level and lowering water table owing to unplanned, ad hoc and uncoordinated infrastructure development including impervious paving, over-extraction of ground water, unsustainable land use practices, etc. As evident from Fig. 1, saltwater intrusion occurs naturally to some degree in most coastal aquifers, owing to the hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater. Since saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher hydraulic head (liquid pressure exerted by a water column). As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater. This process has been held in check because of the greater height of fresh water columns than the sea water column. However, with the rise of sea level and the drop of the water table due to the said reasons, the equilibrium will be lost; consequently more sea water will diffuse into fresh water causing contamination of ground water aquifers thereby posing a serious threat to drinking water.</p><p>Therefore the subject of intrusion of sea water and its implications has assumed paramount importance, particularly in the island nations. Dr. Gregory De Costa, Senior Lecturer, Department of Civil Engineering at Unitech, New Zealand has done extensive research on this subject highlighting the consequences of intrusion of sea water on fresh water supplies in coastal areas where nearly half of the world population lives (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.unitec.ac.nz/about-us/rising-sea-levels-gregory-de-costa\">http://www.unitec.ac.nz/about-us/rising-sea-levels-gregory-de-costa</url>).</p><p>Translating scientific knowledge to design principles in Sri Lanka</p><p>There is growing awareness in cities throughout the world that green and blue infrastructure can offer a wide range of ecosystem services to support a healthy urban environment. For example, landscape architects explore possibilities in their design of the urban landscape to use the potential of green and blue elements for regulating air temperature, air quality, water storage and drainage, and noise reduction. Our politicians and officials travel abroad frequently to attend UN sessions and international conferences related to environmental management, urban planning and development and climate change, and to study modern eco-cities. Yet, hardly any concerted and concentrated effort is being made in our country to derive the potential benefits of green and blue infrastructure. Hence there is a crying need for translation of scientific knowledge on the functionality of green and blue infrastructure into design principles and to integrate these principles into the design of multifunctional green and blue infrastructure.</p><p>The quotation 'Politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians' is attributed to Charles de Gaulle. Likewise, coastal zone management is too serious a matter to be left to a few institutions because about half of the population and half of the GDP of the country come from the coastal areas since economic activities such as manufacturing, trade, tourism, banking, insurance, fisheries, port and shipping are concentrated in this region. Besides, this region is very important from environmental, social and cultural points of view as well.</p><p>Therefore a holistic approach is necessary for coastal zone management including infrastructure development in this area because of its far-reaching implications for ground water recharge and sea water intrusion affecting the supply of drinking water among other things. Mega projects already under way and proposed projects will make an unprecedentedly heavy demand on fresh water resources, and the success of the projects is highly contingent upon availability of quality fresh water in adequate quantity. This is a formidable challenge that has received scant attention. There is little time to waste and delay could prove to be disastrous. Therefore all relevant institutions such as the Coast Conservation Department, Central Environment Authority, Urban Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, and local government institutions as well as the academia should join forces and work in concert to plan, design and build infrastructure with the right blend of grey, green and blue for environmental sustainability, habitability and quality of life, leaving no room for unplanned and uncoordinated physical growth for protecting and fostering the precious ground water aquifers in the country.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["But, they are.

Bambaradeniya, 2006), wetlands are the habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated floral and faunal communities. The Ramsar convention further elaborated the term as \"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.\"</p><p>Wetlands of Sri Lanka can be divided into three broad categories as inland natural fresh water wetlands (e.g. rivers, stream, marshes, swamp forests and villus), marine and salt-water wetlands (e.g. lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds, and coral reefs) and man-made wetlands (e.g. tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns).</p><p>Wetlands provide numerous services</p><p>Wetlands comprise of a combination of water, soils, flora and fauna and the interaction between the elements allow this green infrastructure to perform several functions that are beneficial to humankind as well as the environment. The combination of these functions, together with the rich bio-diversity and cultural heritage of wetlands makes these ecosystems invaluable to people all over the world. The services that a wetland provides can be classified into four broad groups including provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services.</p><p>See table 2</p><p>\"This green infrastructure plays vital hydrological regulating functions such as surface water holding, groundwater recharge, flow regulation, flood mitigation and water-quality control. Due to their importance in the hydrological cycle the wetlands are considered as a key component in strategies for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).\"</p><p>(M. M. Cartney, L. Rebelo, S. S. Sellamuttu, S. D. Silva, 2010)</p><p>Does these wetlands are vulnerable?</p><p>Whatsoever the wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that change over time as a consequence of natural phenomena such as soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding. However, human activities, both within the wetland or in the catchment can influence these natural processes and accelerate the rate of change, threatening the wetland's sustainability and even the existence. Kotagama S.W. summerised the threats to wetlands in Sri Lanka under four major categories; habitat deterioration/degradation, direct loss/exploitation of species, spread of invasive alien species and natural phenomena. Farming in the river basins and upstream combined with heavy usage of agrochemicals are major threats to both fresh water and man-made wetlands. The seeped and percolated chemicals are often responsible for the degradation of water quality in the downstream as well as deteriorate the wetland habitats. Soil erosion due to unprotected upstream agricultural practices enhances the sedimentation is seen as a potential threat that will increase with the intensification of agriculture.</p><p>Coastal erosion on the other hand is another problem, which is brought about by altered currents and sediment loads, and can also be caused by coastal land uses such as unauthorized constructions. Reclamation for urban development, solid waste/garbage disposal and sand mining contributes to alter the structure of the wetland. Wetland habitat deterioration can be occurred due to clearing vegetation especially in the coastal belt and unauthorized and untreated sewage dumping to urban wetlands. The unplanned irrigation structures, regulation of water flow through large water infrastructure i.e. dams and mini hydro resulted in degradation of the quality of wetlands.</p><p>Wetland dependent communities rely on them for their income generation as well as living. Overexploitation of associated fauna and flora by these communities resulted in risking the extinction of several species. The most visible example is fisheries and water birds that are being poached for consumption, while less visible but important changes may also take place in the micro faunal communities that support the ecology of the system and the food chain. Tourism as well as freshwater recreation and trade of ornamental plants and species polluted the eco-system, which leads to the loss of native species in the wetlands.</p><p>The introduced exotic aquatic animal and plant species can be eventually escaped into wild habitats can create serious threat to native aquatic biodiversity. The ornamental fish trade mostly established around water bodies has become the sole contributor to introducing invasive alien aquatic species in Sri Lanka. The most prominent examples that can be seen in local wetlands are these four species of fauna (Tilapia - Oreochromis mossambicus, Walking catfish - Clarias batrachus, Rainbow Trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss and Mosquito fish - Gambusia affinis) and two species of flora (Water Hyacinth - Eichhornia crassipes and Giant Mimosa - Mimosa pigra) that are also included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. (100 of the World's worst invasive alien species, 2004). The spreading of alien invasive species can lead to direct exploitation of native species as it creates a competition for limited resources. The agricultural pests/weeds can also be threatened through this while deteriorating the quality of the wetlands.</p><p>\"Despite all the services they provide wetlands worldwide continuously threatened in different forms by human activities, and Sri Lanka is no exception. Reclamation and clearing for urban expansion, unsustainable solid waste disposal from domestic and industrial sources and the release of industrial, domestic and commercial waste have greatly diminished the health of the wetland ecosystem. Recent increases in flood damages and declining of aquatic biodiversity are, in part, the results of wetlands degradation and destruction. In this context, conservation of our natural heritage is the duty of any responsible citizen\", stated Prof Deepthi Wickramasinghe, Head/Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences, University of Colombo. Wetlands are also threatened by natural phenomena which is also common in Sri Lanka.

Kotagama, C.N.B. Bambaradeniya, 2006), wetlands are habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated floral and faunal communities. The Ramsar Convention further elaborated the term as \"areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.\"</p><p>Wetlands of Sri Lanka can be divided into three broad categories as inland natural fresh water wetlands (e.g. rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and villus), marine and salt-water wetlands (e.g. lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds and coral reefs) and man-made wetlands (e.g. tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns).</p><p>WETLANDS PROVIDE NUMEROUS SERVICES</p><p>Wetlands comprise of a combination of water, soils, flora and fauna and the interaction between elements allow this green infrastructure to perform several functions that are beneficial to humankind as well as the environment.

The services a wetland provides can be classified into four broad groups including provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services.</p><p>SERVICES - COMMENTS AND EXAMPLES</p><p>Provisioning; Food, fresh water, fibres and fuel, biochemical, genetic material</p><p>Regulating; Climate regulation, water regulation (hydrological flows), water purification and waste treatment, erosion regulation, natural hazard regulation, pollination</p><p>Cultural; Spiritual and inspirational ecosystems, recreational, aesthetic and educational</p><p>Supporting; Soil formation, nutrient cycling and biodiversity</p><p>Sediment retention and accumulation of organic matter</p><p>\"This green infrastructure plays vital hydrological regulating functions such as surface water holding, groundwater recharge, flow regulation, flood mitigation and water-quality control.

Sellamuttu, S.D. Silva, 2010).</p><p>ARE WETLANDS VULNERABLE?</p><p>Whatsoever the wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that change over time as a consequence of natural phenomena such as soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding. However, human activities, both within the wetland or in the catchment can influence these natural processes and accelerate the rate of change, threatening the wetland's sustainability and even the existence. Kotagama S.W. summerised the threats to wetlands in Sri Lanka under four major categories; habitat deterioration/degradation, direct loss/exploitation of species, spread of invasive alien species and natural phenomena. Farming in the river basins and upstream combined with heavy usage of agrochemicals are major threats to both fresh water and manmade wetlands.</p><p>The seeped and percolated chemicals are often responsible for the degradation of water quality in the downstream as well as deteriorate the wetland habitats. Soil erosion due to unprotected upstream agricultural practices which enhances the sedimentation is seen as a potential threat that will increase with the intensi?cation of agriculture.</p><p>Coastal erosion on the other hand is another problem, which is brought about by altered currents and sediment loads, and can also be caused by coastal land uses such as unauthorised constructions. Reclamation for urban development, solid waste/garbage disposal and sand mining contributes to alter the structure of the wetland. Wetland habitat deterioration can be occurred due to clearing vegetation especially in the coastal belt and unauthorised and untreated sewage dumping to urban wetlands.

A successful agreement should curb, over the long-term, average global surface warming at a maximum of 2 \u00c2\u00b0C, compared to the pre-industrial level. Along this ultimate objective, the financing of greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the so-called green finance, will be part of the discussions. df</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At first sight, a green finance could be interpreted as contradictory, as for many finance goes hand in hand with excessive greed, economies in dire straits and little interest in environmental considerations. Yet this growing brand of finance basically encompasses all financial instruments fostering the transition towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we will see, every finance stakeholder, from governments to private investors, has actually a high potential of transformative impact to take-up the challenge of fighting global climate change.</p><p>A world economy starving for green infrastructure</p><p>Putting aside the recent slowdown of economic growth in China and the expected US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike, the world economy stands at a critical juncture.</p><p>First, the world is starving for investments in infrastructure. Obsolete infrastructure in developed countries and lack of suitable ones in developing countries, enabling them to accommodate structural changes, are reckoned to be costly in terms of growth. Those investments play indeed a key role in increasing the potential economic growth by spurring productivity gains among other things. They include energy production and distribution, water-supply, transport, airports and every tangible assets easing the access to markets for consumers and producers.</p><p>Meanwhile, as pointed out by the Fifth Assessment Report1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history with widespread impacts on human and natural systems. Importantly, the IPCC warns that a rise of average global surface temperature superior to 2\u00c2\u00b0C will be detrimental to any hopes of a fairer global economic development due to the harsher effects of climate change on developing countries.</p><p>According to IPCC, reaching carbon neutrality by 2100 is a sine qua non condition to stabilise the global warming at the 2\u00c2\u00b0C trigger. We must emphasise that this neutrality does not imply zero carbon emissions rather making the natural absorption of all the carbon released because of human activities possible. Before the industrial revolution, natural carbon sinks, such as oceans, forests, soils and vegetation, have actually contributed to a next to carbon neutral world. As a consequence, every member of the international community should now factor in carbon-neutrality, adaptation and resilience in its decisions of new investment into infrastructure.</p><p>Public finance has definitely to pave the road</p><p>As evidenced by many surveys conducted by IMF or top consultancies, the world needs to mobilise billions of dollars every single year to fund the urgently needed green infrastructure. Unquestionably, part of these funds have to come from the public sector as it has to chart the way ahead. This is why, along the negotiations on the legally binding agreement, the countries' official delegates are expected to find a way to jointly commit $ 100 billion dollars a year by 2020 to combat climate change.</p><p>The Green Climate Fund (GCF), established in 2009 in Copenhagen along the COP15, is to be the main channel for a public green finance. This fund has been designed to promote a paradigm shift in the global economic development by financially supporting countries in their efforts to mitigate greenhouse emissions and their need for adaptation to climate change.</p><p>The contributions consist of grants, capital and loans sourced from developed and developing countries. Provided with these funds, the GCF will target game-changer investments that have a huge impact on greenhouse emissions reduction and are likely to catalyse further investments by reducing entry costs and creating new investment opportunities.</p><p>In this regard, the GCF will provide mainly developing countries with financing in the form of grants and subsidised lending. The access to funds will be available for international and national entities accredited by the GCF's Board.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, the Sri-Lankan Carbon Fund is likely to be the recipient of these funds. Besides the investment dimension, the fund will financially accompany willing countries in the design of their national policies and sectorial strategies intended to cope with the climate issue.</p><p>BUP_DFT_DFT-15-7</p><p>Public money could be too short</p><p>So far, both developed and developing countries had only pledged funds amounting to $ 10 b. This is obviously nowhere near to the ambitious target of $ 100 b a year. In fact, too many governments across the world are cash-strapped because of large fiscal deficit and huge piles of debt to be paid off. The latter reaches on average 100 % of GDP in the OECD, a group of mostly rich countries.</p><p>Public finances in tatters could impair the ability of states to easily honour such a promise. Though, a gradual end to the inefficient and socially costly fossil energy subventions in too many countries would clearly give leeway to switch money into green infrastructures.</p><p>In a recent compelling study2, IMF researchers found out that these subventions cost $ 5, 300 b worldwide and a significant sum of $ 2.6 b in Sri Lanka, almost half of the current public investment in the country. But even if public money has a leading role to finance the transition towards a carbon neutral economy it cannot be the only answer.</p><p>No more banking as usual6</p><p>In a world of still prominent banking intermediation, banks should adapt their business model to the climate change by reorienting their funding towards low-carbon projects or stopping the financing of polluting projects.</p><p>Lately, Credit-Agricole, a global French bank, committed to curb financing new coal thermal powers in the high income countries. Some other big US and UK global banks are already under scrutiny by environmentally minded shareholders who want to see them disclosing more about their lending to firms that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, at least four of these leading banks have seen their shareholders filing nonbinding resolution to commit them to such disclosures.</p><p>Moreover, they are also pushing the banks to take measures aiming at addressing climate change. Though, banks could have reduced margin of actions to finance the economic transition as they have to maintain high regulatory capital ratio under Basel III regulationwork for carbon emissions trading should definitely be contingent on any legally binding agreement signed in Paris to make the world a better place to live in.</p><p>(The writer is the Deputy Economic Counsellor at the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

The Ramsar convention explains the term as \"areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.\"</p><p>Wetlands of Sri Lanka can be divided into three broad categories as inland natural fresh water wetlands (rivers, stream, marshes, swamp forests and villus), marine and salt-water wetlands (lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds and coral reefs) and man-made wetlands (tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns).</p><p>Rich bio-diversity</p><p>Wetlands comprise a combination of water, soils, flora and fauna. The interaction of the elements helps the green infrastructure to perform several functions that are beneficial to humankind and the environment. The combination of these functions, together with the rich bio-diversity and cultural heritage of wetlands makes these ecosystems invaluable to people all over the world.</p><p>The services, that a wetland provides, can be classified into four groups: provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services.</p><p>Wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that change over time as a consequence of natural phenomena, such as soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding. However, human activities, both within the wetland or in the catchment area can influence these natural processes and accelerate the rate of change, threatening the wetland's sustainability.</p><p>Professor of Ornithology S.W. Kotagama summarised the threats to wetlands in Sri Lanka under four major categories; habitat deterioration and degradation, direct loss and exploitation of species, spread of invasive alien species and natural phenomena.</p><p>Farming in river basins and upstream combined with heavy usage of agrochemicals are major threats to fresh water and man-made wetlands. Seeped and percolated chemicals are often responsible for the degradation of water quality in the downstream and deterioration of wetland habitats.</p><p>Soil erosion due to unprotected upstream agricultural practices aggravates sedimentation which is seen as a potential threat that will increase with the intensi?cation of agriculture.</p><p>Coastal erosion on the other hand is another problem, which is brought about by altered currents and sediment loads, and can also be caused by coastal land uses, such as unauthorised constructions. Reclamation for urban development, solid waste and garbage disposal and sand mining contribute to alter the structure of the wetland.</p><p>Wetland habitat can deteriorate due to clearing vegetation, especially, in the coastal belt and unauthorised and untreated sewage dumping in urban wetlands. Unplanned irrigation structures, regulation of water flow through large water infrastructure i.e. dams and mini-hydro power projects result in degradation of the quality of wetlands.</p><p>Wetland dependent communities rely on them for their income generation and living. Overexploitation of associated fauna and ?ora by these communities result in risking the extinction of endangered species. The most visible example is ?sheries, and water birds that are being poached for consumption, while less visible, but important changes may also take place in the micro faunal communities that support the ecology of the system and the food chain. Tourism and freshwater recreation and trade of ornamental plants and species pollute the ecosystem, which leads to the loss of native species in the wetlands.</p><p>Introduced exotic aquatic animal and plant species can eventually escape into wild habitats, and can create serious threats to native aquatic biodiversity. The ornamental fish trade mostly established around water bodies has become the sole contributor to introducing invasive alien aquatic species in Sri Lanka. The most prominent examples that can be seen in local wetlands are these four species of fauna (Tilapia - Oreochromis mossambicus, Walking catfish - Clarias batrachus, Rainbow Trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss and Mosquito fish - Gambusia affinis) and two species of flora (Water Hyacinth - Eichhornia crassipes and Giant Mimosa - Mimosa pigra) that are also included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species.</p><p>The spreading of alien invasive species can lead to the exploitation of native species as it creates a competition for limited resources. Agricultural pests and weeds can also be threatened by this while deteriorating the quality of the wetlands.</p><p>Colombo University Zoology and Environment Sciences Department Head Prof. Deepthi Wickramasinghe said, \"Despite all the services, wetlands worldwide are threatened by human activities, and Sri Lanka is no exception. Reclamation and clearing for urban expansion, unsustainable solid waste disposal from domestic and industrial sources and the release of industrial, domestic and commercial waste have deteriorated the health of the wetland ecosystem. Increase in floods and declining aquatic biodiversity are, in part, the results of wetlands degradation and destruction. The conservation of our natural heritage is the duty of any responsible citizen.\"</p><p>Wetlands are also threatened by natural phenomena common in Sri Lanka. For instance, the prolonged dry conditions in the dry zone results drying off of tanks, streams, salt marshes and lagoons, causing death to species of flora and fauna. The rise of sea water temperature due to climate change bleaches the coral reefs, especially, in the southwestern part of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Prohibitory order</p><p>The vigilance for wetland conservation reached high in Sri Lanka with high intensity and frequent flash floods in the past few years. The Cabinet on August 21, 2018 on a proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister, decided to; to impose a prohibitory order preventing all types of land reclamation and constructions in the Colombo Metropolitan Region for any other purpose other than the constructions necessary to be done which are of national importance and the constructions identified under the Transit Railway Line Network, and to direct the Director General of Wildlife to declare the wetlands, other than the areas recognised adjacent to Kimbulaela and Diyawanna oya in which the development activities have been initiated, as protected areas.</p><p>Sri Lanka rati?ed the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1990 and established a National Wetland Steering Committee (NWSC) while the Committee was reconstituted in 2003 to integrate plans for wetland areas and to coordinate development and conservation activities.</p><p>This resulted in the formal adoption of a National Wetland Policy under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in 2004.</p><p>Giant step</p><p>Since 1897 with the broadcasting of \"protect the coastal belt systems\", Sri Lanka has taken steps towards conserving its wetlands. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937 can be considered as another giant step. Using this legislation, wetlands of importance to birds have been declared as sanctuaries and other protected areas by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. The setting up of a Wetland Steering Committee, hosting international workshops on wetlands and declaring six Ramsar wetland sites (Bundala, Anaiwilundawa, Maduganga, Venkali Santuary, Kumana Wetland Cluster and Wilpattu Wetland showed the country's willingness to protect these valuable water bodies.</p><p>The Government, non-government organisations, research organisations, academia and the cooperate sector are involved in wetland conservation and management related activities in the country.</p><p>Wetland management</p><p>Every one has a role to play in sustainable wetlands management - to ensure the wetland dependent communities continue to obtain the benefits that wetlands provide for reducing poverty and to ensure balanced ecosystems.</p><p>Wetland policies need to better reflect the realities of wetland agriculture - the dilemma remains how to maximise the benefits of agriculture while simultaneously minimising the adverse impacts on other valuable ecosystem services.

Trump has an intuitive sense that hegemons do not rule forever in the capitalist system. The US's transition from a multilateral system in which it exercised its power through control of global institutions, to a go-it-alone attitude that involves negotiating bilateral agreements, is an expression of systemic breakdown.</p><p>The US binged on debt and bought its wares from China, powering the workshop of the world. When it ran into trouble during the Great Recession, as historian Adam Tooze points out, the global economy depended on Chinese stimulus. The relationship between the power blocs, however, is under pressure.</p><p>Deglobalisation reconfigures supply chains. New trends in automation and technology make reshoring a possibility. The world races to find alternative energy sources in the face of climate crisis. In the meantime, new conflicts engendered by climate change compound the centuries-long process of underdevelopment that imperialism has imposed on poor countries. This results in many people migrating to rich countries, seeking a better life.</p><p>Social bases of proto-fascist ideology</p><p>The xenophobic response in Western countries, rooted in settler colonial ideology, is reinforced by the post-9/11 framing of terrorism as a 'Muslim problem'. Strengthening Fortress Europe and the chant to 'build the wall' are ways in which right-wing demagogues capitalise on people's frustration with a system that has not benefited the many. Wages have stagnated over decades while the rich got richer.</p><p>Moreover, the establishment is viewed as a bulwark of liberal multiculturalism. The new right-wing populists attack the public sector in favour of a vindictive capitalism that protects the investments of the few who have made it. They try to convince working class whites especially that they must exclude others to defend what they are in the process of losing.

It's clear from the Labour Party's responses in the UK and Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in the US that there are other ways of framing the masses' problems: from austerity linked to deep cuts to social welfare, to runaway inequality embodied by the super-rich. These political groups and campaigns have drawn attention to new proposals such as the Green Industrial Revolution and the Green New Deal, which would fund massive investment in public infrastructure. In addition, they propose taxing the richest one percent to fund universal services, such as health care and education.</p><p>The problem in Sri Lanka is that progressives often lack the same vision. Liberal civil society appeals to an international order that is quickly disappearing; one built in fact on brutal imperialist intervention masquerading as humanitarianism. For the parliamentary left, the aftermath of revolutionary defeat around the world has meant focusing on 'corruption,' attempting to win over politically ambivalent middle-class constituencies, and, in general, downplaying concerns about redistribution. Gotabaya, however, won't be defeated with paeans to civility or social initiatives that don't challenge market pressures on ordinary people's households.</p><p>Instead, he can be defeated only by a progressive movement that recognises the immediate dangers of a world undergoing profound transformation. This movement must speak to a wide constituency of people who have been dispossessed, exploited, ignored, and marginalised. Only then can we inspire voters to turn up at the polls. The current crop of right-wing demagogues realise that winning is as much about mobilising their own narrow section of the population as it is suppressing voters from other groups.

These industries located centrally in the coastal region account for nearly 43% of the country's GDP, making it a cogwheel that drives the national economy.</p><p>Sri Lanka experienced a deceleration in its real GDP growth in 2017, as the country's agricultural economy was struck by the then prevailing weather conditions. The Economist, in an article published in the same year, linked the country's economic downtrend partially to climate change, attributing it to floods, landslides and droughts the island struggled against.

At this meeting, the well known Environmentalist, Dr. Sarath Kotagama pointed out that our wetlands were rapidly shrinking due to human activities. Prior to that observation, it was my perception that the main cause for shrinking of wetlands had been due to deliberate filling and reclamation activities carried out by people and institutions. However, Dr. Kotagama's observation at the meeting, convinced me to accept the fact that soil erosion contributes much towards the natural shrinking of our wetlands. Every time I visited cities and suburbs, I could see many wetlands - both natural wetlands and abandoned paddy fields, being used as waste dumping yards by individuals, institutions and some local authorities as well. Those who are with vested interests, deliberately dump garbage into wetlands and carryout earth filling on top.</p><p>They subsequently block out these filled land and put it up for sale. Some valuable buildings like Hilton Hotel, Nawam Mawatha Buildings, Maligawatta Housing Complex in Colombo have been built on (filled-up) wetlands. Even the Blomendhal garbage mountain once had been an abandoned paddy field and a marshy wetland. The dumping of Colombo Municipal Council garbage at Blomendhal commenced in 1991, and the motive behind that exercise would have been to make that wetland saleable at a latter date. So, filling wetlands with garbage and its subsequent selling have been a lucrative business in Colombo and suburbs.</p><p>Sometime back, when I made a field visit to Bellanwila - Attidiya sanctuary to ascertain the new eco system development on a waste dump, the land owners of the sanctuary made representations and requested that they be allowed to fill their respective blocks to make them saleable. This area recorded in epics, written during the Kotte period, was a vast paddy field prior to and in the 1970s. However, due to various reasons these fields were abandoned and as a result, invasive plants like 'Wel Aththa' had found their way in to them and it started spreading like a cancer. Unfortunately, these valuable water retention areas and the bird sanctuaries are now gradually vanishing.</p><p>The wetlands are kidneys of eco systems. Environmental services provided by the wetlands are very important for the eco systems to survive. When it rains, wetlands act as water retention and filtration areas, raising the water table facilitating the people to tap fresh water. Variety of flora and fauna thrive in wetlands and therefore, they play a very important role in preserving biodiversity.</p><p>They also maintain food chains and these vast areas with vegetation, naturally purify the air by absorbing carbon and releasing oxygen. On the other hand they act as essential eco corridors for unsustainable cities that are coming up rapidly. So it is very important to have wetlands as open spaces and eco corridors as sustainable for eco cities, which need to be built in the future. Unfortunately, as the services rendered by wetlands to maintain the equilibrium of the eco system has not been properly identified, their market values are comparatively low. In order to get its market value enhanced, its owners opt to fill it for monitory gains. It is profitable for various institutions including local authorities to purchase low priced wetlands, reclaim and construct buildings or other infrastructure facilities on them. Having set up the Low Lying Areas Reclamation Board - a new arm of the then government, the former President Premadasa pioneered the process of filling and selling lowlands.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was so vociferous and took much pride in announcing that he was converting abandoned marshy land to mini cities like Maligawatta Flats and Nawam Mawatha Buildings, without realizing the fact that his exercise would lead to adverse imminent environmental problems. However, within a short period of time, the repercussions of that ill-advised exercise was experienced by its proponents and many others when several areas of Colombo and suburbs got inundated by floods.</p><p>It is important to note that present day cities are totally unsustainable.</p><p>Without fossil fuels we are unable to maintain sky scrapers, flyovers and fuel guzzling transportation etc., It is reported that the first commercial oil well was found by one DRAKE in 1859 and it is predicted that the last drop of oil in the last well will be exhausted by 2059. We are presently experiencing the much awaited oil peak, and if we look far ahead for the sake of our grand children, we have to look for ways and means of introducing new energies to sustain built environments. On the other hand burning of some fossil fuels cause heat pollution. Green House Gases with carbon cause solar radiation accumulation and it results in the rising of global mean temperature. Global warming and climate change would seriously threaten the mere existence of humanity. So, the depletion of oil resources and its destructive pollution effects would force us to choose a new paradigm or trajectory for sustainable development.</p><p>In order to achieve sustainable development, a new concept called Green Economy has been introduced. Green Economy is based on renewable energies and the built environment should essentially be Eco friendly and self sustainable. Generally Sri Lanka's priority for development is to enhance its infrastructure facilities like road network, electricity and transportation etc. The IMF, the World Bank and the other lending and partners of development aid should focus on this as their top priority.</p><p>But as per green economic policies, a new concept called Green Infrastructure has emerged. Multi faceted global crisis promoted this green new big deal and development of green infrastructure. One of its main themes is conservation and the restoration of low lands and wetlands.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the market based value system has failed to add the desired values to the ecosystem services rendered by wetlands or other similar systems. Therefore, the government or the public sector should intervene and introduce new schemes to protect and enhance value of the eco system services. Generally there are four accepted strategies for protection and enhancement of eco services.</p><p>(i) Direct intervention by the government by way of direct funding on restoration projects.</p><p>(ii) Introducing a fee or a tax on people or institutions which cause damage to ecosystem services. This restoration levy will compensate the damage done.</p><p>(iii) By subsidizing the private parties for the steps they take to conserve and enhance the ecosystem services. For example the government can pay the land owners to improve their private property which act as water retention or watershed areas.</p><p>(iv) Creating new markets by way of introducing trading systems. This is a widely accepted mechanism which provide a price on Ecosystem services.</p><p>Governments do this by allocating trading permits or property rights in ecosystem services and then allow other parties to purchase these permits or rights.</p><p>To get the best out of this trading system which could be applied to enhance the value of wetlands, we have to study its practical implementation. In 1995 the city of Eugine in Oregon, USA, established the wetland trading permit system to protect cities of wetlands. They knew very well that their wetlands provided valuable ecosystem services such as water filteration, flood control and species habitat.</p><p>A new law was introduced so that any private developer who wanted to build on existing wetland, had to agree to mitigate the impact by creating or protecting other wetlands. That means a developer who wanted to build on a wetland had to meet that requirement either by creating new wetlands or purchasing a wetland trading permit process by someone else.</p><p>The city of Eugine also established a Wetland Mitigation Bank. This Bank had a dual purpose where those who owned wetlands could store or deposit their certified wetland credit in that Bank and those who wanted to mitigate the damage caused by their building on wetlands could purchase those credits. That could produce new value to the wetland owners. On the other hand new green businesses enhancing green infrastructure by way of creating new wetlands could promote entrepreneurs and also it would discourage developers to build on wetlands in order to keep their mitigation cost low.</p><p>These four strategies should be introduced to protect wetlands in Sri Lanka as well. It is fortunate that The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation &amp; Development Corporation (LRDC) has now launched new projects with these objectives in mind. Presently our Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is in collaboration with The LRDC to explore the feasibility of implementing these strategies in Kelaniya, Mudunella wetlands, while preserving the flood control and water filteration capability of new developed land for the waste management systems of the area.</p><p>The market values of Muthurajawela, Aththidiya and various other lowlands could also be enhanced if we apply these new strategies. The public should be made aware of these strategies before unnecessary politically motivated petty protest campaigns are staged jeopardizing these valuable projects and proposals even before they are put into operation.</p><p>The writer is the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Published by HT Syndication with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Climate change could push more than 100 million people in developing countries below the poverty line by 2030.</p><p>But there is still time to protect and work with nature to build resilience and reduce climate risks at all scales, the report says encouragingly. It also strongly argues that investment in climate adaptation and resilience is cost effective and worthwhile in every possible way.</p><p>High Returns</p><p>As per the report, the overall rate of return on investments in improved resilience is high, with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 2:1 to 10:1, and in some cases even higher.</p><p>Specifically, the analysis finds that investing US$ 1.8 trillion globally in five areas from 2020 to 2030 could generate US$ 7.1 trillion in total net benefits.</p><p>The five areas the report considers needing investment are: early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dry land agriculture, mangrove protection, and investments in making water resources more resilient.</p><p>'Climate adaptation can also deliver a triple dividend. It avoids future losses, generates positive economic gains through innovation, and delivers additional social and environmental benefits,' the report says.</p><p>Social Stratification</p><p>The report says that the underlying inequalities in society must be taken note of and addressed in climate change adaptation programs. People most vulnerable to climate impacts must be involved in decision making, it urges.</p><p>Improved dry land crop production, mangrove protection, and water resources management have economic, social and environmental benefits. These benefits will be on-going and not static in time.</p><p>Accurate Assessment of Risk</p><p>The report says that risk assessment must be accurate so as to better spend resources and get the maximum benefit. There is a need to make risk visible, requiring more precise characterization of who and what is at risk-and why. As part of making risk visible, the public and private sectors can work together to more explicitly put a 'price' to risk in both economic and financial decision-making.</p><p>Equally important is to understand what works and what options to prioritize by supporting experiential learning, stimulating innovations in science and technology, sharing solutions, and piloting new business models and financial services.</p><p>Importantly, there should be no talking down to local people. ' It is important to consider all forms of knowledge, recognizing that valuable local knowledge rests with communities and indigenous populations,' the report said in a plea to be democratic and grassroots-oriented for attaining optimum results.</p><p>Paucity of Funds</p><p>Even though the imperative for action is clear, money is not flowing at the pace or scale needed, the report regrets. The government or the public sector is an essential provider of finance to protect people and livelihoods across communities and sectors. It is also an enabler of increased private sector finance through disclosure requirements and incentives, like buying down the risk of providing financial services to small-holder producers.</p><p>On its part, the private sector should increase investments on its own account, but it should also increasingly complement the public sector in sharing the costs and benefits of adaptation investments, such as for infrastructure, contingency finance, and insurance, the report suggests. Finally, there is a critical need for higher levels of international financial support for adaptation in developing countries.</p><p>Task Ahead</p><p>The tasks ahead are long and onerous given the dangers foreseen. The global demand for food will increase by 50% even as yields decline by up to 30% by 2050 in the absence of ambitious climate action. A more resilient food future will rely on sharp increases in agricultural R and D, which has demonstrated benefit-cost ratios between 2:1 and 17:1. There is a need for better alignment of government finance and incentives for farmers with long-term, sustainable, climate-smart production.</p><p>There needs to be a radical change in access to information, innovative technologies, and finance to enhance the resilience of 500 million small-scale farming households whose livelihoods are most critically impacted by climate change.</p><p>Nature-Based Solution</p><p>Nature-based solutions regulate water flows, protect shorelines, cool cities, and complement built infrastructure. Nature is rapidly being degraded. Large-scale protection and restoration of nature will require accelerating efforts to meet existing political commitments. These commitments are: implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity; appropriately valuing natural assets in land use and investment decisions; and increasing the scale of public and private resources to safeguard nature.</p><p>Many nature-based adaptation solutions are also beneficial for mitigation and can provide one-third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C.</p><p>Water</p><p>Climate change is integrally connected to water systems and resources. Successful adaptation will require scaled-up investments in healthy watersheds and water infrastructure, dramatic improvements in efficiency of water use. Without efficient water allocation and use, the GDPs of India, China and Central Asia would be lower by 7 to 12% by 2050.</p><p>Cities</p><p>Urban areas are home to more than half the global population and are centers of opportunity and innovation. Adaptation efforts, if designed well, can take advantage of this 'transformative energy' and generate high economic returns, the report suggests.</p><p>In coastal cities, for instance, the cost of good adaptation is one-tenth the cost of no action. To plan and deliver more resilient urban services, cities everywhere need to invest in better climate risk information and technical capacity, drawing on credible topographic and community-level data.</p><p>Cities should also invest in nature-based solutions to tackle water and heat risks, and in upgrading the living conditions of the 880 million people living in informal settlements that are highly vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>Ports, roads, power, sanitation, sewer, and communications systems are infrastructure assets at risk from climate change. 'Climate-proofing' existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure that is more climate resilient, make sound economic sense as on an average, the benefits outweigh costs by 4:1.</p><p>Investments in infrastructure need to directly build resilience, whether for storm-water drainage in cities or protecting coastal communities against sea-level rise. This will require developing blended public-private approaches that share the costs and benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure, the report says.</p><p>Need For Community Sense And Prior Warnings</p><p>Finally, the report urges people to go beyond protecting individual assets to ensuring that whole systems are more resilient by making the right choices about where and what to build, which existing assets to upgrade, prioritizing green infrastructure wherever possible, and ensuring that infrastructure continues to function even as damages occur.</p><p>'We need to proactively yet voluntarily move people and assets out of harm's way through better planning and investment decisions.

The bank's asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.</p><p>Brand 'BOC' has been able to overcome significant macro and micro environmental changes in the banking and financial industry to establish itself as a superior brand in the country. With the time tested vision as 'Bankers to the Nation', Brand BOC has delivered the best result for its true stakeholder, citizens and the Government of Sri Lanka.</p><p>BOC has earned the trust of Sri Lankans and proudly caters to over 12 million customers today. With its massive financial capacity and adaptable approach that comes with inherent commitment towards the country's social and economic development, BOC has enabled banking services successfully to a very diverse customer base from individuals to businesses and organizations of different geographic and economic strata.</p><p>BOC offers the flexibility and convenience of a whole gamut of banking services under one roof for everyone from newborn to senior citizen and micro entrepreneur to corporate business. In order to cater to this geographically diverse customer base, the bank has 625 branches spread over every nook and corner and owns the largest ATM/ CDM network in Sri Lanka with over 825 machines serving customers 24 hours, 365 days.</p><p>BOC was the first Sri Lankan bank to have marked its presence overseas with the opening of \"BOC London\" in 1949 at the epicenter of international banking at that time. Later BOC spread its foreign branch network to Chennai, Male and Seychelles. Apart from its own foreign branch network BOC maintains foreign correspondent banking network with over 860 foreign banks and exchange houses. \"The Bank's approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind the BOC brand's 77 year long success.</p><p>Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylon's motive was the same - to promote the social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services. A very recent example was the BOC's digital transformation that completely changed the bank's internal processes along with its customer interface and infused synergy to the whole Sri Lankan banking system.</p><p>\"Along with the benefits of digital transformation BOC was able to embark on green banking comprehensively for a sustainable growth together with the community,\" said BOC General Manager D.M.

It has affiliated hubs in other countries, connecting with London and each other to share trade and investment opportunities in the environmental goods and services sector for the benefit of the Commonwealth and of course our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thus far there exists established hubs in Canada, London, Wales, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa (in both Cape Town and Durban), the Seychelles.</p><p>The Sri Lanka hub will also cover the Maldives, and is operated by Motha Capital Investments [MCI], part of the GE Group. The MCI team leading this hub are Roshan Motha head of Motha Capital Investments (Private) Limited, Rohantha Athukoral, Head of National Portfolio Development of the United Nations office for Project Services (UNOP's) and Tanya Goonewardene, Attorney-at-law.</p><p>The focus of the hub is to link businesses, investors, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders not only in their national markets but also across Commonwealth member nations, and indeed other countries who wish to engage with the Commonwealth for trade and investment. The Hub exists to identify common interest and encouraging transfer of sustainable technologies within the Commonwealth, helping to address climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially in vulnerable countries, and promoting trade and investment in environmental businesses.</p><p>As an inaugural project, Motha Capital Investments (MCI) is presenting to the platform, an initiative by the Carbon Consultancy Company (Private) limited which is a project that has the required expertise to carry out a reforestation project that will establish a biodiversity corridor between the two large remnant rainforest patches in Sri Lanka following principles of analog forestry concepts. Through initiatives such as this they are able to advocate Carbon offsets which are credits for reductions in Green House Gas emissions made at another location.</p><p>Yet another reputed company which has been selected to be introduced on to the Platform is the renowned EnergySolve International (Private) Limited, which promotes the principles of sustainable development in areas including, but not limited to Green infrastructure development and LEED certification, energy saving and efficiency improvements, water saving and efficiency improvements, saving, monitoring and verification, renewable energy development, building energy simulations, artificial and day lighting simulations and energy auditing. To their credit are several World Bank initiatives relating to Energy Efficiency Improvements. It also includes the Brandix India Apparel City and Ken Park Group, jeans manufacturers.</p><p>Investors looking to derive return on investment through green initiatives can become members by registering with MCI, which will then make them privy to proposals of green initiatives across the platform. Similarly, enterprises that are looking for funding for a green initiative can meet with us and have their initiatives screened and upon initial assessment submit a proposal setting out the credentials of the transaction which will then be shared among the rest of the Commonwealth Hubs. We will represent the organization and according to its merits the potential investors will carry out their own due diligence of it.</p><p>The role as the Hub Operator is assisting the enterprise to make its case for funding through its business plan and introducing them to investors across the Commonwealth via the Platform.</p><p>The terms and conditions will be a matter of negotiation between the enterprise and the investor and funding depends entirely on interest of investors. The third group of members to which the Hub extends its invitation is professionals such as lawyers, accountants, lending institutions, auditors who have the required skill set and competence to facilitate these commercial transactions.</p><p>Alluding to the possible cost implications of membership it was decided by MCI has made a policy decision to admit investors, enterprises and professionals free of charge for the first 6 months since launch.

In addition to contributing to analysis, we must describe concretely the vision of society that we are fighting for, regardless of who wins. Having this perspective will shape our approach to future challenges under the rule of either of the two main contenders, Gotabaya Rajapaksa or Sajith Premadasa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the event of a Gotabaya victory, the immediate response will be to try and defend liberal democratic norms. Even if Sajith wins and the left buys itself more time to organise, however, the same crisis that created space for chauvinist forces will exist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, as we can see in Western countries, the neoliberal centrist establishment is hollowed out and incapable of effectively pushing back against authoritarian politics. This politics offers hospitable terrain for extremist actors such as the far right and even fascist forces.</p><p>Left populists in other countries have argued that reversing the authoritarian turn requires an expansive vision that breaks with the neoliberal order. Their argument makes visible the linkage between political and economic reform any successful movement must make, regardless of its ideology. If we look back in the case of Sri Lanka, for example, the UNP used the neoliberal Open Economy policy of 1977 to justify the establishment of the Executive Presidency to effectively implement its plan.</p><p>During the Presidential Election of 2015, the Rajapaksa clan became a concentrated target for popular anger toward the abuse of power. But the political agenda of diverse actors in opposition was vaguely defined. Many embraced anticorruption discourse and a narrow, legalistic definition of constitutional reform. A democratic agenda for constitutional reform can only be achieved, however, by understanding the broad social purpose for which it is designed. We must explain why a more democratic system of governance would be required, for example, to devolve decisions regarding public investment.</p><p>To offer people something more-a way of framing the upcoming election not just in terms of dangers but also possibilities-the left must take the risk, even in a moment fraught with peril, to sketch what a future society could look like if organised according to new principles. What the rest of this article offers is a sketch of a transition in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Narrow electoral calculations force us to recognise the hard authoritarian threat. Writing, however, is also an exercise in political imagination. In addition to identifying the electoral stakes, it helps us concretely envision what we could potentially achieve if we build a collective movement for egalitarian change.</p><p>Social priorities for investment</p><p>If we look at what most people spend money on, we see that basic needs that should be covered by public services remain significant costs for households earning less than Rs. 100,000 a month. Analysing data from the 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, we see that the bottom 90% of Sri Lankan households on average spend nearly 15% on healthcare and education alone.</p><p>Although healthcare and education are technically offered as free services, quality has gone way down. In the health sector, private sector hospitals and insurance schemes predominate because of the need to cover more advanced and complex operations. More importantly perhaps, State hospitals are underfunded. Medical care, however, will require greater investment, especially as the population grows older.</p><p>In terms of education, Sri Lanka used to maintain world-class standards. Now, however, graduates aspire to enrol in extension courses of foreign universities. The lucky few migrate abroad. The crisis is severe even before students enter university. Parents are forced to shoulder the costs of tuition classes because Government schools are inadequate.</p><p>Moreover, after graduation, there are no job guarantees. What's the purpose, then, of schooling? Simply put, education must be decoupled from skills-in a narrow, vocational sense-and reconsidered as a process that enables the citizenry to engage in decision-making at advanced levels. That means debating the social priorities of investment.</p><p>Spending more on health and education would decommodify these needs, take them out of the market, and ease people's stress and anxiety. To do so would require drastically increasing (and enforcing) direct taxes on the rich, which would also level inequality. The State's revenue would ultimately be limited, however, by Sri Lanka's overall economic development. We must redefine what kind of investment is required to achieve development, especially in green infrastructure.</p><p>What if we invested, for example, in more public transport? This approach would create a market for goods and services procured by the state, including the possibility of worker-owned cooperatives. It would enable the state to set labour and environmental standards for contractors, while incentivising private investment. In addition, we could turn Wages Boards into sectoral bargaining institutions, along with making it easier to unionise in the workplace.</p><p>We could imagine a nationalised ride sharing platform, a light rail network in Colombo, and the upgrading of public transport across the entire country. Passenger transport could be combined with cargo. Public facilities for the warehousing and retailing of agro products, including for export abroad, could be built. We could bring farmers, estate workers, and other rural constituencies into the political debate by demanding an efficient network of transportation that cuts out the middlemen while providing unionised green jobs for logistics workers.</p><p>The energy to power this system could come from micro grids expanded with even more public investment. Establishing decentralised renewable energy could enable District Councils to take on more tasks. This would strengthen their capacity under the direction of Provincial Councils that address the development needs of their respective provinces.</p><p>The latest UN Committee on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report on a global Green New Deal, for example, describes an alternative path for countries in the global South. The report mentions that those countries which have not yet sunk capital into developing inefficient energy infrastructure could potentially convert to alternatives faster.</p><p>The above processes would require confronting perhaps the most powerful force currently driving the Sri Lankan economy: real estate speculation. If government planners are serious about implementing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, for example, it's time to ban construction of new luxury apartments, or at least require that a significant proportion of housing stock be allocated for lower income families.</p><p>We could also demand subsidies for climate-proof housing across the island. Finally, a financial transaction tax, capital gains tax, and other wealth taxes could limit speculative activity, in addition to helping cover public expenditures.</p><p>A vision that can win</p><p>What the above reforms would entail is a mix of public and private investment. More importantly, they represent a public framework for private investment. Investors on their own do not set the right priorities for our society, or for our economy for that matter. They look for the most profitable activity that requires the least amount of risk. That's why policy slogans such as attracting more foreign investment can't solve the crisis that manifests politically in the choice between a weak democratic candidate and a hard authoritarian candidate, or Sajith versus Gotabaya. The calculus only changes when capitalists are forced to operate under different circumstances. That means increasing the leverage of actors, such as workers, who can prevent the rich from pushing economic burdens onto the poor. For too long, unfortunately, most Sri Lankans have not enjoyed this advantage. They have experienced their lack of effective bargaining power in the stagnation of their living standards, while other parts of the country, especially the affluent sections of Colombo, obtain high-profile investment.</p><p>Nevertheless, on another level, the business community also operates according to a different rationality, within a set of social parameters. Business people recognise that they will face consequences if the economy, state and society enter a full-blown crisis. As many can see, in Sri Lanka and beyond, the current system is not sustainable. It's producing increasingly authoritarian political responses.</p><p>While some elites may claim that they want a leader who can impose 'discipline,' they may not equally appreciate the proto-fascist forces such a figure could-and likely would-unleash. In the meantime, neoliberal policy makers and think tanks will offer the same solutions. But the deadening of our imagination and the retreat into clich\u00e9s shows that even their rhetoric hardly convinces the decision-makers, much less the voters who will decide the next president.</p><p>In addition to exposing the potential dangers of proto-fascism then, we must sketch an alternative for the candidate that is most capable of defeating reaction this election. While Sajith's success or failure hinges on structural factors-especially the diversity and enthusiasm of his party's social bases-ideological work still has a role to play. Moreover, the way in which we can prevent hard authoritarianism from rearing its head again in the long-term, even if it is defeated in the immediate short-term, is based on the extent to which we adopt a new platform.</p><p>Finally, rethinking the boundaries of what's politically possible can remind us why the changes so many other progressives would like to see can only be achieved as part of a strong left-led coalition. Leading from the left means approaching the democratisation of the relationship between state and society from the perspective of democratising the economy. That includes dispensing with the cheap technocratic rhetoric that has so far defined the presidential candidates' campaigns. Instead, leadership demands that we take the risk of imagining and fighting for a different order.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["To do so would require drastically increasing (and enforcing) direct taxes on the rich, which would also level inequality.

The bank has incorporated Green Banking as a strategic business initiative to its business process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Green Banking is still an evolving concept that has emerged in recent years. Its core idea is to engage in any form of banking which the community gets environmentally benefitted through its practices. The importance of the banking industry being involved in green initiatives comes through its importance in playing the role in economic development through financial intermediation. The banking sector acts as a major partner in financial inclusion therefore vested on its economic power it can promote environmentally sustainable and socially responsible investments and projects.</p><p>'For the Bank of Ceylon, success is always to gain sustainable growth together with the wellbeing of the community, therefore the idea is embedded as an integral part in the bank's core mission. Understanding the economic, social and environmental needs the bank evolved its approach overtime towards this mission without compromising the environment at any cost. The digital transformation was one big advancement we made towards this goal to make a better environment through digitisation,' stated the bank's Chairman President's Counsel Ronald C. Perera.</p><p>'Through this transformation process BOC has been able to alter its systems, processors, communication channels and manage all its resources not only to yield best economic advantages for the bank and its customers but also to engage in environment related best practices comprehensively,' Perera further stated.</p><p>With the best practices that came along with the digital transformation the Bank was able to move into a green process where day-to-day bank operations specially paper work was replaced by technology and made to be seamless and thus minimised waste including and carbon emission. Smart products such as 'SmartGen' were introduced replace conventional savings accounts that use passbooks where there were a lot of paper usage. SmartZones were introduced for paperless transactions 24x7. These products and services have changed the bank's customer interface completely providing utmost convenience. Internally the bank has adapted a comprehensive Document Management System (DMS) and E-learning facility for employee training.</p><p>'We at Bank of Ceylon had many on-going environmentally friendly programs that have been there for several years. The bank has moved into a comprehensive Green Banking approach that is heavily aided by the digital transformation. With that we have introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that includes IT and physical infrastructure,' stated General Manager D.M. Gunasekara.</p><p>Encouraging the business community to adapt environmental best practices is an important initiative that a banking institution can do. 'The Bank of Ceylon takes a special care in projects and business lending to make sure that those financed projects are environmental friendly. It even encourages customers, especially in the SME and corporate segments to execute projects that use renewable energy and installation of renewable energy, waste management, recycling/up-cycling projects and energy saving projects. Partnering to build the NSBM Campuses' new premises is a very recent such project the Bank of Ceylon worked with keen interest which was not only a green project but also addresses one major area of bank's social sustainability which is education,' Gunasekara added.</p><p>Apart from best practices adapted through digitalisation, the Bank of Ceylon has been engaged in green initiatives such as paper recycling, E-waste management, installing eco-friendly equipment, installing energy efficient lighting systems in branches and head office, maintaining green gardens at selected branches with rain water harvesting systems. The solar powered system in selected branches is also a recent addition to the Bank's Green Banking process.</p><p>Commenting on special achievements that is noteworthy; during the past three years only BOC was able to recycle 389,440 kg of paper that was calculated to save 6621 fully grown trees which otherwise would have been cut-down for this purpose and planted 100,000 trees in line with the bank's 75th anniversary in 2014 gathering school children and public from all over the country. The bank's Kilinochchi branch was endorsed as a green branch recently as it was designed to have a solar energy system and utilises space and architectural design to obtain more natural light and air, vertical green garden to keep the interior cool, rain water harvesting system and a SmartZone for digital banking.</p><p>Leading the Sri Lankan banking industry with over 77 years' experience, the Bank of Ceylon has become the most stable and the trusted bank in the country that serves Sri Lankans from all walks of life helping them to build their lives and make themselves financially stable whilst uplifting the country's economy. The bank earned global recognition as one of the top 1000 banks in the world, (Country rank No. 1) as listed by 'The Banker Magazine' (UK) respectively in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The Bank of Ceylon won the overall Gold Award at the NBEA Awards Ceremony 2015 with five other 'Winner' awards. The bank claimed its award as the only Sri Lankan brand recognised as one of Asia's Best Brands in 2013 by the Chief Marketing Officer's Council (CMO Council) based in Mumbai, India. Brand Finance Lanka has ranked Bank of Ceylon as the country's No. 1 brand for the last eight consecutive years.</p><p>The bank has passed exceptional milestones in recent years such as becoming the first to gain over Rs. 1.5 trillion assets and over Rs. 1 trillion deposits. Focusing on the bank's achievement, Fitch Rating Lanka ranked the Bank of Ceylon at AA+(lka) which is the highest rating awarded to a local commercial bank and ICRA (lk) awarded AAA rating which is the highest credit quality rating issued by ICRA Lanka.

As water spills into houses and shops, business grinds to a halt and children pick their way through dangerously flooded streets to get to school.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the past 10 years, the floods have gotten worse, with maximum sea levels rising 8-10 inches. The water stays up for about four hours each time, says Cao Van Buon, a business owner.</p><p>As seasonal and extreme weather events become more severe, cities like Can Tho face an enormous challenge. Many of the world's largest cities are located on coasts, deltas, or riverbanks; globally, 60% of the world's cities are at risk from rising sea levels and storm surges. With this in mind, more than 400 mayors from around the world met at the UN's Paris climate conference determined to take action.</p><p>There was a clear signal from Paris that municipal leaders are not only deeply committed to making sure their cities adapt to the impacts of climate change,  but are also leading the way to lower emissions through low-carbon development, said World Bank Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice Senior Director Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez. With COP21 behind us, it's time to get on with the real work of the post-COP agenda.</p><p>Last year, the World Bank provided over $ 3 billion in urban climate finance and technical assistance to help developing countries build climate-smart cities; this figure is expected to grow proportionately as the Bank moves to increase its climate finance by a third over the next five years.</p><p>As urban populations grow faster than ever - with 90% of that growth happening in developing countries - the World Bank and its partners, are providing advice, tools and funding to address the urban climate challenge. Here's a look at what the bank is doing:</p><p>Adaptation</p><p>Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change, because that's where people and assets are concentrated. The World Bank has helped cities understand and build resilience for more than a decade, promoting early warning systems, stronger infrastructure, flood management, and disaster preparedness programs. In Sri Lanka, World Bank loans are improving Colombo's resilience and ability to prevent floods. In Bogota, Colombia, schools have been upgraded to meet resilient building codes and people living in high-risk areas susceptible to landslides and flash floods have resettled in safer territory.</p><p>Adaptation is about managing risk, said Niels B. Holm-Nielsen, Global Lead for Resilience and Disaster Risk Management at the World Bank. There is a lot for cities to consider - improving water circulation to avoid flooding, territorial planning to guide more resilient urban growth and, most importantly, how to keep things going in the face of major storm or natural disaster.</p><p>Among many tools offered by the World Bank is a new program called 'City Strength', which evaluates resilience on a holistic basis - looking at different sectors like transport, energy, health, waste management, and information and communications technology - bringing the findings together to identify critical gaps or areas of weakness.</p><p>Mitigation</p><p>By the end of the Paris climate talks, more than 450 cities with a combined population of nearly one billion people had pledged to reduce emissions by more than 50% over 15 years. A recent analysis by the World Bank found that only 20% of the world's largest cities have the basic analytics necessary for low-carbon urban planning.</p><p>This expanded engagement on the part of the mayors, coupled with unprecedented urban population growth, presents a unique opportunity to set cities on a low-carbon development path, said Paul Kriss, World Bank Global Lead for Sustainable City Infrastructure and Services.</p><p>Working with more than 20 international organisations, the bank is developing a Climate Certification Program to help city officials gain the expertise necessary to conduct local GHG emissions inventories, the foundation for climate action plans.</p><p>The newly-established Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPCS) supports municipal efforts to integrate low carbon and resilience into planning and decision-making processes, while the Climate Action for Urban Sustainability (CURB) tool can be used by cities prioritise different low-carbon initiatives bases on cost, feasibility, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The Bank is also pioneering the use of TRACE (Tool for Rapid Assessment of City Energy), a land use, transport and energy model that lets users project different scenarios.  When TRACE was deployed in Romania, city officials found that more compact urban development in the Bucharest region could decrease local greenhouse gas emission by 39%.</p><p>Financing</p><p>Building low-carbon, resilient infrastructure often exceeds the existing financial capacity of cities in the developing world.</p><p>Cities can't do it alone, said Roland White, the World Bank's Global Lead for City Management, Finance and Governance. National governments will have to help with major investments, particularly in climate and green infrastructure. And the international community has an important technical and financial role to play.</p><p>Most cities in the developing world don't have access to sufficient, long-term financing and credit. Only 4% of the 500 largest cities are credit worthy in the international markets and only 20 % have a domestic credit rating. National governments need to create the policy and legal environments that help cities more easily access private financing to invest in climate infrastructure, and cities need to strengthen their financial performance to attract investors.</p><p>The World Bank is working with a number of countries to strengthen their regulatory frameworks for municipal borrowing, while its City Creditworthiness Academy (CCA) works to strengthen municipal performance and prepare them to tap domestic and regional capital markets. The CCA has trained over 500 municipal officials from 185 cities in 20 countries.</p><p>Looking to the Post-COP future</p><p>The future of sustainable development lies in creating a mix of financial and technical solutions that can match the complexity of building low carbon, resilient cities, said Ijjasz-Vasquez. These engagements offer combinations of physical risk reduction, financial risk transfer and management, support systems to improve decision making for risk management, and early infrastructure and regulatory improvements that will shape a city's future over 10 to 15-year horizons. Together with our development partners, the World Bank will continue to finance public investment in low-carbon, resilient cities, but we are also helping municipal governments develop a wider array of financial tools to reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["FinancingBuilding low-carbon, resilient infrastructure often exceeds the existing financial capacity of cities in the developing world.

As you may be aware, today, we are running at an ecological deficit, and the current global rate of extraction of natural resources is 25 per cent more than the replenishment rate. The global average ecological footprint is 2.2 global hectares per person as against the bio-capacity of 1.8. The ecological footprint measures humanity's demand on nature. </p><p>\"High income countries\" accounts for an ecological footprint of 6.4 global ha/person as against the bio-capacity of 3.3, whereas the \"Middle Income Countries\" and 'Low Income Countries\" account for ecological footprints of 1.9 and 0.9 as against bio-capacities of 2.1 and 0.7 respectively. Ecological footprint Sri Lanka has an ecological footprint of one global ha/person whereas our bio-capacity is 0.4. Therefore we Sri Lankans too are running at an ecological deficit of 150 per cent! Our country's situation is worse than the global situation. The present multiple crises provide us ample evidences of the ill effects of the unsustainable economic development strategies followed by the industrialized countries in the 20th century for the sake of human development. The result of the present crises is becoming in fact the worst global economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s which led to the World War II. IMF has already warned that all the economies of developed countries may contract in 2009 leading to social and political explosion. It is clear that we have to adjust our economic activities within a two limiting factors in order to attain a sustainable economic growth. One limiting factor is the \"Scarcity of resources\" and the other is \"Pollution\" arising out of the unlimited waste generation including emissions. All of us especially, the policy-makers, Architects and Engineers should understand the gravity of this problem, the root causes and the possible environmental devastations that would occur in future ruining the natural balance of the ecosystem which in turn would lead ruining the human existence in this planet. It is clear that the root cause of the problem is unsustainable consumption and production of the humankind. Most economists are now concerned whether the current financial credit crunch could lead to an ecological crunch or an environmental crisis in the absence of long term solutions linking to sustainability. Financial crisis and economic recession could be reversed over time. However the ecological crises are irreversible in nature and if there are environmental catastrophes, each civilization in the world would be severely affected. It may be considered as the end of the human civilization on this planet. In the early stages of human civilization, it was possible to change the civilization region or zone to a nearby region or a zone whenever environmental problems arose. Globalization However, in the present context, the process of globalization has tightly integrated all civilizations through trade and financial flows and the decisions taken in one country on their economic development have remarkable impacts on the entire world economy and thereby on the entire world community. At the same time, it is a known fact that ecosystems of the world are inextricably interlinked and economic recessions would lead to ecological recessions if timely action is not taken to reverse the trends of unsustainable development by the entire world community. We have to understand that short term rescue plans and temporary measures ignoring the ecological sustainability will not solve the present crises. Even the short term solutions should lead to long term sustainable solutions based on Green Economic principles leading to a \"Green Economy\". Green Economy is about sustainable consumption as well as production. Human health, wellbeing and livelihood are inextricably interlinked with the biological and physical properties and processes and functional ecosystems. The construction industry and its allied professionals-the Architects and Engineers have an important role to play with the policymakers to create a \"Low carbon-Green Built Environment\" functioning in harmony with the natural ecosystem. Without a healthy environment, there can be no social and economic development. We need to form green cities with green infrastructure minimizing the carbon footprints moving away from the carbon dependency economy. Present trends It is important to note that the carbon budget for the century identified by the United Nations to avoid catastrophic environmental disaster to humans is in the range of 50:50 probability which will expire in 2030 if the present trends continue. Therefore we must use a wider framework - a combination of architectural styles of different schools of thought to suit our climatic conditions and cultural practices within a green development paradigm, self sustained with a green culture. In this context my memories go back to the principles followed by our world famous leading architect, Geoffrey Bawa with his remarkable designs based on the Monsoon Architecture. Also, we can learn lessons from our ancient architecture in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and use these with suitable modifications if necessary to suit the present condition. Maintenance A significant portion of investments for economic development should be set apart in the design of green architecture which would eventually avoid the massive costs of expenditure that the country would otherwise have to bear for the maintenance of energy and material intensive systems. In this context, it is necessary to develop new models of green architecture: green buildings, green villages, green cities with guidelines, building codes and other related codes of practices that would evolve the ancient architecture with appropriate modifications to resolve the present crisis. This Green Architecture should lead to sustainable production and consumption practices of the entire community of the country. The recent initiative taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to establish a National Sustainable Development Council with the leadership of the President under the Haritha Lanka Program clearly goes hand-in-hand with the governance structure necessary to integrate green economy needs into the existing development processes at national level.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.</p><p>For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com\">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</email></p>", "publisher": "Daily News (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["The construction industry and its allied professionals-the Architects and Engineers have an important role to play with the policymakers to create a \"Low carbon-Green Built Environment\" functioning in harmony with the natural ecosystem.

According to Dr. Punyawardena, the Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of the atmosphere is increasing at an alarming level which affects the climate change negatively.</p><p>'We know that global warming is occurring due to the greenhouse effect. These greenhouse effects, ultimately lead to the climate change. After 1750, the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere has been sky rocketing. About 45 years ago, the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere was 0.03%. Now the new generation has to learn that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere as 0.04%. Within our lifetime it has risen 0.01%. A huge amount of heat is entrapped due to the greenhouse effect. This effectively leads to a negative impact on climate change,' he said.</p><p>Dr. Punyawardena also mentioned that there is a very clear cut and significant increase in the ambient temperature in the country. According to various studies conducted, the ambient temperature is increasing at a rate of 0.01% to 0.03% annually, with frequent droughts and floods.</p><p>Speaking on the effects of climate change on the annual rainfall, Dr. Punyawardena said that there is no decrease or increase in the amount of rainfall received annually as there was insufficient evidence to prove that there was a trend in the rainfall received.</p><p>'There is a misconception saying that with climate change, the annual rainfall is decreasing. I will say with all the responsibility, our annual rainfall is neither decreasing nor increasing. There is no trend in the rainfall. We get more rain when it is not needed, and we don't get rains when it is needed. In summary, if you take rainfall recording stations, there are about more than 400 stations governed by the Government and the private sector. Around 10% of these stations will show an increasing trend, another 15% will show a decreasing trend, while the remaining 75-80% will not show any trend in the rainfall. The only aspect that has been effected is the timing of the rainfall. The timing has become highly erratic. This results in more droughts and more floods.</p><p>He also mentioned that the intensity of rains have increased as a result of climate change while the number of rainy days have decreased.</p><p>'The intensity of the rains we receive have increased, which also results in an increase in flash floods. After 2005, our rainfall intensity has increased, both in the Central Highlands, and also in the dry zone. Even though the rain intensity is increasing, the number of rainy days are decreasing. This will have a significant impact on the agricultural productivity of the country,' Dr. Punyawardena elaborated.</p><p>He also noted that there will be a noticeable increase in the temperature in the future. He says that the studies conducted by various institutions show that there will be an increase of the temperature by two to three degrees at the turn of the century than that of today. According to Dr. Punyawardena, the increase in temperature will be significant in the Central Highlands, and the Northern Province.</p><p>'All these studies show that the dry zone will become even drier, while the wet zone will become even wetter in the years to come. The dry zone will experience a more intense drought than that of today, whereas the wet zone will experience more excessive rainfall conditions than today,' he added.</p><p>In his final remarks, Dr. Punyawardena said that the threat posed by climate change is a reality.</p><p>'It is true that the threat of climate change is there. All the studies we conduct arrive at the same conclusion, that it is real threat. It will affect all the sectors of the economy, especially agriculture, tourism, health, and transport. There are no sectors with immunity to this complication. All of the sectors are vulnerable to climate change. If you want to sustain, you have to adapt to this situation. That means the need for smarter strategies. We also need to have an attitudinal change. Without changing our attitude we will not be able to face this dilemma successfully,' he concluded.</p><p>Impact and assessment of climate change on biodiversity and alternative energy generation</p><p>IUCN Species Revival Commission Former Deputy Chairperson Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda who spoke at the forum said that the impact of climate change on biodiversity is catastrophic. He also noted that the worst impact will be suffered by the oceans.</p><p>'If we talk about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, it is catastrophic. The worst impact is going to happen to the oceans. The oceans today are acidifying at a rate that exceeds anything we have seen during vertebrate evolution. The last time the oceans saw this kind of acidification trend was 252 million years ago when the Earth saw the Permian Triassic extinction. The acidification of the oceans means that all the animals that depend on Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) for their exoskeletons cannot survive. The very bottom of the food web is taken out. When the Great Dying took place 252 million years ago, 90% of oceanic species became extinct. That is what we are looking at unless we reverse climate change by reducing CO2 emissions,' he said.</p><p>He also mentioned that different species in order to adapt to climate change engage in various actions.</p><p>'As the climate warms, species need to adapt or move to colder climates. As we go upcountry the climate cools substantially. Trees and animals that are now at sea levels in forests have to migrate upwards. Two problems arise here. One is that we have fragmented our landscape so radically that the migration of species becomes very difficult unless we build substantial habitat corridors that enable this to happen. The other problem is that the species who live on the highest peaks have nowhere higher to go. We are looking at major species extinctions in this area,' he added.</p><p>Dr. Pethiyagoda noted that the only way to dampen the impacts of climate change was to decrease the CO2 emissions released.</p><p>'In the whole climate change scenario, there is only one number that matters. That is the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Everything else comes out of that one simple fact. Over the past 1000 years we had an atmospheric concentration of CO2 less than 300ppm (parts per million), we are now well over 400ppm and aiming for the sky. 400ppm is something that we have not seen before in evolutionary history. As in the past 400,000 years, CO2 concentrations have varied. Global sea levels have varied by as much as 400 feet. The last time atmospheric CO2 exceeded 400ppm was 17 million years ago. Long before many of the species that walk the Earth today had evolved. During that time we only saw a sea level rise of 100 feet. The reason this is important is, we are only tweaking one number here. Only the greenhouse gases. The other consequences of that tweak will follow. That is what we need to be ready for,' he elaborated.</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Pethiyagoda said that although Sri Lanka had come a long way in the use of renewable energy, we need to do more. He mentioned that as Sri Lanka was a developing country, the energy requirement will only increase.</p><p>'Our electric energy consumption at the moment is low. To become a fully developed country, we are going to increase the energy consumption by 10 times. As we industrialise, the energy component supplied by the renewable resources we use now will not be sufficient. We have to think big into the future. The only technology available at the moment that we can even think about that will provide CO2 free energy is nuclear energy. Thirty-three countries in the world have nuclear electricity, including countries that are significantly poorer than us. There is no reason that we cannot think big into the future. We have no choice but to think big,' he concluded.</p><p>National strategy to address climate change threats</p><p>Speaking on the national strategy to address climate change threats by creating green infrastructure, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment Climate Change Director Dr. Sunimal Jayatunga said that overcoming the threats from prolonged drought and flood conditions was a national priority for the Government.</p><p>'We have identified three main interventions to address the arising threat of climate change. We hope to enrich catchments and watersheds in the central highlands and river basins. We hope to rehabilitate ancient cascade tank systems in the dry zone, and finally we also hope to divert excess water in the wet zone to control flash floods and to address prolonged droughts in the dry zone. These are the three major interventions that we hope to achieve at present,' he said.</p><p>The Climate Change Director noted that the Moragahakanda Reservoir project is one of the major projects conducted by the Government to address the climate change threat posed on the country.</p><p>'One of the interventions that the Government is currently engaged is building dams, especially the Moragahakanda reservoir project. It is a multipurpose irrigation project. Our aim is to improve the agriculture, power generation, industrial water supply, and the inland fishery sector through this project. This is the biggest multifunctional irrigation project in Sri Lanka and it contains a water quantity that is six times bigger than that of the Parakrama Samudraya. We plan on providing water for both of the major harvest seasons. We also hope to add an annual power generation of about 110 gigawatts to the national grid. It will also provide safe drinking water to a large population that is affected drought conditions in the dry zone. This project addresses and mitigates most of the effects of climate change,' he added.</p><p>Summarising some of the economic benefits of the Moragahakanda Reservoir project, Dr. Jayatunga noted that it is slated to provide irrigation water to about 87,000 farmers in districts such as Matale, Anuradhapura, and Polonnaruwa, during both of the major harvesting seasons, and to increase the annual inland fishing by 4,500 metric tonnes.</p><p>Dr. Jayatunga sharing insights on the most vulnerable sectors to climate change said, 'Agriculture, fishery, livestock, water, health, biodiversity, tourism, marine, urban, city planning, and human settlement are the sectors that are going to be effected the worst by climate change.'</p><p>The Climate Change Director noted: 'In Sri Lanka, we have a cascade tank system. More than 42,000 tanks including small tanks, and the 103 rivers we have in the country are included in this cascade tank system. We have a lot of water bodies in the country, we have to utilise them in a better way. This is what the Ministry is planning on doing. When we divert the excess water in the wet zone to the dry zone, we are going to be using the Mahaweli system. The Mahaweli system is a unique system. It is necessary to apply the ecosystem based adaptation system again. We have to think back to that era and hope to make the country more sustainable. It is one of the best ways to address the climate change in the dry zone. We are also hoping to restore upper watershed catchment areas to ensure climate change resilience. This is an opportunity for us to rehabilitate what we destroyed.'</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Jayatunga said, 'We have other major climate adaptation projects in the works. The Uma Oya multipurpose development project, Upper Elahara Canal project, North-West Canal project, Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation project, the Climate Smart irrigated Agriculture project, the Climate Resilient Improvement Water Management project, and the Yan Oya reservoir project are some of these.'</p><p>Pix by Ruwan Walpola</p><p>Looking ahead and planning for the aftereffects of climate change</p><p>The forum concluded with a panel discussion on looking ahead and planning for the aftereffects of climate change, which included Dr. Nambi Appadurai, Dr. Ranjith Punyawardene, Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, Dr. Sunimal Jayatunga, Forest Department Conservator General Anura Sathurusinghe and Dilhan Fernando</p><p>Q: Under UN Red, the UN programme for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, there are many adaptation strategies discussed in the global context. How can they be applied to Sri Lanka?</p><p>Anura Sathurusinghe: If we take the Red Plus strategy, we developed and presented to the Government about a year ago, when we talk about forestry, we usually talk about the mitigation. But in this case, in Sri Lanka, what was really important was ecosystem services. We thought of identifying different strategies and policies while looking at the mitigation aspects of forestry and also to look at the adaptation requirement also. For that we had identified 13 policies and measures within three main policy frameworks as forest, wildlife, and the watersheds. We looked at watersheds as one whole landscape while looking at the social aspects. There is a mix of both adaptation and mitigation aspects.</p><p>Q: What is the UN Global Concept (UNGC) Future Scope for the climate change adaptation?</p><p>Dilhan Fernando: In the alignment of the environment, there are multiple different interventions, but we must remember that the UNGC is a convening platform and therefore it is reliant on the initiatives of the members. It offers an opportunity for members to work within those seven directions that is mandated by the UN which are very general, to build certain specific interventions. In our case, we work with the UN platform, speaking as Dilmah Conservation, in order to be able to understand best practice globally from the UNGC platform. We use that to be able to optimise what we do, so that we don't reinvent the wheel, build partnerships and that we are able to share our best practice using UNGC, because ultimately there is no point in us doing something fantastic only on one or two of our estates. We need to be able to leverage it to be able to deliver something that we can look back at. I think UNGC has two functions there, one is to be able to act as a platform to share best practice that will help us to scale up any initiative that the members wish and secondly it also has the possibility to allow the members to share their efforts with others in order to deliver at a national scale rather than making it something that might be isolated.</p><p>Q: With respect to adaptation and mitigation responses that we should undertake to reduce the vulnerability of Asia to climate change, are there any significant barriers or challenges that would delay or make them ineffective?</p><p>Nambi Appadurai: One of the key constraints is the interface between science and policy, and how do you convert scientists into policy makers? To me that is a bog challenge. Apart form that the capacities are at different levels, because it is happening at a rapid pace, therefore people coping with different things. But then what happens is that the people cannot accommodate the change in which it happens today. The information flow has to be maintained. Technology is helping us with that. The interactions between science and policy is very critical to me, because a lot of politicians do not understand the complexity of the climate change subject whereas scientist do not understand the intricacies of policy making. Demystifying science is important here.</p><p>Q: Undamming rivers is the trend today. We have decided in Sri Lanka, in consultation with the president, that we cannot tap our rivers any more for power generation without harming the environment. I do not see how climate change impacts can be reduced by damming rivers.</p><p>Rohan Pethiyagoda: There is no question that damming rivers, whether for irrigation, flood management or hydropower, carries environmental costs. It is true that in the US many old and/or poorly-constructed dams are being removed. However, the driving reason for this is not environmental but safety and maintenance cost. In Sri Lanka, the institutions whose job it is to provide our farmers with water, and provide all of us with electricity, considered these challenges and came up with solutions. These solutions include the dams which are today generating electricity at a cost of less than Rs. 10 per kWh4, a fraction of the Rs. 25-60 it costs per unit of thermal power. Almost a third of our power now comes from these dams.</p><p>Climate risk management and climate change adaptation</p><p>Speaking on the reality and threats posed by climate change, and how we can respond to these, World Resource Institute and Climate Resilience Practice India Adaptation Strategy Director Dr. Nambi Appadurai said that it was important to look at adaptation and mitigation as response options to climate change at the same time rather than working on them individually.</p><p>'We have only two major response options to climate change. Mitigation and adaptation are the only major response options. We have spent decades on mitigation, because it is a very politically charged issue. Even though the disparities between the debating sides have died down a bit, we still have a long way to go. Adaptation on the other hand is mostly untouched. Due to the fact that it is a development issue, adaptation is very complex and there is no single solution to it. It is a work in progress and we still have a long way to go. It is a moving target. A good starting point for successful adaptation is acquiring good and relevant information and the possible range of impacts on different sectors. That information also is not easy to come by. We need to have practical approaches to vulnerability assessments. Whatever sector we look at and do vulnerability assessments, we need to look at the direct impacts as well as the indirect impacts,'</p><p>Dr. Appadurai also noted that climate change is a complex subject that needs a thorough understanding to fully comprehend.</p><p>'Climate change is a subject that needs reiteration and repetition. It is also a complex subject, so it takes time to fully comprehend the threat that it poses to the future of the world. We have to accept the fact that climate change is happening right now and it is here to stay for a long time to come. Wherever you go you hear about climate change, no matter the country or continent. It is a word that resonates with everybody today though they find it a bit complex,' he said.</p><p>Speaking on the threat that climate change poses to the modern world, Dr. Appadurai said, 'There are different global challenges. Population growth, poverty, urbanisation, and things like that. All of these are major challenges. Climate change is also on this list but it is a bit further down. Even though it is low on the list as of now, it will only get more prominent, and we have to be ready for that. Climate change affects the very building blocks of survival.'</p><p>He also mentioned the impacts of climate change on the private sector and how adaptation is the most relevant response option to these effects.</p><p>'If we look at the impacts of climate change on the private sector, much of the global discussion on adaptation finance has focused on integrating aspects of climate resilience into public sector budgeting and the allocation of international climate finance. It is however, through the integration of climate resilience aspects into the day-to-day decisions of private enterprises around the world, that the most significant adaptation potential in economic development can be achieved. Understanding how these decisions are made and are ultimately financed is critical for establishing the policy frameworks capable to scale-up private sector investment to transformational scale required. Understanding how private sector adaptation investment occurs, what drives it and how it is financed, also is essential. It is a low-cost entrance for Governments and policy makers seeking to increase levels of adaptation,' he elaborated.</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Appadurai mentioned that evidence based research and sound monitoring as the most important aspects that we should focus on as responses to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>'Looking ahead, I believe that evidence based research is very important. Transformative approaches to the problems that we face today are critical when dealing with the threat of climate change. We need to learn from all the different studies that have been conducted and we need to look at how to put them to good use. Sound monitoring and evaluation is important for this. It is also important to invest in the best tools when dealing with this issue. Given the fact that 70% of the urban infrastructure is yet to be built in India and other developing countries. This provides a big window opportunity to all the countries to build climate resilient infrastructure,' he concluded.</p><p>Overview of the climate change conversation</p><p>Providing an overview of the climate change conversation to the forum, Dilmah Conservation CEO Dilhan Fernando elaborated on some key insights from the 2006 Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change.</p><p>'In 2006, Lord Nichiolas Stern, who was the Treasury Secretary, now the Vice Chair at the Grantham Institute made three key points in the Review of the Economics of Climate Change. Every country and every individual in our world will be affected by climate change but the poorest will suffer the earliest and the most. Two is that climate change is the greatest market failure in of all time. The third is that the benefits of early action far outweigh the costs. He estimated that at that time, inaction could cost the world at least 5% of global GDP each year whilst the cost of early action, reducing emissions could be limited to around 1% of global GDP,' he said.</p><p>He also noted on some of the global catastrophes that have incurred due to the ill-effects of climate change.</p><p>'Just 12 years later from the Stern Review, wildfires are burning in the arctic circle. The fires across Siberia, in the past few weeks have covered 38,000 square miles, the smoke from those fires is evident even over Canada. Last year in Sweden, they had three forest fires. This year they have 40 times that,' he added.</p><p>Fernando also mentioned that the reasons for the lack of definitive action taken to mitigate climate change was due to economic discrepancies.</p><p>'A decade ago, there were environmentalists who fought for acknowledgement and action on this climate reality and on the other side, there were state and business lobbies that sometimes responded but mostly did not. The reasons for the lack of response were mostly economic. Adapting is often thought not to be good for business. In spite of all this, the world still has the same perception, because it is burning more fossil fuels today and apart from other consequences, also killing millions from air pollution,' he elaborated.</p><p>The Dilmah Conservation CEO speaking from the point of view of a climate change denier said, 'There is no real business case for a climate denier, however much one might try to ignore the reality. The US is not alone in this belief, and continues to invest about $20 billion in 2016 in subsidies for the production of fossil fuels, $15 billion more, but the fact is that there are many others except the US example.'</p><p>In his remarks, Dilhan Fernando noted that, 'Human existence is very clearly, intricately, and irrevocably linked to our natural environment. Ultimately, I think that when you look at the past, environmentalists, there was Government, and there were businesses, but today by necessity we are all environmentalists. Failure to address climate change is only going to exacerbate inequalities, and as we all know inequality is a corrosive, debilitating that leads ultimately to instability and far worse consequences.'</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["There is no reason that we cannot think big into the future. We have no choice but to think big,' he concluded. Sunimal Jayatunga said that overcoming the threats from prolonged drought and flood conditions was a national priority for the Government. We have identified three main interventions to address the arising threat of climate change."]}]
