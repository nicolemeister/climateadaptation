With public budgets under pressure, much of the adaptation effort will need to come from the private sector. A new World Bank report has laid out policy reforms that would help households and firms adapt to increasingly frequent and damaging weather events.</p><p>Released yesterday, 'From Risk to Resilience: Helping People and Firms Adapt in South Asia' finds that awareness of climate risk is high. More than 60% of households and firms have experienced extreme weather in the last five years, and more than 75% expect it for the next decade. Many households and businesses are already taking steps to adapt to climate risks. Around 80% of households and 63% of firms have taken some measures to adapt.</p><p>However, most of these measures are basic, such as raising house foundations or installing fans.

People and firms are already adapting, but they are doing so with limited tools and few resources,' said World Bank Vice President for South Asia Martin Raiser.</p><p>'Governments must act quickly to remove the barriers that prevent more effective adaptation. This includes removing distortions in land and labour markets, expanding access to finance, and investing in public infrastructure to support people and businesses as they respond to climate risks.'</p><p>The report finds that market barriers and income constraints are holding back stronger adaptation. Households with more education or access to formal finance are more likely to adopt advanced strategies. Similarly, better-managed firms with fewer regulatory barriers tend to be more adaptive. Removing these barriers would enable more effective adaptation by households and firms.</p><p>'Private sector adaptation could reduce one third of the region's projected climate damage, but this requires governments to strengthen enabling environments,' said World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia Franziska Ohnsorge.

Just a short walk, and I'd reach the vast expanse of water that covers about 70 percent of our planet. Today is World Oceans Day, and with this year's theme - 'Wonder: What Sustains Us' - that sense of fascination feels especially fitting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They say the ocean makes up the lungs of Earth because it plays a vital role in regulating the planet's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Specifically, the ocean produces a significant portion of the Earth's oxygen and absorbs a large amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere thereby helping to slow down the rate of global warming. Unfortunately, rapid climate change is significantly impacting on ocean temperatures with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimating that more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system has been absorbed by the ocean to date. Ocean warming and acidification are damaging marine ecosystems, upon which billions of people depend for food and livelihoods. Coastal communities are experiencing the impact of rising sea levels, biodiversity loss and climate-induced changes in weather first-hand.</p><p>All of this may sound grim, but there is ample hope in our mission for urgent climate action before global warming reaches irreversible levels, which the scientific community has warned will happen should we choose to continue with business as usual. At the British Council, we see this hope reflected in young people. Our long-term investment in youth climate leaders highlights just how vital it is to empower the next generation to become climate advocates, champions, and leaders.</p><p>Youth are becoming catalysts for change by breathing fresh air into existing problems, highlighting innovative solutions and bringing dynamic energy to a longstanding fight. Young people play a vital role in helping communities become more resilient to climate change, acting as drivers of change and contributing actively to local planning efforts.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, the British Council partnered with the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association in 2025 to raise climate change awareness among members across the island. Over 100 Girl Guides aged 12-17 took part in specially designed British Council classroom sessions, led by expert teachers and trained youth climate leaders. These sessions improved climate literacy, sparked ideas for action, and inspired hands-on field projects. Learning in English, the Guides explored climate solutions, gained confidence in presenting and public speaking, and deepened their understanding of climate change. I was especially proud of the youth climate leaders, who applied their learning from British Council programmes to mentor the next generation-Girl Guides from Colombo, Jaffna, Kandy, and Matara. We believe this initiative will help participants take a more active role in climate action in their communities.</p><p>Our partnership with the Girl Guides Association reflects our commitment to supporting women in leading climate action. While climate change affects everyone, it often deepens existing gender inequalities faced by women. By empowering girls to take on environmental leadership, we aim to help rebalance the scales and activate a vital force for community engagement.</p><p>This programme is just one of several initiatives led by the British Council in Sri Lanka, tying in with our global commitment to the climate agenda. By leveraging the trust and credibility that we have built around the world through our work, we are delivering an ambitious global portfolio to inspire and facilitate climate action. These efforts are especially aided by our non-formal education programme, which is all about creating positive pathways and opportunities for young people outside of formal learning spaces</p><p>I will end with a story about Sri Lankan marine biologist Asha De Vos Ph.D. Inspired by the National Geographic magazines that she devoured as a six-year-old, Asha studied marine biology and specialised in blue whale research. 'Her discovery of an aggregation of blue whales and a floating pile of whale faeces off southern Sri Lanka indicated that this population did not, as all other blue whale populations do, migrate to cold waters to feed. This ground-breaking discovery highlighted, for the first time, the role of tropical ecosystems in the lives of the largest animals to ever roam our planet.' She is now a pioneer in her field and the founder of Oceanswell (visit oceanswell.org to learn more), Sri Lanka's first organisation dedicated to marine conservation research and education.</p><p>As we celebrate World Oceans Day today, let's remember that even the smallest pebble can cause a ripple in the water. Small efforts today, taken by committed young changemakers, can grow into powerful initiatives that serve the world. Climate education is the first step- let organisations, educators and leaders come together to invest in tomorrow's leaders, equipping them to protect the vast oceanic heritage of this one planet that we all call home.</p><p>This project was generously sponsored by the UK's Blue Planet Fund.

Beyond extreme weather events and other direct losses and damages, climate change also has a variety of cascading long-term consequences that affect livelihoods, economies, ecosystems, culture, health, and human lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, while many climate impacts happen at the local level, local actors often don't have the resources or capacities to adequately respond to them. They require means of implementation-finance, technology, and capacity-building-that is commensurate to their challenges and aligned with principles of equity, fairness, and common but differentiated responsibilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What needs to be funded?</p><p>Quantifying exact numbers for loss and damage-particularly for non-economic and/or indirect losses-can be challenging, but the general needs on the ground are clear.</p><p>Local actors, such as farmer cooperatives, community associations, municipal councils, civil society organisations, or women's groups, are aware of their challenges and possible actions to address them. For example, this could entail investment into disaster-resilient infrastructure, new crop varieties, restoration of tanks and traditional water management systems, or seed funding for climate-friendly entrepreneurs.</p><p>However, these actors are often unable to access the necessary resources to develop or implement such interventions, which is further compound by gaps in data, risk and vulnerability assessments, available technology, and other factors. Due to their lack of technical capacity for proposal development, fiduciary management and monitoring, as well as requirements to co-finance projects or absorb upfront costs, local actors are not in a position to effectively tap into climate funding, especially from multilateral funds and entities.</p><p>From this, a first takeaway emerges: To effectively reach the ground level, means of implementation for climate adaptation and responses to loss and damage should support the full project cycle, from capacity-building on risk appraisal and project design to streamlined access modalities and sustained operational funding.</p><p>Where does global funding come from?</p><p>Addressing the full spectrum of risks requires funding that is as multifaceted as the impacts themselves. Compensation for economic losses must be coupled with investments in social protection, mental health support, and ecosystem conservation. Non-economic losses, such as the erosion of cultural identity and community networks, need financing for participatory mapping, the establishment of dialogue platforms, and preservation of traditional knowledge or practices. Without resources calibrated to local contexts, efforts of resilience-building run the risk of overlooking root causes of vulnerability and perpetuating inequitable outcomes.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, Articles 9 to 11 enshrine finance, technology transfer, and capacity building as means of implementation. Funding sources for climate action at the global level include the operating entities of the financial mechanisms under the UNFCCC: the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD). Furthermore, there are also other climate funds-the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund-as well as multilateral development banks and international financial institutions.</p><p>A second takeaway: There is no universal one-size-fits-all solution for funding, as local impacts and needs-as well as the existing structures for access and implementation-vary greatly. However, there are lessons to be learned from the operation of existing funds and their attempts to make finance more accessible, such as through the GEF's direct access entities or the Adaptation Fund's direct access modalities.</p><p>What are the key challenges to overcome?</p><p>Making direct access available and building capacities of local actors to actually utilise is a complex task that includes development of a local ecosystem for adaptation, risk management, and resilience-building. Central to unlocking finance for local actors is the expansion of direct and enhanced direct access modalities without lengthy accreditation processes and requirements for technical expertise and upfront investment that exceed what local actors can deliver.</p><p>Building local capacity is indispensable and encompasses not only technical skills in project appraisal, financial management, and monitoring, evaluation, and learning, but also institutional strengthening through governance frameworks, participatory decision-making bodies, and robust accountability mechanisms. Investing in regional project preparation facilities, automatic 'kick-start' funds for accredited entities, and standardised accounting packages can further lower these barriers while layered or tiered structures can decentralise decision-making while ensuring fiduciary compliance.</p><p>Equally important is harmonising global funding with national systems and priorities. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and other policy documents provide strategic roadmaps for climate action. Embedding local access windows within these instruments-through dedicated budget lines, policy targets, and reporting indicators-can align subnational investments with broader adaptation goals.</p><p>The third takeaway: For access modalities to be truly inclusive, equitable, and transparent, they should be developed through participatory multi-stakeholder processes to ensure that the voices of frontline communities and vulnerable groups, as well as those of local actors in general, are taken into account.</p><p>How can we move forward?</p><p>Several pivotal entry points in 2025 and beyond offer opportunities to recalibrate climate finance further towards the local level. This includes the FRLD, which is now becoming operational, with a first application window-known as the Barbados Implementation Modalities-opening soon. This first window could serve as a testing ground for local and community-driven grants supported by participatory monitoring and evaluation systems to build an evidence base for scaling up and learn from experience.</p><p>Another entry point is presented by the Global Goal on Adaptation and the issue of means of implementation, which is currently being discussed in connection with the development of indicators to measure progress towards global adaptation targets. When defining indicators on scale, quality, and access to finance, considerations related to local access (for example, the proportion of adaptation funds reaching subnational entities or the rate of project approval for direct access proposals) could help to further highlight this question.</p><p>In addition to loss and damage and adaptation, finance is itself a central agenda item in the UNFCCC and very relevant to this question. Besides the formal negotiations, this also includes the Baku-to-Belem Roadmap to USD 1.3 trillion, which aims to find a way forward to scale up climate finance in line with the new collective quantified goal (NCQG). In this process, local access as well as local investment plans could play an important role and help to shift from centralised, project-centric financing to decentralised, program-based approaches underpinned by participatory governance.</p><p>Designing global climate funds to reach effectively the ground is not merely a financing challenge, but a test of political will, momentum, and solidarity. With strategic entry points in 2025 and beyond, the international community can ensure that those at the frontlines of climate change are not left alone, waiting for support. For developing countries, the dividends of enhanced access are clear. Investments in local actors do more than protect assets and help to nurture social cohesion, preserve cultural heritage, and foster the adaptive capacities that underpin long-term sustainable development and prosperity.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025 opens registrations", "published": "2025-07-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has announced that registrations are now open for the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025 (SLEIS), taking place on 2 and 3 December at the Shangri-La Colombo.</p><p>This year's event introduces an enhanced format that builds on the Ceylon Chamber's flagship Sri Lanka Economic Summit, introducing a stronger investment focus to reflect current national priorities.</p><p>Under the theme 'Gateway to Growth: Asia's Emerging Opportunity', SLEIS 2025 aims to position Sri Lanka as a compelling investment destination at a time when regional supply chains are shifting, and structural reform is back on the agenda.

Across the city-from Wellawatte to Wattala-families scrambled for candles and battery-powered fans. The blackout lasted only an hour, but it was a stark reminder of Sri Lanka's energy fragility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2024, Sri Lanka spent over $ 2 billion importing coal, oil, and gas to keep the lights on. Fossil fuels still power more than 60% of our electricity, despite vast untapped renewable resources. Meanwhile, power generation emits over 10 million tonnes of CO2 annually, accelerating climate change and threatening both our economy and food security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We stand at an inflection point: modernise and transition to clean energy at scale - or continue spiralling into higher costs, environmental damage, and unreliable power.</p><p>Why the stakes are so high?</p><p>It should be noted with all seriousness that Sri Lanka's dependence on fossil fuel imports is a triple threat to:</p><p>Economic stability: Fuel imports consume up to 30% of export earnings in volatile years.</p><p>Food security: Climate shifts have already caused paddy yields to fall by 10-15% in drought years.</p><p>Health and environment: Air pollution from coal plants contributes to respiratory diseases, and greenhouse gases intensify extreme weather events.</p><p>According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), island nations like Sri Lanka face disproportionate risks from delayed energy transitions, making urgent reforms critical.</p><p>The land question</p><p>Sri Lanka's total arable land is just over 2 million hectares, a finite resource critical for both food and energy production. Covering fertile land with single-use solar or wind farms is neither sustainable nor politically feasible.</p><p>The future lies in dual-use solutions that maximise land productivity:</p><p>Agrivoltaics: Solar panels elevated to allow crops like mung beans, onions, turmeric, and chillies to grow beneath. International studies, including French agricultural research, show crop yields can improve under such shading, thanks to reduced heat stress and better moisture retention.</p><p>Floating solar: Installing solar panels on reservoirs like Rantembe and Maduru Oya reduces water evaporation while producing clean energy.</p><p>Japan's legal mandate for agrivoltaics on farmland sets a regional example Sri Lanka can emulate.</p><p>Storage: Closing the renewable loop</p><p>Renewables are inherently variable. Without efficient storage, fossil fuels remain indispensable for grid stability.</p><p>A two-tier storage strategy is essential:</p><p>Batteries: Ideal for short-term storage (hours), smoothing daily supply-demand fluctuations.</p><p>Green hydrogen: Vital for seasonal and long-duration storage (weeks to months), produced by electrolysis using surplus renewable electricity. Hydrogen can power transport, fertiliser manufacturing, and even serve as an export commodity.</p><p>Australia's Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) and Morocco's green hydrogen export plans provide valuable case studies for Sri Lanka's emerging strategy.</p><p>Risks and realities of renewable energy</p><p>Renewables bring benefits but also challenges:</p><p>Wind farms: Require significant land area and may impact bird migration paths.</p><p>Solar panels: Need end-of-life recycling plans to mitigate waste.</p><p>Bioenergy: Risks competition with food crops if unchecked.</p><p>Robust environmental impact assessments and lifecycle management plans must be mandated for all projects.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Act: Blueprint for the future</p><p>Sri Lanka needs a comprehensive law to cement the renewable transition:</p><p>Key provisions</p><p>Legally binding targets: Achieve 60% renewable electricity by 2035 and 90% by 2040.</p><p>Universal incentives: Tax holidays, accelerated depreciation, and concessional loans (0-3%) for all renewable energy projects-solar, wind, hydro, biomass, hydrogen, and storage technologies.</p><p>Land protection: Mandatory dual-use (agrivoltaics or compatible activities) on arable land to safeguard food production.</p><p>Bankable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): Government-backed contracts with currency hedging to reduce investor risk.</p><p>Grid modernisation: Investment in smart grids with AI-driven load balancing and public transparency.</p><p>Technology localisation: Foster domestic assembly and R and D of panels, inverters, batteries, and electrolysers.</p><p>Environmental safeguards: Enforce biodiversity protection and lifecycle carbon accounting.</p><p>The Government's role: From policy maker to market catalyst</p><p>Sri Lanka's energy future depends on Government leadership that goes beyond regulation to actively catalyse market development.</p><p>1. Legislative backbone - The Renewable Energy Act</p><p>Passing the Act will legally bind national renewable targets and enforce land-use policies integrating agriculture and storage.</p><p>Examples from Asia underscore success: India's Electricity Act reforms led to a solar boom; Vietnam's feed-in tariffs multiplied solar capacity 16-fold in three years.</p><p>2. Financing and investor confidence</p><p>Stable investment requires clear risk mitigation:</p><p>Tax incentives and concessional loans must be universally available.</p><p>Sovereign guarantees on PPAs remove utility default risks.</p><p>Currency risk hedging instruments encourage foreign capital, mirroring Morocco's Noor Solar Complex financing.</p><p>3. Strategic land allocation</p><p>With limited fertile land:</p><p>Create renewable energy zones on marginal or degraded lands.</p><p>Streamline land leasing via one-stop BOI processes.</p><p>Enforce dual-use designs to protect agricultural productivity.</p><p>4. Infrastructure modernisation</p><p>An upgraded grid is vital:</p><p>Deploy smart grid tech with AI-based forecasting and automated balancing.</p><p>Expand high-voltage corridors linking renewable-rich regions to demand centres.</p><p>Enable cross-border power trade via India-Sri Lanka interconnection projects to open export markets.</p><p>5.

The Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) - a joint venture between China Merchants Port Holdings and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) - opened in 2013 under a 35-year build-operate-transfer deal. It gave Colombo South Harbour the capacity to handle the world's largest vessels, cementing the port's status as South Asia's top transshipment hub.</p><p>Further south, Hambantota Port became the most talked-about infrastructure deal in the nation's modern history. Conceived under President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a second deep-water port, it struggled to attract traffic. In 2017, amid mounting debt, the unity government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe leased it to China Merchants Port for $ 1.12 billion on a 99-year term. Which perhaps was not a sensible move considering the length of the lease and the extent of land that was incorporated in the lease. For some, it was a lifeline; for others, a warning about debt and sovereignty.</p><p>Another key concession was the Colombo West International Terminal (WCT) agreement signed in 2021 - majority owned by India's Adani Ports  and  SEZalongside John Keells Holdings and SLPA. This marked the first Indian-led port development in Sri Lanka, signalling a diversification of strategic partners.</p><p>Real estate and tourism: concrete signals of confidence</p><p>Foreign investment wasn't just about cranes and containers. In 2014, Hong Kong's Shangri-La Group opened its Hambantota resort and followed with the One Galle Face mixed-use development in Colombo - a combined $ 800 million commitment. At the time, it was the largest foreign investment in Sri Lanka's leisure and property sectors, signalling confidence in tourism and urban redevelopment.</p><p>The most ambitious urban project, however, is Port City Colombo - a 269-hectare reclamation by China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). Launched during Xi Jinping's 2014 visit, its reclaimed land was completed by 2019.</p><p>This project would have been complete well ahead of 2019 if the Yahapalanaya government led by Prime Minister Rani Wickremesinghe did not oppose the continuation of the project. This also caused the Government to pay damages for stalling the project.</p><p>In 2021, Parliament created the Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC), giving the site its own investment regime and signalling the intent to position it as a regional financial and services hub.</p><p>Telecoms and digital infrastructure: quiet but consistent capital</p><p>While ports and towers dominated headlines, telecoms quietly became Sri Lanka's largest continuous foreign investment sector. Malaysia's Dialog Axiata has invested more than $ 3 billion since the mid-2000s, rolling out 3G, 4G, and preparing for 5G networks.</p><p>In 2018, Hong Kong's CK Hutchison merged Hutch with UAE-owned Etisalat Lanka, creating a stronger third mobile player. These moves have given Sri Lanka one of South Asia's most competitive and affordable telecom markets - a foundation for the country's growing digital services exports.</p><p>Apparel and manufacturing: the steady earners</p><p>Even amid megaproject glamour, the quiet workhorses of Sri Lanka's export economy remain its export processing zones (EPZs). The apparel sector, with significant foreign joint ventures, dominates these zones - particularly Katunayake, Biyagama, and Koggala.</p><p>Brands like Brandix and MAS Holdings have used FDI partnerships to move up the value chain, building 'green' factories and design capabilities, keeping Sri Lanka's products competitive even as labour costs rise.</p><p>Renewables: the next frontier</p><p>In the early 2020s, Sri Lanka began courting large-scale renewable energy projects, aiming to tap wind corridors in the North and solar potential across the island. A flagship initiative was the 2022-2023 partnership agreements with Adani Green Energy for wind power in Mannar and Pooneryn.</p><p>These projects reflected a shift from infrastructure-heavy FDI to investments in energy security and climate resilience. They also underscored the importance of clear, bankable contracts to attract long-term private capital into the power sector.</p><p>The brains behind the big bets</p><p>Mahinda Rajapaksa (President, 2005-2015): Political architect of Hambantota Port and Port City Colombo, with an emphasis on Chinese capital and infrastructure megaprojects.</p><p>Ranil Wickremesinghe (Prime Minister during key deals, later President): Negotiated the Hambantota lease and facilitated agreements to diversify Colombo port investment partners. Which perhaps was not a sensible move considering the length of the lease and the extent of land that was incorporated in the lease.</p><p>Board of Investment (BOI): The country's investment promotion agency, instrumental in facilitating approvals for large projects across manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure.</p><p>Colombo Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC): Established in 2021 to govern the Port City's special economic zone, a structural innovation in Sri Lanka's investment framework.</p><p>Corporate champions: China Merchants Port, CHEC/China Harbour, Adani Ports  and  SEZ, John Keells Holdings, Dialog Axiata, Shangri-La Group - all have left visible footprints on Sri Lanka's economic landscape.</p><p>From mega-projects to measured reform</p><p>The numbers show how fragile FDI flows have been. In 2018, inflows topped $ 1.6 billion. By 2023, after the Easter 2019 attacks, COVID-19, and the 2022 debt crisis, they had fallen to $ 730 million.</p><p>In 2023, under an IMF Extended Fund Facility, the Government embarked on reforms aimed at stabilising the currency, restructuring state-owned enterprises, and improving the investment climate. The Board of Investment reported early signs of recovery in project approvals, but reaching the regional benchmark of 2-3% of GDP in FDI will require consistent policy delivery.</p><p>The road ahead: five watch points</p><p>1.Execution at Colombo West International Terminal - on-time delivery and operational performance will set the tone for future port concessions.</p><p>2.Anchor tenants at Port City - law firms, BPM providers, and financial services players will test whether the SEZ's incentives are credible.</p><p>3.Transparent renewable energy agreements - essential to unlock the multi-billion-dollar clean energy pipeline.</p><p>4.Digital infrastructure scaling - 5G rollout and fibre expansion will determine if Sri Lanka can grow its IT/BPM exports.</p><p>5.Policy continuity - perhaps the single biggest determinant of whether investors see Sri Lanka as an opportunity or a risk.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>From 2004 to 2024, Sri Lanka's FDI journey has been a mix of bold ambition, uneven execution, and political shifts.

Global foreign direct investment fell by 11%, marking the second consecutive year of decline and confirming a deepening slowdown in productive capital flows, while revealing a critical disconnect between where capital flows and where development needs are most acute. The report's central thesis - that 'too many economies are being left behind not for a lack of potential - but because the system still sends capital where it's easiest, not where it's needed' - resonates particularly strongly for an economy that is rebuilding its investment credentials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investment Reality Check</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">International project finance - often crucial for infrastructure - fell by 26% in 2024. The drop was especially steep in sectors critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - renewable energy (-31%), transport (-32%) and water and sanitation (-30%). The global pullback from infrastructure finance compounds the challenge of securing the estimated $ 4 trillion annually needed for sustainable development in developing countries worldwide. Investments into digital projects, the issue is one of concentration where just ten countries accounted for 80% of all greenfield projects in the Global South.</p><p>For a country that desperately needs infrastructure investment to support economic recovery and climate resilience, these trends suggest that traditional financing models may prove insufficient. These sobering statistics on global flows come alongside rising investment needs in Sri Lanka - to upgrade the power grid, improve transport networks, and enhance water management systems. While domestic savings alone cannot fund these massive capital injections, a refocus on innovative approaches to mobilising domestic capital may be needed. The report's emphasis on blended finance mechanisms suggests that Sri Lanka must become more sophisticated in structuring public-private partnerships that can attract patient capital.</p><p>Regional context and competitive positioning</p><p>The divergent regional trends highlighted in the report offer both challenges and opportunities for Sri Lanka. In developing economies, regional trends diverged: Africa saw FDI rise 12% (net of a single large project in Egypt). Asia remained the world's top FDI recipient, despite a modest 3% decline. Countries in Southeast Asia posted a 10% rise, reaching $ 225 billion - the second-highest level on record. South Asia's performance remains uneven, with India leading the pack.</p><p>Sri Lanka's challenge lies in positioning itself competitively within Asia's investment landscape while overcoming the reputational damage from its recent economic crisis. The country's traditional strengths - strategic location, educated workforce, and English proficiency - remain relevant, but investors now demand greater regulatory predictability and policy consistency. Furthermore, attracting investment into the digital economy demands new capabilities. The country's universities and technical institutions must rapidly adapt curricula to meet evolving skill demands, while regulatory frameworks need updating to support digital innovation without compromising security and privacy.</p><p>Geopolitical fragmentation and investment flows</p><p>The investment landscape in 2024 was shaped by geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation and intensifying industrial policy competition, according to the UNCTAD report. These dynamics, combined with elevated financial risk and uncertainty, are redrawing global investment maps and eroding long-term investor confidence.</p><p>For Sri Lanka, this fragmentation presents both risks and opportunities. The country's historically non-aligned foreign policy stance could prove advantageous as multinational companies seek investment destinations that offer political stability without forcing difficult geopolitical choices. However, this requires maintaining delicate diplomatic balance while ensuring that domestic policies create an enabling environment for investment. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka may need to increasingly consider national security issues in investment policy and regulation, as we pointed out in a recent CSF Discussion Paper ('The Emergence of National Security Considerations in Foreign Investment Regulation').</p><p>Sustainable finance: A window of opportunity</p><p>The growing emphasis on sustainable finance presents a unique opportunity for Sri Lanka to reframe its investment narrative. With global sustainable fund markets expanding rapidly and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria becoming central to investment decisions. The report underscores that sustainable finance flows are increasingly directed toward projects that demonstrate clear alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>For Sri Lanka, this means that infrastructure projects combining climate resilience, digital connectivity, and social impact could access financing streams unavailable to purely commercial ventures. The country's recent moves toward green bonds and sustainability-linked financing represent early steps, but a more comprehensive sustainable finance framework - including robust environmental and social safeguards, transparent reporting mechanisms, and clear performance metrics - will be essential to tap into this growing capital pool. As traditional FDI flows become more volatile, sustainable finance offers Sri Lanka a pathway to attract long-term, development-oriented investment that aligns with both recovery imperatives and climate commitments.</p><p>Mobilising domestic capital</p><p>Even as Sri Lanka remains sanguine about international sustainable finance flows, it's useful to remain realistic about how soon and in what volumes these may come to Sri Lanka. While macroeconomic conditions improve, sovereign ratings upgrade, and foreign investor confidence builds, turning our attention to domestic sources of capital is important. Mobilising domestic sustainability-linked bonds, green deposits, special development financing windows in state banks, and blended finance mechanisms to attract multilateral finance to 'tag team' with domestic finance, should receive renewed focus.</p><p>Strategic imperatives for policy reform</p><p>Sri Lanka's ongoing International Monetary Fund program has focused heavily on fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability - necessary but insufficient conditions for a sustainable recovery in growth. The UNCTAD findings suggest that without complementary policies to attract quality FDI, the country may find itself trapped in a low-growth equilibrium.</p><p>The report's call for 'smarter capital - long-term, inclusive and aligned with sustainable development' should inform Sri Lanka's investment promotion strategy. Rather than competing solely on traditional factors like low cost factor input (like labour) or revenue-eroding tax incentives, the country must position itself as a sophisticated, well-governed, and environmentally-conscious destination for transformative investments.</p><p>Successive recent Governments' efforts to streamline investment approvals and establish one-stop services represent positive steps, but deeper reforms are necessary. Progressive elements of the Economic Transformation Act (mainly enshrined in its Investment chapter) merit stronger consideration, as they provide for robust new platforms like the Economic Commission and Invest Sri Lanka (to drive FDI promotion and facilitation), and consolidates and updates Sri Lanka's international investment obligations. The global trend toward investment concentration in digital sectors means that without deliberate policy intervention, the country risks being relegated to the periphery of the digital transformation that will define 21st-century economic competitiveness.</p><p>Turning crisis into opportunity</p><p>The World Investment Report 2025 serves as both warning and roadmap for Sri Lanka. The global investment environment is becoming more challenging, but countries that adapt quickly to new realities can still attract transformative capital.</p><p>The key lies in recognising that the traditional model of competing for FDI through regulatory arbitrage and cost advantages is becoming more and more obsolete. Tomorrow's winners will be countries that can offer modernising digital economy and trade infrastructure, skilled workforces, and regulatory frameworks that support openness while managing risks responsibly.</p><p>Sri Lanka's current economic difficulties, while painful, may paradoxically position the country to benefit from the global investment recalibration that the latest UNCTAD report describes. The economic and governance reforms being undertaken as part of Sri Lanka's larger restructuring could make the country an attractive destination for investors seeking stable, predictable environments, in an uncertain global environment volatile world. Sri Lanka's path to sustainable recovery depends on positioning itself not just as a reformed economy, but as a forward-looking partner for investors seeking stable, sustainable returns in an uncertain global environment.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["The global pullback from infrastructure finance compounds the challenge of securing the estimated $ 4 trillion annually needed for sustainable development in developing countries worldwide.

The initiative was commenced in 2019, and Abans PLC renewed their support for five more years through to 2030 by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between WNPS and Abans PLC on 31 May 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Spread across 372 hectares, the Bellanwila-Attidiya wetland, which was gazetted in 1990 is home to over 150 bird species (including rare migratory visitors), endemic reptiles, mammals like the Otter and Rusty-spotted Cat, and the endangered Purple-faced Leaf Monkey. This key wetland sanctuary adjacent to Colombo (being the only wetland Capital City in the world), is protected with the status of 'Sanctuary' under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (FFPO) of Sri Lanka. Years of invasive species persisting, and unmanaged pollution had reduced the sanctuary's ecological integrity, which prompted the need for urgent restoration.</p><p>The Green Isle Project is focused on reversing this degradation through scientific habitat restoration, habitat enrichment, public awareness, and long-term ecological monitoring on the 40 acre island. These efforts are now managed by the WNPS PLANT (Preserving Land and Nature) subcommittee which has years of experience in preserving large areas of lands with sensitive eco systems around Sri Lanka, and are engaged in developing over 20 kilometres of Forest corridors across sensitive landscapes.</p><p>'This is not just about restoring a wetland - it's about securing a future where both people and nature can thrive together in our capital city,' said the WNPS President Graham Marshall.

Teams will soon embark on doing a Rapid Biodiveristy Assessment on the Island and the surrounding area, which will provide critical insights on the different lifeforms within this ecosystem. Under this initiative, the entry of more urban wildlife into the area is expected, in addition to a boost in the research conducted within the area. The area will be enriched with over a thousand trees to increase the sources of food through fruit trees and to enhance biodiversity. Through these actions, the habitat loss of the endangered and endemic Purple-faced Leaf Monkey (Western subspecies nestor) is expected to be mitigated.

In an exclusive online discussion from Brussels, Douglas spoke with the Daily FT, offering a visionary outlook on the implications, opportunities, and future of regenerative agriculture powered by the cooperative movement. Here are excerpts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: ICA joining regenagri's board has been hailed as a game changer. Could you elaborate on why this partnership is so pivotal for ICA members globally, and particularly in a nation like Sri Lanka?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This partnership represents more than a simple collaboration; it is the confluence of two powerful, shared visions aimed at fundamentally transforming global agriculture through sustainable, farmer-centric, regenerative practices. The International Cooperative Alliance is the global voice for a movement that encompasses over one billion members, a significant portion of whom are smallholder farmers who act as stewards of our planet's land and resources. For too long, these farmers have been at the mercy of volatile markets and degrading environmental conditions. This alliance is a declaration that a new era is possible.</p><p>Regenagri's proven, data-driven methodologies and certification frameworks provide the tools for this transformation. They offer a clear pathway for farmers to access higher-value markets that are increasingly demanding proof of sustainability, enabling them to build prosperous livelihoods while actively healing their environment. In a country like Sri Lanka, where agriculture is the very backbone of rural economies, embracing regenagri standards is not just an upgrade-it's a paradigm shift. It is about empowering farming communities to build a future defined by resilience, greater productivity, and profound ecological harmony.</p><p>Q: What does regenerative agriculture specifically offer the smallholder farmers of Sri Lanka?</p><p>Regenerative agriculture offers a pathway to liberation and sovereignty for smallholder farmers. At its core, it is about restoring the natural vitality of the earth-it fundamentally rebuilds soil health, enhances biodiversity, and contributes to the global effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all while increasing the productivity of the farm. For Sri Lanka's dedicated smallholders, this translates into a cascade of benefits: healthier, more resilient soils that can better withstand climatic shocks, leading to more stable and abundant yields. More than that, it builds resilience against the escalating climate crisis, which is a critical advantage in a nation so frequently affected by extreme weather events.</p><p>Furthermore, this partnership unlocks new economic pathways. Through regenagri's carbon in-setting program, cooperatives can measure and verify greenhouse gas reductions and soil carbon improvements from their regenerative practices. This process generates verified carbon credits, which represent a reduction in the farm's carbon footprint. These credits can then create an additional revenue stream for the cooperative and its members by negotiating with the downstream buyers who are trying to reduce their carbon footprint and are willing to reward farmers for their positive environmental impact. It's a powerful model where ecological restoration translates directly to economic benefits.</p><p>Q: How do you envision ICA's membership in regenagri influencing the cooperative farming movement worldwide?</p><p>The ICA's global membership is a powerful network for change, and through it, we can scale the adoption of regenagri standards with unprecedented speed and impact. Cooperatives are not top-down institutions; they are built from the ground up, deeply embedded in the communities they serve. This inherent structure makes them the perfect vehicles for championing regenerative methods that resonate with both economic aspirations and environmental stewardship.</p><p>This creates a powerful domino effect: as one cooperative embraces regenerative agriculture and reaps the benefits, it inspires others. As more cooperatives join this movement, market opportunities expand, best practices are shared and refined, and farmers across the world benefit collectively from this shared wisdom. This is amplified by our strategic alliances, such as our long-standing partnership with Solidaridad, which allows us to pool resources and expertise to support cooperatives in their journey. Our ultimate goal is to make regenerative practices a cornerstone of the global cooperative identity, creating a mainstream movement driven by cooperative systems.</p><p>Q: What immediate opportunities does ICA see in implementing regenagri standards?</p><p>The most immediate and compelling opportunities are found in establishing transparency and achieving market differentiation. In today's world, consumers and international markets are not just buying a product; they are buying a story, a commitment. They are increasingly demanding credible, verifiable evidence of sustainability, and regenagri certification provides exactly that.</p><p>This allows ICA member cooperatives to move beyond local commodity markets and present verifiably regenerative products to the world, gaining a competitive edge and ensuring fairer returns for their farmer-members. For a nation like Sri Lanka, with its global reputation for premium tea, spices, and other export crops, regenagri certification is a golden opportunity. It can position its cooperatives as leaders at the forefront of the premium, sustainably, and ethically sourced agricultural products market.</p><p>Q: What role does technology play in making regenerative agriculture viable and attractive for smallholders?</p><p>Technology is the great enabler in this transition. It is central to the regenagri approach, democratising access to powerful tools and insights. Through the regenagri digital platform, farmers can accurately monitor the health of their soil, track water usage, and measure positive impacts on biodiversity and carbon sequestration.</p><p>This provides data-driven insights that empower smallholders to make informed decisions, optimise their practices, enhance productivity, and minimise their environmental footprint. Crucially, technology makes the process of verification and certification more efficient, scalable, and accessible for even the smallest farms, ensuring no one is left behind in this agricultural revolution.</p><p>Q: Looking ahead, how might this partnership between ICA and regenagri evolve over the next five years?</p><p>I see our collaboration deepening profoundly, becoming a cornerstone of our global strategy. Over the next five years, we anticipate a wave of adoption of regenagri standards across our vast network of ICA cooperatives, catalysing systemic and lasting change throughout global agriculture. We envision a future of enhanced data integration, where insights from millions of farms create a powerful feedback loop for continuous improvement. We will work to build a robust and vibrant global marketplace dedicated to regenerative products. Ultimately, this partnership will firmly establish cooperatives as the undisputed global leaders in sustainable agriculture, serving as a powerful demonstration of how our business model can deliver profound and positive environmental and socio-economic impacts.</p><p>Q: What is your message to policy makers in Sri Lanka and globally on the subject of regenerative agriculture?</p><p>My message is clear: regenerative agriculture is not merely a good practice-it is an essential policy for the 21st century. Policymakers must awaken to the immense potential that regenerative systems hold for building climate resilience, fostering sustainable economic growth, and advancing social equity. Governments have a critical role to play. By actively supporting regenerative practices through education, infrastructure development, research, and forward-thinking incentives, they can unlock transformative outcomes for rural communities and the health of our planet. Sri Lanka has the potential to become a shining example for the world, demonstrating how progressive policy and unified cooperative action can forge a future of agricultural sustainability and widespread rural prosperity.</p><p>Q: How optimistic are you that regenerative agriculture will become the norm rather than the exception?</p><p>I am incredibly optimistic, more so now than ever. We are witnessing a historic global momentum, a powerful convergence of forces. This change is being pulled by conscious consumer demand, pushed by the undeniable urgency of the climate crisis, and propelled by a new understanding of true value. The principles of regenerative agriculture resonate deeply with the innate values that farmers have always held-a profound connection to their land, a commitment to their communities, and the desire for economic stability. Through the ICA's global partnership with regenagri, we are not just participating in this movement; we are dedicated to leading it, ensuring that these life-affirming practices become the mainstream standard, transforming our world's agricultural landscape for many generations to come.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Q: What is your message to policy makers in Sri Lanka and globally on the subject of regenerative agriculture?

Further, this decision has generated negative responses and uninformed statements from the general public, as well as politically driven media outlets. Despite the negativity surrounding this issue, the sudden attention on the Sri Lankan salt industry presents an opportunity to discuss the real situation and the importance of safeguarding this unique industry for future generations. Before delving into the specifics of the recent events, it is essential to establish an overview of the salt industry in Sri Lanka.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka boasts a well-established saltern industry, with Government and private-sector companies holding nearly equal shares and dominance in the market. The country is nearly self-sufficient in salt production, comfortably meeting the annual demand of approximately 180,000 MT for domestic and industrial purposes through a widespread saltern industry located in the coastal regions of Puttalam, Hambantota, Alimankada, Mannar, and Trincomalee. Pure Vacuum-Dried (PVD) salt is imported by the food and pharmaceutical industries, where higher purity and specific physical properties are required. However, this minor dependency on imports should not be seen as a weakness of Sri Lankan salterns, we should only see it as an opportunity for growth. </p><p>Small yet significant efforts of the Sri Lankan saltern industry</p><p>More interestingly, the author noted an update from a private-sector salt producer in Sri Lanka entering the PVD market segment and was thrilled to pick up a packet of PVD salt from a supermarket shelf. Furthermore, it is worth noting the small yet significant efforts of the Sri Lankan saltern industry, such as the production of crystal-clear 'Singithi Lunu' salt for the export market. This product, created in the eco-friendly environment of the Bundala Saltern, is a specialty exported to the Japanese market. Harvesting salt is an ancient practice, but the history of the sector as an organised industry dates back to the colonial era of Ceylon, when prisoners were forced to work under the harsh conditions of salterns. However, the industry has undergone significant changes since then. Today, it is well-integrated into modern organisational structures that prioritise appreciable working conditions. At the heart of this industry are the salterns in the Puttalam area, where approximately 20,000 people depend on permanent or seasonal engagement with salterns for their livelihood. </p><p>If we have such a strong industry, what went wrong? What is the reason behind the recent salt shortage, leading the Cabinet to make the not-so-popular decision to permit the import of up to 30,000 metric tons of raw, non-iodised salt?</p><p>Salt industry in world is interestingly diversified which include solar evaporation, rock salt mining, vacuum evaporation and lake salt extraction as a basis to produce salt. Sri Lanka's salt industry relies on solar evaporation, which is highly sensitive to climatic conditions. A hot climate with minimal rainfall is essential, and a completely dry period of 40 to 45 days is required for the process. Solar evaporation-based salt production depends on the crystallisation points in different tanks, making uninterrupted dry weather crucial for efficiency. </p><p>Adverse weather conditions</p><p>All the salterns located in the coastal regions of Puttalam, Hambantota, Alimankada, Mannar, and Trincomalee are highly dependent on the weather patterns endemic to their area for harvesting salt from sea water. However, during the Maha season, a critical period for Sri Lanka's salt industry, the Puttalam area-a major production hub-experienced adverse weather conditions. Heavy rains and typhoons jeopardised the entire season for the salterns in the region, leaving some areas still submerged in storm water from recent events. </p><p>The Puttalam area encompasses 4,000 hectares of salterns, employing approximately 20,000 families directly and indirectly through its operations. It fulfils a significant portion of the country's salt demand (45%, according to statistics from private salt manufacturers). This unexpected disruption has interrupted the salt industry's operations, and projections indicate that without intervention, the first quarter of Sri Lanka's domestic and industrial markets could face a severe salt shortage. </p><p>Despite having to face heavy criticism for importing salt to an island surrounded by sea, the Government took a commendable step by authorising State Trading Corporation (a Government-owned trending arm) to urgently import 30,000 metric tons of non-iodised salt. This measure aims to stabilise the supply chain by distributing the imported salt among industry players to meet market demand effectively.</p><p>Cabinet decision on 18 December 2024</p><p>'The salt production of Sri Lanka is sufficient to meet the domestic and industrial requirements of the country, and the salt yield depends on weather conditions. It has been observed that there may be a shortage of supplying salt in the domestic market for the domestic and industry requirements in the year 2025 due to bad weather in the country. As a remedial measure, the salt manufacturers have made a request to grant permission to import 30,000 metric tons of raw non-iodised salt as per the prevailing duty rates to be processed and supplied to the market. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the joint proposal presented by the Minister of Trade, Commercial, Food Security, and Co-operative Development and the Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development to import a maximum of 30,000 metric tons of raw non-iodised salt on or before 31-01-2025 through the State Trading Corporation and to supply it to the local market.' </p><p>While this firefighting measure is appreciable, it is time to implement a sustainable solution to address the issue, as unpredictable weather patterns have become inevitable worldwide. As part of the climate crisis, erratic rainfall and an increase in extreme weather events like storms and typhoons disrupt the solar evaporation process, which requires prolonged dry periods with minimal rainfall. Flooding from heavy rains can damage saltern infrastructure, contaminate salt beds, and delay production cycles, leading to supply shortages and economic losses. As climate variability intensifies, the saltern industry faces growing challenges in maintaining consistent output, threatening livelihoods and the stability of salt-dependent markets. </p><p>While permitting imports is a temporary solution, the Government must take immediate action to safeguard and strengthen Sri Lanka's thriving saltern industry against these inevitable natural disasters. Such a solution is not simple - a multidisciplinary action is needed where policymakers, industrialists, and academics should team up towards a common goal. This is a call for such timely action.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 59, "title": "Yajith heads Alumni of Commonwealth Executive Master of Business Administration/Public Administration", "published": "2025-07-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The 7th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Commonwealth Executive Master of Business Administration/Public Administration (CEMBA/CEMPA) Alumni Association, Faculty of Management Studies of the Open University of Sri Lanka, was successfully convened at Hotel Solis in Pitakotte.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The event brought together alumni members to review the past year's activities, discuss ongoing projects, and plan for future initiatives.</p><p>The event was inaugurated with a welcome speech by the alumni president, Yajith De Silva, emphasising the importance of strengthening alumni networks and collaboration.</p><p>The Secretary, Patrick Victor, presented the annual report, highlighting achievements, member engagement, and financial statements.</p><p>Pro tem Chairman Prof. Nalin Abeysekera, whilst congratulating the outgoing executive committee proposed the name of veteran planter and Palm Oil Industry Association Chief Operating Officer Yajith De Silva for another term as the president of CEMBA/CEMPA Alumina.</p><p>Higher Education Commonwealth of Learning Advisor Dr. Jaco Oliver in a message expressing his gratitude to the Alumni conveyed that, 'The Commonwealth Executive Master of Business Administration and Master of Public Administration stand as flagship expressions of that mission.

This milestone arrives amid unprecedented climate disruptions, from record-breaking heat to extreme weather events and shifting climatic patterns. As global temperature rise threatens to exceed the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set in the Paris Agreement, the multilateral process faces core questions: Can it catalyse transformative action fast enough? Does its expanding scale compromise efficacy? And how can we ensure that negotiations in Bonn and Bel\u00e9m connect to ground realities as well as the needs and priorities of climate-vulnerable countries, groups, and communities?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the process?</p><p>Climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement follow a schedule with regular milestones throughout the year. In 2025, this includes the 62nd sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB62) in June and the 30th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP30) from 10-21 November in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil.</p><p>Since 1995, every year (with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) has seen sessions of the COP and the SBs, with attendance numbers steadily growing. While COP1 barely had 4,000 attendees, COP15 in Paris reached around 27,000, a number that was again dwarfed by recent COPs such as COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh (50,000 attendees), COP28 in Dubai (84,000 attendees), or COP29 in Baku (56,000 attendees).</p><p>This exponential growth reflects the growing scale of the climate crisis, but it also strains the process. Negotiators now navigate a maze of simultaneous consultations, drafting sessions, and conversations. SB62, which concluded on 26 June after two weeks of intense discussions, exemplified this challenge as it brought together thousands of delegates from across the world. More than 50 agenda items, over 30 mandated events, and a range of side events and dialogues took place in and around Bonn's World Conference Center.</p><p>In addition to SB62 and COP30, this year will also see two UNFCCC Climate Weeks, the first of which was hosted in Panama City in May. Furthermore, mandated workshops, the meetings of the constituted bodies, and events such as National Adaptation Plan Expo in Zambia complement a packed calendar for negotiators, observers, and the UNFCCC Secretariat.</p><p>These activities unfold against a backdrop of alarming scientific updates.

There are several key topics at the centre of global attention, such as finance, adaptation, just transition, and mitigation. For each of these thematic areas, there are different agenda items, workstreams, or work programs, such as the United Arab Emirates Just Transition Work Programme or the Sharm el-Sheikh Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme.</p><p>On finance, one of the key challenges is to follow up on the new climate finance goal set in Baku last year. Through the Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to $1.3T-referring to the aspirational new goal of scaling up finance provided to developing countries for climate action to at least $ 1.3 trillion per year by 2035-, negotiators try to address questions of quantity and quality of finance, ensure access, and explore financial mechanisms and instruments.</p><p>For adaptation, the Global Goal on Adaptation has been prominently featured through workshops, a group of experts developing indicators, and tense negotiations lasting until the evening hours of the last day of SB62. Key areas of divergence included the timeline and guidance for the work of experts; the operationalisation of the new Baku Adaptation Roadmap; questions on cross-cutting issues; and means of implementation, which are comprised of finance, technology, and capacity-building.</p><p>Furthermore, countries are expected to submit the third round of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0) ahead of COP30, which will allow the world to get a better understanding of collective ambition and help to identify gaps, needs, and areas for enhanced action.</p><p>Where do we go from here?</p><p>A decade after the Paris Agreement, the multilateral climate negotiation process stands at a precipice. The process has grown in size but still needs to deliver substance to ensure effective and equitable climate action. As negotiators attempt to make progress on a vast agenda, many other actors-such as observer constituencies, civil society organisations, researchers, academia, and the private sector-can play a role as well within and outside SB62 and COP30.</p><p>While the key topics largely remain the same--mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation--, there are specific workstreams and items to be addressed in 2025. From indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation to a clear roadmap for making the new finance goal a reality, much work remains to be done over the coming months and going into Bel\u00e9m.

The biodiversity that could have supported a thriving industry in pharmaceuticals, eco-tourism, and sustainable agriculture remains largely untapped and poorly researched.</p><p>In fact, the story of Sri Lanka's biodiversity is often one of lost opportunities and missed benefits. One glaring example is that of Kothala Himbutu (Salacia reticulata), a plant known locally for its anti-diabetic properties. Although Sri Lankan traditional knowledge recognised its medicinal potential, it was foreign researchers and companies that capitalised on it, developing profitable drugs without returning any benefit to the country of origin. This is a classic case of biopiracy-the exploitation of natural resources and indigenous knowledge without proper compensation or recognition.</p><p>If Sri Lanka is to protect its biodiversity while also benefiting from it, the Government, academic institutions, and private sector must work together to create a robust framework for research, development, and innovation. This includes investing in biotechnological research, encouraging interdisciplinary studies in ecology, medicine, and economics, and building infrastructure to support intellectual property rights and patents.</p><p>Additionally, there must be legislation to protect against the unauthorised use of native species and traditional knowledge. Material transfer agreements which allow access to local biodiversity to foreign research institutions and companies while ensuring benefit sharing of the results of those ventures is a primary necessity. Taking this one step forward Sri Lanka should look into collaborations which would return the benefits both in terms of monetary value and knowledge for such material sharing.

Over 30% of all food in the region is lost or wasted each year, which is enough to feed nearly 300 million people. From farm to fork, food loss and waste undermine nutrition, hurt farmers' incomes, fuel climate change, and strain both economies and ecosystems. But what if this crisis could be reframed as an opportunity?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reducing food loss and waste isn't just about efficiency; it's one of the most accessible and inclusive ways to improve food security, reduce poverty, and meet climate goals. Without planting a single extra seed, South Asian countries can boost food availability, raise rural incomes, curb emissions, and create green jobs. It's a win for people, the economy, and the planet.</p><p>Rising food demand</p><p>Today, countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka are grappling with rising food demand, erratic weather patterns, and persistent malnutrition. Business as usual is no longer an option. Reducing food loss and waste can be the lever that connects food security, economic growth, and climate action.</p><p>Take Bangladesh, for instance. More than one-third of all food produced is lost in the country. This comes at an enormous cost, equivalent to over 4% of GDP. Food loss accounts for 13% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the productivity of a quarter of its arable land. The good news is that the Government has recognised the issue as a policy priority. But turning this intent into impact will demand hard trade-offs, rethinking subsidies, investing in logistics, and backing small-scale innovators.</p><p>Bhutan, too, faces its version of this challenge. As the country aims for high-income status by 2034, it loses nearly 32% of major staples like rice and maize. With a dual food economy, split between subsistence farming and market-oriented production, the need for tailored solutions is critical. The country's food system must deliver not just food security, but also economic diversification, better nutrition, and jobs.</p><p>In Nepal, the figure is even more alarming: an estimated 43% of food is lost or wasted. Reducing that by just 30% could dramatically increase the supply of nutritious food to vulnerable populations. But change will require hard conversations around subsidies, food pricing, and distribution models.</p><p>Core structural issue</p><p>A core structural issue cuts across the region: food is simply priced too low to reflect its true value. Fertiliser and water subsidies, designed to boost production, often lead to overuse, inefficiency, and waste. Smarter support systems, such as direct cash transfers, can help reorient agriculture toward nutrition security and environmental sustainability.</p><p>The good news is that innovation is already happening in the region. India offers a compelling case of how policy, technology, and entrepreneurship can converge to curb food loss. With AI-driven supply chains, solar-powered cold storage, and digital platforms linking farmers to buyers, India is rethinking the architecture of its food system.

But this cradle of Ceylon tea, famed from London to Beijing, is faltering. Soil, once fertile, now lies tired from years of chemical overload. Pest outbreaks are more frequent. Fertiliser prices have soared beyond reach. And the cup, once golden, is losing its richness. 'The rain used to come like clockwork,' says Gamage Bandara, a second-generation tea farmer I met during one of my trips to Sri Lankan tea gardens. 'Now, it either pours like a flood or disappears for weeks. The leaves don't know when to grow anymore.' Gamage's lament echoes through the central highlands of Sri Lanka, where tea is more than a crop-it's heritage, livelihood, and national identity all steeped into one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crisis beneath the canopy</p><p>Sri Lanka's tea industry-once the pride of Ceylon and the third-largest tea exporter globally-is gradually wilting under the weight of environmental and economic distress. From the hill slopes of Nuwara Eliya to the low-grown estates in Ratnapura, the once-verdant plantations are confronting depleted soils, erratic rainfall, and rising temperatures that threaten both yield and quality. In 2022, the industry's output plunged to a 26-year low, with total tea production falling to 251 million kg from a high of over 340 million kg in 2013, according to the Sri Lanka Tea Board Annual Report.</p><p>However, the industry began to recover modestly in the following years. By the end of 2023, total production rose to 256.04 million kg, marking a 4.54 million-kg (+1.8 %) increase from 2022 (TEA Statistics, 2024). The upward trend continued through 2024: 262.16 million kg was produced by December, an additional gain of 6.07 million kg (+2.4 %) from 2023 (Market Reports - Ceylon Tea Brokers, Dec. 2024). While this modest rebound is promising, it remains significantly below the heights of the early 2010s and continues to face substantial challenges from climate impacts, soil degradation, and market instability. In fact, it will not be out of place to suggest that this downturn is more than cyclical. It's structural.</p><p>It would be a profound irony-and a strategic misstep-if Sri Lanka, a pioneer in regenerative tea, lets others overtake it in the global shift to sustainability. After all, it was Halgolla Estate that made history as the world's first Regenagri-certified tea estate, having implemented soil-restorative practices, wildlife conservation, and carbon footprint reduction to global acclaim. Likewise, Lumbini Tea Factory-the first to bring a group of smallholder outgrowers under Regenagri-has shown that long-term returns on investment come not just from environmental gains, but from lower input costs, premium market access, and greater climate resilience</p><p>Decades of continuous monoculture on steep slopes have eroded the health of Sri Lanka's tea soils-up to 412 t/ha/year in some highland plantations-far exceeding the 9 t/ha/year threshold and causing yield losses upward of 133 kg/ha annually (Wickramarachchi and Bandara, 2014). Soil organic carbon has dwindled to around 2.16% (pH 4.5), weakening nutrient retention and soil structure (Joachim and Pandithasekara, 2004).</p><p>The nationwide ban on chemical fertilisers in April 2021 led to a 35% drop in usage, slashing tea production nearly 18%, and costing the sector an estimated LKR 84 billion (US$425 million) (Drechsel et al., 2025).</p><p>Climate patterns have also become unpredictable: rising temperatures, erratic monsoons and intermittent droughts now reduce yields by roughly 4.6% per 1 \u00b0C warming (IWMI, 2025).</p><p>Collectively, these pressures have eroded yields by about 15%, degraded cup quality, and left farming families in severe economic and emotional distress-signalling a crisis beneath the green canopy.</p><p>Amidst these compounding crises, regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessity. Rooted in ecological principles and traditional knowledge, regenerative practices focus on rebuilding soil health, increasing biodiversity, and restoring the ecosystem services on which tea production ultimately depends. Unlike organic farming, which can often be prescriptive and yield-focused, regenerative farming emphasises long-term resilience, carbon sequestration, and farmer autonomy, as detailed by the Rodale Institute.</p><p>As global buyers-from Unilever to niche ethical tea brands-increasingly shift toward carbon-neutral, traceable supply chains, Sri Lanka has a window of opportunity to rebrand its tea not just as premium, but as planet-positive. The world's largest regenerative agriculture certification standard, Regenagri, offers a chance to lead that transformation.</p><p>Regenagri: The global benchmark for regenerative agriculture</p><p>Regenagri is the world's largest regenerative agriculture initiative, headquartered in London, UK, with over 2.2 million hectares under certification-more than any comparable program. Incubated by Solidaridad, the world's oldest and largest sustainability organisation, Regenagri operates as a Community Interest Company (CIC), jointly owned by farmers, businesses, and NGOs, ensuring equitable governance and shared accountability.</p><p>In tea estates, Regenagri promotes sustainable practices such as cover cropping, organic soil amendments, shade tree planting, and biodiversity corridors. Its certification process helps tea producers move beyond just \"chemical-free\" claims by verifying long-term ecological restoration and carbon sequestration through third-party audits. The platform also provides a digital hub for farmers to track data on soil health, water use, biodiversity, and greenhouse gases, ensuring transparent and continuous improvement.</p><p>For tea packers and brands, Regenagri certification ensures traceability from field to cup and opens access to premium markets demanding climate-smart products. With mounting global pressure to comply with sustainability laws like European Union's Green Deal, Regenagri offers both ecological and economic resilience for South Asian tea producers looking to future-proof their industry. For tea estates, regenerative farming isn't just good for the planet-it's also good business. Under the Regenagri framework, estates that adopt soil-friendly practices like composting, reduced tillage, agroforestry, and cover cropping can sequester carbon-essentially pulling harmful CO2 out of the atmosphere and storing it safely in the soil. What makes this powerful is that Regenagri provides a verified carbon certification system, aligned with global standards like the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064-2. Once verified, estates can generate carbon credits, which are tradable on environmental markets or sold to companies looking to offset their emissions. This creates an entirely new income stream for tea growers, especially at a time when input costs are rising and market prices remain volatile.</p><p>Evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment. Regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessity</p><p>Myths and truths about Regenerative Agriculture</p><p>Critics often mistake regenerative agriculture for simply being another form of organic farming. While organic bans chemical use, regenerative agriculture suggests planned reduction. In fact, regenerative practices go further, restoring soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and actively capturing carbon, making it a systems-based, outcome-driven approach rather than a fixed-input model.</p><p>Some argue it's too costly or too slow to scale. Yet evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment (ROI).</p><p>Concerns about initial yield drops are not visible in several pilots conducted across the world. NGO Solidaridad has shown through its field trials in 2020-22, that 13,000 farmers cultivating cotton and soy have increased yield by 20% to 30%, reduced input costs by 30%, and received a market price premium of 3%. This project shows economic and environmental viability. Importantly, the smallholder farmers in India were able to generate 2 carbon credits per acre in cotton in partnership with carbon project developer Boomitra.</p><p>Lastly, critics claim it's too radical for legacy tea estates. In reality, Regenagri supports phased adoption, allowing estates to implement hybrid models that integrate regenerative principles without disrupting ongoing operations-making the transition both practical and strategic.</p><p>Global momentum, local opportunity</p><p>Across the world, regenerative agriculture is not just a movement-it's becoming a market expectation. Meanwhile, global demand for regeneratively produced tea and other commodities is accelerating. Markets such as the EU, UK, and Japan are tightening sustainability regulations. The European Green Deal and the upcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (EUCSDDD) require exporters to prove deforestation-free, low-carbon supply chains (CBI Report, 2023). Germany's Lieferkettengesetz (LkSG) adds another layer of accountability for social and environmental compliance.</p><p>Importantly, Regenagri complements existing ethical labels like Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance rather than competing with them. However, it adds deeper ecological validation and carbon-traceable integrity. It's already attracting global brands like illycaff\u00e8, Candiani Denim, Giorgio Armani, and J.Crew, signalling that regenerative supply chains are becoming the gold standard in sustainability (Regenagri Certified Companies).</p><p>In this context, India's recent partnership between Solidaridad Asia and the Indian Tea Association (ITA) is a game changer. It aims to bring 100,000 hectares of Indian tea under Regenagri certification over three years-a move that could propel Indian tea industry into a global leader in regenerative, climate-resilient tea production.</p><p>Sri Lanka must not miss the bus</p><p>It would be a profound irony-and a strategic misstep-if Sri Lanka, a pioneer in regenerative tea, lets others overtake it in the global shift to sustainability.

It could mean exclusion from premium markets, especially in Europe, where regulations like the EU Green Deal and German Due Diligence Laws demand verifiable environmental compliance. Regenagri's framework, already in use by Sri Lankan estates like Halgolla, provides the tools, credibility, and international alignment required to keep \"Ceylon Tea\" not just relevant-but revered in a carbon-conscious world.</p><p>The question isn't whether Sri Lanka can afford to embrace regenerative agriculture.

Tea bushes thrive under a canopy of shade trees, soil hums with microbial activity, and farmers no longer fear the rain.

It's about moving forward-with nature, not against it. It aligns ancient wisdom with cutting-edge science, ensuring that Sri Lanka's proud legacy of Ceylon tea can weather the storms ahead.

Scientists believe that there is a risk of increased incidence of unforeseen diseases like corona in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the other hand, the poverty rate is also growing due to natural disasters caused by climate change. Statistics show that about 23 million people are displaced annually due to climate change. Natural disasters are estimated to continue to increase due to climate change. In that case, necessary steps must be taken to reduce the impact of damage caused by climate change. On the one hand, there is a growing population; on the other hand, the entire world is concerned about the harmful effects of climate change. The 29th meeting of the Climate Conference was held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.</p><p>UN experts called on countries worldwide to prioritize human rights protection with truly effective climate action for 2030 and agree on adequate, transparent, and legitimate financing for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 66,778 people are participating in this year's UN Climate Conference. Leaders from all over the world are meeting to address the climate crisis. Developing countries also discussed finance and trade. The question of what the most vulnerable countries have gained from climate change has arisen at the COP29 conference held in Baku. In the past, climate conferences have discussed increasing the use of renewable energy in implementing the Paris Agreement, financial support for technological innovation in developed countries, increasing the use of hybrid vehicles, transferring climate-resilient technologies to developing countries at low cost, and budgets to combat climate change.</p><p>Although it is difficult to deal with the effects of climate change in reality, more attention should be paid to increasing adaptive capacity to reduce this impact. For this reason, the importance of climate finance is immense. The effects of climate change are being observed more in developing countries. Recently, the harmful effects of floods, salinity, drought, and natural disasters have been noticeable in Bangladesh. Geographically, Bangladesh is a climate-vulnerable country.</p><p>In this case, money is needed to increase adaptive capacity. To improve the flow of flood water caused by climate change, a considerable amount of money is required to increase the navigability of local rivers. Money is also needed to produce renewable energy instead of coal-based power generation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is a need to analyze the extent to which the decisions taken at the COP conference in the past have been implemented. Since the impact of climate change is exceptionally high in developing poor and small island states, adaptive capacity must be increased by developing climate-resilient environments in these countries.</p><p>To increase this adaptive capacity, implementing the decisions taken at the COP conference is essential. There is no alternative to adaptation to protect the world from the harmful effects of natural disasters, food security, and health risks. Therefore, a realistic decision on climate finance is needed. Only the practical implementation of the decisions taken at COP29 can protect vulnerable countries, including Bangladesh, from the harmful effects of climate change. This year's weather disasters have encouraged developing countries to demand more funds. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has released a report highlighting how climate change is making life even more difficult for people fleeing war and persecution.</p><p>The report shows that three-quarters of the world's 120 million displaced people live in countries severely affected by climate change and that 65 countries are expected to face 'extreme climate-related hazards' by 2040. The harmful effects of climate change are increasing. Developing and poor countries are suffering the most. Small and island states are also suffering greatly. Crops are also suffering in this regard. Each crop requires a certain level of temperature for its production. If temperatures increase at an unexpected rate, there is a risk of crop production being disrupted. Greenhouse gases contribute to the increase in temperature.</p><p>The amount of greenhouse gases in the world is constantly increasing. According to the 2023 estimate, 57.4 gigatons of greenhouse gases are emitted annually. On the other hand, according to the Paris Agreement, there is an obligation to keep the increase in global temperature within 1.5 degrees Celsius. But if the temperature continues to increase like this, there is a risk that global temperature will increase from 2.5 degrees to 2.9 degrees Celsius. Therefore, according to the Paris Agreement, to keep the temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere will have to be reduced by about 43 percent by 2030. The amount of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gases has increased by about 50 percent compared to the previous industrial era. If the temperature has to be kept below 2 degrees Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere will have to be reduced by about 24 gigatons.</p><p>Oil and gas production through coal-based electricity generation must be reduced by 2040. Otherwise, stopping the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will not be possible. The number of natural disasters is increasing due to the impact of climate change. According to the United Nations, about 650,000 people die annually in drought, 577,232 in cyclones and storms, 58,700 in floods, and 55,736 in high temperatures. In recent years, about 40 percent of the world's land productivity has been reduced due to climate change.</p><p>The amount of cultivable land is decreasing due to salinity and natural disasters. In broad terms, food insecurity may increase due to climate change in the future. At COP29, Bangladesh focuses on securing funding to support a national plan that could benefit more than 50 million people in high-risk climate zones. Bangladesh is ranked as the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world. It faces regular natural disasters, including cyclones, floods, and heat waves, and it is estimated that climate change could displace 13.3 million Bangladeshis by 2050.</p><p>Bangladesh highlighted the need for developed countries to meet their annual pledge of $100 billion. Bangladesh also spoke about the complexity of accessing climate fund funding. Establishing a $700 million loss and damage fund was a key achievement of COP28. As the country most affected by climate-related disasters, Bangladesh welcomed this development. Bangladesh wants to play an influential role for the least developed, highly endangered, and vulnerable countries due to climate change at the COP29 conference. To this end, we decided to work together to resolve several important issues.</p><p>Bangladesh's agenda at COP29 revolves around three main agendas - climate finance, adaptation implementation, and implementation of the damage fund. Bangladesh has helped address displacement and loss of arable land from rising sea levels. The conference also advocated a strong financing mechanism to support the disadvantaged people affected by climate change. Bangladesh has worked with the attitude that countries that contribute the least to global emissions will receive priority in compensation. Bangladesh's inclusion in this issue is a significant step forward. Apart from government representatives, other participants in various events also participate in policy discussions, advocate for Bangladesh, and share their experiences. Not only at COP meetings and discussions on this issue occur at the UN, regionally, in different countries, and in other institutions within the country. Numerous reports have also been released based on these. But the pace of climate change is increasing. Bangladesh spends an amount equivalent to 5 to 6 billion US dollars annually from its annual budget on climate management.</p><p>It receives about one billion dollars annually from the international community. However, more money is needed to take appropriate measures, which is unlikely to be received from the global community. Bangladesh seeks support for allocating 200 billion US dollars to LDC countries. A proposal has been made to allocate 200 billion US dollars for the least developed countries (LDCs) and the most vulnerable countries to address the climate crisis challenges. Bangladesh has called on the European Union (EU) to support this proposal. This call was made at a bilateral meeting between LDC and EU ministers on the outcome of COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.</p><p>The meeting emphasized the need for a balanced and equitable agreement through cooperation between both parties to resolve the remaining issues. Bangladesh said that many problems remain unresolved. They called on both sides to work together to ensure a meaningful and inclusive agreement at COP29. At the meeting, the LDC ministers outlined their central positions, emphasizing the need for financial and technical assistance to address the impacts of climate change. EU ministers acknowledged the concerns of LDC countries. They reiterated their commitment to addressing climate risks and ensuring sustainable development. The meeting discussed important issues such as climate finance, adaptation, emission reductions, and the global stock-taking process. The meeting was identified as an essential step forward in taking effective action by giving importance to the voices of the most vulnerable countries in the final negotiations of COP29.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 52, "title": "Middle East: Escalating tensions in engine of global economy", "published": "2025-06-21", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The countries of the Middle East play a vital role in the global economy and are often referred to as the engine of the global economy, as the region lies at the heart of the world's energy system. It holds nearly half of the world's proven oil reserves and about one-third of its natural gas reserves. Nations such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are key to meeting global energy demand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key maritime routes, especially the Strait of Hormuz-through which one-fifth of the world's oil supply passes-highlight the region's strategic importance in both geopolitical and economic terms. Oil price stability is closely tied to the political and logistical conditions in this area. Any disruption in the region sends shockwaves through the global economy, affecting everything from fuel prices in Europe to manufacturing output in Asia.</p><p>The Middle East has historically been perceived as the world's primary supplier of fossil fuels, often reduced to the moniker of the 'global fuel station.' However, this view no longer captures the full breadth of the region's multifaceted economic significance. Today, the Middle East represents a critical node in the global economy-one that connects continents, facilitates trade, channels financial capital, drives innovation, and influences geopolitical dynamics. In an era marked by geopolitical realignments, climate transition, and technological disruption, the Middle East is not only maintaining its relevance-it is evolving into a diversified economic powerhouse.</p><p>Strategic trade corridors and global commerce</p><p>The Middle East occupies a pivotal geographic location, bridging Asia, Europe, and Africa. Its strategic importance is underscored by major maritime trade routes such as the Suez Canal, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. These waterways handle trillions of dollars in goods annually, forming the logistical backbone of global commerce.</p><p>Financial power and global investment</p><p>Beyond energy and trade, the Middle East wields substantial financial influence through its sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Entities such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets. These funds play a decisive role in shaping global investment trends, with allocations in infrastructure, technology, real estate, green energy, and even global sports leagues.</p><p>Simultaneously, countries like the United Arab Emirates are positioning themselves as international financial hubs by leveraging liberal investment laws, world-class digital infrastructure, and free economic zones. These reforms have attracted significant foreign direct investment (FDI), transforming the Gulf into an emerging centre of capital allocation and financial innovation.</p><p>Labour mobility and remittance flows</p><p>The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are home to millions of migrant workers from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. These labour migrants are essential to the functioning of Middle Eastern economies, particularly in sectors like construction, healthcare, and domestic services. At the same time, they send billions of dollars in remittances back to their home countries-such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the Philippines-supporting household consumption, foreign exchange reserves, and poverty alleviation.</p><p>This labour ecosystem has created a two-way economic dependence: while the Middle East benefits from an affordable, flexible workforce, several developing economies depend on this income for macroeconomic stability. Any disruption in labour markets-due to regional conflicts or economic downturns-can send economic shockwaves well beyond the Gulf.</p><p>Innovation and technological leadership</p><p>Although traditionally associated with hydrocarbons, the Middle East is increasingly making its mark in global innovation. Israel, often dubbed the 'Startup Nation,' is a global leader in fields such as cybersecurity, biotechnology, agricultural technology, and water resource management. These innovations are exported across continents, addressing challenges from food security in Africa to climate resilience in Asia.</p><p>Meanwhile, countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are investing heavily in digital transformation, artificial intelligence, smart city infrastructure, and clean energy. These initiatives-anchored by programs like Saudi Vision 2030-aim to diversify economic output and elevate the region's role in the global knowledge economy.</p><p>Tourism, culture, and soft power</p><p>As part of their economic diversification agendas, many Middle Eastern nations are turning to tourism and cultural diplomacy. Saudi Arabia has launched heritage tourism projects and relaxed visa restrictions under Vision 2030. The UAE has hosted global mega-events like Expo 2020 in Dubai. Qatar, after hosting the FIFA World Cup 2022, continues to invest in sports and entertainment as part of its broader nation-branding strategy.</p><p>These initiatives not only generate economic revenue but also contribute to the region's soft power, influencing perceptions, attracting investment, and integrating the Middle East more deeply into global service industries and aviation networks.</p><p>Geopolitical weight and global market influence</p><p>The Middle East's geopolitical dynamics continue to exert a profound influence on global economic stability. Conflicts involving Israel, Iran, Yemen, and Syria, as well as broader regional tensions, directly impact global oil prices, investor confidence, and diplomatic alignments. The region's central role in OPEC+ also grants it the ability to influence energy supply and pricing, which in turn affects inflation, monetary policy, and industrial output globally.</p><p>Major powers-including the United States, China, Russia, and the European Union-maintain significant strategic interests in the Middle East, whether through military presence, energy dependencies, or diplomatic engagement. The region's stability is therefore not just a regional concern, but a global imperative.</p><p>Regional conflicts and global economic repercussions</p><p>Current tensions between Iran and Israel underscore the extent to which regional conflicts can destabilise the global economy. Iran controls critical infrastructure, including its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, through which nearly one-fifth of global oil flows. Israel, in contrast, represents a hub of technological and defence innovation.</p><p>Should these tensions escalate further, the global economy would likely face:</p><p>Oil price surges, straining public finances and raising inflation.</p><p>Disruption of trade routes, leading to higher shipping and insurance costs.</p><p>Volatility in financial markets, as investors shift toward safe-haven assets.</p><p>Threats to labour remittances, particularly from Gulf-based Asian workers.</p><p>Decline in investor confidence and setbacks in post-COVID recovery across emerging markets.</p><p>Asian economies are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on Middle Eastern energy and remittances. Referring to the Middle East merely as the 'world's fuel station' is a significant understatement. The region is a complex, multi-dimensional driver of the global economy. It underpins energy security, facilitates vital trade flows, powers financial markets, sustains labour migration, and leads technological innovation.</p><p>As the global economy navigates structural transitions-such as climate change, digital transformation, supply chain realignment, and shifting geopolitical alliances-the Middle East will remain indispensable. Its ability to adapt and diversify will not only shape the region's future but also influence the trajectory of the global economy for decades to come.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Innovation and technological leadershipAlthough traditionally associated with hydrocarbons, the Middle East is increasingly making its mark in global innovation.

The Proprietary Planters Alliance (PPA) has emerged as a game-changing force with a clear mission: to give voice, vision, and viability to proprietary planters-Sri Lanka's underrepresented yet vital stakeholders in agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a time when global markets demand traceability, value-chain efficiency, environmental stewardship, and ethical labour practices, the plantation sector remains burdened by archaic structures and fragmented representation. This is the void the PPA is built to fill. With this intention in mind, PPA inaugurated its operations on 1 June, at a simple ceremony held at the Orient Club - Colombo.</p><p>The Office Bearers appointed are: Founder Dammika Kobbekaduwa Chairperson Dr. Janaki Kuruppu, Directors: Dr. Dilhan Sampath Jayatilleke, Upananda Karunaratne, Dr. R.A.D. Kumarawickrama, Dr. W.G. Somaratne, Rehan Jayathilake, S.M.P. Jayantha, Arjun Dharmadasa, Dr. Nadaraja Rejendran and Dyan Seneviratne.</p><p>PPA said for decades, proprietary planters-those who own and operate small to mid-sized tea, rubber, coconut, spice, and fruit estates-have lacked a centralised platform to lobby for policy, access finance, and leverage innovations. Unlike corporate plantations, these planters rarely benefit from RandD, climate adaptation schemes, digital agri-tools, or direct trade exposure.</p><p>Meanwhile, national goals like doubling the GDP to $ 160 billion and making Sri Lanka a smart agricultural hub are simply unattainable without tapping into the true potential of these grassroots actors.</p><p>PPA bridges this divide by acting as: A policy think-tank, a technical innovation platform, a channel for climate finance and ESG compliance and a collaborative hub for agri-tourism, value addition, and sustainable exports.</p><p>Its vision is to create a resilient, sustainable, and globally competitive proprietary plantation sector in Sri Lanka that leads in innovation, value addition, and ethical agricultural practices.</p><p>The mission is to empower proprietary planters through unified representation, advanced agronomy, policy advocacy, climate-smart innovations, and integrated value-chain management-enabling prosperity from plot to port.</p><p>PPA's strategic goals are:</p><p>Policy reform: Influence national agricultural, trade, and labour policy to favour modern proprietary estate models.</p><p>Value chain integration: Promote vertically integrated models from cultivation to retail, including tea-based wellness products and processed spices.</p><p>Innovation and digitalisation: Provide members access to precision agriculture, remote sensing, and AI-driven analytics.</p><p>Climate resilience and ESG: Implement globally aligned climate-smart practices and position members for green financing.</p><p>Market access: Enable direct links with exporters, supermarkets, and buyers for improved farm-gate pricing.</p><p>Capacity building: Facilitate continuous training, certification, and professional development.</p><p>Youth and gender equity: Encourage new generations and women to become plantation entrepreneurs.</p><p>At the launch of PPA, the Colombo Declaration was ratified as a defining milestone.</p><p>It is a formal charter of unity, purpose, and transformation for Sri Lanka's proprietary plantation community. This Declaration is not just a ceremonial pledge; it is the institutional backbone of a national movement toward a climate-smart, value chain-driven, and people-first plantation model.</p><p>PPA said the Declaration reinforces key commitments including ESG-driven agriculture, HRM-centered workforce transformation, policy engagement, and access to global green finance. By aligning proprietary planters around these shared objectives, the Colombo Declaration directly contributes to closing the productivity and market access gaps that have historically limited the sector's GDP contribution.</p><p>In essence, the Colombo Declaration positions PPA as a strategic national instrument to unlock the latent economic value in Sri Lanka's plantation economy-potentially adding billions to the country's agri-GDP through inclusive, sustainable growth.</p><p>Why every proprietary planter must join</p><p>1. Power in numbers:</p><p>Alone, a planter is a commodity producer. As a member of PPA, you become part of a national movement with lobbying power, donor engagement, and export linkages.</p><p>2. Tools of the future:</p><p>Access the latest in satellite crop monitoring, regenerative soil tech, and climate insurance models.</p><p>3. Policy access:</p><p>Be at the decision-making table-on issues ranging from subsidy allocation to land reform and smart agri-investments.</p><p>4. Climate and ESG compliance:</p><p>Get certified, get recognised, and get financed. PPA's alignment with global standards allows members to qualify for carbon credits, green loans, and sustainability-linked certifications.</p><p>5. Shared prosperity:</p><p>PPA offers a space for collaboration-not competition-among fellow planters, innovators, and financiers.</p><p>While rooted in Sri Lanka, PPA offers a scalable model for tropical countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America-regions with similar plantation legacies and rural enterprise structures. Whether it's nutmeg in Kerala, coffee in Ethiopia, or cacao in Ecuador, the proprietary planter model remains a potent but under-leveraged development tool.</p><p>PPA said the time for waiting is over. 'Whether you're a third-generation tea grower in Kandy, a cinnamon cultivator in Matara, or a fruit planter in Monaragala, the PPA is your passport to relevance, resilience, and returns,' it said.</p><p>Colombo Declaration KPIs:</p><p>Net income per hectare (? by 20-30%)</p><p>Youth participation in plantation ownership (? by 50% in three years)</p><p>% of estates adopting traceability tools</p><p>% of members accessing green finance or ESG-linked investment</p><p>Macro Impact to GDP: If even 30% of Sri Lanka's 200,000+ proprietary holdings align with PPA's Colombo Declaration framework, it could conservatively add Rs. 300-500 billion annually in value-added export earnings and agri-tourism-boosting national GDP by over 1.5% points within five years.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Value chain integration: Promote vertically integrated models from cultivation to retail, including tea-based wellness products and processed spices.

Some blamed COVID-19. Others pointed fingers at international lenders or global oil prices. But beneath these surface shocks lies a deeper truth the IMF laid bare in it's first-ever Governance Diagnostic for Sri Lanka: corruption-not crisis-broke the nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka isn't alone. Lebanon, Nigeria, Zambia, and Argentina have all walked a similar path-resource-rich, debt-burdened, and paralysed by public mistrust. In each case, corruption didn't arrive like a tsunami. It crept in like termites, quietly hollowing out institutions, budgets, and hopes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Corruption: The Hidden Tax on Progress</p><p>Each year, over US$1 trillion is lost globally to bribery and embezzlement-enough to fund universal education four times over. In Sri Lanka alone, the Auditor-General flagged Rs.100 billion in irregularities in 2021-more than the entire Samurdhi welfare budget.</p><p>What does that mean for the average citizen? It means overpriced medicines. Underfunded schools. Roads to nowhere. And businesses burdened with 'facilitation' fees just to navigate bureaucracy. Surveys show honest companies in corrupt environments lose up to 20 per cent of revenue to these hidden costs. When corruption decides who gets contracts, competence takes a back seat-and the nation pays the price.</p><p>One global study by Cambridge University found that a 10-point improvement in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) boosts annual growth in 'genuine wealth' per person by 0.6 per cent. That's not just GDP-it's long-term prosperity measured by education, natural resources, and well-being. In short: cleaner countries grow stronger.</p><p>How Corruption Becomes a Debt Trap</p><p>Here's how the cycle works: Corrupt officials greenlight mega-projects not because they're needed, but because they're lucrative-for themselves. These white elephants are often funded by opaque, high-interest commercial loans like International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), which bypass the safeguards of multilateral lenders such as the World Bank. By 2021, 36 per cent of Sri Lanka's external debt was in ISBs, which swallowed 70 per cent of interest payments. We borrowed more to cover old loans, until there was nothing left but default.</p><p>Mattala Airport, built at a cost of US$200 million, now sees fewer passengers than a rural bus station. Flood-control projects, meanwhile, languish for lack of funds. This isn't just mismanagement-it's theft with receipts.</p><p>Transparency International's 2024 study found that 97 countries at risk of debt distress had one thing in common: corruption disguised through shady loans. It's not that the money didn't exist, it just didn't reach the people.</p><p>The Cost We Don't See</p><p>Corruption is not just about kickbacks or padded invoices. It erodes the very soul of a nation. It widens inequality-elite school spots go to the highest bribes, not the brightest child. It destroys trust-citizens stop believing in the ballot or the law. And it saps the will to reform-why fight a system rigged to protect the powerful?</p><p>In 2022, Sri Lankans took to the streets in the 'Aragalaya' protest movement, driven not by ideology but by exhaustion. Their rallying cry wasn't 'left' or 'right'-it was simple: 'Stop the corruption.' The real cost of graft is measured in nine-hour power cuts, empty pharmacy shelves, and shattered public trust.</p><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Illusion</p><p>When former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa took office in 2019, loyalists touted him as 'Sri Lanka's Lee Kuan Yew'-the man who would bring Singapore-style discipline to governance. But charisma is no substitute for systems. Singapore's success wasn't built on slogans; it was forged through fearless institutions.</p><p>In Singapore, ministers and their relatives can be arrested-and are. Public servants are paid well and promoted on merit. Asset declarations are published, lifestyle audits are real, and corruption trials conclude in months, not decades.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, by contrast, bribery investigations stretch over years. Conviction rates hover below 4 per cent. Asset registers exist, but no one sees them. And public contracts often come with secret riders and whispered deals. As the IMF bluntly observed, the problem is not the lack of laws-it's the absence of political will to enforce them.</p><p>So, What Does Work?</p><p>Countries like Denmark, Singapore, and Estonia offer blueprints. Denmark leads global rankings for clean governance not by chance, but by design: Independent courts that prosecute without fear or favour.Transparent procurement, with all public contracts over $7,000 listed online.Coalition politics that require compromise, preventing any one group from capturing the state.Professional civil services where appointments are based on merit, not loyalty.High social trust, built over generations by showing that public money serves the public good.</p><p>This integrity dividend pays off: Denmark has universal healthcare, free universities, and national debt below 35 per cent of GDP. In other words, clean governance is the cheapest infrastructure a nation can build.</p><p>What Can Sri Lanka Do? The solutions aren't abstract or impossible, they're practical, proven, and already working elsewhere. First, Sri Lanka urgently needs a strong Public Procurement Act to close loopholes and bring all major government spending under transparent rules. Customs and tax processes must be digitised to reduce the human discretion that enables bribery. Citizens should be able to track how every rupee is spent through real-time budget dashboards. Political campaign financing must be audited, with clear donation limits to curb undue influence. State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) should publish their performance goals and progress quarterly. Specialised anti-corruption courts, like the fast-track model used in the Philippines, can ensure swift justice. Whistle-blowers deserve rewards and protection, as seen in India's tax system. Integrity agreements to uphold ethical standards in public tenders-can prevent collusion in major contracts. Gender-responsive budgeting and more women in financial leadership have shown to reduce misuse of funds. Finally, investing in civic tech tools-like apps that let citizens report corruption anonymously-can unleash the power of public oversight. Even adopting half of these reforms could improve Sri Lanka's corruption ranking significantly and lower borrowing costs-freeing up critical funds for schools, hospitals, and climate resilience.</p><p>A Matter of Mindset</p><p>Sri Lanka's hope doesn't lie in a messiah figure, but in a mind shift. Corruption survives because too many believe 'everyone does it' or that 'nothing will change.' But 'Aragalaya' showed otherwise. When citizens speak with one voice, systems begin to move.</p><p>As Singapore's founding leader once said: 'If you want to fight corruption, be ready to send your friends and family to jail.' Sri Lanka's leaders still shy from that Rubicon.</p><p>But we can no longer afford the cost of silence. Each day we delay reform, we pay in wasted talent, lost investment, and broken dreams. Corruption steals twice: first the Treasury, then the future.</p><p>The Road Ahead</p><p>Clean governance is not the icing on the cake of development-it is the oven that bakes it. Without it, debt explodes, infrastructure rusts, and citizens lose hope. With it, every rupee borrowed builds a bridge-not to a Swiss bank, but to a better tomorrow.</p><p>So, to those still searching for 'our Lee Kuan Yew,' know this: his true legacy isn't a statue. It's a system.

Mr Ahmed Rafay Alam, an environmental lawyer, shed light on governance related challenges, which augment climate-induced threats to Pakistan's security. The last speaker, Ms Sarah Hayat, Climate Law and Policy Expert, discussed the need for climate adaptation and mitigation as a way forward to a secure future for Pakistan.</p><p>In his concluding remarks, Air Marshal Asim Suleiman (Retd), President, CASS Lahore, said that despite contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan has endured the harsh realities of climate change. He highlighted that the crisis does not stop at natural disasters, rather it extends to straining the economy, political stability, and social fabric of Pakistan, besides intensifying regional tensions. The President acknowledged Pakistan's initiatives to combat climate change, however, he stressed the need for international cooperation, considering this to be a shared endeavour.</p><p>The seminar highlighted various key points. The speakers pointed out how certain lapses in management in the past have contributed to the escalating severity of climate change threats. They also emphasised the need for inclusive climate resilient strategies at the federal, provincial and local levels.

It flew lower over Colombo like a ghost of ambitions long dead, its overhauled engines growling through the suffocating air, while crowds gathered below in religious fervour - not to protest, not to question, but to celebrate. Yes, celebrate. Blessings were uttered, oil lamps lit, conch shells blown, cameras flashed, and ministers smirked like messiahs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This, we are told, is a national achievement. A refurbished aircraft, leased at extortionate cost, arriving in a nation that can barely afford paracetamol in government hospitals. We have stopped pretending we are a developing country. We are now a tragicomedy - a satire written by thieves, directed by clowns, and performed by an audience too traumatised to laugh.</p><p>What sort of nation throws a religious ceremony for a second-hand plane? What deranged psyche applauds its arrival while paying three times its actual worth because of the corruption of previous governments? And let's be clear - this is not some abstract budgetary oversight. This is blood-sucking fraud, perpetuated across regimes by suits who wore patriotism like a mask while robbing the public blind.</p><p>Minister Bimal Rathnayake - himself no stranger to the theatre of politics - reluctantly admitted in Parliament that the country is bleeding USD 800,000 every single month as a penalty for a fraudulent Airbus deal cooked up during the Rajapaksa era and carelessly mishandled during Ranil Wickremesinghe's tenure. The contract was poisoned from the start - a grotesque mixture of kickbacks, nepotism, and cover-ups - and instead of dismantling the fraud, the next administration simply reshuffled it. Now, to cap it off, we're leasing yet another aircraft at USD 275,000 per month while simultaneously paying for the one that never arrived.</p><p>If Dante were to write The Divine Comedy today, he'd carve a fresh circle in hell for Sri Lankan politicians, where demons wear ministerial suits and count Airbus payments in endless loops.</p><p>This is the audacity of post-war Sri Lanka. We don't punish corruption. We institutionalise it, celebrate it, and bless it with pirith.</p><p>There are no consequences. The architects of these frauds are not only free but revered - they run for office, build monuments, give speeches, and wag fingers on television. Meanwhile, the average citizen - robbed of fuel, food, and future - is told to tighten belts and 'support the nation.' What nation? The one that auctions its morality to the highest bidder? The one where cronyism is called policy and theft is baptised as economic strategy?</p><p>Let us be clear: this is not about a plane. This is about a population so thoroughly broken that we now mistake humiliation for honour. We've descended into the realm of ritualised failure - where every scandal is repackaged as progress, where every theft is a 'legacy issue,' and where every act of national degradation is masked with cheap cultural symbolism.</p><p>And make no mistake: this farce in the skies was not mere incompetence. It was theatre - meticulously planned, obscenely funded, and cynically marketed to a people whose memories have been eroded by propaganda and daily survival. There was choreography in the descent. There were cameras positioned to catch the wheels touching the tarmac as though history had landed.</p><p>But history didn't land. Duplicity did.</p><p>The same politicians who bankrupted our economy, stashed public wealth offshore, lied through teeth and ballot boxes - they are now the ones blessing this arrival as a turning point. Turning point toward what? Bankruptcy 2.0?</p><p>Our airline, once a modest symbol of national pride, is now a flying debt trap, loaded with bad leases, inflated procurement contracts, and staffed by political appointees whose only qualification is servitude to power. SriLankan Airlines is no longer an airline. It is a monument to systematic plunder.</p><p>This month, Sri Lanka's trade deficit ballooned to USD 717.5 million. Imports rose by 17.5%. Export growth is limping. But amidst this economic hemorrhage, what did we decide to do? Import more cars. Import another aircraft. Hold another thamasa.</p><p>We are an economy in reverse. A nation sprinting backward. Every other country in the region is talking about AI, digitisation, climate resilience. We are lighting incense sticks for a plane that's been flying since the early 2000s.</p><p>This is not development. It is devolution. This is not pride. It is performative delusion.</p><p>How long can we go on like this?</p><p>Do nations rot slowly? Or do they collapse all at once?</p><p>In Sri Lanka, we are experiencing both: a slow, calculated rot at the hands of an unpunished elite and a sudden collapse witnessed by a public too disoriented to scream. We have no functioning mechanism for accountability. The legal system has atrophied. The Auditor General's reports are read like bedtime stories, never actioned. Commissions are formed only to forget. Investigations launched only to distract. No prosecutions, no convictions. Only noise, followed by silence, followed by repetition.</p><p>We've entered the age of aesthetic governance - where symbolism has replaced substance, and distraction is the preferred political currency.</p><p>So here's the question that every citizen must now face without flinching:</p><p>Are we truly this gullible?</p><p>Or have we simply given up?</p><p>A plane arrives. We cheer. A billion rupees disappear. We shrug. A scandal erupts. We scroll. A minister lies. We yawn. This is the cycle now. The rituals of a failed republic.</p><p>And so, to the politicians behind this aerial charade: you may have fooled the cameras, but history won't be kind. And to the people of this nation - we must now decide whether we continue to dance beneath the debris of our own undoing or finally, irrevocably, say: enough.</p><p>Because if this is what we've become - a nation that blesses stolen planes while paying ransom for others never received - then perhaps the plane should not have landed. Perhaps it should have kept flying - far, far away from this spectacle of ruin.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["We are an economy in reverse. A nation sprinting backward.

'MB'), makes a passionate case for the primacy of wind in Sri Lanka's renewable energy transition. While MB certainly raises some valid points 'in general' however, on the other hand, his well-written piece clearly omits critical nuances required for a holistic understanding of not only Sri Lanka's energy but most importantly the economic, agricultural, and ecological realities of an island where over a third of Sri Lankans are still deprived of basic needs even in 2025 as per the recent World Bank report issued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is important to understand, Sri Lanka's path forward with 'renewable energy' must be based not just on potential megawatts or the immediate FDI monetary value the Government would receive to the country through local projects initiations as a short-term quick fix to increase foreign reserves in the country, but rather on long-term practical integration, socio-economic synergy, environmental preservation, climate resilience and most importantly the sustainability of these projects impacting the overall livelihoods and wellbeing of the present as well as future generations to come.</p><p>In this context, Noteworthy Global coming from a team of international professionals with ancestral Sri Lankan roots stands firm in unity on our ground on the value preposition we bring with regard to the wellbeing of Sri Lankan Future presenting the Sri Lankan Government - solar power - predominantly through 'Agrivoltaic Systems' - to provide a more feasible, equitable, and sustainable path than wind with the currently on-going discussions with ministerial officials in Sri Lanka on the same.</p><p>1. Wind power in Sri Lanka: Not without complications and long-term impacts</p><p>MB rightly notes that Sri Lanka has a theoretical wind potential of 20-24 GW. While numbers in theory is nice, the practical and economic feasibility of tapping into this potential is severely limited. According to the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA), only around 5 GW is technically exploitable due to land use restrictions, ecological constraints, and variability in wind resources.</p><p>Moreover, the centralised nature of wind farms demands large tracts of contiguous land - a rare commodity in an island nation like Sri Lanka with an already high population density and competing land demands unlike the New Zealand or Australia.</p><p>2. Economic and grid realities</p><p>Wind power is intermittent and demands heavy grid stabilisation investments. Sri Lanka's aging grid infrastructure is already under strain, and the integration of large-scale wind projects would necessitate costly upgrades, including storage and spinning reserves. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has consistently flagged this concern in its Long-Term Generation Expansion Plans (LTGEP).</p><p>In contrast, solar - especially decentralised solar with agrivoltaics - provides a modular and geographically dispersed energy supply that aligns better with grid realities and rural development goals.</p><p>3. Environmental and tourism impacts</p><p>The Mannar wind power project, often cited as a flagship success on the outset, has also drawn severe criticism. Environmentalists have constantly raised alarms about its location in a sensitive migratory bird corridor. The project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) itself acknowledges threats to species such as flamingos and eagles due to turbine density and power line infrastructure.</p><p>Additionally, wind farms generate noise pollution and visual disturbances that affect local communities and tourism. This is particularly problematic in areas with high ecological or scenic value-both abundant in Sri Lanka. Aesthetic degradation, shadow flicker, and noise make wind farms unwelcome in many localities.</p><p>Tourism, which contributed nearly 5% to Sri Lanka's GDP pre-COVID, must be protected. Large wind turbines on scenic coastal belts or hilltops may offer clean energy, but at what cost to Sri Lanka's competitive advantage as a nature-based destination?</p><p>4. Environmental and land use risks of wind energy</p><p>Impact on local farming and land access</p><p>Wind farms require substantial contiguous land areas, often leading to the leasing or acquisition of potential agricultural lands for decades. This process can result in the loss of arable land, displacement of farming communities, and heightened community resistance. Unlike the agrivoltaics project concept, which allow for dual land use (simultaneous agriculture and energy production), wind energy projects typically preclude agricultural activities on the occupied land, thereby imposing further long-term socio-economic externalities in a country like Sri Lanka which is already struggling with food security.</p><p>Scientific evidence and case studies:</p><p>a. India - Kanyakumari District: A study published in the Indian Journal of Science and Technology analysed the effect of wind farms on crop production in Kanyakumari District. Utilising remote sensing and GIS technologies, the study found that areas in proximity to wind farms exhibited reduced NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) values, indicating a decline in vegetation health and crop yields. The study linked this to microclimatic changes like temperature, humidity, and rainfall shifts.</p><p>b. China - Bashang Area: Research in the Bashang area of Northern China revealed that wind farms significantly inhibited local vegetation growth and productivity. Reductions in NDVI (8.9%), LAI (14.5%), and EVI (14.8%) were observed over a decade, attributed to increased land surface temperatures and decreased soil moisture due to turbine-induced turbulence.</p><p>c. Inner Mongolia Plateau: A study in Geography and Sustainability showed that wind farms increased nighttime surface temperatures and reduced net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation, particularly over forests, by an average of 12.37 gC/m\u00b2. These effects threaten ecological balance and local agriculture.</p><p>Implications for Sri Lanka:</p><p>Sri Lanka's agricultural sector has always been the backbone of rural livelihoods and food security historically making the nation known to have been self-sustained. Now, for the past few decades, while Sri Lanka is already facing climate vulnerability and high import dependency, further alienation of arable land could:</p><p>Reduce arable land availability, further limiting food production.</p><p>Displace farming communities, causing socio-economic distress in younger generations</p><p>Undermine food security, as nearly 28% of the population experiences food scarcity.</p><p>Worsen import dependency, with food import costs hitting $ 577.2 million in just the first four months of 2024 (15.4% YoY increase).</p><p>By any way wind farms do not offer solutions to these existing interconnected crises. Agrovoltaics, in contrast, increase energy access while protecting and enhancing agriculture, including through crop diversification, microclimate improvement, and land productivity helping the Sri Lankan economy in a synergistic cyclical manner with reduction of importation cost and increase of local job opportunities bringing revival back to the dying agricultural industry improving the rural livelihoods of the locals with new hopes of a secured and sustainable future.</p><p>5. Agrovoltaics: The synergistic pathway for Sri Lanka</p><p>Sri Lanka has faced many past economic failures ending up putting the burden towards the tax payers. The international hype of energy transition should be carefully tackled by Sri Lanka while also addressing the currently increasing food insecurity simultaneously than jumping to the bandwagon effect of trends and later regret with further damages to the economy beyond repair. This is why Noteworthy Global is heavy in our communications bringing the importance of Sri Lanka to adopt Agrovoltaics which enables solar panels to be installed above crops, allowing dual land use. A recent pilot in Anuradhapura already demonstrated a 35% increase in chilli yields due to moderated temperatures and controlled evaporation under solar panels.</p><p>Globally, Germany, Japan, and India have already adopted agrovoltaics to maximise land productivity and energy generation and other nations are also getting to this well proven eco-friendly sustainable strategy as we speak locally.</p><p>For Sri Lanka, this is more than technology-it is resilience, the strategy forward. Agrivoltaics offers:</p><p>Income diversification for farmers with improved living standards</p><p>Increased crop resilience during droughts</p><p>Better use of marginal lands, especially in the dry zone</p><p>Decentralised energy contributing to grid stability</p><p>6. A question of national priorities</p><p>MB suggests that solar alone cannot meet Sri Lanka's energy needs. However, this is a false dichotomy. The question is not wind or solar-it is about what works best for Sri Lanka to bounce back confidently given our national context and underlying present challenges as a community with over 20 million population.</p><p>In the face of a global community, it is no secret that Sri Lanka though rich in abundance in beauty as an island in its own splendour, suffers immensely from food scarcity, ecological vulnerability, and limited public finances and team Noteworthy Global is determined to work towards to bring this to a halt. Energy investments must address multiple national priorities simultaneously. Wind provides energy but leaves the land barren, communities displaced, birds endangered, and tourism compromised for years to come adding more pressure to the economy where current population no longer wish to be part of looking ways to migrate as possible for the betterment of their children's future with fear of insecurity in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Agrovoltaics addresses right to the existing burning roots bringing food security, climate resilience, farmer livelihoods, biodiversity, and energy access all at once right from the inception of investment facilitation in Sri Lanka. It is not just about electrons - it is about equity and economics which is all for a better living standard.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Sri Lanka must avoid the temptation of techno-fixes adapted in the developed part of the world making the mistake of ignoring ground realities of a developing island nation. Wind power may have theoretical promise with definite short-term financial gains to Sri Lanka, but at a high hidden cost to come negatively impacting ecological, agricultural, and social trade-offs making it a suboptimal choice in many parts of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Instead, we should champion solar, especially by way of implementing Agrovoltaic systems, as a practical, inclusive, and ecologically sound pathway forward. It should be noted, energy or investments from a given energy plant is not the end goal - human wellbeing, national resilience, and sustainable prosperity are.</p><p>Let us not pass the burden of poor decision making to our children and generations to come.

It was backed by substance</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The past few days have marked a significant moment in Sri Lanka's international diplomacy and its relationship with the Sri Lankan diaspora in Europe. With an invitation extended by the German President, Sri Lanka's President Anura Kumara Disanayake and Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath undertook a three-day official state visit to Germany that may well be remembered as a turning point in Sri Lanka's foreign relations. This historic state visit included a series of high-level diplomatic meetings, bilateral agreement signings, and a deeply emotional encounter with Sri Lankans living in Europe. As a participant and moderator of the diaspora meeting held in Berlin, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the remarkable atmosphere of hope, connection, and change that permeated the event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new tone in diplomacy</p><p>The visit was not just symbolic. It was backed by substance. President Disanayake and Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath met with key figures in the German government, including the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, along with several senior officials and business leaders. Discussions covered a range of topics, from development cooperation and climate initiatives to trade and investment. Several bilateral agreements were signed, laying the groundwork for stronger cooperation in technology, education, sustainable energy, and economic development. Germany, recognised globally for its leadership in environmental technology and sustainable development, signalled through these talks a renewed willingness to support Sri Lanka's ambitious plans for green energy and economic modernisation.</p><p>Sri Lanka's delegation presented comprehensive strategies aimed at enhancing education standards, fostering innovation, and ensuring inclusive growth that benefits all segments of society. The meetings conveyed a clear message: Sri Lanka is ready to re-engage with the world in a spirit of mutual respect, transparency, and strategic partnership. It was a refreshing departure from the traditional approach to diplomacy, grounded in a vision of inclusive growth and democratic accountability. The fact that the German government initiated and hosted this visit speaks volumes about the growing international confidence in Sri Lanka's potential and leadership.</p><p>The diaspora meeting: A moment of unity</p><p>Beyond the state functions, one of the most memorable aspects of the visit was the special meeting between the President and Sri Lankans residing in Europe, particularly those in Germany. Organised by members of the National People's Power (NPP) in Germany, the event drew nearly 300 attendees, a number that far exceeded expectations. Due to the limited size of the hall, many who wanted to attend could not be accommodated, highlighting the diaspora's eagerness to reconnect. But those who were present brought with them a wave of emotion, energy, and gratitude. It was clear that this was more than just a political meeting. It was a reunion of trust between a long-disconnected leadership and its people overseas.</p><p>As the moderator, I was deeply moved by the emotional expressions from attendees - people shedding tears of hope, applauding each statement with sincerity, and expressing their desire to contribute to Sri Lanka's transformation. The gathering included a diverse cross-section of the diaspora - students pursuing degrees in Europe, entrepreneurs involved in startups, cultural activists working to preserve Sri Lankan heritage abroad, and families who have made new lives in Germany and beyond.</p><p>The event was a vivid reminder that the Sri Lankan diaspora is a powerful force, eager not just to observe but to actively participate in the country's future. In a time where global politics is often clouded by cynicism, this gathering reminded us of the power of authentic leadership and grassroots connection. It demonstrated that diplomacy is not only conducted in grand government halls but also in heartfelt conversations and shared dreams.</p><p>Why it matters</p><p>This visit was important for three major reasons:</p><p>1.Restoring global confidence in</p><p>Sri Lanka:</p><p>After years of political instability, economic hardship, and international scepticism, Sri Lanka is beginning to reposition itself as a credible global partner. The German government's invitation and the substance of the meetings indicate a renewed trust in the island nation's future. This confidence will be critical as Sri Lanka seeks new trade partners, investment opportunities, and collaborative initiatives in areas like climate resilience and technology.</p><p>2.Bridging the gap with the diaspora:</p><p>The Sri Lankan diaspora, especially in Europe, has often felt sidelined in national discussions. This meeting re-established that bridge. The President's presence among the people, his openness to listen, and the crowd's response marked a new chapter in people-to-people diplomacy. Such engagement is vital because diaspora communities contribute not only remittances but also ideas, skills, and international advocacy. Rebuilding trust is essential to harness this potential fully.</p><p>3.Signalling a new political culture:</p><p>The visit embodied a shift in tone and intent. The messages repeated by President Dissanayake and his delegation were clear: Say no to corruption. Say no to racism. Say no to radicalism. These are not just slogans-they are principles that can guide a new political era. They promise a government committed to integrity, social cohesion, and moderation - qualities necessary for Sri Lanka's sustainable peace and development.</p><p>A touching scene</p><p>What stood out most to me personally was the emotional intensity of the evening. People from all walks of life - students, professionals, families - shared a collective feeling of finally being seen and heard. Some attendees travelled from neighbouring countries to be part of the moment. The pride and joy were palpable. Many took selfies with the President, gifted books and cultural items, and even recited poems. The President's interactions were not hurried photo-ops; they were sincere conversations filled with empathy and mutual respect. For many in the room, this was their first time engaging with a Sri Lankan leader who represented their values, hopes, and voice.</p><p>One young woman shared how this was the first time she felt genuinely represented, after years of feeling disconnected from Sri Lankan politics. An elderly gentleman spoke of hope that the new leadership would finally bring the fairness and accountability the country desperately needs. These personal stories echoed a broader narrative - the diaspora's desire to be part of a healing, inclusive Sri Lanka. This wasn't just a political victory; it was a human moment.</p><p>Going forward</p><p>As the President departed Germany, he left behind more than just signed agreements and media coverage. He left behind renewed faith. Faith that Sri Lanka can rise again with honest leadership. Faith that the diaspora matters. Faith that change, though difficult, is not impossible. The road ahead is long and complex. Transforming a nation requires more than political will-it demands collective action, inclusive dialogue, and sustained international support. Sri Lanka faces urgent challenges - rebuilding an economy battered by crisis, addressing social divides, and pursuing reconciliation after years of conflict. But this visit has laid a foundation. It has opened new channels for cooperation, trust, and shared vision. Germany's support in education, renewable energy, and technology transfer can accelerate Sri Lanka's development trajectory. The diaspora's renewed engagement can foster cultural exchange and economic ties that benefit both homeland and host countries.</p><p>Final thoughts</p><p>As someone who has studied international diplomacy and teaching International relations and Geopolitics for many years, I can say this without hesitation: this state visit was a diplomatic success. It wasn't flashy or extravagant, but it was deeply meaningful. It reminded us that diplomacy is not just about protocol and agreements. It's about building bridges - between nations, between governments and people, and between dreams and reality. From Berlin to Colombo, the message is clear: Sri Lanka is turning a new page. The world is watching, and many of us are ready to walk alongside. Let us move forward with courage, with integrity, and with unity. Say no to corruption. Say no to racism. Say no to radicalism. That is the Sri Lanka we believe in.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Restoring global confidence inSri Lanka:After years of political instability, economic hardship, and international scepticism, Sri Lanka is beginning to reposition itself as a credible global partner.

On 13 March, Rutte visited Trump in the Oval Office, where he praised the US president on a number of fronts, including the war in Ukraine. Rutte ended the meeting by telling Trump that he was looking forward to hosting him in The Hague, his 'hometown', and was eager to 'work together to ensure that [the NATO summit] will be a splash, a real success projecting American power on the world stage'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are thirty-two full members of NATO, thirty from Europe and two from North America. The United States is only one among them, yet, as Rutte made clear in his statement, it is the one that defines NATO and is but a vehicle for the projection of US power. There should be no doubt about that fact. It is precisely for this reason that the idea of the US leaving NATO - as Trump threatened to do if the Europeans did not increase their military spending - is moot. NATO is the United States.</p><p>From Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, the No Cold War collective, and our European partners at the Zetkin Forum for Social Research comes our June dossier, NATO: The Most Dangerous Organisation on Earth. The title is bold but not hyperbolic. It reflects the facts before us. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO has conducted some of the most lethal wars on the planet and now threatens us with the unthinkable possibility of nuclear conflict. The dossier provides ample evidence of this. Here, we simply note two of the alliance's more egregious acts over the past decades:</p><p>It was NATO that dismembered Yugoslavia in 1999.</p><p>It was NATO that destroyed the Libyan state in 2011.</p><p>It is erroneous to see NATO as an autonomous actor. NATO, as Rutte so eloquently stated, is an instrument of 'projecting American power on the world stage'. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has used NATO to incorporate Eastern Europe into a pliable set of states subordinate to its interests. When the European Union expanded eastward and sought to build autonomous European institutions, NATO came along and ensured that the United States would be the engine of any European expansion. One might be forgiven for having forgotten the warning that came not from Russia's current President Vladimir Putin but from his decidedly pro-US predecessor Boris Yeltsin, who warned during NATO's 1995 bombing of the Bosnian Serbs, 'this is the first sign of what could happen when NATO comes right up to the Russian Federation's borders. ... The game of war could burst out across the whole of Europe'. In 1990, the Soviet Union reluctantly agreed to the reunification of Germany and its entry into NATO under assurances that the alliance would not expand eastward (the US also used the move to 'keep the Germans down' bykeeping them anchored within NATO structures). But there was no agreement that the US could use NATO as an instrument to project power right up to Russia's borders. Nor was there any mandate for NATO to be used in far-off theatres like the South China Sea to confront the People's Republic of China under the pretext of freedom of navigation and regional stability. NATO - against the self-interest of its European member states - has been drawn into confrontations against Russia and China that are entirely about the US wanting to shackle its 'near-peer rivals'. These confrontations have nothing to do with European security: neither Russia nor China have threatened Europe, with Russia repeatedly reiterating that its war in Ukraine has everything to do with threats on its borders and China emphasising that it is a defensive power with no aggressive intentions regarding Europe.</p><p>Before Donald Trump took office in December 2024, his transition team told European officials that the president-elect would ask NATO member states to increase their military spending to 5% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared to the previous target of 2%. Most states would not be able to comply with this dramatic increase without deep cuts to their social expenditure (as of late 2024, Poland is the only member state that spends more than 4% of its GDP on its military - 4.12% to be exact - while the United States officially spends 3.38%). US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said that while this 5% demand would not come with a deadline, 'the United States expects every ally to step up with concrete plans, budgets, timelines, [and] deliverables to meet the 5% target and close capability gaps'.</p><p>From NATO's founding in 1949 - and even throughout the Cold War - there was no firm benchmark for military spending for member states (such as percentage of GDP). The 1952 Lisbon Agreement on NATO force levels, which set targets for the number of conventional and reserve forces, simply could not be met due to the privations in post-war Europe. In the 1970s, NATO members had to fill out a Defence Planning Questionnaire to assess national military spending efforts, but no targets could be set. During Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981-1989) - when the US was spending around 6% of GDP on defence - questions were again raised about force level goals and defence spending, and there were calls for European members states to increase their share to as much as 4% of GDP.In the early 1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington feared that NATO states would cut their military budgets. At the 2002 NATO Summit in Prague, alliance leaders adopted the Prague Capabilities Commitment, which once more called for the need to modernise forces in the context of the War on Terror, but no formal spending target was established.</p><p>It was not until the 2006 Riga Summit, when NATO officially endorsed the 2% target, that the first formal benchmark for military spending among member states emerged. Though pressure mounted at the 2014 Wales Summit to comply with this hitherto unmet goal, there was still no real enthusiasm for it. Trump pushed hard during his first term, suggesting that the US would leave NATO if the Europeans did not increase their military spending. Then, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the 2% goal began to be seen - as then NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said - 'not as a ceiling, but the minimum, a floor'. In anticipation of this year's summit in The Hague, current NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that NATO members must 'shift to a wartime mindset and turbo charge our defence production and defence spending'.</p><p>Various European institutes and movement platforms have already begun to release documents in anticipation of the upcoming NATO summit. One is the annual report from the German Institutes of Peace and Conflict Research (Bonn International Centre for Conflict Studies, Institut fr Friedensforschung und Sicherheitspolitik, Institut fr Entwicklung und Frieden, and the Leibniz Institut fr Friedens-und Konfliktforschung), which argues that Europe must prepare for a post-US NATO by increasing its own military spending and moving toward non-lethal forms of diplomacy such as arms control and peace-building measures. This is one approach to the NATO crisis, but it suffers from two key flaws: first, it misunderstands Europe's role in NATO by treating it as an equal partner, when NATO is in fact an instrument for the subordination of Europe to US strategic aims, and second, even if member states in Europe increase their military spending to 5% of GDP, they simply do not have the capacity to do so.</p><p>The British government's Strategic Defence Review 2025 is basically a recipe for bankruptcy. Britain simply does not have the resources to build a new 'hybrid navy' with 'hybrid airwings', provide housing for the working class, or refurbish its health care system. It is easy to write about a 'whole-of-society' approach but hard to find the money to build a society strained by so many afflictions. On the other hand, the National Union of Rail, Maritime, and Transport Workers and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament make a perfectly reasonable case for 'human security and common security', as they write it in their Alternative Defence Review.

The partnership between Germany and Sri Lanka is one such example. Rooted in historical goodwill and sustained through economic cooperation, development aid, and cultural exchanges, it's a relationship built on substance rather than spectacle. As a Sri Lankan living in Germany, I've seen firsthand Germany's ongoing commitment to Sri Lanka's development. Beyond this, there's great potential for a more strategic, multifaceted partnership that benefits both countries in areas like education, climate, and innovation. It's time to bring this valuable relationship into the spotlight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Historical roots and post-independence ties</p><p>Germany recognised Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) shortly after it gained independence in 1948. Diplomatic relations were officially established in 1953, and since then, Germany has been a consistent development partner. During the Cold War, West Germany's support for Sri Lanka's economic development was a notable gesture of mutual respect. German development agencies such as GTZ (now GIZ) and KfW played pivotal roles in sectors like vocational training, infrastructure, and healthcare. One of the most visible symbols of early cooperation was the establishment of German technical training institutes across Sri Lanka. These institutions not only equipped young Sri Lankans with valuable skills but also solidified Germany's reputation as a development partner with long-term vision. Even today, German engineering and training standards are held in high regard in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Economic engagement and trade</p><p>Germany is one of Sri Lanka's key trading partners in Europe. As of 2023, it ranks among the top 10 export destinations for Sri Lankan goods. Tea, textiles, rubber products, and spices continue to find loyal markets in Germany. At the same time, Germany exports high-value machinery, automobiles, and industrial equipment to Sri Lanka. The trade relationship is complementary, with strong potential for growth through diversification and value addition. Moreover, German companies are showing increased interest in Sri Lanka's renewable energy, IT, and tourism sectors.</p><p>As Sri Lanka gradually recovers from its recent economic crisis, a window of opportunity has emerged to attract more sustainable investment from Germany-particularly in green technology and digital infrastructure. A bilateral investment treaty could provide much-needed reassurance for potential German investors.</p><p>Development cooperation and peacebuilding</p><p>Germany has long been one of the most generous bilateral donors to Sri Lanka, offering both technical assistance and financial aid. What sets Germany apart is its focus on sustainability,</p><p>capacity building, and social inclusion. German support has played a significant role in promoting vocational education, decentralisation, and the strengthening of health systems. In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's civil war, German aid shifted toward supporting reconciliation, psychosocial care, and civil society engagement.</p><p>German foundations such as Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES), Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), and Heinrich B\u00f6ll Stiftung (HBS) have been actively involved in promoting human rights, democratic governance, and inter-ethnic dialogue. Given Germany's growing emphasis on a feminist foreign policy, there is further potential for collaboration on gender equality, women's empowerment, and peace building-areas that are critical for Sri Lanka's long-term stability.</p><p>The diaspora as a cultural bridge</p><p>The Sri Lankan diaspora in Germany, though relatively small (estimated at around 60,000), plays a unique role in strengthening people-to-people ties. Comprising professionals, students, artists, and second-generation youth, the diaspora contributes not only to Germany's economy but also to its multicultural identity. Sri Lankan temples, cultural associations, and Tamil language schools are visible across cities like Berlin, Hamburg, and Frankfurt. In recent years, diaspora-led initiatives in entrepreneurship, humanitarian aid, and academic exchange have helped bridge the gap between the two societies, offering a bottom-up approach to diplomacy.</p><p>There is also a growing number of Sri Lankan students pursuing higher education in Germany, attracted by its tuition-free universities, world-class research facilities, and inclusive visa policies. Many return to Sri Lanka with advanced skills, while others contribute to the German workforce. Encouraging more bilateral academic exchanges and research collaborations could amplify this brain circulation.</p><p>Climate, sustainability, and shared priorities</p><p>As the world grapples with climate change, Germany and Sri Lanka share common interests in climate resilience, biodiversity protection, and sustainable development. Germany's expertise in renewable energy and environmental policy could greatly support Sri Lanka's transition to a greener economy. Joint research on climate adaptation, sustainable agriculture, and disaster management would benefit both nations. Furthermore, Germany's leadership in global climate diplomacy aligns well with Sri Lanka's vulnerability to climate shocks. A focused bilateral agenda on environmental cooperation could enhance the relevance of the Germany-Sri Lanka relationship within global climate negotiations.</p><p>Looking ahead: A strategic reimagining</p><p>The upcoming visit of Sri Lanka's president to Germany on 10 June presents a timely opportunity to elevate the Germany-Sri Lanka partnership. This visit should not only celebrate the longstanding friendship but also address the relationship in a wider strategic context. While Sri Lanka has recently focused much of its foreign policy attention on neighbouring giants like China and India, it is crucial not to overlook the mutual benefits that a strong partnership with Germany-and the broader European Union-can bring. Germany's economic strength, technological expertise, and commitment to sustainable development offer avenues for Sri Lanka to diversify its international partnerships and reduce over-dependence on a few large powers.</p><p>At the same time, Germany stands to gain from closer ties with Sri Lanka in areas such as trade, renewable energy, tourism, education, and regional stability in the Indian Ocean. The president's visit could thus serve as a catalyst for forging new agreements, expanding trade relations, and deepening cooperation on security, digital innovation, and climate action. For the partnership to truly flourish, both countries need to envision a comprehensive bilateral framework that goes beyond aid and trade.

This landmark initiative, funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Agriculture, aims to develop a comprehensive strategy to safeguard the country's agricultural sector from the adverse impacts of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka, with its tropical climate, is highly susceptible to the effects of climate change, consistently ranking among the top ten countries at risk of extreme weather events according to the Global Climate Risk Index. Projections indicate significant shifts in weather patterns, including rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and increased frequency of extreme events, all of which have already begun to diminish agricultural productivity and water availability across the island.</p><p>Agriculture in the dry and intermediate zones is particularly vulnerable to the changing and variable climate due to climate change, with research projecting an average 10-12% yield reduction if appropriate interventions are not implemented to mitigate these effects. The CSA Investment Plan is designed to be a strategic and comprehensive blueprint for fostering agricultural development that is resilient to climate change. Through this plan, FAO specialists, including both international and national experts, will work closely with a wide range of stakeholders-including government bodies, the private sector, and academia-to assess national climate finance priorities and develop innovative investment mechanisms tailored to the unique challenges faced by Sri Lanka's agricultural sector.</p><p>Mr. Prabath Chandrakeerthi, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and representative of the National Designated Authority, highlighted the significance of this initiative, \"Sri Lanka's vulnerability to climate change is a pressing concern, particularly for our farmers who are at the frontline of this crisis. The development of a Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plan is a timely and necessary step to equip our agricultural sector with the tools and resources needed to adapt and thrive in a changing climate. We are committed to working collaboratively with all stakeholders to ensure the success of this initiative.\"</p><p>This investment plan will bridge the gap between farmers and investors, attract private sector investment for climate-smart interventions, and open new avenues for youth and young entrepreneurs. Mr Vimlendra Sharan, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka emphasized the importance of this initiative, \"Climate change is not a distant threat-it is a present reality that is already affecting our farmers and our food security. The Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plan will be a vital tool in ensuring that Sri Lanka's agricultural sector can adapt to these changes and continue to thrive in the face of adversity.\"</p><p>This workshop marks the first of several consultations planned as part of the CSA Investment Plan's development process, reflecting FAO's commitment to an inclusive, participatory approach that brings together all relevant voices in the fight against climate change.</p><p>About FAO</p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger.

The notion that this administration, flawed as it may be, will crumble by September is not merely premature but verges on delusional. Opposition politicians, flailing for relevance, have begun to indulge in a collective hallucination, casting themselves as saviours without the moral, intellectual, or organisational gravitas to lead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let us be clear: Ranil Wickremesinghe, with all the political acumen he has cultivated over decades, would do well not to re-emerge as the nation's helmsman under the current tainted alliance. Rather, he ought to focus on forging a worthy successor who can dismantle the culture of corruption that festers not only within his own party but throughout the opposition establishment. A decaying tree cannot yield sound fruit.</p><p>The opposition, for its part, remains fractured, directionless, and devoid of authentic ideological cohesion. Their criticism of Dissanayake's regime as deceitful is often justified, yet they offer no compelling alternative. If they are to be believed, a mere reshuffling of names will yield national redemption. The reality, however, is that they suffer from what French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu termed a 'habitus of defeat'-a behavioural inertia rooted in years of systemic failure and opportunistic politicking.</p><p>Despite Dissanayake's apparent psychological strain-his conspicuous hyperactivity betrays a man under immense internal and external pressures-he remains, for now, unassailable by the current political opposition. His relentless grassroots engagement, though occasionally haphazard and histrionic, has earned him a rare commodity in Sri Lankan politics: trust. In an era defined by the erosion of institutional legitimacy, that trust is his strongest bulwark.</p><p>The president's tenuous hold on the public's patience is sustained not by the virtue of his policies but by the opposition's inability to present a coherent counter-narrative. Their incompetence is illustrated by the vacuity of their leaders, many of whom display staggering immaturity and a woeful misunderstanding of modern governance.</p><p>As Machiavelli noted in The Prince, 'It is not titles that honour men, but men that honour titles.' Many opposition leaders today, though adorned with lofty designations, possess neither the wisdom nor the disposition to steward a nation teetering on the edge of socioeconomic precipice. Their infantile tantrums and internecine feuds serve only to alienate the citizenry.</p><p>It is not that Dissanayake's administration is impervious to collapse. Indeed, the internal fissures within the National People's Power (NPP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) are beginning to show. The Prime Minister, in particular, has acted with an alarming degree of political naivety. With rare exceptions-such as Bimal Rathnayake and Nalinda Jayatissa, who exude a modicum of integrity and strategic sensibility-the remainder resemble proverbial bulls in a china shop, wreaking havoc with rhetoric devoid of substance. The cabinet, peopled by courtiers and yes-men, lacks the intellectual rigour and ethical backbone to guide national policy. A recalibration is urgently needed-not as a cosmetic exercise but as a foundational rethinking of governance ethos.</p><p>This is a time that calls for what Antonio Gramsci termed 'pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.' Dissanayake must confront his government's deficiencies with brutal honesty. He must reassert control by discarding those who masquerade as loyalists but are in fact political parasites. His team must be rebuilt on meritocratic foundations, with continuous performance evaluations and a readiness to excise the deadwood.</p><p>The opposition, meanwhile, clings to the fantasy that the government will suffer a Gotabaya-style implosion. But history seldom repeats with such symmetry. The upheaval that unseated Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sui generis, fuelled by an economic apocalypse and decades of dynastic decadence. Unless the present government commits a similarly spectacular act of self-destruction, it will not be dislodged by mere rhetorical vitriol.</p><p>At present, the opposition's main tactical gambit lies in weaponising the government's contradictions and unfulfilled promises. They aim to frame Dissanayake's administration as purveyors of 'noble lies' in the Platonic sense-crafted myths masquerading as truth to preserve political order. But even if this is partially accurate, the opposition has failed to articulate its own truth. What is their economic doctrine? How will they navigate the geopolitical quagmire engulfing Sri Lanka, especially with mounting tensions between China and India? The silence is deafening.</p><p>It is also pertinent to consider the regional parallels. In Pakistan, Imran Khan rode a populist wave to power only to be undone by his lack of institutional support. In Brazil, Lula da Silva returned with renewed credibility, not just because of Bolsonaro's failures but because he offered a compelling alternative vision. The Sri Lankan opposition, by contrast, offers neither structural reform nor charismatic leadership. Instead, it harps on the failures of the government while embodying many of the same pathologies.</p><p>Sri Lanka needs more than regime change; it requires epistemic rupture-a break from the cognitive and cultural structures that have perpetuated decades of misgovernance. This involves transforming not merely the faces in parliament, but the very way political legitimacy is conceptualised and exercised. As Michel Foucault argued, 'Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategic situation.'</p><p>Thus, for the opposition to truly challenge Anura Kumara Dissanayake, it must understand the strategic complexity of the moment. They must cease being reactive and start being visionary. They must move beyond ephemeral populism and cultivate a political grammar that speaks to the structural anxieties of the Sri Lankan people: inflation, corruption, youth unemployment, education reform, and climate resilience.</p><p>Let it be clear: we are no sycophantic paean to the current regime. Dissanayake must urgently manage his insecurities, stabilise his psyche, and rid himself of sycophantic advisers who, in the words of Shakespeare's King Lear, '...will say anything to gain their ends, though they mean nothing.' If he fails to do so, his government may become a theatre of tragic irony-a revolution betrayed from within.</p><p>Sri Lanka is entering uncharted territory. The geopolitical chessboard is shifting rapidly, and crises loom that lie beyond the nation's immediate control. The challenge is not merely to survive these trials but to develop resilience. Should Dissanayake's government maintain focus on the main issues and prepare for unforeseen global shocks, it can plausibly complete its term.</p><p>Politics is not a morality play. It is a contest of visions, capabilities, and coalitions. For now, the opposition offers neither. Until that changes, Anura Kumara Dissanayake remains the default choice-not because he is flawless, but because the alternative is, quite simply, far worse.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["Thus, for the opposition to truly challenge Anura Kumara Dissanayake, it must understand the strategic complexity of the moment.

The Small Entrepreneur Programme (SEP) annual grant distribution is an award-winning initiative that supports budding micro-entrepreneurs with grants to further their business goals. This March, 82 micro-entrepreneurs from the East received grants to further their micro businesses. From sewing machines to salon and cooking equipment, each beneficiary is assessed and surveyed to best understand their requirements and granted a fixed sum in the form of equipment. </p><p>Dilmah's support of micro entrepreneurship doesn't stop there. Following the loss of employment and economic struggles faced by small businesses during COVID-19, the MJF Charitable Foundation launched 'The People's Market'. This initiative offered a platform for small businesses and budding entrepreneurs to launch and retail their products and grow their networks. Following successful markets in Moratuwa and Weligama, The People's Market was organised in the East last November bringing together 50 vendors and 1,500 marketgoers. This March, 60 vendors from the previous SEP grant awards showcased their products for over 1,000 marketgoers in Valachchenai with the aim of growing their businesses and expanding their visibility. </p><p>For Dilhan C. Fernando and the Foundation, their motivation is based on kindness and creating a sustainable environment for empowerment. 'Dignity comes not from dependence or charity. But dignity comes from a sustainable model where we offer a crutch and at a certain point, we give the beneficiary the possibility of throwing it away and walking on their own, then eventually running,' he said. </p><p>Sustainable livelihoods for Veddah community</p><p>Dilmah is also taking steps to support the indigenous Veddah community in the East by helping them transition from the unsustainable practice of forest honey harvesting. This initiative, driven by Dilmah Conservation, marks the first time the community has received support to adopt more sustainable practices that will improve their livelihoods. Earlier this year, Dilmah Conservation provided fundamental training in beekeeping, and during the recent visit, six Veddah beekeepers were gifted bee boxes and equipment. Advanced training is planned by Dilmah Conservation in the near future, which will further support the community in refining their practices for long-term success.</p><p>Additionally, Dilmah Conservation is collaborating with communities in the East to promote food security, green cover and climate resilience. One such initiative is the creation of a dry-zone arboretum - a mini forest designed to serve as an educational hub for both students and the public. The arboretum aims to raise awareness about forest ecology and showcase a variety of plant species. Currently, around 60 trees are planted within the arboretum. As part of its revitalisation, 45 trees were newly established. Chairman Dilhan C. Fernando, alongside his son Amrit Fernando, symbolically planted a Domba tree and a Kaluwara tree, marking the first step of this exciting project. In the next phase, 80 additional species will be introduced, further enriching the arboretum and its educational potential. </p><p>From empowering individuals through education and entrepreneurship to safeguarding indigenous communities and fostering environmental conservation, Dilmah's unique commitment to 'Making The World A Better Tea' extends far beyond a typical cuppa. It is a reflection of the legacy of kindness and responsibility, proving that a successful business can be a powerful catalyst for positive change, enriching lives and nurturing the planet.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Earlier this year, Dilmah Conservation provided fundamental training in beekeeping, and during the recent visit, six Veddah beekeepers were gifted bee boxes and equipment.

In cities where waste logistics are already stretched thin, biomedical waste risks leaching into water bodies, contaminating groundwater, and releasing toxins through unchecked incineration.</p><p>Without a shift from disposal-oriented strategies to regenerative, circular practices, such initiatives, however well-intentioned, risk becoming environmentally unsustainable.</p><p>Circular economy (CE) principles, if embedded in healthcare infrastructure from the outset, can address both access and sustainability. However, does India's policy architecture support this vision?</p><p>A policy shortcoming</p><p>We recently published new research on India's circular economy in the scholarly journal Resources, Conservation &amp; Recycling (2025) based on a comprehensive quantitative analysis of 41 central policy instruments that govern India's biomedical waste management.</p><p>Using a state-of-the-art integrated coding framework based on 82 circularity indicators aligned with the 6Rs of circular economy (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Reclaim, Recover, Restore) and the BS8001:2017 principles (System Thinking, Innovation, Collaboration, Value Optimisation, Transparency, Stewardship), we evaluated 3,362 potential instances where circular economy principles could have been encoded in these policy instruments.</p><p>Our results are unequivocal: only 274 out of these 3,362 instances, a mere 8.15 per cent, demonstrate any alignment with circular economy principles. Conversely, this also means that over 91 per cent of India's healthcare waste management policy infrastructure reflects linear, end-of-pipe thinking.</p><p>Waste is viewed as a liability to be discarded, not a resource to be regenerated. Only one of the 41 policy instruments - the Comprehensive Mission Document of the National Water Mission (2008)-included more than 50 per cent of the 82 circularity indicators mentioned earlier.</p><p>This instrument has a score of 67.07 per cent alignment, standing in stark contrast to five other policy instruments - including pandemic-era biomedical waste guidelines from 2020 - that showed 0% alignment with circularity.</p><p>These five instruments are Bio-Medical Waste Management (Second Amendment) Rules, 2019 Guidelines for Barcode System for BMW Management, 2018 COVID-19 BMW Disposal Guidelines (March 18 &amp; 25, 2020 versions) and Guidelines for Incineration Chamber Verification, 2019. Even the flagship Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules (2016), usually considered India's most comprehensive BMW legislation, showed only 3.66 per cent circularity alignment and referenced merely 2 of the 6Rs and 3 of the 6 BS8001 principles. When assessed against the six BS8001:2017 operational principles, the picture remains dismal.</p><p>While 'Value Optimisation' had the highest number of coded references (61 mentions under various 6R combinations), 'Transparency' - essential for accountability and public trust - appeared in only 14 out of 3362 instances, or 0.4 per cent.</p><p>In addition, the failure to implement Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks is a key structural gap. Countries like Germany and Japan have made EPR legally binding for pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices, mandating producers to take back, repurpose, or recycle post-use medical materials.</p><p>India's 2016 BMW rules do not include any EPR mandates, potentially a glaring policy oversight in an era of rising pharmaceutical consumption and device usage.</p><p>Another significant gap is wastewater management. Our study shows that policy instruments almost entirely ignore wastewater originating from healthcare systems, even though wastewater often contains pharmaceutical residues, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pathogens, and heavy metals.</p><p>For example, only four instruments out of forty-one discuss water-related circularity indicators. Even the National Policy on Faecal Sludge and Septage Management (2017), widely seen as a milestone in sanitation planning, scored just 13.41 per cent on circularity alignment.</p><p>This is despite growing scientific evidence that links hospital effluents to antibiotic resistance, hormonal imbalances, reproductive disorders and aquatic toxicity. Climate change will intensify such effects as pathogen survival and dispersal increase in warmer and wetter conditions.</p><p>There is also scope for improvement in the technology aspects of circularity. Globally, alternatives to incineration, such as autoclaving, pyrolysis, gasification, constructed wetlands and anaerobic digestion, are being scaled up.</p><p>However, India's policy landscape remains heavily skewed toward centralised, high-temperature incineration, which emits an average of 1074 kg CO e per ton of waste, compared to 65 kg CO e/ton for recycling.</p><p>There is also a chronic underinvestment in data-driven waste monitoring systems. Innovations such as blockchain-based waste traceability, smart biohazard bags, AI-based segregation, and IoT-enabled incinerator tracking are almost entirely absent from regulatory vocabulary. The lack of real-time monitoring severely hampers enforcement in a country where over 1.5 lakh healthcare facilities generate biomedical waste.</p><p>Embedding circularity into India's development vision</p><p>India's aspiration to become a developed nation by 2047 under the Viksit Bharat agenda cannot rest on service delivery alone.</p><p>It must embed climate resilience and circular economy thinking into every layer of national planning, particularly healthcare management, which produces five per cent of India's total greenhouse gas emissions.

By adjusting to actual or expected climate change, economies, businesses, and households can reduce negative impacts and take advantage of emerging opportunities, contributing to an overall more resilient and climate-adapted world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, as climate change accelerates, there are concerns that incremental adaptation measures may no longer be sufficient. As a reaction, the concept of 'transformational adaptation' has increasingly entered discussions around climate change adaptation in academic circles as well as in the global climate negotiations. But is there a common understanding of this concept and its implications?</p><p>What is transformational adaptation?</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), transformational adaptation 'changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts.' In opposition to incremental adaptation, it is often seen as going beyond short-term measures and reactive approaches to focus on deeper and more long-term changes that aim to overhaul entire sectors or industries. Rather than merely adjusting existing practices, transformational adaptation calls for systemic shifts in how societies perceive risks, manage resources, and pursue sustainable development in a rapidly changing climate.</p><p>Traditional 'incremental' adaptation actions included, for example, enhancements to irrigation systems, resistant crop varieties, more resilient infrastructure, or investment into early warning systems. However, with rising global temperatures and increasingly intense and frequent climate change impacts, such measures could run into soft or hard limits of adaptation. In this context, hard limits are those where incremental adaptative actions are no longer able to avoid intolerable risks, while soft limits are those where such options still exist, but are currently not available due to constraints in finance, capacities, technology, etc.</p><p>Transformational adaptation, by contrast, calls for a wider change in adaptation pathways that deviate from existing systems to maintain resilience even in the face of more radical climatic changes. Considerations around addressing underlying inequities and systemic barriers are a key part of this concept, not only to safeguard vulnerable populations but also to support long-term sustainable development.</p><p>How does it connect to the Global Goal on Adaptation?</p><p>The Paris Agreement has established a Global Goal on Adaptation, which is currently being fleshed out and concretised through a global negotiation process. At the end of 2023, Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement created the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience to frame this Global Goal setting eleven targets (for example, on food and water security, human health, natural ecosystems, or cultural heritage) that should be achieved for successful adaptation and resilience-building across the globe.</p><p>The Framework explicitly references to both 'long-term transformational and incremental adaptation' and aims to examine 'how transformational adaptation is defined and understood at different spatial scales and sectors.' A resulting technical paper completed in late 2024 offers a definition of transformational adaptation as changes that reflect something new, novel, and different; challenge the soft limits of adaptation; encompass large-scale and system-wide changes; entail sudden shifts in views, perceptions, attitudes, and norms; are robust, resilient, and lasting; and are aligned with key goals and processes.</p><p>While this definition provides an outline of the concept, it is yet to be seen how it will connect to either the negotiation process-for example, through its inclusion in an upcoming decision at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in November 2025 in Brazil-or actions on the ground. Transitioning to transformational adaptation is also likely to be resource-intensive, necessitating substantial investments and supportive institutional frameworks for its effective implementation. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds or blended finance, have been identified as potential enablers for scaling up transformational projects.</p><p>Another major challenges in advancing transformational adaptation is the development of robust metrics to assess progress. Unlike incremental adaptation measures, whose impacts can be easier to quantify, transformational change involves long-term and wide-ranging shifts in social dynamics, understandings, and worldviews. Current efforts by the IPCC and other international bodies have proposed innovative indicators-ranging from changes in participation in decision-making processes to the extent of policy integration across sectors-that could serve as proxies for measuring transformation. Institutional innovation could be another indicator of transformational change, fostering cross-sectoral collaboration and inclusive multi-actor partnerships to break down silos and enable coordinated action across diverse sectors.</p><p>What are key challenges and opportunities?</p><p>Transformational adaptation promises a paradigm shift in our response to climate change. By embracing systemic change, integrating diverse knowledge systems, and reorienting financial and institutional frameworks, it could potentially contribute to building a future that is not only resilient to climate impacts but also fundamentally more just and sustainable.</p><p>However, significant challenges remain. The scale and speed of change required often conflict with existing systems and constraints, especially related to available finance, technology, capacities, or data. Furthermore, transformational adaptation is a concept that is currently not well understood and lacks a commonly accepted definition as well as a toolset of good practices. At the same time, there are many incremental adaptation measures with proven impact that require resources for scaling up or replicating their implementation. While exploring transformational adaptation is important, it should not lead to a neglect of other forms of adaptation, and work towards a holistic and balanced understanding of the spectrum of adaptation actions across different levels and time periods.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["How does it connect to the Global Goal on Adaptation?

A total of 394, 533 registered voters will be eligible to vote at the election, with 2800 candidates contesting from 47 wards in the city. A total of 110 members are to be elected to the CMC, with 66 being elected from the wards. Voting will be held across 295 polling booths. All main political parties have been campaigning hard across the length and breadth of the city in recent days, fighting for every vote. One of the main positives has been an extremely peaceful campaign, with no major incident of election violence reported so far.</p><p>With two island-wide elections in the span of just seven months though, many parties are worried about voter fatigue leading to a far smaller turnout than they are hoping for. There has also been a longstanding perception among some voters that a local government election is of less importance than an election such as a presidential or parliamentary election, which directly deals with issues at the national level. Political party representatives interviewed by the Sunday Times however, countered that, given local authorities provide essential services in the areas that voters live, this is an election that impacts people's lives more directly than other elections. Everything from garbage collection, street lighting, firefighting services, library services, public sanitation and public parks come under the authority of local councils. As such they stressed on the importance of voters exercising their franchise to elect those who will be responsible for managing such services.</p><p>Parties also pointed out that local government elections were originally scheduled for 2023, but were postponed and are now taking place after more than two years. With the previous nominations being cancelled and fresh nominations accepted, a large number of new parties and candidates have also entered the fray and will be contesting the upcoming election.</p><p>Some political parties such as the National People's Power (NPP) and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) have already named their mayoral candidates for Colombo. Vraie Cally Balthazaar is the mayoral candidate of the NPP while the SJB is fielding Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa. Many other parties have not named their mayoral candidates.</p><p>Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa (SJB): A happy city, his goal</p><p>A specialist family physician as well as an academic attached to the University of Colombo, Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa is the SJB's mayoral candidate for Colombo. Positions he has held in his professional life include serving as a Member of the University Grants Commission, a Member of the University Senate, and the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA). A grandson of former Speaker M.H. Mohamed, Dr, Haniffa was born and bred in Borella, and will be contesting from the very ward (Borella South) he grew up in.</p><p>Dr. Haniffa, who describes himself as 'a capitalist through and through,' said he chose the SJB because having looked at the full spectrum of capitalist parties, their vision and their leadership, the one which most appealed to him was the 'humanistic capitalism' promoted by the SJB.</p><p>Dr. Haniffa is contesting under the tagline 'For a Happier Colombo,' and plans to make the city into one that people can be proud of. 'Through making Colombo a happier place, I want to make the voter of Colombo a proud citizen. If your garbage is not collected, if you are stuck in traffic, if your neighbourhood is flooded or your sewerage if blocked, you are unhappy. If we can bring in a system to resolve such issues, we will become a happier city. That's what we want to do.'</p><p>His manifesto includes plans to improve childhood education, a policy for waste management reform in Colombo, improving access in Colombo for seniors and people with disabilities, modernising and improving transport links in the city, a policy for smarter, fairer and more efficient urban parking and a policy for flood prevention, drainage reform and climate resilience in Colombo.</p><p>Dr. Haniffa plans to improve Colombo through effective and efficient management, accountability and responsibility, and real-time transparency. 'That's the role of government; to provide the platform for people to thrive. So, that's what we will do.'</p><p>He added that he feels he is creating hope among the people and this was reflected in the response he receives while campaigning, adding that the SJB has a good team capable of working to improve the city.</p><p>He urged voters to come out and vote given that this is an election which will impact them on a daily basis. 'You cannot complain to the Minister of Waterways about your sewage being blocked or the Central Environmental Authority about your garbage not being collected. You have to complain to us. This is your real neighbourhood democratic governance. So, please take that seriously and come out and vote for whomever you want, but be objective with your decision,' he emphasised.</p><p>Vraie Cally Balthazaar (NPP): A win for us is a win for the people</p><p>Vraie Cally Balthazaar, who is the National People's Power's (NPP) mayoral candidate for Colombo, comes from an extensive background in media. Having obtained a BA in Design, she subsequently obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in Women and Gender Studies from the University of Colombo and has also worked as a researcher, looking into urban development and how it affects women in the city in particular.</p><p>'Historically, my family and people I know have never aligned with the JVP and so I've always had a particular notion of what the JVP meant well into my 30s. But it was only in my 30s that I was first exposed to JVP ideology and thinking,' she said, explaining how she got into politics. While it took her a little time to understand the party, she said that realised that much of the value systems of the party were things that resonated with her.</p><p>Ms. Balthazaar, who will contest from the Thimbirigasyaya ward, said the main aim of the NPP is to ensure that people of the city have access to services. 'A cause of frustration for many people is that you have a huge local government entity that is neither efficient nor transparent,' she noted, adding that digitization will go a long way towards making local government more efficient and transparent. The NPP administration will also introduce support processes to help people as they get used to the digitization, she added.</p><p>Another key goal is to root out corruption, Ms. Balthazaar said, stating that the CMC needs a strong team committed to stopping corruption for that to happen. 'We have already shown our commitment to stop corruption at the national level and we will ensure that the same thing happens at local council level.'</p><p>She added the NPP's candidates are strong because they are a really good mix of people who have worked on the ground, with many being community leaders long before an election was ever in place. 'They have the desire and the moral compass that is required to work with people and I think that is what really sets us apart. We are a good team.'</p><p>Ms. Balthazaar said the NPP needs to win but the win is not for the party alone. 'The citizens of Colombo City need to win. We live in this incredibly diverse, rich, visibly shiny city, but the lives of the people in the city are not beautiful or prosperous. Whatever superficial changes we make, if people's lives aren't beautiful, we will never improve as a city. The people of the city need to win. That is my aspiration for the city,' she remarked.</p><p>M.T.M. Iqbal (UNP): The UNP is still popular in the CMC</p><p>Former Colombo Deputy Mayor M.T.M. Iqbal is the senior-most candidate contesting for the CMC from the United National Party (UNP). A veteran local government politician, Mr. Iqbal's experience in politics goes back 30 years, with him first becoming actively involved in the UNP during the time of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa.</p><p>Having been first elected to the CMC in 1997, he counts 28 years of experience in the CMC, having been elected as a Member in five elections continuously. 'This will be my sixth election,' said Mr. Iqbal, who is contesting from the Masangas Veediya Ward.</p><p>Mr Iqbal was the Deputy Mayor of Colombo under Mayor Rosy Senanayake during the last CMC administration and he claimed that the administration did a lot of work to resolve many of Colombo's issues. He pointed out the waste-to-energy plant that was initiated in Kerawalapitiya as one example aimed at managing the city's garbage issue. He said the UNP administration of the CMC also did a lot to help those from low-income families. 'We carpeted and maintained roads, installed new street lamps and beautified the city. We spent a lot of money to improve public works.'</p><p>While the UNP may have suffered a setback in national elections, he expressed confidence that the party would mount a strong challenge for the CMC. 'The UNP is still the most popular party in the CMC. Voters want to see the return of the Elephant symbol, which they are most familiar with. We are carrying out house-to-house campaigns. The response from people has been very good. Even those who voted for other parties say they are going to vote for us. I believe we can obtain a majority,' he added.</p><p>Having been a CMC member for nearly three decades, Mr. Iqbal acknowledged that corruption was a major issue at the CMC, saying there have been instances where CMC members had been involved in corrupt activities such as owing parking spaces through other parties or manipulating tender contracts. Nevertheless, he insisted the team the UNP is putting to contest the election is clean.</p><p>He also said that he is someone who has kept his promises to the voters. 'I have done what I said I would do. I did a lot of work in my ward and the people of this city,' he said, noting that this was why voters had elected him to the council time and again.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["If we can bring in a system to resolve such issues, we will become a happier city.

This is a promethean responsibility for a party that holds a 2/3 majority within parliament and is a responsibility that should not be dealt with lightly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The budget presentation by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, for the annual year 2025 was a highly anticipatory spectacle for many a Sri Lankan. As the interim government's financial blueprint for the upcoming fiscal year, it seeks to address immediate economic concerns while laying the groundwork for long-term stability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of now, two parliamentary readings for the 2025 budget have been completed. The first reading was held on January 9, 2025, where the Prime Minister presented the, '2025 appropriation bill', to parliament. Following this, the second reading was held on February 17, 2025, where President Anura Kumara Dissanayake delivered the budget speech. The second reading debate spanned a period of 07 days (February 18 to 25), with the voting taking place on February 25.</p><p>The third and final reading, also known as the committee stage debate, is scheduled for a period of 19 days (February 27 to March 21), with the final vote arranged for the 21t of March. With the third reading of the budget currently underway, here are some key takeaways from the 2025 budget.</p><p>Economic and Fiscal Outlook</p><p>The 2025 budget projects a 23% increase in total revenue, reaching Rs. 4,990 billion, largely driven by tax revenue growth. Government expenditure is expected to rise by 17% to Rs. 7,190 billion, with significant allocations toward infrastructure, energy, and digital transformation. However, the fiscal deficit remains a pressing concern at Rs. 2,200 billion, necessitating a combination of domestic and foreign financing to bridge the gap.</p><p>Digital Transformation</p><p>A key initiative in the budget is the introduction of the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identification (SL-UDI) system, aimed at enhancing cybersecurity and data privacy. Additionally, efforts to expand digital payment systems reflect the government's goal of reducing cash dependency.</p><p>Taxation reforms</p><p>The budget proposes an increase in the tax-free threshold for personal income tax while removing VAT on essential food items such as fresh milk and yoghurt. However, new VAT impositions on digital services and increased corporate taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and gaming have been introduced.</p><p>Trade and export development</p><p>The government plans to implement a National Export Development Plan (2025-2029) to stimulate export growth. Additionally, an expansion of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) is expected to enhance Sri Lanka's economic integration with key trade partners.</p><p>Infrastructure and transport</p><p>Modernisation of logistics remains a priority, with projects such as the completion of the East and West Container Terminals and the establishment of the Internal Container Dry Port at Veyangoda. Public transport will also see improvements, with Rs. 3,000 million allocated for the procurement of 100 low-floor buses.</p><p>Agriculture and land</p><p>The agriculture sector will focus on modernisation, climate resilience, and strengthening value chains. Fertilizer subsidies and the maintenance of a rice buffer stock remain central to the government's strategy.</p><p>SME Development</p><p>Recognizing the critical role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the government will establish a Development Bank through the National Credit Guarantee Institution (NCGI). Furthermore, Rs. 1 billion has been earmarked to commercialize research and innovation.</p><p>Health</p><p>The healthcare budget is set to increase to Rs. 604,000 million. Among the notable initiatives are a five-year national programme for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities and the development of a model day-care centre for children with autism.</p><p>Education</p><p>The education sector will receive Rs. 10,000 million for infrastructure upgrades, alongside increased emoluments for vocational education students. Additionally, Rs. 100 million has been allocated for the Jaffna Library's infrastructure development.</p><p>SOE Governance</p><p>A holding company will be established to oversee State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), with the aim of improving governance and financial discipline. Additionally, Sri Lankan Airlines' long-standing budgetary concerns will be addressed.</p><p>Tourism</p><p>The tourism sector, a vital contributor to Sri Lanka's economy, has been allocated Rs. 500 million for infrastructure development, with a focus on branding and regional attraction enhancement.</p><p>Investment Facilitation</p><p>Legislative reforms such as the Investment Protection Bill and a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Act will provide a more transparent legal framework for investors. The Economic Transformation Act is also set to be revisited to foster a more business-friendly environment.</p><p>Here are the highlights of the National Budget over the past 3 years</p><p>The 2025 Budget navigates a fine line between meeting IMF requirements and addressing domestic economic pressures.</p><p>Umesh Moramudali, Lecturer, Department of Economics, University of Colombo, commented that, 'The budget was largely prepared based on the IMF's primary surplus targets. It's not a budget that significantly deviates from the IMF programme.</p><p>On the positive side, there are minor investments in public transport and education, but other than that, there is no significant change'.</p><p>Despite targeting a primary account surplus, the projected fiscal deficit of 6.7% surpasses the IMF's 5.2% benchmark. This highlights the delicate task of reconciling fiscal consolidation with growth ambitions. However, the interim government's plan to raise revenue to 15.1% GDP, by the end of 2025 signals a deliberate approach to improve debt sustainability and foster a more stable economic environment.</p><p>Dr. Ahilan Kadirgamar, Political Economist &amp; Senior Lecturer, University of Jaffna, said, \"The 2025 budget is the short budget because of the elections since it comprises of a 9 month period. The biggest problem is that we are in an IMF programme that has caused severe limitations particularly due to its austerity measures. Therefore, the government is able to carry out policies and measures within the IMF framework with no major changes. The next few months are a learning and testing period and it is the 2026 budget in November that will dictate whether the government can move out of the IMF programme in the foreseeable future\".</p><p>The budget doesn't simply draw the line with the country's domestic affairs. Sri Lanka must also take into consideration the stark reality of its geopolitical position. Wedged between the looming colossi of both India and China: two nations vying for hegemonic position of the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka has quite the task of manoeuvring through the narrow strait of global financial markets and carving out a coherent fiscal path to avoid any potential economic shocks in the future.</p><p>The budget does not serve as an outright testament to the NPP's ability to govern. Rather, it signals the evolution of a movement once marked by a turbulent history, now seeking to reinvent itself into a disciplined political entity. This is a promethean responsibility for a party that holds a 2/3 majority within parliament and is a responsibility that should not be dealt with lightly.</p><p>However, whether the government can successfully steer the country through economic turmoil, geopolitical tensions, and structural inefficiencies remains to be seen. One might be tempted to fall back on the old adage, \"only time will tell.\" Yet, time is a luxury that Sri Lanka can scarcely afford just about now.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The first part of this article series provided a comprehensive breakdown of the origin, rationale, and structure of this policy. It examined how countries were tiered and how Sri Lanka's effective trade burden was assessed at 88%, culminating in its current tariff status.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Part 2 shifts focus from the cause and effect to the course of action. It evaluates the steps Sri Lanka can take to mitigate the economic fallout, adjust its trade orientation, and leverage this moment as a turning point for reform. Encouragingly, the Sri Lankan Government has already initiated concrete and timely action. These include launching diplomatic engagements and appointing a high-level committee to assess and respond to the challenge. While the situation is serious, it is far from insurmountable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This article outlines short-term, medium-term, and long-term strategies for Sri Lanka and identifies opportunities for recalibration and resilience. The tone is intentionally constructive-because the present disruption, if managed skilfully, can also become a catalyst for transformation.</p><p>1.Immediate response: Structured engagement and policy alignment</p><p>In response to the US Executive Order, the Sri Lankan Government acted promptly by initiating a coordinated national response.</p><p>On 3 April 2025, President Anura Kumara Disanayake appointed a high-level expert committee tasked with assessing the implications of the reciprocal tariffs and advising on mitigation strategies. This committee includes senior officials from key economic institutions such as the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, BOI, EDB, and Foreign Ministry, alongside representatives from the private sector and academia. Its scope covers a full-sectoral impact assessment and the formulation of a national action plan.</p><p>The Deputy Minister of Economic Development further clarified that the tariff was not a targeted action against Sri Lanka but part of a broader recalibration of US trade policy. In this context, the government has begun diplomatic engagements, including outreach to the US Trade Representative's office, to advocate for Sri Lanka's case, particularly in light of its IMF-backed reforms and developing country status.</p><p>The committee's role is especially critical. It is well-positioned to assess and integrate many of the strategies discussed in this article-from trade diversification and tariff engineering to proactive WTO diplomacy and value chain strengthening. The Government's willingness to act swiftly and seek expert input reflects the importance of aligning policy, diplomacy, and industry support in facing the reciprocal tariff regime.</p><p>2.Reframing the challenge</p><p>Before delving into long-term strategies, it is important to reframe the situation not as an insurmountable threat but as a disruption that can be managed through smart, data-driven policies.</p><p>It is crucial to note:</p><p> The US tariff is not a sanction but a reciprocal tariff-a tool the US is using to press for 'fair treatment' of its exports.</p><p> The burden arises not from any single event or policy failure in Sri Lanka, but from global trade dynamics that the US perceives as structurally imbalanced.</p><p> While Sri Lanka was flagged with an '88% effective trade burden,' the methodology behind that figure remains opaque. Regardless, the response must be diplomatic, data-backed, and forward-looking.</p><p>3.Strategic pathways for Sri Lanka</p><p>Sri Lanka's response should be mapped over three time horizons-short, medium, and long term-each with specific policy levers and institutional actions.</p><p>A.Short-term (0-6 months): Stabilise and signal</p><p>Objective: Maintain business confidence, prevent export disruption, and open diplomatic channels.</p><p>Key actions:</p><p>1.High-level diplomacy</p><p> Engage the US Trade Representative (USTR), Department of Commerce, and Congress through formal diplomatic channels.</p><p> Utilise embassies and consulates to push for case-by-case tariff relief or targeted exemptions (as permitted under Annex II of the Executive Order).</p><p>2.Communicate transparently with exporters</p><p> Coordinate with industry associations to relay tariff specifics, affected HS codes, and implications.</p><p> Help exporters navigate potential duty drawback schemes or cost pass-through mechanisms.</p><p>3.Conduct a sectoral impact assessment</p><p> Commission detailed impact modelling across apparel, rubber, agricultural exports, and logistics.</p><p> Prioritise vulnerable supply chains and employment-intensive sectors.</p><p>4.Build multilateral coalitions</p><p> Coordinate with similarly affected countries-like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Pakistan-to jointly raise concerns at the WTO or regional trade forums.</p><p>5.Safeguard forex flows</p><p> Liaise with the Central Bank to monitor trade-related USD inflows and adjust reserves strategy if disruptions become prolonged.</p><p>B.Medium-term (6-24 months): Diversify and upgrade</p><p>Objective: Reduce vulnerability to US demand shocks by diversifying export destinations, upgrading value chains, and improving trade architecture.</p><p>Key strategies:</p><p>1.Market diversification</p><p> Accelerate access negotiations with the EU (GSP+ requalification), UK DCTS, and East Asian economies.</p><p> Expand bilateral agreements with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the GCC.</p><p>2.Export value addition</p><p> Promote higher-margin, branded apparel, specialty agricultural products, and processed goods that can absorb higher tariffs through premium positioning.</p><p> Incentivise R and D and product innovation in existing export categories.</p><p>3.Investor confidence measures</p><p> Reassure FDI investors that Sri Lanka remains committed to open trade and investment.</p><p> Offer short-term incentives to retain export-focused investors considering relocation due to tariffs.</p><p>4.Improve trade facilitation and compliance</p><p> Review and streamline customs procedures, labelling requirements, and licensing rules to eliminate perceived non-tariff barriers.</p><p> Engage in regulatory harmonisation with key partners.</p><p>5.Negotiate for inclusion in exclusion lists</p><p> Work with US authorities to demonstrate why certain goods from Sri Lanka should be reclassified under Annex II of the Executive Order.</p><p>C.Long-Term (2-5 years): Restructure and resilience</p><p>Objective: Future-proof Sri Lanka's export economy through institutional reform and systemic repositioning.</p><p>Key policy pathways:</p><p>1.Trade policy modernisation</p><p> Create a unified Trade Negotiation Authority capable of leading bilateral and multilateral negotiations.</p><p> Upgrade digital infrastructure to support end-to-end export tracking and compliance.</p><p>2.Manufacturing ecosystem strengthening</p><p> Transition from labour-cost arbitrage to skill, technology, and sustainability-based competitiveness.</p><p> Promote domestic input linkages to reduce reliance on imported raw materials.</p><p>3.WTO engagement and legal recourse</p><p> Consider dispute resolution avenues under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism if the reciprocal tariffs are seen to breach MFN principles.</p><p> Push for a global review of tariff methodologies, especially those involving 'composite burden' indices like the 88% figure.</p><p>4.Green and ethical trade leadership</p><p> Position Sri Lanka as a global leader in ethical apparel, organic agriculture, and fair trade.</p><p> Align export strategy with ESG standards increasingly prioritised by Western buyers.</p><p>5.Export resilience planning</p><p> Create a National Export Resilience Strategy with buffer funds, contingency trade arrangements, and early warning systems to preempt trade shocks.</p><p>4.Sector-specific priorities</p><p>Sri Lanka's response must recognise the asymmetric exposure across sectors:</p><p>Apparel</p><p> Engage US buyers directly to offer short-term cost mitigation.</p><p> Negotiate fabric forward rules that allow reclassification under US customs exemptions.</p><p> Scale e-commerce channels to bypass traditional markups.</p><p>Rubber and industrial goods</p><p> Develop regional sales platforms in India, Southeast Asia, and Africa.</p><p> Implement origin-based tariff engineering through regional partnerships.</p><p>Agriculture and plantation</p><p> Focus on high-margin, GI-certified exports like Ceylon Tea, cinnamon, and king coconut.</p><p> Leverage diaspora marketing to maintain brand loyalty in the US despite price increases.</p><p>Logistics and shipping</p><p>Develop warehousing and re-export models to segment high-tariff destinations.</p><p>Promote Colombo Port's role in transshipment over direct-to-US models.</p><p>5.A coordinated national effort</p><p>Sri Lanka's ability to adapt will hinge on whole-of-government and whole-of-society coordination.</p><p>The expert committee appointed by the President represents a critical institutional response. Its composition reflects broad stakeholder engagement, and its mission aligns with many of the actions outlined in this article. Follow-through will be essential, and the committee's recommendations must translate into coherent policy, legislative action, and diplomatic communication.</p><p>6.A new model of engagement with the US</p><p>Beyond immediate remedies, Sri Lanka must begin crafting a new model of engagement with the United States.</p><p>This includes:</p><p> Reinforcing shared geopolitical interests, including maritime security, democratic governance, and climate resilience.</p><p> Offering cooperative frameworks in clean energy, health technology, and education exports.</p><p> Building people-to-people linkages through diaspora networks, university partnerships, and digital diplomacy.</p><p>Conclusion: From retaliation to reinvention</p><p>Sri Lanka is at a crossroads. The 44% US tariff is not just a numerical penalty-it is a test of institutional maturity, policy agility, and economic imagination.</p><p>To its credit, the Government has moved quickly, launching diplomatic outreach and appointing an expert task force. These are foundational steps. The pathway ahead will require sustained policy momentum, strategic alliances, and pragmatic reforms.</p><p>As the global trade architecture becomes more contested, small but nimble nations like Sri Lanka must lead with clarity, courage, and coordination. The reciprocal tariffs, harsh though they are, may yet become the trigger for a long-overdue transformation.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["6.

Therefore, enhancing the potential of the agriculture sector is a key requirement in terms of improving economic opportunities for the vast majority of Sri Lankans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his Budget 2025 presentation, the President also said the following.</p><p>The Government policy on agriculture sector is aimed at increasing its productivity, competitiveness, and resilience.

As the newly elected Government finalised an IMF-backed debt restructuring deal agreed by the previous Government, a sustainable path out of the crisis with key creditors, including international sovereign bondholders (ISBs) who hold nearly 30% of the country's debt, seems unlikely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This unjust debt restructuring process underscored deeper systemic issues in global finance, including the lack of a sovereign bankruptcy mechanism and the unchecked power of private creditors. Without binding legal frameworks to ensure equitable debt resolution, debtor nations like Sri Lanka remain vulnerable to reckless lending practices, odious debts, and delays in restructuring processes that further harm their economies and people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge of negotiating with ISBs</p><p>ISBs represent a significant portion of Sri Lanka's debt burden and pose a unique challenge in the restructuring process. Unlike bilateral creditors or multilateral institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, ISBs are governed predominantly by New York or UK law, and there is no legal mechanism to compel private creditors to participate in debt restructuring negotiations. This absence of enforceable rules allows International Sovereign Bondholders to prioritise their financial interests, often to the detriment of the borrowing nation's economic recovery and public welfare.</p><p>Compounding the issue is the 'risk premium' that ISB investors receive-higher interest rates designed to compensate for the perceived risk of lending to countries like Sri Lanka. However, this premium has incentivised reckless lending practices, where creditors profit from high-risk loans without considering the long-term sustainability of the borrower's debt. When a country defaults, these same creditors can delay restructuring negotiations or demand disproportionate repayments, exacerbating economic instability and social hardship.</p><p>The consequences of an imbalanced system</p><p>The lack of a sovereign bankruptcy mechanism creates a profound power imbalance between debtor nations and their creditors. For countries like Sri Lanka, this imbalance manifests in several ways:</p><p>Prolonged negotiations: Without legal obligations to participate, private creditors can stall negotiations, delaying the resolution of debt crises. These delays exacerbate economic uncertainty, restrict access to international markets, and prolong the suffering of citizens.</p><p>Odious debts: Reckless lending practices often result in debts that are unsustainable or unjust, burdening nations with obligations that prioritise creditor profits over the needs of their people.</p><p>Limited resources for essential services: During restructuring, debtor nations must continue servicing their debts, diverting funds from critical areas such as healthcare, education, and climate resilience.</p><p>Economic and social damage: The uncertainty and austerity associated with protracted debt crises can lead to widespread economic stagnation, social unrest, and loss of trust in government institutions.</p><p>Legislative solutions for debt justice</p><p>Recognising these challenges, lawmakers in the UK and New York-two jurisdictions that govern most ISB contracts-are working to address the systemic flaws in sovereign debt resolution. Proposed debt justice laws in these jurisdictions aim to create a fairer and more efficient framework for restructuring sovereign debt.</p><p>In November 2024, Bambos Charalambous, Labour MP for Southgate and Wood Green in London, proposed in the UK parliament to bring in a Bill to make provision for or in connection with the relief of debts of certain developing countries.</p><p>Key provisions of proposed legislation</p><p>Limit on litigation: Private lenders would be prohibited from suing debtor countries for amounts exceeding what they would receive under an agreed debt restructuring framework. This would prevent creditors from bypassing restructuring agreements in pursuit of higher repayments.</p><p>Mandatory participation: Courts could compel private creditors to participate in debt restructuring agreements once governments and multilateral institutions, such as the IMF, have endorsed them.</p><p>Repayment pauses: Borrowing countries would be granted a moratorium on debt repayments once they formally apply for restructuring, preventing further depletion of their reserves during negotiations.</p><p>Equity in restructuring: The laws would ensure that private creditors are bound by the same terms as other lenders, reducing the toxic power imbalance that currently exists.</p><p>Benefits of debt justice legislation</p><p>If enacted, these reforms could transform the sovereign debt landscape, providing significant benefits for debtor nations and their populations:</p><p>Easier restructuring: By eliminating the ability of private creditors to hold out for better terms, the legislation would streamline restructuring processes and ensure greater compliance.</p><p>Financial relief for essential services: Reducing repayment obligations would free up critical resources for healthcare, education, and climate adaptation, improving the quality of life for citizens.</p><p>Faster resolution: Clear rules for creditor participation would reduce delays, allowing countries to return to stability and growth more quickly.</p><p>Levelling the playing field: By addressing the power imbalance between debtor nations and their creditors, these laws would restore fairness and accountability to the restructuring process.</p><p>The path forward for Sri Lanka</p><p>Sri Lanka's experience highlights the urgent need for systemic reforms in sovereign debt resolution. The country's default has revealed the predatory nature of international lending practices and the inadequacy of current frameworks to ensure equitable outcomes. For Sri Lanka, the immediate priority is to secure a sustainable debt restructuring agreement that alleviates the burden on its economy and people. However, achieving this goal requires more than just negotiations with creditors-it demands a global commitment to reforming the rules that govern sovereign debt.</p><p>The role of international advocacy</p><p>Organisations such as Debt Justice UK, alongside campaigners and lawmakers in the UK and New York, are playing a critical role in pushing for these reforms. Their efforts are aimed at creating a legal framework that prioritises the welfare of debtor nations and their citizens over the profit motives of private creditors. As Sri Lanka navigates its debt restructuring process, these advocacy efforts offer hope for a more just and sustainable resolution-not only for Sri Lanka but for all countries grappling with unsustainable debt.</p><p>The writer, co-founder of the Institute of Political Economy and a former local councillor in London, met with his local MP, Bambos Charalambous, at the UK Parliament to discuss the pressing challenges posed by Sri Lanka's debt crisis. During their meeting, Gunawardena highlighted the unsustainable nature of the current debt restructuring agreement and warned of the significant risk of further default when Sri Lanka's IMF program concludes in 2028.</p><p>Charalambous acknowledged these concerns and drew parallels to past global debt relief efforts, stating, '2025 marks the 25th anniversary of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which successfully secured over $ 100 billion in debt cancellation for 35 of the world's poorest countries. We must build on that success and push for renewed international action on debt relief, ensuring that savings from debt cancellation are redirected towards vital investments in health and education for low-income nations.'</p><p>The way forward</p><p>Sri Lanka's debt crisis underscores the urgent need for legislative reforms to address the inequities in sovereign debt resolution. Without mechanisms to enforce private creditor participation and ensure equitable restructuring, debtor nations remain trapped in a cycle of financial instability and social harm. The proposed debt justice laws in the UK and New York represent a critical step toward creating a fairer system-one that acknowledges the shared responsibility of lenders and borrowers and prioritises the well-being of people over profit.

Prime Minister Mark Brown's unequivocal commitment to transparency in publishing this agreement underscores a resolute stance against speculative conjecture. This bilateral covenant extends beyond mere diplomatic formalities, embodying a deliberate and strategic alliance sculpted over nearly three decades of unwavering engagement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1997, the Cook Islands and China have fostered an evolving camaraderie anchored in reciprocal respect and shared imperatives. As Prime Minister Brown astutely remarked, 'When they read our comprehensive strategic partnership, I hope they read it in partnership with New Zealand's own comprehensive strategic partnership and then tell me where the differences are that cause concern.' This statement, aimed at detractors questioning the accord's integrity, accentuates the imperative of measured scrutiny over hasty presuppositions.</p><p>The CSP's guiding principles-partnership, respect, integrity, and resilience-articulate a sophisticated framework ensuring bilateral engagements remain symbiotic. The Cook Islands' reaffirmation of the One-China policy further cements its diplomatic alignment with Beijing, reflecting the nuanced pragmatism inherent in Pacific geopolitics.</p><p>Economic cooperation is a linchpin of this agreement, particularly given the Cook Islands' precarious economic vulnerabilities despite its OECD-classified high-income status. The CSP delineates economic diversification strategies, enabling deeper integration into China's expansive trade networks. The Cook Islands is poised to capitalise on China's economic platforms, including international import expos and BRI-aligned investment conduits. Prime Minister Brown has been vocal about this pragmatic approach, stating, 'I'm very happy, as I said, for our action plan document to be put out to the public sphere for everybody to have a look at it.'</p><p>Infrastructure development has long been a hallmark of Sino-Cook Islands collaboration. China's instrumental role in past projects-ranging from judicial edifices to educational institutions-exemplifies its strategic investments. The new agreement seeks to enhance infrastructural advancements through synergies with regional frameworks like the Pacific Quality Infrastructure Initiative. However, stringent adherence to national regulatory imperatives remains paramount to safeguarding sovereign interests.</p><p>Environmental imperatives are interwoven throughout the CSP, acknowledging the existential threat of climate change to Pacific nations. The agreement advocates for bolstered climate resilience through China's technical prowess and financial accessibility. This aligns with the Cook Islands' renewable energy aspirations and China's 2060 carbon neutrality commitment. Mechanisms such as the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Change Cooperation Centre will facilitate technological exchanges, reinforcing regional sustainability ambitions.</p><p>Maritime cooperation constitutes a significant dimension of this partnership. From oceanic research to fisheries management and seabed mineral exploration, the CSP envisages multi-faceted engagements. The Cook Islands, prioritising seabed mineral extraction as a pivotal economic sector, will leverage Chinese expertise to navigate this burgeoning industry while ensuring ecological safeguards.</p><p>The agreement also accentuates disaster resilience, committing to intelligence-sharing, joint emergency drills, and humanitarian assistance. Given the Pacific's susceptibility to natural disasters, China's willingness to augment disaster preparedness frameworks is a strategic asset. The CSP envisions the creation of a China-Pacific disaster management coordination mechanism to institutionalise response capabilities.</p><p>Cultural and social synergies remain integral to this accord. The CSP aspires to fortify artistic and academic exchanges, cultivating deeper cross-cultural understanding. Education emerges as a priority, with China continuing to offer scholarships, linguistic immersion initiatives, and Confucius Classroom resources. Medical collaborations also take precedence, particularly in pandemic preparedness, as evidenced by commitments to joint research and the assimilation of traditional Chinese medicine within the Cook Islands' healthcare system.</p><p>The CSP situates regional and multilateral cooperation at its core, recognising China's role as a key Pacific Islands Forum dialogue partner. The Cook Islands seeks to harmonise China's Pacific engagement with the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, ensuring congruence with regional aspirations. Annual China-Pacific diplomatic forums serve as structured platforms for discourse, reinforcing policy synchronisation.</p><p>Security considerations within the CSP remain calibrated to established international protocols. Both nations pledge adherence to regional peace and security mechanisms, encompassing non-proliferation treaties and countering transnational crime. Crucially, the agreement refrains from any militaristic entanglements, maintaining the Cook Islands' diplomatic equilibrium.</p><p>Despite the accord's clear parameters, some external scepticism persists, particularly from New Zealand. However, Prime Minister Brown has been unequivocal: 'I'm sure once the New Zealand Government has a look at it that there will be nothing for them to be concerned about.' His assertion challenges critics to assess the document on its merits rather than succumb to speculative anxieties.</p><p>By publishing the CSP, the Cook Islands government has manifested an unambiguous confidence in its diplomatic agency. The agreement is meticulously structured, delineating substantive commitments in economic fortification, environmental stewardship, and cultural enrichment. As Pacific nations increasingly assert their geopolitical autonomy, the Cook Islands' engagement with China exemplifies a judicious exercise in strategic diplomacy-one that prioritises national development imperatives while upholding regional solidarity.</p><p>Ultimately, the CSP 2025-2030 is emblematic of an era where Pacific nations sculpt their own diplomatic trajectories. The Cook Islands-China accord, underpinned by a shared vision for progress, encapsulates the pragmatic and forward-looking ethos that defines contemporary Pacific diplomacy.

These wetlands, including the famous Koggala Lagoon, Muthurajawela Marsh, Wilpattu National Park, and Bundala National Park, are vital for both local communities and wildlife.</p><p>The Muthurajawela Marsh, for example, is Sri Lanka's largest coastal wetland and an important habitat for migratory birds. Meanwhile, Bundala National Park is a designated Ramsar Site, providing a safe haven for many species, including the endangered Sri Lankan elephant and waterfowl.</p><p>Why Are Wetlands Important?</p><p>Biodiversity Hotspots</p><p>Wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems, supporting a wide range of wildlife. In Sri Lanka, wetlands are home to over 200 species of birds, many of which are migratory. These wetlands are crucial for maintaining the balance of the ecosystem by supporting a diverse array of plants, insects, amphibians, and reptiles.</p><p>Natural Water Filters</p><p>Wetlands act as natural filters, improving water quality by trapping pollutants and sediments. This makes wetlands vital for ensuring clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. They also recharge groundwater, which is a crucial source of freshwater for Sri Lanka.</p><p>Climate Change Mitigation</p><p>Wetlands play a critical role in climate regulation by acting as carbon sinks. They store large amounts of carbon in their soil and vegetation, helping to reduce the effects of climate change. Sri Lanka's wetlands, particularly the mangroves along the coast, help protect coastal communities from the impacts of sea-level rise and extreme weather events.</p><p>Livelihoods and Economic Benefits</p><p>Wetlands provide vital resources for Sri Lankan communities. They support fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Local communities depend on wetland resources for their daily needs, including fishing, water supply, and agriculture. Moreover, wetlands attract eco-tourists from around the world, generating revenue and providing employment opportunities.</p><p>Threats to Sri Lankan Wetlands</p><p>Despite their importance, Sri Lanka's wetlands face numerous threats, including:</p><p>Urbanization: Rapid development along the coastlines and near wetland areas is leading to habitat destruction.</p><p>Pollution: Industrial runoff, untreated sewage, and plastic waste pollute wetland ecosystems, harming wildlife and reducing water quality.</p><p>Climate Change: Rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events are threatening coastal wetlands, making them more vulnerable to erosion and saltwater intrusion.</p><p>Unsustainable Resource Use: Overfishing, illegal hunting, and the extraction of wetland resources for commercial use are depleting these fragile ecosystems.</p><p>How Can We Protect Wetlands?</p><p>Conservation Efforts</p><p>Sri Lanka's government and conservation organizations are working together to protect key wetland areas through sustainable management and protection. It's important to support these efforts by advocating for stronger environmental laws and policies that safeguard wetlands.</p><p>Sustainable Development</p><p>Urban planning should prioritize wetland conservation, ensuring that development projects do not encroach upon vital ecosystems. This includes promoting eco-friendly infrastructure and sustainable agriculture.</p><p>Raising Awareness</p><p>Awareness campaigns, like World Wetlands Day, help educate the public about the importance of wetlands. By fostering a deeper understanding of these ecosystems, we can inspire more people to take action and support wetland conservation.</p><p>Community Engagement</p><p>Local communities play a central role in protecting wetlands. Empowering communities with the knowledge and resources to sustainably use wetland resources can ensure the long-term health of these ecosystems. Involving locals in conservation programs and eco-tourism initiatives can help create a shared responsibility for wetland preservation.</p><p>On this World Wetlands Day, let's take a moment to reflect on the immense value of Sri Lanka's wetlands. These ecosystems provide us with clean water, biodiversity, and climate resilience. By taking action today, we can help protect these vital areas for future generations.</p><p>Let's work together to ensure the survival of our wetlands, so they continue to support both nature and people.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hiru News.
