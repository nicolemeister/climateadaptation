These interventions target degraded lands and community areas, aiming to enhance biodiversity, improve community livelihoods, build climate resilience, and sequester carbon in one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in Sri Lanka's dry zone.</p><p>Stressing the significance of this degraded land restoration initiative, Sri Lanka Forest Department Deputy Conservator Nishantha Edirisinghe said that Sri Lanka was now committed to protecting 30% of its land under the Global Biodiversity Framework. But it currently only protects around 25%. To meet this target, the Forest Department was actively working on gazetting more forests as protected areas.</p><p>However, even once these areas are officially recognised as protected areas, the law still allowed for collaboration with communities, including benefit-sharing and involving them in conservation efforts.</p><p>Edirisinghe further added that Sri Lanka was in a difficult position where the degradation of its forests and environment caused many problems such as human-wildlife conflicts, climate change and water scarcity. Keeping the forests intact was essential for survival, and therefore, with every development project implemented, it was important to consider their impact on the forests.</p><p>'This project addresses the forest sector/the environment while also considering human well-being and development. So it has addressed both sectors. That is the most important and significant part of this project,' he said.</p><p>HSBC Sri Lanka CEO Mark Surgenor said that this initiative was much more than just planting trees or boosting yields. It was fundamentally about education, knowledge-sharing, and sustainable land management. He highlighted that improved yields in milk, poultry, and fruit production were being achieved without harming the environment through sustainable agricultural practices.</p><p>'It's a very detailed project involving many different dimensions... This is about getting that whole cycle working well together and that is how we create sustainability. Let's focus on making sure the land we've got is looked after as well as possible to create a long term sustainable solution rather than trying to create new lands.'</p><p>He noted that HSBC Sri Lanka was more than just a funding partner of the project, but the HSBC staff had also contributed over 2000 volunteer hours, actively participating in tree planting campaigns, school awareness programmes, and recognition events for community champions.</p><p>This pilot initiative focuses on restoration of the Siyabalagaswewa Forest and its surrounding landscape, located in the Thuppitiyawa Grama Niladhari (GN) Division of the Mahawilachchiya Divisional Secretariat, Anuradhapura District.</p><p>One of the initiative's most significant achievements is the instalment of boundary posts, a major step toward the legal declaration of the restored Siyabalagaswewa Forest as a Reserved Forest. This was done with technical support from the Forest Department who will initiate the gazetting process, which will officially establish it as a protected area, in the near future. This will be done to ensure long-term protection of the area while aligning with both national and global conservation targets.</p><p>In addition to restoring the 35 hectares of the Siyabalagaswewa Forest under the Forest Department, an additional 100 hectares of adjoining community land is being restored through regenerative agricultural practices such as food forest gardens, silvopastoral systems, live fencing, and avenue plantations. Moreover, the Mahawilachchiya Divisional Secretariat and the Department of Animal Production and Health have played pivotal roles in these community-based conservation efforts by collaborating closely with the project team.</p><p>The initiative exemplifies an effective Public-Private-People partnership focused on advancing Sri Lanka's national and global environmental commitments, particularly those under the 30x30 biodiversity targets, which aim to protect 30% of terrestrial and marine ecosystems by 2030.</p><p>IUCN Sri Lanka Country Representative Dr. Shamen Vithanage said, 'This was started in 2021 at a time when things were not in good shape for us.

PES is a simple idea with powerful implications but complex mechanisms: those who benefit from nature's services should pay for those who can protect and maintain them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This means using money and incentives-like payments or contracts-to encourage people to protect and promote nature. As a result, the people, communities and businesses that depend on ecosystem services of the nature will have a better input flow for their benefit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead of relying only on laws or regulations, the PES approach treats clean water, fresh air, forests, and wildlife as valuable services that benefit everyone. Those who use or profit from these services like companies or cities pays those who take care of them like farmers or forest communities.</p><p>Accordingly, PES creates a system where protecting and promoting nature becomes a fair and rewarding activity towards a greener future of the country.</p><p>There are a number of countries in Asia, which have already implemented PES such as Vietnam, Indonesia, China, India and the Philippines. As of now, some other Asian countries are also implementing pilot projects and preparing to implement PES - these countries include Thailand, Laos, Nepal, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bhutan, Mongolia, South Korea and Singapore.</p><p>Case of Vietnam</p><p>In the misty highlands of Vietnam, it was a quiet revolution turning highland forests into financial assets, uplifting rural communities, and protecting vital water sources - PES. It has been changing the way that governments, businesses, and villagers think about nature.</p><p>Nature has a value that has been undervalued since the time when the modern industrial age had begun. The world has been making use of its nature services - the so-called ecosystem services - taking its value as granted and without investing in conserving and promoting it or making a sustainable use of it.</p><p>Vietnam launched its national PES programme in 2008, starting with pilot projects in Lam Dong and Son La provinces. By 2010, it had scaled up nationwide through Decree 99, making PES a legal requirement. Under this Decree 99, forest ecosystem services as well as the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders were defined. The definition of the forest ecosystem services included such things as water regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and tourism. The roles and responsibilities included management and use of payments.</p><p>Today, over 5,000 square km of forest area are under PES contracts. Vietnam's forests are owned and managed by a mix of entities such as government agencies, local governments, communities, community-based organisations as well as the military units. Government agencies manage national parks, protected areas and state forest enterprises, while local governments must oversee forest protection.</p><p>Maintainance of forests, in particular, are with the ethnic minority communities, while community-based organisations such as farmer associations, women's unions and youth groups are involved in keeping the forests safe in some areas.</p><p>Forests ecosystem services</p><p>Forests provide a wide array of ecosystem benefits critical for keeping environmental sustainability, human well-being and economic progress in a sustainable manner. They provide natural regulating services protecting watersheds, reducing soil erosion, maintaining streamflows, and preventing sedimentation in water reserviours. Forests are important in regulating carbon emmission and improving air quality. Forest cover also helps buffer against floods, landslides and droughts.</p><p>Forests are crucial in maintaining biodiversity and species habitats. Vietnam's forests are part of a global biodiversity hotspot, hosting over 10,000 plant species and hundreds of endemic and endangered animal species. Forests provide critical habitat for wildlife and maintain ecological balance.</p><p>Forests are important sources of cultural values and supporting services, while the many ethinic groups traditionally living in such areas have deep cultural ties to forest landscapes. Soil formation and nutrient cycling is essential for agriculture and sustaining long-term land productivity. These forests also attract nature-based tourism, generating income and awareness.</p><p>Sellers and buyers</p><p>Now it is the responsibility of the communities to maintain the flow of ecosystem services of the forests by protecting and promoting them for which the communities receive a payment in cash or in-kind. More than 400,000 households-many from ethnic minority groups-receive payments for protecting forests under the PES mechanism in Vietnam. They are the sellers (or suppliers) of ecosystem services from the forests in the upstream areas.</p><p>But who are buyers? While protecting and promoting forest areas are crucial for national interests (for which the taxpayers must pay), there are direct beneficiaries of forest ecosystem services - hydropower plants, water supply companies, and tourism operators in the downstream areas. Payments for ecosystem services are collected from these downstream direct beneficiaries.</p><p>It is practically more complex than assumed to be conceptually, because there should be a market mechanism under which sellers and buyers exchange the ecosystem services. This means there is essentially a role for an intermediary institutional arrangement, which do not exist under normal market systems.</p><p>Ecosystem inputs</p><p>In Vietnam, the payments for ecosystem services are effectively embedded into the prices of the goods or services that are directly dependent on such ecosystem services - electricity tariffs, water tariffs and tourism charges. It is fair enough, because ecosystem services are vital inputs to produce these supplies. If the world is paying for labour, capital and technology, why not do the same justice for ecosystem services?</p><p>The payments are funneled through a Central and Provincial Forest Protection and Development Funds (FPDFs), which act as financial intermediaries. Over 98 per cent of PES revenue comes from public payments via electricity and water bills, with hydropower and water companies acting as intermediaries.</p><p>Then, the payments are disbursed to forest communities based on contracts and verified service delivery. Households and communities receive direct cash transfers or in-kind support. Payments are calculated per hectare or per service unit (e.g., water flow regulation). This programme focuses on four key ecosystem services: watershed protection, carbon sequestration, landscape beauty and biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Success story</p><p>Vietnam's PES mechanism is considered to be a success story which has depicted its long-term sustainability. Apart from better management of biodiversity and ecosystem services, it has derived positive impact on forest communities as well.</p><p>In the Central Highlands, villagers who once relied on slash-and-burn agriculture, encroaching forests and illegal logging activities, now earn steady income from forest protection and promotion. Women's groups have formed to manage payments and monitor forest health. Youth are trained as forest rangers. The programme has also improved forest cover, and strengthened local governance. Importantly, it respects customary land rights and involves communities in decision-making.</p><p>Vietnam's success lies not just in payments, but in the institutions behind them. Each province has a Forest Protection and Development Fund (FPDF), which acts as a financial intermediary. These funds collect payments from buyers and disburse them to forest stewards. The system is transparent, with contracts, audits, and GPS-based monitoring. It blends state oversight with market incentives-a model that balances accountability and flexibility.</p><p>Lessons for Sri Lanka</p><p>Sri Lanka has rich forest ecosystems-from the Knuckles Range to Sinharaja-and vital watersheds that feed our rivers and reservoirs. Yet deforestation, encroachment, and climate stress threaten these lifelines. Already, the communities are faced with ever-escalating wildlife conflict including human-elephant and human-leopard conflicts.</p><p>In addition, Sri Lanka also has a coastal belt that provides a rich array of ecosystem services that are vital for environmental health, economic development, and community well-being. Could PES help us turn the tide?</p><p>As Sri Lanka explores nature-based solutions, PES deserves serious attention. It aligns with global trends-from the Kunming-Montreal biodiversity framework to climate finance goals. Vietnam's story shows that PES is not just theory-it's practice.</p><p>It's not just economics-it's empowerment. And it's not just conservation-it's transformation.

Some examples include climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration and storage through forests), regulation of heat and air quality (e.g., green roofs and walls), flood control and water treatment (e.g., urban wetlands and waterways), disaster risk reduction (e.g., mangrove belts to protect coastal settlements and infrastructure), livelihood generation (e.g., through ecotourism, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable (agro)forestry), or public health (e.g., bats controlling dengue mosquito populations).</p><p>As a climate-vulnerable island nation, Sri Lanka faces both challenges and opportunities when it comes to the utilisation of NBS. On the one hand, the country needs to find cost-effective and affordable solutions to address climate impacts and strengthen economic development and growth. On the other hand, it has the potential to harness NBS for both a green and a blue economy, scaling up nature-based businesses to benefit from the island's existing wealth of biodiversity and variety of productive natural ecosystems.</p><p>This entails fully nature-based solutions, such as restoring urban wetlands (Colombo's wetlands, for example, have lost 40% of their water holding capacity over the last decade, but could play a critical role for disaster risk reduction and improvement of water and air quality) or afforestation to increase the national forest cover (in line with national commitments and goals), but also the integration of nature-based elements into business models and supply chains. For example, nature-based ingredients and methods could be used in sectors such as the fashion and garment industry; mangrove belts and other ecosystems could be integrated into the design of coastal hotels or resorts; seagrass and other aqua- and mariculture could enhance the blue economy; and investment could be channelled into agroforestry and sustainable, nature-positive agricultural practices, building on existing local and traditional knowledge.</p><p>NBS hold the potential to provide benefits for people, planet, and the economy, but they need to be supported by appropriate frameworks that facilitate investment, prevent greenwashing, and enable entrepreneurs, SMEs, and corporates to access relevant data, resources, accreditation, certification, and risk management techniques.

In the journey of transitioning to a low carbon economy and a cleaner Sri Lanka through the development of the ESG pillars, the Government of Sri Lanka and environmentally and socially responsible corporates could make great use of innovative sustainable financing tools such as GSS + bonds introduced at the CSE.</p><p>Putting your money where your values are: GSS+ products explained</p><p>GSS+ refers to a category of financial products designed to fund projects with positive environmental and social impacts. The following are types of sustainable bond products within the GSS+ framework.</p><p>1. Green Bonds</p><p>Green Bonds are innovative financial instruments where the proceeds are invested exclusively (either by specifying the use of the proceeds, direct project exposure, or securitisation) in eligible green projects that generate climate or other environmental benefits such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable waste management, sustainable land use (forestry and agriculture), biodiversity, clean transportation and clean water. Their structure, risk and returns are otherwise identical to those of traditional bonds. They are no different from conventional bonds where their structure, risk and return are identical to traditional bonds with the only difference being the specification that the proceeds be invested in projects that generate environmental benefits.</p><p>2. Blue Bonds</p><p>Blue Bonds are a subset of Green Bonds, where the funds raised are used to finance the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems, particularly in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development).</p><p>Possible broad project categories include:</p><p>Sustainable blue economic activities that restore, protect and maintain diversity, productivity, resilience, core functions, value and health of marine ecosystems.</p><p>Provide sustained livelihood opportunities and strengthen livelihoods and communities dependent on the marine ecosystems.</p><p>Investments which strengthen, restore and conserve the blue natural capital for climate mitigation and climate adaptation.</p><p>Investments that address coastal resilience and coastal and marine climate adaptation challenges.</p><p>Activities and projects that reduce stressors to marine ecosystems, such as sources of pollution which can be from industry, agriculture, retail sector etc.</p><p>Infrastructure that is using nature-based solutions in the marine and coastal space and.</p><p>Activities that strengthen coastal and marine governance, science and technology for the benefit of ecosystems.</p><p>3. Social Bonds</p><p>Similar to a Green Bond, a Social Bond is a fixed income instrument where the proceeds are focused on activities with predominantly positive social outcomes. Accordingly, Social Bonds mobilise funds to finance or refinance in part or in full new and/or existing eligible social projects. Some examples of eligible social projects include ; affordable basic infrastructure (e.g. clean drinking water, sewers, sanitation, transport, energy), access to essential services (e.g. health, education and vocational training, healthcare, financing and financial services), affordable housing, employment generation and programs designed to prevent and/or alleviate unemployment stemming from socioeconomic crises, climate transition projects and/or other considerations for a 'just transition' (such provision and/or promotion could include SME financing and microfinance), food security and sustainable food systems (e.g. physical, social, and economic access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food that meets dietary needs and requirements, resilient agricultural practices; reduction of food loss and waste, and improved productivity of small-scale producers).</p><p>4. Sustainability linked bonds</p><p>Sustainability Linked Bonds differ from the other types of GSS+ Bonds in that their proceeds are not used to finance specific projects but are instead made available for general corporate purposes, with the issuer contractually undertaking to achieve predefined, measurable sustainability targets or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). As a rule, failure to achieve these targets results in penalty payments to investors attributes to an increased coupon. The opposite is sometimes true, i.e. the coupon or payment to investors is reduced if the KPI targets are met. In both cases, sustainability-linked bonds are intended to provide the issuer with a financial incentive to achieve the sustainability targets it has set within the agreed time frame.</p><p>An example of a recently issued Sustainability Linked Bond is by Coca-Cola I\u00e7ecek (CCI), which successfully launched the largest Sustainability-linked bond in Trkiye to date, with an issue size of USD 500 million. Under the terms of the bond, CCI has committed to improving its water efficiency by 13% by 2027 and 17% by 2029, aligning its financial strategy with its broader environmental sustainability goals by the time the bond reaches maturity.</p><p>In addition to the aforesaid main categories, issuers also have the option of combining both Green and Social elements and issuing a Sustainability Bond where proceeds are utilised to finance or re-finance a combination of both Green and Social Projects.</p><p>From millions to trillions: The explosive growth of Sustainable Bonds</p><p>As per World Bank data, the market expanded remarkably from just $140 billion pre-2016 to a peak of $1,239 billion in 2021, representing nearly 9x growth over this period.</p><p>After explosive growth culminating in 2021, the market experienced a moderate contraction in 2022 (to $1,020 billion) followed by slight recovery in 2023 ($1,073 billion) and 2024 ($1,125 billion).</p><p>Moreover, when it comes to product diversification, while the Green Bonds dominated the early market, there was a significant diversification with Social Bonds emerging more prominently around 2019-2020, sustainability-Linked Bonds appearing around 2020 and solidifying their presence and Transition bonds representing the smallest segment with minimal visibility.</p><p>The period between 2019-2021 marked the most dramatic growth (from $389B to $1,239B), likely influenced by the pandemic which heightened focus on both social welfare and green recovery initiatives.</p><p>However, despite the diversification, Green Bonds consistently represent the largest segment by volume throughout the entire period between pre 2016, 2016 -2024, underlining their foundational role in the sustainable finance market.</p><p>Moreover, Sustainable Bond issuances for the year 2024 reached USD 1.1 trillion which is a 5% increase from the amount recorded for 2023. Further, the cumulative amount of Green, Social, Sustainability, Sustainability-Linked, and Transition (labeled sustainable) Bonds issued in the market amounted to USD 6.2 trillion as at the end of December 2024.</p><p>Additionally, advanced markets demonstrate both greater volume and diversity in sustainable finance instruments, while Emerging Markets and Supranational issuers contribute relatively equal shares but with different compositions.</p><p>The above facts denote the maturing of the sustainable finance market, with initial explosive growth, giving way to a more stable but still substantial market with diversified product offerings across the GSS+ spectrum.</p><p>Unlocking value: The advantages of GSS+ Bond issuance and investment</p><p>These bonds offer issuers a pathway to diversify funding sources, enhance their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) profiles, and attract a broader investor base. For investors, GSS+ bonds present opportunities to achieve competitive financial returns while contributing to impactful projects that address global challenges. As the market for these bonds continues to expand, understanding their advantages is crucial for both issuers and investors aiming to make informed and responsible financial decisions.</p><p>Benefits to issuers</p><p>1. Provides the issuers with the opportunity to diversify the funding sources and attract a new pool of investors interested in sustainable investments; domestic and international</p><p>2. Issuing a Sustainable Bond enhances the issuer's reputation as a responsible entity concerned with and adhering to ESG aspect, thereby being recognised as a contributor to achieving national SDGs</p><p>3. The strong investor demand enjoyed by Sustainable Bonds provides the issuer with the opportunity to reduce interest rates and therefore lower the cost of funds</p><p>4. Sustainable Bonds offer an effective mode of finance to cost-intensive investment projects that provide environmental and social benefits to the country</p><p>Benefits to investors</p><p>1. Offers an investment option that provides comparable financial returns whilst contributing towards the country's economic and sustainable development</p><p>2. The respective Sustainable Bond Principes and Standards require the issuers to adhere to stringent reporting requirements which provides transparency for managing the investment</p><p>3. It gives investors a sense of self-fulfillment for contributing towards projects that save the environment and support social development</p><p>Sustainable finance under scrutiny: Regulatory standards for GSS+ instruments</p><p>As per the Listing Rules of the CSE, an entity seeking to issue GSS+ Bonds needs to adhere to the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Principles and Guidelines pertaining to Green, Blue, Social or Sustainability Linked Bonds. Provided however, in the case of a Commercial Bank, Specialised Bank or Financial Institution licensed/regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka seeking to issue GSS+ Bonds, such Entity shall additionally adhere to the Green Finance Taxonomy, or any related Taxonomy (as applicable) issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Further, it is required that the Entity seeking to issue GSS+ Bond/s appoint an Independent External Reviewer to provide prior to the issue, an external review in the form of one of the following:1) Consultant's Review/ Second Party Opinion, 2) verification or 3) a Green Bond Rating (separate from an issuer's overall ESG rating). Further, post issuance, the external reviewer is to attest on the entity's compliance with the applicable ICMA Principles and Guidelines and the Green Finance Taxonomy issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as applicable on a periodic basis and confirm the effective utilisation of proceeds. The Rules include stringent enforcement criteria to deter and remedy any non-compliance by the issuer.</p><p>Sri Lanka's emerging GSS+ Bond landscape: Key milestones and market interest</p><p>Sri Lanka's first Green Bond was issued by the DFCC Bank in September 2024 for a total value of LKR 2.5 billion at a coupon of 12%. This issue was oversubscribed. In December 2024, the DFCC went on to obtain a dual listing for its Green Bond at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE). Further, Alliance Finance Company PLC, a Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) issued LKR 1 billion of Green Bonds in February 2025 at a coupon of 10.75%, which was also oversubscribed. Several other issuers are currently working with the CSE in relation to issuing GSS+ Bonds.</p><p>Future of sustainable investment in Sri Lanka: Promising potential</p><p>Sri Lanka\"s journey into sustainable finance has gained significant momentum, marked by pioneering product issues as described above which depicts a robust investor appetite for environmentally and socially responsible investments. These developments signal a promising future for GSS+ products in Sri Lanka, potentially attracting international capital and fostering a more resilient economy. With a lineup of potential issuers interested in launching GSS+ Bonds, Sri Lanka is poised to become a regional leader in sustainable finance. The nation\"s commitment to renewable energy and social development, coupled with supportive regulatory frameworks, positions it as an attractive destination for impact-focused investors.

With countries set to submit early next year their updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world has an opportunity - and a responsibility - to take transformative action to address the climate crisis. The ocean must be central to this effort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody understands this better than small island developing states (SIDS) like Palau. For us, climate policy is not some abstract debate about hypothetical future risks; it is a fight for survival. Already, coral reefs are undergoing bleaching; storms are becoming increasingly frequent and destructive; and droughts are undermining food security. Rising sea levels threaten not just our land, but also our culture, our way of life, and our very existence.</p><p>To date, international support for climate action has fallen far short of meeting developing countries' needs. SIDS collectively receive less than 2% of global climate finance, even as they oversee 30% of the world's territorial waters. It is a striking imbalance, especially given the ocean's enormous untapped potential to help mitigate climate change.</p><p>The ocean is our planet's largest carbon sink, absorbing 25% of all carbon dioxide emissions and a staggering 90% of the excess heat generated by a warming atmosphere. According to a 2023 report, ocean-based climate solutions can get us as much as 35% closer to our emissions-reduction targets for 2050, on a pathway that limits the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0 Celsius. And mitigating climate change is just the beginning; a healthy ocean plays a pivotal role in creating sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable communities worldwide.</p><p>Consider nature-based solutions like the restoration of mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs. Beyond sequestering carbon, these ecosystems act as natural defences against rising seas and extreme weather, and they form the basis of local livelihoods. In Palau, marine protected areas safeguard biodiversity, support sustainable fisheries, and bolster the tourism industry.</p><p>So far, the ocean-including the ecosystems it supports-has largely been treated as an afterthought in global climate strategies, sidelined in favour of more visible priorities like renewable energy and curbs on emissions. The High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy has revealed that many of its member countries-which together govern half the world's territorial oceans-have yet to integrate the ocean fully into their NDCs.</p><p>This omission represents a vital opportunity, which countries should seize as they prepare their NDC submissions before the February deadline. Putting the ocean at the centre of our climate strategies would transform it from a silent victim of global warming into an active force for mitigation and resilience-building.</p><p>The Blue Economy and Finance Forum (BEFF) takes place in June, one of the 'special events' that will set the stage for the third UN Ocean Conference in Nice. The BEFF aims to unlock financing for ocean-based solutions, particularly biodiversity-positive investments that simultaneously support economic development and climate goals. But, as we saw at COP29, public budgets are already stretched thin. Mobilising private capital alongside public investment is thus essential to drive meaningful change.</p><p>To understand why, look no further than the shipping industry, which emits more carbon than all but six countries. Critical pieces of the net-zero puzzle are already in place for the industry. Shipping companies are planning their low-carbon transitions. The technologies they need-in particular, 'green fuels' like green methanol and ammonia-have been de-veloped. And producers are ready to increase output while continuing to innovate. And yet scaling up production has proved difficult, because investors still view crucial green technologies as too risky.</p><p>This mismatch between ambition and funding underscores the need for creative financing solutions, such as government-backed guarantees or blended-finance instruments. Fortunately, the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance, agreed at COP29, offers an opportunity to set ambitious targets and leverage innovative mechanisms to unlock private investment at scale.</p><p>Despite its disappointments, COP29 delivered another reason for cautious optimism: the dis-cussions there reflected growing recognition that ocean action is climate action. This idea, which began gaining traction in 2019 during the Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue at COP25, has evolved into a powerful movement. As a result, momentum is building behind ocean-based climate solutions.</p><p>But harnessing this momentum to deliver measurable action-such as the introduction of more marine protected areas covering mangroves and seagrass meadows or scaling up the decarbonisation of the shipping industry-will require collaboration across sectors and bor-ders. And it will require far more financing. As we look ahead to the BEFF and beyond, we must make one thing crystal clear: investing in the ocean is investing in our collective future.</p><p>(Ilana Seid is Palau's Ambassador to the United Nations, Sherpa Co-Chair of the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, and Co-Chair of the Steering Committee for the Blue Economy and Finance Forum.)</p><p>Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2024. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</url></p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["5\u00b0 Celsius.

Its location along major shipping routes has made it a critical node for global trade. However, as a small island state, it faces growing threats from climate change. The island nation is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and other environmental shifts that intensify maritime security risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the broader Indian Ocean Region (IOR), many island states, like Sri Lanka, share common vulnerabilities due to their reliance on maritime resources. They depend on the ocean for livelihoods through fishing, tourism, and trade. Climate change disrupts these activities, leading to resource scarcity and the amplification of illegal fishing and maritime crime.</p><p>As sea temperatures rise, fish populations shift, often resulting in increased competition for dwindling stocks. This competition can fuel illegal fishing, further threatening economic stability. Additionally, rising sea levels endanger coastal infrastructure, including ports and naval bases, which are vital for both trade and security. The displacement of coastal communities due to climate-induced erosion and flooding is another significant concern, often leading to human trafficking and migration.</p><p>Sri Lanka's experience highlights the need for robust adaptation strategies to counter these threats. The country has taken proactive steps, including launching its Climate Prosperity Plan, restoring mangrove ecosystems, and enhancing coastal resilience. The Sri Lankan Navy plays a crucial role in safeguarding maritime interests by increasing patrols, intercepting illegal activities, and collaborating with international partners on counter-piracy and trafficking efforts.</p><p>For island states in the IOR, Sri Lanka serves as a case study for addressing the complex interplay between climate change and maritime security. Regional cooperation, policy integration, and community-led adaptation are essential to building resilience and ensuring long-term stability in these vulnerable regions. By taking a holistic approach, island states can better navigate the challenges posed by climate change and secure their maritime futures.</p><p>Strengthening Adaptation and Regional Cooperation</p><p>Building on its proactive measures, Sri Lanka underscores the importance of regional collaboration and a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change impacts on maritime security. Given the interconnectedness of island nations in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), collective efforts are crucial for strengthening resilience and safeguarding maritime interests.</p><p>Sustainable Fisheries and Blue Economy Diversification</p><p>Sri Lanka's experience highlights the importance of sustainable fisheries management. Overfishing due to climate change-induced shifts in marine ecosystems is a growing concern across the region. Collaborating with neighboring countries to adopt sustainable fishing practices and enforce regulations can prevent resource depletion and mitigate conflicts. Additionally, diversifying the blue economy-by investing in renewable energy, marine research, and ecotourism-can reduce dependence on vulnerable sectors like traditional fisheries and tourism.</p><p>Climate-Resilient Infrastructure and Coastal Management</p><p>As climate-induced risks, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather, threaten critical coastal infrastructure, Sri Lanka's focus on climate-resilient planning offers valuable lessons for other island states. Investments in strengthening ports, naval bases, and coastal surveillance systems are essential for maintaining both economic stability and maritime security. Sri Lanka's efforts in restoring mangroves and protecting coral reefs serve as practical examples of nature-based solutions that enhance coastal resilience while supporting livelihoods.</p><p>Community-Led Adaptation and Local Empowerment</p><p>Engaging local communities in climate adaptation efforts is another vital component of resilience building. Sri Lanka's mangrove restoration projects and coastal conservation initiatives demonstrate how empowering local populations can lead to more sustainable outcomes. Island states across the IOR can replicate this model by integrating local knowledge and participation into broader climate adaptation strategies, fostering stronger social cohesion and environmental stewardship.</p><p>Joint Maritime Operations and International Cooperation</p><p>Sri Lanka's active participation in joint maritime operations and regional security forums, such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), showcases the importance of international cooperation. Strengthening regional ties through coordinated patrols, information sharing, and capacity building can help island states effectively combat transnational crimes, such as piracy, smuggling, and illegal fishing. The establishment of agreements like the Djibouti Code of Conduct is an important step toward enhancing maritime security and ensuring the safe passage of global trade.</p><p>Charting a Climate-Resilient Maritime Future</p><p>As the effects of climate change continue to reshape the maritime landscape, Sri Lanka's comprehensive approach to adaptation and security serves as a roadmap for other island nations. By prioritizing sustainability, fostering regional cooperation, and empowering local communities, the IOR can mitigate the threats posed by climate change and ensure long-term security for its maritime domain.</p><p>In conclusion, Sri Lanka's proactive strategies in addressing the nexus between climate change and maritime security provide a blueprint for island states in the Indian Ocean Region.

By evening we were asked to evacuate and take shelter at the Sooriyawewa School. We had no way of even changing our clothes. The telephone lines were disconnected, there was no electricity or water supply and the survivors were in dire straits. But without staying back at the school we returned to the town to gather dead bodies\"</p><p>- Mohamed Zain Airudeen</p><p>It had only taken a matter of seconds for the deadly wave to claim people's lives and cause irreparable damage to property. There were two events that took place. Just before the wave struck, the shoreline cleared and people ran towards the beach. The next instance, a second, more deadly wave struck. \"We ran uphill as far as our legs would take us. By the time the wave subsided and we returned in search of our families and loved ones, almost everything had been ruined,\" he said.</p><p>Airudeen recalled how one could only think of running for dear life leaving behind their loved ones because the intensity of the wave was unimaginable. \"After I heard that the wave had subsided I started looking for my relatives and friends. But people who had survived were soaked in water and there were injured people all around me and on top of that there were even more dead bodies. It was a harrowing experience,\" he said.</p><p>The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami claimed the lives of over 30,000 people from across Sri Lanka, out of which the recorded death toll in Hambantota was over 3000. Airudeen lost his mother, elder sister and six other family members on that fateful day. \"I somehow located my elder brother. He too had run like me and was waiting at a corner of a street. It was only by afternoon that we started looking for our relatives and friends. We recovered my mother's body and slowly gathered the bodies of those whom we knew. As more dead bodies were found there wasn't enough space at the old hospital which was previously in the town,\" he said.</p><p>The Hambantota town underwent a major transformation following the tsunami. A volleyball court has been constructed at the place where Airudeen's house used to be. The Sunday fair has been shifted towards the main road. But it took over a year to rebuild their lives and for them to settle down at a new house away from the coastline.</p><p>\"Our houses were destroyed by the wave and we had nowhere to go. By evening we were asked to evacuate and take shelter at the Sooriyawewa School. We had no way of even changing our clothes. The telephone lines were disconnected, there was no electricity or water supply and the survivors were in dire straits. But without staying back at the school we returned to the town to gather dead bodies. Some remains were beyond recognition as the bodies were swollen after people drowned. There were bodies of locals and tourists. Since there wasn't enough space to bury the remains of all who were dead, some were buried at the mosque premises as well,\" said Airudeen.</p><p>Raja's experience</p><p>Airudeen's elder brother, fondly known as Raja, had been playing with his two-year old just before tsunami struck. \"I was closing the gate when I heard my neighbour scream saying \"Raja duwanna, wathura enawa!\" (which translates to Raja run! The water is coming!). I hurriedly looked around and it was only then that I saw a massive wave, a wave larger than a massive Palu tree heading inland. I took the child to my hand and before I could decide what to do, the wave struck. The water came with such a force that everybody was being taken away by the strong current. I closed my eyes and was floating away when I felt something and grabbed onto it. Eventually the water subsided and that was when I realised that I had landed on the slab of a nearby house,\" said Raja.</p><p>Many people have died as they banged into by pillars transmitting electricity, windows, bricks and other materials that were either uprooted or damaged by the wave. \"In such an instance you only have the senses to save your own life,\" he added. \"After the water subsided I rushed back to my mother's house, but even at that point it was beyond recognition. I could barely recognise her house by guessing the location. But I couldn't find her. Then a friend came and said that he had seen my wife. I then went in search of her and on my way back I met my younger brother,\" recalled Raja.</p><p>By evening more bodies were being recovered and all of them were being transported by tractors. Raja and his brother were on a mission to find their relatives and friends. Some bodies were being taken to the hospital while some were taken to the Sippikulama Mosque. \"While we were waiting a neighbour had recovered a body of a woman thinking that it was his mother. Just then someone asked me to check whether it was my mother. I immediately identified the body and it was then that I came back to my senses,\" Raja said.</p><p>Thereafter he had made it his responsibility to note down all the dead bodies that were recovered from his area. He had continued to fill the notebook, noting down all dead bodies with respective addresses with the help of a torchlight. Once the mosque reached maximum capacity, the remaining bodies were taken to the other mosque premises behind the Municipal Council. By evening the stench from the bodies had become unbearable. \"But I couldn't leave my mother's body just like that. I managed to recover bodies of people in my neighbourhood. We had to cover the bodies and I requested people to give some clothes if they had any. Women brought their sarees, we lit up fires to reduce the stench and chanted religious slogans. By next day morning we were able to get some white clothes to prepare the bodies for burial. The Sippikulama Mosque premises had the first tsunami mass grave where my mother's body and bodies of everyone in my neighbourhood were buried,\" Raja recalled.</p><p>The remaining bodies were taken to the burial ground behind the Municipal Council. The Hambantota town itself has three mass graves which contain the remains of people, who lost their lives from the deadly wave. Almost all bodies were recovered using tippers and backhoes. Even amidst the devastation, Raja wanted to ensure that almost all bodies of the Muslim community were given a dignified burial. Raja recalled how drug addicts resorted to taking off body parts of dead bodies in order to obtain any gold jewellery that people had worn. To avoid such incidents from occurring, the military had warned people to leave the town area, indicating that a third wave might occur anytime, just to scare away the people and avoid further crimes.</p><p>Raja, Airudeen and everybody who were displaced in Hambantota were relocated to Sooriyawewa. But before the authorities could reach the affected communities, people in Sooriyawewa had looked after the displaced survivors of the tsunami, irrespective of religious differences. It was a story of communal harmony where even elderly women were healing the minds of the affected people. \"They provided us with food and every facility that they could provide us with and there were elderly women who even pacified us because they knew we were dealing with a great deal of trauma,\" recalled Raja.</p><p>As the official in charge of the Sunday fair, Raja had wanted to give something to the people of Sooriyawewa for the support they extended to the displaced families. As a result, Raja made arrangements to allow vegetable and fruit sellers in Sooriyawewa to bring their produce to the Sunday fair in Hambantota thereby providing an opportunity for them to sell their products as a gesture of goodwill. \"To date, we still treat them like family and vice versa,\" he added.</p><p>The tsunami struck when Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was President. Immediately after a disaster, people expect the government to support them until they recover from the trauma and devastation. Transparency International Sri Lanka revealed that Sri Lanka received US$ 2126 million from international donors following the tsunami; out of which only USD 1075 million were disbursed. However the government failed to provide an explanation as to what happened to over US$ 471 million from the disbursed amount. Even though the government denied allegations of funds being misused, individuals such as Airudeen and Raja, who were displaced by the tsunami, eventually had to depend on foreign aid to rebuild their lives.</p><p>Foreign donor agencies made use of the opportunity to help rebuild the lives of affected families and many of these were genuine efforts. But Raja and Airudeen alleged how local officials attempted to rob money from these initiatives as well. They claimed that the infrastructure in some houses were of extremely poor quality that they had to report these malpractices to the original donor. Some projects undertaken by certain people, who had VIP status, were condemned by the Housing Development Authority. It took almost a year for Raja and Airudeen to get a house of their own.</p><p>Back in 2006 people weren't prepared for a tsunami in the backdrop of a civil war in the North. In fact, people didn't even know what a tsunami was to begin with. The only response they knew was to run for dear life; just like how Airudeen and Raja did. There are many other survivors like Airudeen and Raja who will never be able to recover from the trauma of that deadly event. It was only afterwards that disaster management and risk reduction became a topic of discussion. Many initiatives such as early warning systems were set up to enhance Sri Lanka's capacity to detect and respond to seismic activities. There were policies in place to introduce no-build buffer zones to restrict constructions within a specified distance from the coastline. But implementation of such policies have faced resistance from various factions. The importance of mangrove and coral reef restoration too have been discussed as effective nature-based solutions to mitigate the impact of tsunamis. But whether people are prepared to face natural disasters that occur in Sri Lanka still remains a question.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Pointing out that climate change has increased vastly in the past century, the joint presentations by the two conservationists showed how climate change attacks the entire ecosystem just as a malfunction in one area of the human ecosystem, the body would impact the whole.</p><p>Dr. SriyanieMiththapala is a graduate in Biology from the University of Colombo, with an MA in Biology from Smith College, US, and PhD in Wildlife and Range Sciences from the University of Florida, US. As a Smithsonian Research Associate, she is a consultant at the Sri Lanka Country Office of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p><p>Prof. Devaka Weerakoon is a senior professor at the University of Colombo, Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences, and has worked extensively on local and international conservation projects.</p><p>Pointing out the need for a holistic policy on climate change action that would incorporate nature based solutions the two conservationists showed how using shrubs, grass and trees is far superior to a stone made wall when countering flooding.</p><p>Among the points highlighted at the discussion that ensued with the participants, was that nature based solutions 'take time' to which they said it should be dispensed with, given the concept of 'time' should be interpreted in accordance with the sustainability and impact of the solution. The explanation that two or three years would take for some plant species to become an effective buffer against landslides should not be regarded as a 'long time' said a member of the audience who actively works on interweaving nature based solutions with various other socio-economic concerns.</p><p>This comment complimented the basic fact highlighted by the two academics that all solutions to put right a world suffering from pollution and man-made destruction of the earth would be to turn to nature. The growth of plant species on mountain slopes was underscored to prevent landslides, quoting examples from Nepal, on the importance of mangroves to cool the overheated earth, noting that Sri Lanka has lost its way from its initial enthusiasm for nurturing mangroves for climate disaster prevention following the 2004 tsunami. Examples from Bangladesh showed the effectiveness of the floating plots created using traditional knowledge to counter flooding. Here, reed mats were weaved interwoven with plant seeds and roots so that it would stem the excessive outflow of water, resulting in aesthetic floating gardens.</p><p>It was demonstrated that conserving nature and the survival of other species finally lead to the survival and wellbeing of humans, indicating that conservation equals food security and the opposite equals loss of homes, livelihood, poverty and food insecurity.</p><p>They explained how nature grows forests on its own when left to its own devices, with human assistance could result in more food security.</p><p>'I hope a holistic national policy, one policy that would integrate all essential factors related to climate action and conservation would be made in my lifetime instead of fragmented solutions,' quipped Dr. Miththapala, when asked her views on the different policies made in Sri Lanka pertaining to theses connected with nature conservation.</p><p>Although not elaborated upon due to time constraint, how animals, including leopards, contribute to the ecosystem was briefly touched on.</p><p>Here again the logic that was self-evident is that when nature is conserved and kept in abundance for the animal species their encroaching on human territory decreases. Sri Lanka's dilemma is that the human occupied landmass is some 70% with less than 30% safeguarded for nature.</p><p>The lecture focused on global and local economic impacts of climate disasters running into billions of dollars while the corrective path seems quite simple; return to nature and let nature take over our lives and minds instead of flagrant materialism.</p><p>One of the highlights of the event in terms of audience participation was when well-known forest garden promoter Ranjit Seneviratne 87 years young jumped up from his seat and yelled 'I am 87 years and I can jump like this because I eat everything that grows in my garden forest in Kollupitiya.' It is so simple. A forest can be grown even in a concrete obsessed territory and one such home garden forest can be an inspiration to many.</p><p>While congratulating the incredible efforts of those such as Dr. Sriyanie Miththapala and Prof. Dewaka Weerakoon the impact of such lectures are so powerful, and at times unmeasurable. For instance, chatting with Ranjit Seneviratne after the event I learnt that it was one of Dr. Miththapala's lectures some 10 years ago that inspired him to transform his home garden into a forest.

Looking to advance progress towards the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) goals and targets adopted by almost 200 countries (including Sri Lanka) at the last CoP in 2022, all attention this year is on the 700 billion dollar question, 'So where will the money come from?' $ 700 billion is the annual biodiversity finance gap, identified in the GBF and analysed in detail by The Nature Conservancy. Recognising the urgent need to fill this gap, Target 19 of the GBF commits to 'mobilise $ 200 billion per year for biodiversity from all sources'. As Conservation International's Chief Strategy Officer remarked ahead of the summit in Cali, Colombia, '...negotiators cannot leave Cali without deciding where some of that funding will originate, when it will be delivered, and what groups will receive it'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amidst Sri Lanka's acute fiscal constraints alongside rising risks to nature and biodiversity, the outcome of this global conversation will certainly matter. But what we do here at home may matter even more - not just for biodiversity conservation, but also for the wider state of the economy, growth, and people's basic wellbeing and livelihoods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka and biodiversity financing</p><p>Sri Lanka has been a contracting party to the Convention on Biological Diversity since 1994, and in 2022 we adopted the GBF. So, we are also committed to the GBF targets, including reversing nature loss and conserving 30% of the world's land and sea by 2030. The GBF calls for a whole-of-economy approach that involves shifting to new ways of producing, consuming and investing. In August 2024, the Sri Lankan Government launched a special '30x30' program to draw renewed attention to the agenda.</p><p>Estimates for Sri Lanka by UNDP back in 2018 (based on work by Vidanage, et al.) showed that the financing to achieve biodiversity targets between 2016 and 2022 was already short by US$ 190 million, on top of the resources allocated by the government budget between 2018 and 2024. These were pre-COVID and pre-crisis numbers. With the sharp fiscal cuts since then, it is clear that the financing pressures have greatly intensified. There are no new official figures on the financing gap, or to what extent the previous figures are relevant today.</p><p>The looming threats require us to accelerate our efforts. Biodiversity is in decline, with economy-wide impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods, and human health, that we haven't even begun to comprehend yet. It is estimated that one-fourth of our bird species, half of our freshwater fish, over half of our mammals, two-fifths of our reptiles, and two-thirds of our amphibians are under threat. Among keystone species, we have lost over 700 elephants in under two years. Between 2001 and 2023, the country lost 222,000 hectares of tree cover.</p><p>These issues matter not only from a pure conservation perspective, but also from a socio-economic one. The dependence of the Sri Lankan economy, key export sectors, and rural livelihoods on biodiversity, as well as the critical role that natural ecosystems play in securing clean and regular water supplies, pollination, disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation and other key services, is poorly appreciated by mainstream stakeholders in economics and finance. Moreover, there are lucrative new markets and return-generating investment opportunities that are emerging in relation to sustainable supply chains and nature-positive business. As yet, we have barely started to tap into these valuable economic opportunities.</p><p>Improving understanding, reorienting priorities</p><p>In recent years Sri Lanka has taken some steps that improve policy conditions for financing nature. The Central Bank's sustainable finance roadmap and green finance taxonomy are now well-anchored in the financial sector. A sovereign green bond framework is being finalised. And multi-stakeholder discussions around revising targets contained in the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (NBSAP) relating to financing and private sector involvement, disclosure and reporting have been active.</p><p>Yet, CSF's work in this space - engaging with policymakers, financial institutions, conservation organisations, corporates, and environmental professionals - has shown that the understanding around biodiversity financing mechanisms is still nascent.</p><p>At the policy level, conversations on financing of nature descend into narrowly talking about financing of climate change mitigation. There is a tendency for local stakeholders to conflate climate finance and biodiversity finance - although of course linked, the two are quite distinct. A small sub-set of climate finance - those relating to 'natural climate solutions' or 'ecosystem-based' mitigation and adaptation approaches - goes to biodiversity. But the rest is overwhelmingly focused on energy and transport sectors, not on agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) and nature-based solutions. Indicative of this conflation is that at a World Bank biodiversity finance forum in April, the then State Minister focussed the majority of his comments not on biodiversity and nature conservation, but on the government's plans for renewable energy.</p><p>At the financial institutional level, our work has shown that bankers have a narrow understanding of green finance - primarily focussing on lending to clean energy projects. Although biodiversity has been emerging as an asset class over recent years, it is only just beginning to be incorporated into the credit lines and investment portfolios of our financial institutions.</p><p>At the level of conservationists and ecologists, there is often either a sharp distrust of innovative financing instruments, or a loose embrace of all and any concepts - from credits to bonds. Most conservation organisations are yet to fully embrace the important economic and financial opportunities that exist to not just support biodiversity conservation, but at the same time strengthen the economy.</p><p>Budgeting processes in Protected Areas (PAs) remain underdeveloped, making estimates of conservation financing needs difficult. CSF's work in the Vidaththalvitu Nature Reserve (in partnership with Blue Resources Trust) revealed that PA management plans and financing plans are not fully-aligned, that there is under-estimation of costs and cost-bearers. We also observed substantial capability gaps in modern conservation finance planning among conservation mandate holders in government.</p><p>Looking at financing mechanisms critically</p><p>Sri Lanka needs to become much more open to, and informed about, the new sources and mechanisms that are available for biodiversity financing. These range from environment fees and levies, biodiversity credits and blended finance mechanisms, to blue bonds and nature-themed insurance. All offer opportunities to better finance conservation and strengthen our natural ecosystems (which in turn improves our economy), as well as to kick-start new and sustainable sources of income and livelihoods. As part of a much-needed shift of our post-crisis economic recovery to a more nature-positive path, these biodiversity financing mechanisms are important allies.</p><p>Over the last year, CSF has been guiding stakeholders in this space on the options that exist, how to think about their relevance and practical application, and what cautionary notes to look out for. While nature-linked sovereign debt instruments (like blue bonds and debt-for-nature swaps) are often spoken of, there are many critical considerations for Sri Lanka, as highlighted in a recently published Analytical Note by CSF. Without due recognition of global capital market trends, domestic debt management weaknesses, and the need for inclusive approaches in identifying credible and impactful projects, such sovereign biodiversity finance can only add to the country's debt troubles.</p><p>Meanwhile, attempts to establish small, site-specific Conservation Trust Funds (CTF) - as some projects have mooted - may be futile. It would be more compelling to global funders to have a marine seascape-wide CTF for Sri Lanka, and structure it as a special purpose vehicle for mobilising a mix of funding (bilateral, multilateral, philanthropic, and commercial) over a longer term. This resonates with the advice shared by the international Conservation Finance Alliance's CEO David Meyers during a webinar hosted by CSF earlier this year.</p><p>There is also a growing recognition of the role of corporates in financing biodiversity efforts, and in benefiting from the new nature-based markets and investment opportunities that have been emerging over recent year. There is also a responsibility for businesses and enterprises to better factor biodiversity into their business, with an increasing attention on (and requirement for) nature-related disclosures and reporting. At this year's CoP16, discussions on advancing the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and Science-Based Targets Initiatives (SBTI) will be quite prominent. Sri Lankan corporates would also find IFC's recent Biodiversity Finance Reference Guide useful in understanding how to practically mobilise investment and identify credible projects.</p><p>Readiness of domestic financial institutions</p><p>Sri Lankan financial institutions (FIs) provide a vital bridge between international funding sources, and domestic financing needs, across sectors, and at all levels of scale. Whether it is new foreign credit lines that fund nature-positive projects, blue bond issuances that have a window for lending to reef-positive businesses, the domestic financial industry will have a role to play. But still there is some progress needed to shift their thinking and prepare them to take a wider perspective. Two recent studies by CSF reinforce this view. An assessment of 'Environmental Integration by Sri Lankan Financial Institutions' showed that very few Sri Lankan lenders systematically assess environmental impacts and risks in granting credit facilities - just 5 of 47 FIs. The research also uncovered that only two FIs quantify/measure environmental and/or climate risks in their portfolio. With many of Sri Lanka's productive sectors heavily reliant on biodiversity and nature in some way (whether it is export crops like tea, rubber, coconut and spices, fish and seafood products, services like tourism or, indeed, any industry that requires clean and regular water supplies, or protection against floods, soil erosion and tidal surges), FIs that lend to these sectors need to urgently increase their attention to these considerations that have hitherto been ignored.</p><p>Encouragingly, though, another CSF study on green finance maturity among Sri Lankan banks, showed that there is a growing prevalence among them in engaging with environmental organisations. Two-fifths of surveyed banks reported that they 'Engage with environmental organisations to better understand environmental issues in the country', and nearly half reported that they 'Engage with environmental organisations to better understand risks and risk mitigation'. Unfortunately, none of them report that they 'Engage with environmental organisations to introduce third-party checks and balances on our green finance practices', and only one-third said that they have formal partnerships or collaborations with environmental organisations, not in a CSR capacity but specifically for informing and advising on green finance-related matters. These all point to a growing need to reorient Sri Lanka's finance sector to look beyond the narrow field of view of mitigation finance, to adaptation finance - given Sri Lanka's need to chart a nature-positive economic recovery.</p><p>Cautious engagement with international private capital</p><p>As for international private investment interest - there are some initial signs. A leading global firm, Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute, wrote to the financial industry in 2022 that, 'Sri Lanka exhibits exceptional levels of terrestrial and marine biodiversity whilst having an economy highly dependent on nature and its services (for sectors such as fisheries, agriculture and tourism)', and that, 'there are a number of potential high impact target areas linked to biodiversity that could be considered in a sustainability linked bond and would be attractive for investors looking to participate and access the sustainable debt markets'. They highlighted forest conservation, marine biodiversity protection, and whale habitat protection specifically, as areas of interest. Additionally, over the past two years following the unilateral debt standstill, there have been visits from global banks and financial advisors seeking a mandate from the Government to proceed with sovereign green debt strategies.</p><p>While being open to these, the government as well as civil society conservation stakeholders need to be acutely aware of the nuances of such instruments, including both potential gains and risks. This includes reviewing the ongoing global critiques of sovereign debt (notably, the lack of a multilateral architecture for sovereign debt workout for middle-income countries like Sri Lanka). Domestic policy and institutional coordination gaps - especially between state bodies handling public finance issues and those handling environmental issues - exacerbate the risks.</p><p>Lessons and inspirations from others</p><p>As we strengthen Sri Lanka's ability to access new finance for nature, we can look to other interesting cases. Through our research specifically in the marine finance space, we have unpacked examples ranging from Belize and Seychelles (on blue bond-financed debt-for-nature swaps), to Indonesia and Fiji (on blended finance mechanisms), Mikoko Pamoja and Vanga Blue Forest in Kenya (blue carbon credits), and Palau (small-ticket crowd-funding for marine protected areas).</p><p>All of these point to the need for a) inclusive, multi-stakeholder approaches to designing mechanisms and monitoring impacts; b) the need for domestic stakeholders (government as well as civil society) to be open to including international partners in domestic mechanisms - not just as providers of capital, but also providers of expertise and accountability); c) the need for policy and institutional coordination, overcoming turf wars and risk-aversion; and importantly, d) the need for a pipeline of 'bankable' nature projects, that have been carefully vetted not only for their pure conservation objectives, but rooted in local community and livelihood realities.</p><p>Concluding thoughts</p><p>With the current mandate given by the GBF, there is currently a great deal of international interest in funding biodiversity. Amidst a problematic international financial architecture, bright spots for attracting conservation finance do exist - whether it is from global philanthropies, multilateral agencies, or via leveraging new nature-positive markets and investment flows. By the end of August 2023, Fitch put biodiversity-tied bond sales at a record $ 165 billion. About 16% of green, social and sustainability bonds issued in 2023 included biodiversity conservation as a use of proceeds, up from just 5% in 2020. According to Credit Suisse and McKinsey (2016), the total private conservation finance investment potential is estimated at $ 200-400 billion.</p><p>The world is constantly looking for success stories, amidst dire news about climate failure in many places. Sri Lanka can offer the world the next success story - a country that emerged from debt distress, to chart a more nature-positive economy that benefits rural communities, MSMEs, larger corporates, consumers, and society as a whole.</p><p>With the right domestic mechanisms, a credible policy commitment, open-mindedness among government and non-government stakeholders, and a nuanced view of the financing options, Sri Lanka can rise up to meet the challenge. While the outcome of the COP16 is uncertain, and the commitment of the developed world to expand financing is yet unknown, Sri Lanka must work on putting its own house in order and get prepared.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["There is a tendency for local stakeholders to conflate climate finance and biodiversity finance - although of course linked, the two are quite distinct.

No more excuses. No more waiting for others to move first.

This crisis affects some countries more than others, leaving disproportionate and devastating impacts in its wake. Sri Lanka, among many other neighbouring tropical nations, is one such country.</p><p>The tropics host an estimated 80% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity and most of its marine diversity. A significant proportion of this diversity is already under threat. Recent research has found that the tropics are the global climate modulator. Yet, the tropics continue to suffer the most from the climate change impacts, resultant disasters, and resource loss. Modeling and current realities suggest that the effects of increased greenhouse gas emissions will have a much larger impact on tropical communities, habitats and biota, despite the region contributing less than 20% of the global CO2 emissions.</p><p>A majority of the population in the tropics - which are home to most of the world's poorest - live in drastic socio-economic disparities. Since 2013, debt service has increased across the tropics, a warning sign of future debt challenges for them, which is now a reality Sri Lanka is experiencing. Resource extraction and processing cause over 90% of global biodiversity loss and more than half of the effects of global climate change. High-income countries use over 10 times more resources per capita than low-income countries. This growing use of natural resources, including land, water and materials such as biomass, fossil fuels, metals and non-metallic minerals, most of which originate in the tropics and are fed into the global economy, is the main cause of the triple planetary crisis.</p><p>Given these drastic imbalances in terms of resource input and output and the significant impacts that the region, its environment and its people bear, the tropics are significantly resource-constrained.</p><p>Secretary to the Ministry of Environment, Dr. Anil Jasinghe notes, \"Sri Lanka is an ideal illustration of the issues that plague the tropics. It is a biodiversity hotspot; however, a significant proportion of our endemic species are diminishing. We are in a conservation crisis, yet conserving these species will have an enormous impact on securing global biodiversity.</p><p>Sri Lanka is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. The country experiences on average US$ 313 million in annual disaster losses. Yet, Sri Lanka has been lauded as a success story for achieving high levels of human development while pursuing low-carbon growth.\"</p><p>He went on to note, \"The Climate Prosperity Plan submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the country's long-term low greenhouse gas emission strategy (low GHG emission strategy) requires a total of US$ 26 billion, with US$ 6.5 billion required per year if we are to successfully mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p><p>\"Sri Lanka is only just getting its bearings following the worst economic crisis the country has ever seen.

He highlighted the importance of tangible climate actions and commended the delegates for their valuable suggestions.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe drew attention to the significant economic consequences of climate-related issues, with experts predicting a 1.5% GDP loss for Sri Lanka by 2050. In response, Sri Lanka has adopted a dual approach to climate ambition. At COP 27, the President launched the Climate Prosperity Plan, a strategy for green growth cantered on renewable energy generation, leveraging the nation's natural advantages in wind and solar power. This initiative aligns with Sri Lanka's economic restructuring following the 2022 financial crisis, as the country aims to transition towards a green economy.</p><p>The second facet of Sri Lanka's climate ambition involves supporting the establishment of a climate justice forum. This forum aims to foster international collaboration to address various climate challenges, including loss and damage adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>In addition to these efforts, Sri Lanka is proposing two critical measures on the global stage. First, the President suggested the creation of an international climate change university, designed as a global platform for research and development focused on climate mitigation actions.</p><p>Second, recognizing the need for responsible resource management, Sri Lanka is concentrating on areas where maximum impact can be achieved. The President introduced the Tropical Belt Climate Ambition Project, targeting the highly bio diverse tropical belt region.</p><p>Vulnerable communities in this area are disproportionately affected by climate change. \"The tropical belt is the most tropically diverse region on earth. Typically, biodiversity increases as the latitude decreases. The biodiversity increases as we get closer to the equator. Vulnerable communities in the tropical belt are the worst impacted by climate change,\" he added.</p><p>Investments in renewable energy, nature-based solutions and pollution control within the tropical belt have the potential to yield transformative results, benefiting not only the region but also temperate areas worldwide.

He said appropriate adaptation measures for infrastructure and the overall system's ability to cope in extreme weather event situations should be carefully assessed in view of emerging risks.</p><p>Addressing the fourth South Asia Hydromet Forum (SAHF) held in Colombo recently, Wijewardene said: \"Today's gathering underscores our united stand against one of our era's most daunting challenges: climate change and its intensifying impacts on socio- economic development and growth. South Asia is increasingly at the frontline of this battle.\"</p><p>He said Sri Lanka, significantly affected by weather-related losses, incurred damages nearing US$7 billion from 1990 to 2018. Looking ahead, we face an even starker reality: by 2050, an expected 7.7 percent GDP decline in Sri Lanka could translate to a loss of US$50 billion, with 87 percent of our population potentially facing extreme weather conditions.</p><p>Wijewardene said extreme weather events, ranging from torrential rains to severe droughts, have drastically impacted Sri Lanka's infrastructure, economy, and citizens' lives and livelihoods natural environment. The ramifications on our economy are profound, particularly in the agricultural sector, which has suffered greatly due to variability of the rainfall.</p><p>This brings into sharp focus the indispensable role of Hydro met services. The improvement of hydro-met services, which offer real-time weather, water, and climate information and early warnings for communities and sectors, is critical to minimize climate impacts, he said. He said \"Acknowledging the climate and environmental challenges, Sri Lanka is committed to bolstering its resilience. We've woven climate actions into our national agenda, actively enhancing our capabilities to prepare and respond to the adverse impacts. Our Climate Prosperity Plan, focused on amplifying renewable energy and leveraging nature-based solutions for resilience, aligns with our National Adaptation Plan, charting a course for a climate-resilient future.\"</p><p>Solidarity and cooperation are essential on our path forward. Climate change, a crisis without borders, demands a collective response. Sri Lanka, embracing this reality, initiated the Tropical Belt Initiative at COP28, targeting the unique challenges of global warming and championing sustainable development for tropical nations. Furthering our commitment, we are proud to collaborate with the Maldives in establishing the International Climate Change University, a vital institution for capacity building and advancing climate science, he said.</p><p>Forums like SAHF are critical in nurturing a collaborative spirit.

We would not normally associate the humble bee with an Extinction Level Event (ELE), but this shows that every living being on Earth, however small or insignificant it may seem to be, has a role to play in the greater scheme of things. Every animal and every plant that is lost could hasten our own extinction. This is the most compelling reason for protecting Nature and Biodiversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there is a growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to future generations, the number of species is being significantly reduced by certain human activities from deforestation to seabed mining. In other words, thousands of species of flora and fauna could be extinct by the turn of this century. Last year, 21 major animal species went extinct in the US alone. Some marine animals may be lost even before we identify them properly. Overall, more than one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction.</p><p>Given the importance of public education and awareness about this issue, the United Nations (UN) decided to celebrate the International Day for Biological Diversity (IDBD) annually on May 22. It was also fitting that this year, it fell just before Vesak, which celebrates the Birth, Enlightenment and the Passing Away of the Buddha, who advocated compassion for all living beings, big or small.</p><p>Rekindling bonds</p><p>According to the UN, as the global community is called to re-examine our relationship to the natural world, one thing is certain: despite all our technological advances we are completely dependent on healthy and vibrant ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter and energy, just to name a few. This involves respecting, protecting, and repairing our biological wealth.</p><p>Conserving and restoring natural spaces, and the biodiversity they contain, is essential for limiting emissions and adapting to climate impacts. Climate Change, biodiversity loss and air pollution are part of an interlinked triple planetary crisis the world is facing today. As per the UN, they need to be tackled together if we are to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and secure a viable future on this planet, the only home we have, at least until we can explore other worlds in this galaxy and beyond. But that is unlikely to happen at least for another 1,000 years. So it is essential to keep the Earth habitable for the time being.</p><p>In December 2022, the world came together and agreed on a global plan to transform humankind's relationship with Nature. The adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, also known as The Biodiversity Plan, sets goals and concrete measures to stop and reverse the loss of nature by 2050, just 25 years away.</p><p>This year, the theme of the International Day for Biological Diversity was \"Be part of the Plan\". This is a call to action to encourage Governments, indigenous peoples and local communities, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), lawmakers, businesses, and individuals to highlight the ways in which they are supporting the implementation of the Biodiversity Plan. Everyone has a role to play and therefore can be a \"\"Part of the Plan\".</p><p>That is the main message from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the key international instrument for sustainable development.</p><p>This year's celebration is expected to increase the visibility momentum in the lead-up to the sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 16), to be held in Colombia from October 21 to November 1 2024.</p><p>Biological diversity is often understood in terms of the wide variety of plants, animals and microorganisms, but it also includes genetic differences within each species - for example, between varieties of crops and breeds of livestock - and the variety of ecosystems (lakes, forest, deserts, agricultural landscapes) that host multiple kind of interactions among the various species (humans, plants, animals).</p><p>Significance</p><p>Biological diversity resources are the pillars upon which we have built our civilisation. Fish provide 20 percent of animal protein to about three billion people. Over 80 percent of the human diet is provided by edible plants and/or their parts such as fruit. As many as 80 percent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant based medicines for basic healthcare.</p><p>This last point is especially important, as some species in forest environments such as Sinharaja which may have medicinal properties could become extinct even without the knowledge of botanists and scientists. There have been attempts to smuggle such animals and plants in defiance of international pacts. Recently, an Italian father and son duo were arrested in Sri Lanka for attempting to smuggle out specimens of several protected insect species.</p><p>Hunger hotspots</p><p>The loss of biodiversity in whatever manner threatens all of humanity, including our health. It has been proven that biodiversity loss could expand zoonoses - diseases transmitted from animals to humans- while, on the other hand, if we keep biodiversity intact, it offers excellent tools to fight against pandemics like those caused by Corona viruses. Covid-19 was a good example of a Zoonotic disease, believed to have been transmitted via wild bats in Wuhan, China. Incidentally, UN Member Countries will be working on a treaty to face future pandemics, from May 27.</p><p>In recent months, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and others have pointed to an increase in food insecurity and \"hunger hotspots\" in various parts of Asia and the Pacific. While conflicts and climate crises can be blamed for this, the slow but steady erosion of the region's biodiversity is an equal or even greater threat to future food security. The FAO's most recent outlook report on Asia-Pacific's forest sector found that biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in natural forests are declining along with the capacity of these forests to deliver water and soil protection, climate regulation, amenity and cultural values, and wood, foods, and medicines.</p><p>Reversing this trend must be a priority for all countries in the Asian region in the next decade to ensure survival, especially in the face of Climate Change. Halting deforestation and forest degradation, while enabling forest and landscape restoration, are also vital components of addressing the challenge of biodiversity loss and Climate Change.</p><p>Indeed, the mitigation of Climate Change is one of the several benefits we derive from ensuring that biodiversity suffers no losses. After all, it fulfills our basic needs for food, shelter, medicines, mental health, recreation, and spiritual enrichment. To face the continuing decline in the quality of our environment, we will need to rely more on solutions that draw upon Biodiversity or Nature, also called nature-based solutions.</p><p>But recent trends are alarming: Current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems will undermine progress towards 80 percent of the assessed targets of eight of the 17 SDGs; Three-quarters of the land-based environment and about 66 percent of the marine environment have been significantly altered by human actions.</p><p>Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing can be blamed partly for this. While scientists fear ELEs, there is another school of thought on this issue. We have all heard the phrase \"extinction is forever\" but is it really so? Some scientists think that animal extinction can be reversed - to the point where completely \"dead\" species can be revived. If you have heard the expression \"as dead as a dodo\", based on the extinct bird, it means that someone or something cannot ever be brought back to life.</p><p>But this is precisely what these scientists want to achieve - if you have watched the Jurassic Park movies (and who hasn't?), Richard Attenborough's character recreates living, breathing dinosaurs by extracting dino-DNA from a fossilised mosquito that had bitten a dinosaur more than 65 million years ago. This is indeed theoretically possible. Right now, scientists are working on literally reviving the mammoth (unlike in the case of dinosaurs, completely intact and well preserved bodies of mammoths are available) and several other species, including possibly the aforementioned Dodo.</p><p>A matter of concern</p><p>This, of course, raises many ethical and moral questions and even some intriguing possibilities. Can we indeed recreate dinosaurs or even the Neanderthals? But can and will they survive in this much-changed world? It is actually better to concentrate on saving the species that are facing extinction rather than bring back extinct species. The latter is a very risky idea and venture as things stand, even though it is technically possible with current technology. Such resources should be diverted to conservation programs in zoos and elsewhere that seek to protect critically endangered animal and plant species around the world. They deserve a second chance at life, which is Nature's biggest gift.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

The meeting aimed at collectively addressing concerns and actions towards mitigating threats to the shared future of the tea industry. The focus was on the opportunity in greening the plantations, by supporting livelihoods and strengthening sustainability while mitigating the effects of increasing climate extremes.

For a population that did not even know the word 'tsunami' before 2004, we are now very much aware of the dangers posed by these massive waves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tsunami arose from a displacement between the India and Burma plates, 70 Km off the west coast of northern Sumatra. The earthquake's initial magnitude was estimated at 8.0 on the Richter scale. Almost 40 hours after the quake, they learned that its true force stayed hidden as it travelled along 1000 Km of a fault line. The final reading, published in May 2005, indicated that the Indian Ocean quake had one of the highest magnitudes ever recorded at 9.1. It even managed to shake the Earth a bit off its regular orbit.</p><p>One of the main reasons for the massive loss of life in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami was the lack of an early warning system. Although the US Geological Survey tried to warn the Indian Ocean countries, a combination of missteps and other factors prevented the message from going to the right eyes and ears. The result was a tragedy of huge proportions.</p><p>Today, the situation is much better. The Indian Ocean region has a sophisticated tsunami information gathering and distribution network that cost billions of dollars called the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS). In addition, there are more than 60 Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART), sensors worldwide.</p><p>Our authorities must assess the viability and readiness of our own tsunami/earthquake warning systems in conjunction with those of other Indian Ocean countries. With the apparent failure of these systems in Indonesia on many recent occasions, all Indian Ocean countries including Sri Lanka must take immediate collective measures to repair and upgrade the warning systems.</p><p>The tsunami warning mechanism is now ingrained in our minds and the moment coastal dwellers hear about an undersea earthquake somewhere in Asia, they are mentally prepared to reach higher ground. Still, education and awareness are much needed.</p><p>All local cellular operators have tested their capability to mass broadcast SMS messages on tsunamis to their subscribers. Warning siren towers have been erected in all coastal areas, with the paths to safety clearly marked. Television and radio stations are under instructions to broadcast any warning messages, for those who may not have access to smartphones.</p><p>Worldwide, scientists are beginning to unravel more details and secrets about tsunamis.</p><p>While Japan, from where the very word \"tsunami\" 'Big Wave in Japanese' comes, leads the world in tsunami research, many other countries are actively engaged in the field. In tsunami preparedness, it turns out there can be strength in beauty. Japanese researchers recently concluded that rows of green hills strategically arranged along coastlines can help to fend off destruction from tsunamis while preserving ocean views and access to the shore. For some communities, they may offer a better option than towering seawalls. Giant seawalls are the conventional approach to mitigating tsunami risk. Japan, for example, has built hundreds of miles of concrete walls, taller than 40 feet in some places, at a cost of more than US$ 12 billion since tsunami waves flattened coastal communities throughout eastern Japan in March 2011. Scientists say coastal forests can help put the brakes on tsunami flow speeds in nearby towns and villages. These and other nature-based solutions are increasingly important in plans for coastal risk management.</p><p>Sri Lankan universities too must take a pro-active interest in tsunami research, given Sri Lanka's increased vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunamis. Several tremors have been felt in Sri Lanka recently. The lesson is that an earthquake or tsunami can strike anytime without any warning. We must be prepared for bigger earthquakes and tsunamis. Eternal vigilance is the only answer.</p><p>Any advances that can accurately predict the formation of a tsunami is welcome, bearing in mind that the death toll from tsunamis during the past century is higher than that from any other natural hazard. The idea is to give at least a half-hour head start to residents to get to higher ground. It is vital to literally drill the tsunami into young minds - in Chile, for example, even kindergarten kids have to undergo regular tsunami evacuation practice sessions.</p><p>We still do not have the technology to accurately anticipate earthquakes and tsunamis. But during the intervening 19 years, scientists have learned a lot about tsunamis, so there is hope for such advances.</p><p>The most enduring legacy of the 2004 Tsunami should be the continuing improvement of disaster response and prevention capacities in our society on the one hand and the pursuit of greater environmental and climate sensitivity on the other. Ultimately, the lives of those affected by the Tsunami will have true meaning only if Sri Lankan society can effectively contribute to environmental protection and the reversal of global warming.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Especially in the current context, it is therefore vital to leverage the country's natural capital to access international finance and link ecosystem conservation with economic prosperity.</p><p>Ecosystems services and benefits</p><p>The needs of the hour are clear, including the need for building resilience and a more robust and sustainable economy that can attract investment and foreign inflows. Towards this goal, ecosystems can play a pivotal role. They are impacted by climate change and human activities, but they also have the potential to provide solutions and accelerate action.</p><p>As a country with ecosystems ranging from cloud forests to lowland rain forests and from river estuaries to seagrass beds, Sri Lanka has significant potential to harness nature-based solutions and mobilise finance and support on the national, regional, and global level. Natural ecosystems strengthen climate change mitigation, adaptation, resilience-building, and local livelihoods. They provide regulatory and provisioning services, strengthen disaster risk reduction, serve as habitats and nurseries, support natural cycles, and can hold great cultural, recreational, and aesthetic value.</p><p>These services and benefits can to some extent be quantified and expressed in numbers that far outweigh the profit of unsustainable extraction. In addition, ecosystems create value for entire communities and areas, not just individuals or companies, with many co-benefits for human health and wellbeing, biodiversity, and the economy.</p><p>Connecting ecosystems and financial flows</p><p>Considering this, how can Sri Lanka use its ecosystems to build a more sustainable financial system and long-term resilience? How can ecosystem services and ecosystem-based adaptation be turned into a business case and shown to be advantageous not just for nature and climate, but also in terms of economic stability and growth?</p><p>There is a range of available schemes and mechanisms that have been developed around the world to address this issue, for example payment for ecosystem services, national funds to support projects with ecosystem conservation and adaptation benefits, green certification schemes, or credit systems for development projects that impact ecosystems. These mechanisms all provide some sort of financial benefit for healthy nature and biodiversity, which goes towards strengthening the business case of protecting ecosystems.</p><p>Similarly, such benefits can be directly built into financial instruments and mechanisms, such as microfinance schemes to invest in sustainable adaptation practices or loans with lower rates if conditions related to ecosystem and biodiversity conservation are fulfilled. Healthy and thriving ecosystems often act as risk reduction measures, for example mangrove ecosystems that protect coastal communities against floods and even tsunamis. This provides an opportunity to link them to other aspects of a risk management framework, including insurance schemes that can give discounts on premiums if the insured party maintains the functionality of risk-reducing ecosystems. If nature-conscious and nature-positive systems in the financial sector are scaled up, it can result in win-win-win situations for consumers, financial institutions, and the planet.</p><p>One level higher, ecosystems not only save money when their conservation is incentivised on the domestic level, they can also enhance access to additional finance for the country. Potential sources of climate and development funding for ecosystems include multilateral funds (such as the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environmental Facility, or the Adaptation Fund) and development banks, bilateral development partners, and the private sector.</p><p>Some well-known classes of ecosystem-related financial instruments include green bonds, which fund projects with positive environmental impacts; debt-for-nature swaps, which convert foreign debt into funding for local ecosystem conservation; and carbon credits, carbon offsetting, or carbon insetting, which provide an opportunity to mobilise climate finance through conserving or restoring green and blue carbon ecosystems.</p><p>Besides multi- and bilateral public finance, there is vast potential to scale up funding from the private sector by communicating that the benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation are central to business considerations, not merely a side project for corporate social responsibility.

The tab is still being calculated. Nonetheless, Sri Lanka's interventions were absent in many key negotiations over the two weeks of COP28.</p><p>Newly-appointed Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was absent from many of the country statements on various agenda items and events - like the climate-health ministerial and even a Joint Crediting Mechanism event at the Japan pavilion, a crucial instrument on climate finance.</p><p>He missed most of his sessions and sent his secretary to some, Sri Lanka delegation sources said, requesting anonymity.

We observed that delegates who invited stakeholders to bilaterals on the promise the minister would attend were often left in the uncomfortable position of making excuses for his last-minute cancellations.</p><p>Sri Lanka faced scheduling conflicts across the board. Attendance of ministry officials at agenda item meetings - the core negotiations at COP28 - was varied. Deliberations on loss and damage and agriculture saw regular interventions by Sri Lankan officials, but Article 6 negotiators were frequently absent from their relevant meeting rooms. (Article 6 of the Paris Agreement sets out the rules for global trade in greenhouse gas emissions reductions).</p><p>This was because of commitments at the Sri Lanka pavilion, ministry officials maintained. 'There were a lot of lessons this year that we must make sure we learn from and improve for upcoming climate summits,' noted Environment Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe. He said the country's first-ever pavilion at the international event was a serious undertaking.</p><p>Dr. Jasinghe, by contrast, was seen hard at work, making numerous interventions and representations for Sri Lanka in many spaces. The result of this year's COP was underwhelming from a developing country's point of view, he concurred.</p><p>'The Global Stocktake revealed that progress was insufficient,' he said. 'The target was to cut 43% of emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 globally, which hasn't happened.'</p><p>Consequently, the GST has called on parties to triple RE capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030; and to produce ambitious economy-wide emission reduction targets. But, as usual, commitment gaps were identified on the part of the developed countries, Dr. Jasinghe observed.</p><p>COP28 called for a doubling of adaptation finance and for targets to be set for 2030 in terms of water security, ecosystem restoration, and health under the Global Goal of Adaptation.</p><p>'There were no decisions on carbon markets, which is unfortunate since countries like ours could benefit from it, but voluntary markets will continue amidst discussions on how to supervise them to troubleshoot the credibility issues associated with them,' Dr. Jasinghe said.</p><p>Carbon markets are a specialised type of financial market, through which carbon credits - essentially permits that allow the purchaser to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas - can be bought and sold.</p><p>The terminology on fossil fuels was also significantly 'diluted' this year, Dr. Jasinghe pointed out. While COP28 re-emphasised cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible by 2050, Dr. Jasinghe felt emissions will peak by 2025 globally, given the trend in countries like China and India.</p><p>Severe backslides in agriculture negotiations were a concern, especially for agriculture-based countries like Sri Lanka, with the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint work on implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security - one of COP27's crowning glories - crashing this year.</p><p>The four-year work programme under UNFCCC is aimed at safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and addressing the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.</p><p>One goal was to establish a coordination committee for the plan at COP28, pointed out Buddhi Marambe, senior professor of the faculty of agriculture at the University of Peradeniya.</p><p>But developed countries threw in a wrench when they wanted to start over with a new text, instead of opening the previous one.

Sea level rise, erosion, and storms affect the coastal zone while agricultural areas are threatened by erratic rainfall, droughts, floods, and soil degradation. Across the country and across key economic sectors, climate change already impacts livelihoods, lives, and human wellbeing, and is projected to become more severe in the coming decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka is also blessed with a rich biodiversity and a multitude of productive ecosystems. From cloud forests to grasslands, and from lowland rainforests, lakes, and coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, the island is home to a significant range of habitats and associated species of animals and plants, many of which are endemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Particularly in light of the new Global Biodiversity Framework and the intergovernmental climate negotiations, how can Sri Lanka's natural wealth help the country to address challenges such as climate change while also facilitating economic recovery and sustainable development?</p><p>The benefits of biodiversity</p><p>There are at least three ways in which biodiversity and ecosystems can be part of the solution and help to increase the resilience of human communities and systems.</p><p>First off, ecosystems provide a range of benefits, some of which can be directly expressed in monetary terms. These ecosystem services include provision of goods and ingredients for consumption, medicine, cosmetics, construction, and other purposes, prevention of erosion, regulation of air and water quality, protection against floods, storage of water, tourism and recreation opportunities, and many more.</p><p>Mangrove ecosystems, for example, have been estimated to provide services worth up to $ 50,000 per hectare in some cases, with $ 15,000 as the average value. Beyond these valuated benefits, natural ecosystems serve as animal habitats and hold intangible and hard-to-quantify aesthetic, cultural, or spiritual value, create a sense of place, and can improve mental health and resilience of nearby communities.</p><p>Secondly, while healthy ecosystems automatically provide the above-mentioned benefits to the environment, wildlife, and human communities, they can also be harnessed in targeted ways. Towards this end, ecosystem services can be incorporated into planning processes in direct, indirect, or hybrid ways.</p><p>Such nature-based solutions can, for example, take the form of green infrastructure such as green roofs, rain gardens, urban forests, urban wetlands, or urban agriculture that improve the resilience of human settlements by contributing to disaster risk reduction, flood control, food security, and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>Beyond improving cities and infrastructure, nature also offers ways to directly boost economic growth in sustainable ways. For an island nation like Sri Lanka, investing in a blue economy holds significant potential. Blue economy measures could include ecosystem solutions in the fisheries sector, seaweed or seagrass cultivation, coastal zone management, aquaculture, coastal and marine tourism, ocean-based transportation, or renewable ocean energy.</p><p>On land, integrated nature-based solutions can transform food systems and enhance productivity, production diversity, and resilience through agroforestry, or work towards more sustainable, cost-effective, and circular land and water management.</p><p>Thirdly, actions related to ecosystem conservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and assisted growth can help to mobilise much-needed finance and investment. There are various financial instruments and mechanisms that connect to natural ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, including green bonds, ecological restoration bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, impact investing, carbon credits (both on the voluntary market and in relation to a centralised mechanism being set up under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement), biodiversity offsets (for instance, for afforestation or habitat restoration), natural capital finance, resource efficiency financing, or bioprospecting (the exploration of biodiversity for commercially valuable genetic and biochemical resources).</p><p>Other mechanisms that can incentivise ecosystem conservation and link them to economic growth are payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanisms, ecosystem discounts for insurance premiums, eco-index insurance, or green mortgages.</p><p>Possible sources of finance for such interventions are varied and operate across all scales. Depending on available funding, nature-based solutions could take the form of national-level projects or public works, but also nature-based microfinance for local projects, such as in ecotourism or sustainable agriculture. Nature-based crowdfunding, donations, sale of conservation easements, special levies, or land trusts are potential other sources of biodiversity finance.</p><p>Aligning national and global goals</p><p>As highlighted in my previous column, the climate and biodiversity crises are neither separate nor are they confined to the country level. They are deeply interconnected global challenges-part of what can be called a 'polycrisis'-but must be addressed first and foremost through local and national action.</p><p>Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, global goals relate to climate change mitigation (emission reduction and curbing of temperature rise), adaptation (changing systems to avoid adverse impacts and seize positive opportunities), addressing loss and damage (support for those affected by climate impacts beyond adaptation limits), and providing support for developing countries, including through finance and technology transfer.</p><p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) adopted last month, global goals focus on biodiversity conservation and protected areas, halting species extinction, preserving genetic resources, halving food waste, and strengthening sustainable biodiversity management and usage. Furthermore, the GBF aims to mobilise at least $ 200 billion per year in financial flows from all sources to support these goals and ensure that adequate means of implementation are available to all Parties, particularly developing countries.</p><p>Individual countries communicate their contributions to these overarching goals through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Sri Lanka's NDCs, for example, include sectors such as forestry, water, biodiversity, and coastal and marine, while the country's NBSAPs reference climate impacts, biodiversity valuation, sustainable use of biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, and equitable sharing of biodiversity benefits, among other things.</p><p>Both documents contain targets related to the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of soil, water, forests, wetlands, agrobiodiversity, and coastal and marine areas. Conserving natural ecosystems and biodiversity contributes to achieving these targets as well as mitigating climate change by acting as carbon sinks.</p><p>If national, local, and sector-specific plans and interventions are aligned with these commitments, they can better access finance from global funds (such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environmental Facility), multi- and bilateral entities, financial markets, the private sector, the insurance industry, repurposed subsidies, and other countries.</p><p>With the new biodiversity finance target, pledges made to several funds at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, and a new upcoming global goal for climate finance, there is an important window of opportunity to link action on biodiversity and climate change.</p><p>Identifying synergies</p><p>Sri Lanka is endowed with valuable natural capital in the form of diverse ecosystems, fauna, and flora. Building on this capital in line with national and global commitments can provide a pathway to attract investment, access finance from a multitude of sources, and design interventions and policies with strong co-benefits and synergies.</p><p>If concrete, transparent, and well-designed actions are taken on different levels, they can not only prevent further biodiversity loss and preserve biodiversity benefits for future generations, but also utilise the full potential of ecosystems to address climate change, support economic growth, and mobilise investment from a multitude of sources.</p><p>(The writer works as Director - Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

However, significant work is needed to translate this outline into an actionable framework and operationalise the process of reporting on and collating the GGA.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To this end, the Parties to the Paris Agreement decided at COP26 in 2021 to explore these questions through the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work program on the GGA, which runs from 2022-2023 and comprises a total of eight workshops up to COP28. Five of these workshops have taken place so far, with the sixth scheduled to be conducted from 4-5 June in Bonn, Germany. As time is running out toward the end of the work program and COP28, now is an important opportunity to take stock of the state of the conversation: What can the GGA achieve? What are its key elements and considerations? And how will this global goal connect to work on the national and local level?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Designing a global goal</p><p>After COP27 in late 2022 and a total of five workshops, a rough shape of the GGA is beginning to materialise. As contained in Decision 3/CMA.4, paragraph 10, there are four dimensions, twelve themes, and eighteen cross-cutting considerations that have been brought forward and frame the discussion right now.</p><p>First of all, the four dimensions include assessment, planning, implementation, and monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL), which together form the adaptation policy cycle. This means that the GGA should take into consideration not only National Adaptation Plans and other policy documents developed by countries around the world, but all steps of climate change adaptation: understanding current and projected climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks; developing plans and mainstreaming adaptation into national planning processes; implementing these plans on the national and local level; monitoring and evaluating progress based on a set of indicators and targets; and learning from the results to enhance plans and policies in an iterative process. There are important considerations related to these dimensions that could be captured through the GGA, such as support in terms of finance, capacity-building, and technology transfer, or collaboration between different stakeholders and stakeholder groups.</p><p>Second, adaptation actions are highly context-specific and will look different depending on a multitude of factors, such as geography, climatic conditions, hazards, demographics, sociocultural factors, and sectors. As identified by Parties and other stakeholders, key thematic areas for adaptation include the following: water; food and agriculture; cities; settlements; infrastructure; health; poverty and livelihoods; terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; marine and coastal ecosystems; biodiversity; mountain regions; and cultural heritage. This wide variety of adaptation areas, as well as different spatial and temporal scales of adaptation actions, renders it difficult to identify common indicators, metrics, and targets that could be used to establish a global goal.</p><p>Finally, there is also a range of cross-cutting considerations that are highly relevant when it comes to adaptation. These include, for example, gender; local, traditional, and Indigenous knowledge systems; human rights; social justice; nature-based solutions; intergenerational equity; intersectional approaches; or using the best available science and science-based indicators. Without covering all relevant perspectives, the GGA would not be complete and unable to address the specific needs of individuals, households, communities, and countries around the globe.</p><p>Crucial challenges and needs</p><p>Defining a global goal that can capture the world's progress on climate change adaptation is a highly complex and challenging task. Adaptation is context-specific and can take many forms, from grey infrastructure (e.g., flood protection dykes) to new practices (e.g., climate-smart agriculture) and from nature-based solutions (e.g., planting mangroves) to financial instruments or social protection systems. A global goal needs to consider all the different dimensions, themes, and cross-cutting considerations from a variety of contexts and find a way to compile, collate, or synthesise them into a global target or set of global targets and indicators.</p><p>This directly connects to the challenge of measuring progress towards these targets and, therefore, the GGA. In the sixth workshop and beyond, Parties will discuss potential indicators or metrics for adaptation, potentially using a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches in connection with similar global processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.</p><p>Equity, justice, and inclusiveness are other important considerations. Given the differential impacts of climate change as well as the guiding principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities,' Parties to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) need to ensure that the GGA takes into account the needs of vulnerable developing countries, listens to the voices of affected frontline communities, and conducts reporting and assessment processes without posing an additional burden or incurring additional costs for those countries and communities.</p><p>A key topic in this regard is adaptation finance, which must be scaled up to enable adaptation at scale and with the speed necessary to protect already affected communities and prevent avoidable losses and damages. The GGA can serve as an instrument to enhance funding by capturing resource and technology needs to channel funding towards them and help to strengthen local and national adaptation efforts. It also provides an opportunity to incentivise and mobilise private sector involvement and build multi-actor partnerships for adaptation, risk management, and resilience-building across all levels.</p><p>Designing the GGA is further complicated by the fact that it cannot be seen as a completely independent process but is rather deeply interconnected with other workstreams and negotiation agenda items under the UNFCCC. This includes, for example, the Global Stocktake (GST), which is the collective global assessment of progress towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The first GST is also being discussed at the moment and should incorporate the GGA under its adaptation component, with both the GST and the GGA work programme scheduled to end this year.</p><p>Utilising a global goal to enhance local and national action</p><p>The GGA could play a vital role for national and local climate action by providing a shared vision and framework for adaptation. It signifies an international commitment to support and prioritise adaptation efforts and could galvanise national governments to integrate climate adaptation into their development strategies and policies. By doing so, it encourages a proactive and anticipatory approach to managing climate risks and could even unlock opportunities to benefit from sectoral shifts and a just transition towards green, resilient, and climate-smart economies.</p><p>Particularly for a climate-vulnerable developing country like Sri Lanka, climate change is a topic of paramount importance. Defining and operationalising the GGA and its mechanisms for support could greatly influence the resources and international support available to Sri Lanka for its adaptation efforts, as well as provide guidance to align national processes within a global framework and common metrics and methodologies. This could potentially include adaptation funding, technical support for adaptation measures, and capacity-building and knowledge transfer for both immediate and longer-term adaptation measures.</p><p>(The writer works as Director: Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

The interlinked and cascading effects of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution-the triple planetary crisis-are demanding a heavy toll on individuals, communities and threatening life on our planet. We are putting extreme pressure on the planet. The triple planetary crisis is already exceeding the planetary boundaries. The world has already lost 8% of known animal species and 22% are at risk of extinction due to the destruction of their natural habitats and the introduction of invasive species. We are now losing biodiversity up to 10,000 times faster than it was disappearing 100 years ago. Declines in nature and biodiversity at the current trajectory will undermine the progress towards 35 out of 44 targets of the SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, weather, cities, climates, oceans and land. In terms of change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052.</p><p>The other day, I read a blog by a young scientist, a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Her name is Sanjali De Silva. This is what she said: \"People of Sri Lanka feel the impact of climate change every day. Those effects are overwhelmingly caused by the self-serving command and irresponsible action of the fossil fuel industry and the nations unwilling to do their part to stop the climate paradigm. My people of Sri Lanka and my family deserve better.\" I agree wholeheartedly with her. Sri Lanka, her country and mine, has constantly been placed among the top risk of extreme weather events by the Climate Risk Index annually released by German Watch. Although Sri Lanka's emissions are globally negligible, amounting to merely 0.03%, we, in our ambitious NDCs, have set targets for 2030 to achieve a 14.5% reduction of GHG emissions, a 70% electricity generation through renewable sources, 32% forest cover, weaning off coal power by 2042 and reaching net zero by 2050.</p><p>The Climate Prosperity Plan of Sri Lanka, launched at COP 27, aims at rapid augmentation of nature-based solutions, including renewable energy. The Net Zero 2050 roadmap for Sri Lanka will be launched at COP 28. Sri Lanka is in the process of renewing the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2016 to 2022 to achieve the objectives of the Kunming-Montreal Global Diversity Framework. Since Sri Lanka is one of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots, I have instructed the Ministry of Environment to formulate a national policy on living entities to conserve pristine ecosystems. Sri Lanka has formulated the national policy on waste management, covering nine categories of general and hazardous waste. The national policy on chemical management was formulated to streamline chemical management in the country. Sri Lanka formulated the national policy on sustainable consumption and production in 2019. The Green Procurement Policy and the Green Labelling Framework will come into effect this year. My government will enact a new Climate Change Act and a National Environment Act to address the triple planetary crisis in the context of new knowledge and practices. We are starting our transition to a green economy. But there is a cost. The Climate Prosperity Plan, which spans from 2023 to 2042, will require 26.5 billion U.S. dollars. The implementation of the Net Zero 2050 roadmap will require over 100 billion U.S. dollars. The list is not over. Where are we going to source these resources from? We cannot source all this money from within our country. The problem is not confined to Sri Lanka.</p><p>Developing countries require financing up to 5.9 trillion U.S. dollars to fulfil their NDCs up to 2030. A further 4 trillion U.S. dollars is required per annum for clean energy technology to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. At COP 27, there was an agreement to provide the lost and damaged funding for vulnerable countries hit by climate disaster. The Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan, a transitional committee was established. The meetings of the committee and the discussions at the recent sessions of the UN during the UN General Assembly have not resolved key questions.</p><p>a. Who will contribute? Is it the developed nations? EU, UK, Norway, among others, say all countries are liable to pay.</p><p>b. The question of criteria. Who will receive the funds?</p><p>c. Where to house the fund? At the World Bank or UNFCC?</p><p>d. Where do you find the money for the fund? Is it re-channelling existing funds or new additional funds? Delegates, these discussions are getting nowhere and it's unlikely that these issues will be resolved by the time of COP 28.</p><p>The ability of global leaders to cooperate and provide a coordinated response to existential challenges such as climate change is missing in a scenario dominated by great power rivalries, geopolitical interests and in many cases domestic policy. For instance, it is not feasible to expect robust leadership of the United States in the global fight against climate change next year. The US will be caught up in an acrimonious election year and must first overcome domestic debates between climate deniers and those who are serious about addressing the issue. The Ukraine war will tie down Europe. The Indo-Pacific will witness further escalation of tension. Numerous global fora have attempted to address the issue of climate change. The Bridgetown Initiative, Paris Pact for People and Planet, and numerous initiatives by the UN Secretary-General. The issues and potential solutions have been well articulated at these events. What is missing is the money on the table, leadership and action.</p><p>Therefore, we in Asia-Pacific and others in the global south will need to galvanize an alternative leadership mechanism. What is crucial is that geopolitics and great power rivalries take a second place when it comes to addressing climate issues such as climate change and global environmental degradation. We need a climate justice forum to ensure that the countries least responsible for climate change do not bear a disproportionate share of the loss. We need to raise our collective voice and say, let's get done with this. While the debate on the loss and damage fund continues, we should insist on the following: The money on the table is negligible, but let's at least start with the 100 billion SDI initiatives available to the IMF and convert that into actions and positive outcomes. The developed economies should be held accountable for meeting their net zero targets at least by 2040. If they fail to stay in line with these targets, such countries should be required to compensate the rest of the world. These funds can help with the financing requirements for climate mitigation, adaptation and climate prosperity of developing nations. The global ambitions regarding finance of combating climate change have so far been woefully inadequate. It is also not just public funds that can resolve the magnitude of the issue at hand.</p><p>The Bridgetown initiative has clearly articulated the need for using the balance sheets of the NDBs to provide guarantees and leverage private funds to be channelled towards addressing climate change issues in developing nations. Additional volumes of concessionary financing at scale through the NDB are also a crucial requirement. Climate-related investments provide long-term returns, which cannot be financed by fragmented short-term high-cost private financing. The prevailing situation where global monetary tightening is pushing up market-linked lending rates of NDBs and the IMF is also an opportune moment to consider options of capping such rates or other means to avoid further fiscal burdens on borrowing nations. All three initiatives above would have been on the agenda in a serious manner long time ago had there been a greater voice of developing nations and the global south in the decision-making authorities of these global financial institutions. We must also press ahead with Kenya's call for debt relief for low-income countries.</p><p>Parallel to these settings, we must finalize the loss and damage funds. In my view, all developed countries must contribute to the fund. We must also call for voluntary contributions by the developing countries, especially those exceeding the 2050 target. The Vanuatu Resolution has taken the issue of climate change before the International Court of Justice. This is the start of a process of recognizing climate justice as a human right. It is the core of the right to life. All other rights flow from the right to life.

In terms of change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052.</p><p>\"The other day, I read a blog by a young scientist, a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Her name is Sanjali De Silva. This is what she said: 'People of Sri Lanka feel the impact of climate change every day. Those effects are overwhelmingly caused by the self- serving command and irresponsible action of the fossil fuel industry and the nations unwilling to do their part to stop the climate paradigm. My people of Sri Lanka and my family deserve better.' I agree wholeheartedly with her. Sri Lanka, her country and mine, has constantly been placed among the top risk of extreme weather events by the Climate Risk Index annually released by German Watch. Although Sri Lanka's emissions are globally negligible, amounting to merely 0.03 percent, we, in our ambitious NDCs, have set targets for 2030 to achieve a 14.5 percent reduction of GHG emissions, a 70 percent electricity generation through renewable sources, 32 percent forest cover, weaning off coal power by 2042 and reaching net zero by 2050.</p><p>\"The Climate Prosperity Plan of Sri Lanka, launched at COP 27, aims at rapid augmentation of nature-based solutions, including renewable energy. The Net Zero 2050 roadmap for Sri Lanka will be launched at COP 28. Sri Lanka is in the process of renewing the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2016 to 2022 to achieve the objectives of the Kunming-Montreal Global Diversity Framework. Since Sri Lanka is one of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots, I have instructed the Ministry of Environment to formulate a national policy on living entities to conserve pristine ecosystems.</p><p>\"Sri Lanka has formulated the national policy on waste management, covering nine categories of general and hazardous waste. The national policy on chemical management was formulated to streamline chemical management in the country. Sri Lanka formulated the national policy on sustainable consumption and production in 2019. The Green Procurement Policy and the Green Labelling Framework will come into effect this year.</p><p>\"My government will enact a new Climate Change Act and a National Environment Act to address the triple planetary crisis in the context of new knowledge and practices. We are starting our transition to a green economy. But there is a cost. The Climate Prosperity Plan, which spans from 2023 to 2042, will require US$ 26.5 billion. The implementation of the Net Zero 2050 roadmap will require over US$ 100 billion. The list is not over. Where are we going to source these resources from? We cannot source all this money from within our country.</p><p>\"The problem is not confined to Sri Lanka. Developing countries require financing up to US$ 5.9 trillion to fulfil their NDCs up to 2030. A further US$ 4 trillion is required per annum for clean energy technology to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. At COP 27, there was an agreement to provide the lost and damaged funding for vulnerable countries hit by climate disaster. The Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan, a transitional committee was established. The meetings of the committee and the discussions at the recent sessions of the UN during the UN General Assembly have not resolved key questions.</p><p>a. Who will contribute? Is it the developed nations? EU, UK, Norway, among others, say all countries are liable to pay.</p><p>b. The question of criteria. Who will receive the funds?</p><p>c. Where to house the fund? At the World Bank or UNFCC?</p><p>d. Where do you find the money for the fund? Is it re-channelling existing funds or new additional funds?</p><p>\"Delegates, these discussions are getting nowhere and it's unlikely that these issues will be resolved by the time of COP 28. The ability of global leaders to cooperate and provide a coordinated response to existential challenges such as climate change is missing in a scenario dominated by great power rivalries, geopolitical interests and in many cases domestic policy. For instance, it is not feasible to expect robust leadership of the United States in the global fight against climate change next year.</p><p>The US will be caught up in an acrimonious election year and must first overcome domestic debates between climate deniers and those who are serious about addressing the issue. The Ukraine war will tie down Europe. The Indo-Pacific will witness further escalation of tension. Numerous global fora have attempted to address the issue of climate change. The Bridgetown Initiative, Paris Pact for People and Planet, and numerous initiatives by the UN Secretary-General. The issues and potential solutions have been well articulated at these events. What is missing is the money on the table, leadership and action.</p><p>\"Therefore, we in Asia-Pacific and others in the global south will need to galvanize an alternative leadership mechanism. What is crucial is that geopolitics and great power rivalries take a second place when it comes to addressing climate issues such as climate change and global environmental degradation. We need a climate justice forum to ensure that the countries least responsible for climate change do not bear a disproportionate share of the loss.</p><p>\"We need to raise our collective voice and say, let's get done with this. While the debate on the loss and damage fund continues, we should insist on the following: The money on the table is negligible, but let's at least start with the 100 billion SDI initiatives available to the IMF and convert that into actions and positive outcomes. The developed economies should be held accountable for meeting their net zero targets at least by 2040. If they fail to stay in line with these targets, such countries should be required to compensate the rest of the world. These funds can help with the financing requirements for climate mitigation, adaptation and climate prosperity of developing nations. The global ambitions regarding finance of combating climate change have so far been woefully inadequate. It is also not just public funds that can resolve the magnitude of the issue at hand.</p><p>\"The Bridgetown initiative has clearly articulated the need for using the balance sheets of the NDBs to provide guarantees and leverage private funds to be channelled towards addressing climate change issues in developing nations. Additional volumes of concessionary financing at scale through the NDB are also a crucial requirement. Climate-related investments provide long-term returns, which cannot be financed by fragmented short-term high-cost private financing.</p><p>\"The prevailing situation where global monetary tightening is pushing up market- linked lending rates of NDBs and the IMF is also an opportune moment to consider options of capping such rates or other means to avoid further fiscal burdens on borrowing nations. All three initiatives above would have been on the agenda in a serious manner long time ago had there been a greater voice of developing nations and the global south in the decision-making authorities of these global financial institutions. We must also press ahead with Kenya's call for debt relief for low-income countries.</p><p>\"Parallel to these settings, we must finalize the loss and damage funds. In my view, all developed countries must contribute to the fund. We must also call for voluntary contributions by the developing countries, especially those exceeding the 2050 target. The Vanuatu Resolution has taken the issue of climate change before the International Court of Justice. This is the start of a process of recognizing climate justice as a human right. It is the core of the right to life. All other rights flow from the right to life. Countries unwilling to do their part to stop the climate crisis are guilty of committing genocide.\"</p><p>Ali Salajegheh the Vice President of Iran and Head of Iran's Department of Environment, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Minister of Environment aseer Ahmed, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry, Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda, President's Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Aniva Marie Clarke, Representative of the Major Group for Children and Youth and representatives from member countries of the Asia Pacific region and professionals participated in this event.</p><p>Following the event, President Wickremesinghe held bilateral discussions with Ali Salajegheh, Vice President of Iran.

The ADB announced $14 billion financial package in September last year, which included both short term measures and long term measures. And short-term measures included very quick dispersing of budget financing through what we call it Counter Technical Support to support our developing member countries (DMCs) to provide food and necessities urgently for the vulnerable and poor.

And quite recently, s the US Fed already started to slow down the pace of interest rate hike, but it's not clear yet whether those advanced economies will end up successfully with so-called soft landing scenario or falling into a recession due to the persistent inflationary pressure in the service sector, and so on. And also this rapid pace of interest rate hike has really tightened global financial conditions from last year, both short term and long term yield has risen, premium has increased and quite recently there were signs of strains in the banking sector in the US and Europe.

For access to the full interview's audio and transcript, you can stream this episode on Breaking Green's website or wherever you get your podcasts. Breaking Green is produced by Global Justice Ecology Project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this interview, Nnimmo Bassey, a Nigerian architect and award-winning environmentalist, author, and poet, talks about the history of exploitation of the African continent, the failure of the international community to recognize the climate debt owed to the Global South, and the United Nations Climate Change Conference that will take place in Egypt in November 2022.table \" \" 0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto   class=\"tr-caption\" Nimmo Bassey [ Photo: Right Livelihood Foundation]Bassey has written (such as in his book To Cook a Continent) and spoken about the economic exploitation of nature and the oppression of people based on his firsthand experience. Although he does not often write or speak about his personal experiences, his early years were punctuated by civil war motivated in part by \"a fight about oil, or who controls the oil.</p><p>\"Bassey has taken square aim at the military-petroleum complex in fighting gas flaring in the Niger Delta. This dangerous undertaking cost fellow activist and poet Ken Saro-Wiwa his life in 1995.Seeing deep connections that lead to what he calls \"simple solutions\" to complex problems like climate change, Bassey emphasizes the right of nature to exist in its own right and the importance of living in balance with nature, and rejects the proposal of false climate solutions that would advance exploitation and the financialization of nature that threatens our existence on a \"planet that can well do without us.</p><p>\"Bassey chaired Friends of the Earth International from 2008 through 2012 and was executive director of Environmental Rights Action for two decades. He was a co-recipient of the 2010 Right Livelihood Award, the recipient of the 2012 Rafto Prize, a human rights award, and in 2009, was named one of Time magazine's Heroes of the Environment.</p><p> Bassey is the director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation, an ecological think tank, and a board member of Global Justice Ecology Project.Steve Taylor: Climate change is a complex problem, but maybe there's a simple solution.</p><p> What might that look like?Nnimmo Bassey: Simple solutions are avoided in today's world because they don't support capital. And capital is ruling the world.</p><p> Life is simpler than people think. So, the complex problems we have today--they're all man-made, human-made by our love of complexities.</p><p> But the idea of capital accumulation has led to massive losses and massive destruction and has led the world to the brink. The simple solution that we need, if we're talking about warming, is this: Leave the carbon in the ground, leave the oil in the soil, [and] leave the coal in the hole.</p><p> Simple as that. When people leave the fossils in the ground, they are seen as anti-progress and anti-development, whereas these are the real climate champions: People like the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta, the territory where Ken Saro-Wiwa was murdered by the Nigerian state in 1995. Now the Ogoni people have kept the oil in their territory in the ground since 1993. That is millions upon millions of tons of carbon locked up in the ground.</p><p> That is climate action. That is real carbon sequestration.</p><p>ST: Could you talk about the climate debt that is owed to the Global South in general, and African nations in particular?NB: There's no doubt that there is climate debt, and indeed an ecological debt owed to the Global South, and Africa in particular. It has become clear that the sort of exploitation and consumption that has gone on over the years has become a big problem, not just for the regions that were exploited, but for the entire world.</p><p> The argument we're hearing is that if the financial value is not placed on nature, nobody's going to respect or protect nature. Now, why was no financial cost placed on the territories that were damaged? Why were they exploited and sacrificed without any consideration or thought about what the value is to those who live in the territory, and those who use those resources? So, if we're to go the full way with this argument of putting price tags on nature so that nature can be respected, then you have to also look at the historical harm and damage that's been done, place a price tag on it, recognize that this is a debt that is owed, and have it paid.</p><p>ST: You've discussed in our interview how some policies meant to address climate change are \"false solutions,\" particularly those intended to address the climate debt owed to the Global South and to Africa in particular. Could you talk a bit about the misnomer of the Global North's proposals of so-called \"nature-based solutions\" to the climate crisis that claim to emulate the practices and wisdom of Indigenous communities in ecological stewardship, but which actually seem like an extension of colonial exploitation--rationalizations to allow the richer nations that are responsible for the pollution to continue polluting.</p><p>NB: The narrative has been so cleverly constructed that when you hear, for example, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), everybody says, \"Yes, we want to do that.\" And now we're heading to \"nature-based solutions.</p><p>\" Who doesn't want nature-based solutions? Nature provided the solution to the challenges [that Indigenous people have] had for centuries, for millennia. And now, some clever people appropriate the terminology.</p><p> So that by the time Indigenous communities say they want nature-based solutions, the clever people will say, \"well, that's what we're talking about.\" Whereas they're not talking about that at all.</p><p> Everything's about generating value chains and revenue, completely forgetting about who we are as part of nature. So, the entire scheme has been one insult after another.</p><p> The very idea of putting a price on the services of Mother Earth, and appropriating financial capital from those resources, from this process, is another horrible way by which people are being exploited.ST: How does REDD adversely impact local communities on the African continent?NB: REDD is a great idea, which should be supported by everyone merely looking at that label.</p><p> But the devil is in the detail. It is made by securing or appropriating or grabbing some forest territory, and then declaring that to be a REDD forest.</p><p> And now once that is done, what becomes paramount is that it is no longer a forest of trees. It is now a forest of carbon, a carbon sink.</p><p> So, if you look at the trees, you don't see them as ecosystems. You don't see them as living communities.</p><p> You see them as carbon stock. And that immediately sets a different kind of relationship between those who are living in the forest, those who need the forest, and those who are now the owners of the forest.</p><p> And so, it's because of that logic that [some] communities in Africa have lost access to their forests, or lost access to the use of their forests, the way they'd been using [them] for centuries.ST: As an activist, you have done some dangerous work opposing gas flaring.</p><p> Could you tell us about gas flaring and how it impacts the Niger Delta?NB: Gas flaring, simply put, is setting gas on fire in the oil fields. Because when crude oil is extracted in some locations, it could come out of the ground with natural gas and with water, and other chemicals.</p><p> The gas that comes out of the well with the oil can be easily reinjected into the well. And that is almost like carbon capture and storage.</p><p> It goes into the well and also helps to push out more oil from the well. So you have more carbon released into the atmosphere.</p><p> Secondly, the gas can be collected and utilized for industrial purposes or for cooking, or processed for liquefied natural gas. Or the gas could just be set on fire.</p><p> And that's what we have, at many points--probably over 120 locations in the Niger Delta. So you have these giant furnaces.</p><p> They pump a terrible cocktail of dangerous elements into the atmosphere, sometimes in the middle of where communities [reside], and sometimes horizontally, not [with] vertical stacks. So you have birth defects, [and] all kinds of diseases imaginable, caused by gas flaring.</p><p> It also reduces agricultural productivity, up to one kilometer from the location of the furnace.ST: The UN climate conference COP27 is coming up in Egypt.</p><p> Is there any hope for some real change here?NB: The only hope I see with the COP is the hope of what people can do outside the COP. The mobilizations that the COPs generate in meetings across the world--people talking about climate change, people taking real action, and Indigenous groups organizing and choosing different methods of agriculture that help cool the planet.</p><p> People just doing what they can--that to me is what holds hope. The COP itself is a rigged process that works in a very colonial manner, offloading climate responsibility on the victims of climate change.</p><p>This article was produced by Earth | Food | Life, a project of the Independent Media Institute.Steve Taylor is the press secretary for Global Justice Ecology Project and the host of the podcast Breaking Green.</p><p> Beginning his environmental work in the 1990s opposing clearcutting in Shawnee National Forest, Taylor was awarded the Leo and Kay Drey Award for Leadership from the Missouri Coalition for the Environment for his work as co-founder of the Times Beach Action Group.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["So, if we're to go the full way with this argument of putting price tags on nature so that nature can be respected, then you have to also look at the historical harm and damage that's been done, place a price tag on it, recognize that this is a debt that is owed, and have it paid.

Mangroves and sea grasses sink more carbon than land forests. However, the rapid climate change is altering the marine environment with rising sea levels and temperatures, Ocean acidification, coral bleaching, habitat destruction and extreme weather patterns. These phenomenon have a direct impact on human lives by disrupting ocean biodiversity, the Ocean dependent food patterns, and coastal livelihoods.

Last summer in the US, when older people fell down on tar during heat waves, they had to be treated first for burns. Scientists believe that July 2023 was the hottest month on record. Last year, we read of multiple disasters worldwide: extreme heat waves in the USA, various parts of Europe and Asia; over 4,000 wildfires which raged in Canada, as well as a devastating one in Hawaii; and severe monsoons which caused extreme floods in many parts of Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of the above are attributed to global warming and climate change. Our actions that emit greenhouse gases have increased the Earth's temperature faster since 1970, than any other period in the last 2000 years. This global warming has wrought havoc on the Earth's climate - such as warming oceans and resulting cascading impacts such as melting icebergs, sea level rise, coastal flooding, and saltwater going up rivers, all of which disrupt livelihoods, food and water security.</p><p>The most challenging impact of global warming has been long-term shifts in the Earth's weather patterns. There are more intense and frequent extreme weather events - such as storms, cyclones, floods and droughts, often leading to erosion and landslides. Erratic (out-of-season) rainfall, failure of monsoons and seasonal shifts have serious effects on agriculture, causing crop failure and therefore, affecting food security.</p><p>These effects of climate change are bad enough, but they are exacerbated by other human activities - namely, habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation, pollution, and introduction/spread of invasive alien species. For example, deforestation of catchment forests upstream results in erosion, and sometimes, slope instability, which, in turn, leads to landslides and downstream floods. There was a recent news item from the National Building Research Organisation that because of deforestation coupled with heavy rains, 1/5th of Sri Lanka is landslide-prone. Poor agriculture practices that leave soil exposed to heat when there is a drought, worsen its impacts. Relying on monocultures of crops when there are seasonal shifts (delayed monsoons, for example) can increase food insecurity.</p><p>Any process that emits CO2 is called a carbon source, and green plants that absorb carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis, are known as carbon sinks.</p><p>There are two ways of dealing with climate change. Human action/s to reduce emissions or to reduce carbon sources/enhance carbon sinks is called climate change mitigation. These actions include switching to clean energy, reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing energy efficiency. However, even if, today, everyone, everywhere stopped all emissions of greenhouse gases, the temperature of the surface of the Earth would not cool for thousands of years to levels before the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, adjusting to observed or predicted climate change also becomes necessary. This is known as climate change adaptation. Adaptation could be as simple as growing drought-tolerant crops in the dry zone.</p><p>In December 2023, leaders of governments of the world met at the 28th Conference of Parties (COP). After contentious debates, negotiations and compromise, they agreed to 'transition away from fossil fuels'. Some hailed this outcome as 'the beginning of the end of fossil fuels', others were deeply disappointed with the wording and that the proposed transition was not given a time frame.</p><p>Without waiting to see what will happen about shifting from fossil fuels at the global scale, what can we, the public, do?</p><p>Look to nature for solutions</p><p>Look, for example, at trees. Their leaves and canopies slow the rate of rainfall falling to the forest floor. Leaf litter functions like a gigantic sponge soaking the water up and slowing its release into the soil. This is a natural method of regulating floods and recharging groundwater. The roots of trees hold soils together. Without leaf litter and roots, rain falling on bare soil flows fast over the surface, resulting in erosion. Heavy rain falling on large areas of bare soil on slopes could cause landslides. Catchment forests reduce the risk of floods by increasing the amount of rainfall soaked into the soil, reducing and delaying the highest flows of floodwaters.</p><p>Meanwhile, green plants serve as nature's carbon sinks by removing carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis. During this process, they also replenish the oxygen that we breathe.</p><p>Nature has provided us with a ready-made solution for climate change adaptation. Why then, are we not looking to nature and using these solutions?</p><p>Nature-based Solutions (NbS) involve working with nature to address challenges of communities and societies, to provide benefits for both human well-being and biodiversity. This approach aims for a win-win both for us humans, as well as for biodiversity.</p><p>Compared to hard engineering solutions, NbS provide additional benefits called co-benefits as shown in the diagram above.</p><p>In contrast, the construction of a gabion retaining wall in a river or canal - for the prevention of erosion - may also provide clearer water but no other benefits.</p><p>The other difference is that NbS are cost-effective. In the mid-hills of Nepal, erosion and resultant landslides were common along many rural roadsides built without any safeguards to control erosion. A native plant - broom grass (Thysanolaena nees) - is a hardy perennial, with a network of roots that holds the soil together. When villagers planted broom grass along roadsides, this simple action significantly reduced erosion and landslides. An important co-benefit was that once this grass grew to about two metres, it could be cut and sold - as fodder for livestock, fuel and for brooms - which increased the household income of villagers. A standard cost-benefit analysis showed that over time, NbS were less expensive than hard engineering because there is far less maintenance necessary. But when the co-benefit of the income that communities earned was included, NbS were shown to be much cheaper than hard engineering solutions.</p><p>In the high Andes Mountains of Peru, livestock are grazed in high-elevation, wet, montane grasslands. There now are recurring droughts. With community participation, a pasture and water management plan was developed to ensure better management of water and establish a rotational grazing pattern (to avoid overgrazing). The ecosystem service of provision of year-round water was restored. Better management increased milk yield, fetching more income. The improved growth of grasses has also contributed to the conservation of threatened species - such as the vulnerable Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) and the Per\u00favian guemal (Hippocamelus antisensis) - another win-win for people and biodiversity.</p><p>Urban areas are most at risk from heat waves. They act as heat islands - trapping the sun's heat in concrete in buildings and the surfaces of roads. Green infrastructure (such as corridors of vegetation), green spaces (parks, grasslands and urban wooded areas), green walls and green roofs are extremely effective in reducing ambient heat. Increasing blue infrastructure (such as natural or artificial ponds and lakes) has the same effect. Barcelona, in Spain, increased tree coverage from 5% to 30% and reduced temperatures so much, that the city saved 10 million USD in annual bills for air conditioning.</p><p>Most cities have impermeable systems - such as tar, concrete, stone, brick, and roofing - that prevent water from filtering through the ground. The sponge city concept uses blue infrastructure to absorb rainwater, which is then naturally filtered by the soil to reach aquifers. Sponge cities are connected by open green spaces and waterways, which naturally retain and filter water. They also have green roofs that can retain and filter rainwater before releasing it into the ground. Also important in sponge cities are permeable roads and pavements, bio-swales (landscaped areas that collect stormwater runoff, filtering out pollution and letting the water soak into the ground) and bio-retention systems (depressed, landscaped areas for the discharge of stormwater). In a sponge city, in addition to providing natural flood control, co-benefits such as cooling, enhancing urban biodiversity and increasing recreation are also achieved.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, I think that we have long since forgotten to look to nature for solutions, in our unending quest for development, although traditionally, NbS were successfully implemented, using observation and common sense.</p><p>Colombo has the distinction of becoming the world's first Ramsar Wetland City. It is in the floodplain of the left bank catchment of the Kelani Ganga and historically, was built on, around and interwoven with wetlands. However, now only about 2,000 ha of these wetlands - natural, giant sponges - remain. Some wetland parks, set up for the conservation of these critical soakage areas for the capital, are now being pruned and tamed as venues for wedding photographs. Sri Lanka had a ready-made sponge city......... but we have reclaimed it, dredged it, filled it and built infrastructure and roads, so that, often, with monsoonal rains, Colombo floods.</p><p>A recent article in the Sunday Times stated that 214 trees posing danger to people have been removed by the Colombo Municipal Council. Assuming that these are all old trees (about 30 years old), with trunks at least metre in a diameter, and that all plant species absorb an equal amount of carbon, these trees that were cut, stored about 4,639 tons of carbon. We should have maintained and looked after those magnificent trees so that they did not pose a threat to people. Instead, these natural carbon sinks were grossly neglected, and we must now forgo the immense benefits they provide us.</p><p>We Sri Lankans must do better. Perhaps we must see green plants as tiny carbon-guzzling, oxygen-generating machines, just as we know that vehicles are petrol-consuming carbon-dioxide-releasing machines. What if each of us pledges to plant and look after a native herbaceous plant, a shrub or a tree, and tend it? Those who own estates or large gardens can plant trees, others with small gardens can plant shrubs, while those who live in apartments can grow plants in pots. Even if 1% of our population fulfils this pledge and plants trees and tends them, then we will have 221,810 more carbon sinks, absorbing an estimated 4,807,835 tons of carbon in their lifetime, absorbing the emissions for a year from one million cars.</p><p>As Jane Goodall says 'What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.'</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Nature has provided us with a ready-made solution for climate change adaptation.

A polycrisis does not have a single cause and, therefore, no singular solution. However, the interconnected nature of its constituent crises means that actions taken in one sphere-for example, climate action or environmental conservation-have the potential to produce powerful synergies and co-benefits. In other words, while there is feedback between the crises, there is also the potential for feedback between solutions.</p><p>Global processes to address global challenges</p><p>Countries such as Sri Lanka can greatly benefit from integrating their strategies and plans and harnessing synergies between development, climate action, biodiversity conservation, pollution reduction, and key sectoral interventions. However, uniting these different processes-each with their own institutional setups, policy frameworks, finance streams, evidence bases, and actors-is not an easy task.</p><p>Toward the end of 2022, the need to address the polycrisis in a holistic fashion is becoming increasingly obvious, with multiple important summits happening in close succession. In November 2022, the 198 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with a total of 45,000 people attending the two-week conference (UNFCCC COP27). Only a week later, the first session of a new Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay, with more than 2,500 delegates from 147 countries (INC-1). Finally, representatives of 188 governments gathered in December in Montreal for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), which concluded with the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).</p><p>Climate change is explicitly mentioned in the GBF, with three targets directly referring to climate change and the need to optimise 'co-benefits and synergies of finance targeting the biodiversity and climate crises.' Similarly, the COP27 cover decision (the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan) addresses biodiversity and ecosystem conservation in multiple places and contains dedicated sections on forests and oceans, as well as an acknowledgement of the urgent need to harness synergies for addressing the 'interlinked global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss in the broader context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.'</p><p>Synergetic solutions for complex challenges</p><p>The above-mentioned conferences are not the only important events of the year-for example, COP15 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the third 'Rio Convention,' took place in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in May-, and a multitude of other planning and implementation processes took place on the regional, national, and local level. However, many of these processes aim to address the same underlying causes in similar timeframes (with target years 2030 and/or 2050) in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and the need for economic growth and recovery after COVID-19 and global supply chain disruptions.</p><p>For example, there are clear parallels between the global frameworks for climate action and biodiversity conservation. Both the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) have similar governing bodies (their respective Conferences of the Parties) and mechanisms for communicating national commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans), as well as overlapping funding mechanisms (Green Climate Fund and Global Environmental Facility) and related science-policy bodies (IPCC and IPBES).</p><p>Nature-based solutions and planetary health</p><p>The GBF aims to protect 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030, reduce the extinction of threatened species, and focus on the sustainable use and management of biodiversity and natural resources. The UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also adapting to the unavoidable effects of climate change to protect people, livelihoods, and ecosystems. In addition, there is an urgent need to manage waste and plastic pollution, stop desertification, and prevent soil degradation.</p><p>To do this, it is possible to identify and utilise synergies between national commitments under different global frameworks. Actions on climate change and biodiversity can complement each other, address common causes and impacts, and target co-benefits through multidisciplinary cooperation.</p><p>The advantages of coordinated and synergetic actions are multifold. If a polycrisis is addressed through holistic interventions, it can help to use resources more efficiently, avoid redundancies and duplication of efforts, enhance knowledge-sharing, and improve access to different funding sources, technology transfer, and other means of support. Policy coherence is an important element that guides implementation, and reporting on progress can be done more comprehensively and efficiently.</p><p>Nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based adaptation can help to bridge the gap between these different targets and address multiple crises simultaneously.

Based on this framework, it is possible to develop standards, curriculums, training plans, requirements, and learning outcomes as well as systems for quality assurance and monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>Priority sectors for a just transition</p><p>Sri Lanka's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement identify six priority sectors for climate change mitigation (electricity, transportation, industry, waste management, forestry, agriculture) and nine sectors for adaptation (agriculture, fisheries, livestock, water, biodiversity, coastal and marine, health, urban planning and human settlements, tourism and recreation), plus one additional cross-cutting sector focused on preventing and addressing climate-induced loss and damage. These sectors are directly impacted by climate change and/or potential key contributors to climate action and a just transition.</p><p>To achieve the intended contributions and commitments across the different sectors, a skilled workforce is required at every level, including a large number of technicians and technical assistants, electricians, project officers, experts in sustainable architecture and services, civil engineers and construction site supervisors, energy auditors, surveyors and survey field assistants, laboratory technicians and assistants, resource assessors, and many other types of qualified personnel. Enhancing current TVET programs with relevant qualifications and mainstreaming climate change into TVET is crucial to fulfilling these requirements and create a workforce that not only has specialised technical skills but also an interdisciplinary understanding of how climate change affects their sector, the ability to collaborate across disciplines, and the capacity to innovate and adapt to a rapidly changing context.</p><p>For example, the energy sector is critical for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as for providing energy security and a low-cost, sustainable, and resilient supply of clean electricity. A recent research study estimates that to implement Sri Lanka's national plans and commitments for the future development of the renewable energy sector, an overall number of approximately 1,650 technicians and 1,100 technical assistants could be needed in the short term, and a cumulative number of 5,300 technicians and 2,900 technical assistants in the medium term.</p><p>Competencies needed for these technicians and technical assistants include an understanding of renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, grid management, and energy storage, but also problem-solving, planning, learning, teamwork, and integrated systems management.</p><p>Currently, there are only a few dedicated training programs, modules, and certificate courses for renewable energy, the majority of which are focused on solar PV systems (ground, floating, and/or rooftop) and located in Colombo district.

The Meeriyabadda and Aranayaka landslides bear testimony to this statement. However, with thundershower warnings issued on a number of districts in the country, it is important to revisit landslide mitigation strategies, particularly in hilly areas. In some cases, latest technology has been used for water retention and increase soil strength. But engineering experts are now looking at possibilities of nature-based solutions to mitigate landslides. Speaking at the Moratuwa University's Inaugural Lecture Series, Prof. Udeni Nawagamuwa of the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Moratuwa shed light on 'Nature-based Landslide Mitigation' with a few case studies done in several parts of the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How landslides occur</p><p>\"A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris or earth down a slope,\" he explained in his opening remarks.\"Landslides are a type of 'mass wasting' which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. As people move into new areas of hilly or mountainous terrain, it is important to understand the nature of their potential exposure to landslide hazards, and how cities, towns, and counties can plan for land use, engineering of new construction and infrastructure which will reduce the costs of living with landslides.\"</p><p>Human activities could be a contributing factor in causing landslides. \"However, many landslides caused by human activities could be avoided or mitigated. These could be a result of building roads and structures without adequate grading of slopes, poorly planned alteration of drainage patterns and disturbances caused to old landslides.\"</p><p>Identifying warning signs</p><p>In most instances people are unaware of an impending landslide. But warning signs could be observed. Some of these include:</p><p>Mitigation measures</p><p>Prof. Nawagamuwa then shed light on the latest Landslide Hazard Zonation Mapping Project (LHMP) implemented by the National Building Research Organisation. \"Hazard zonation mapping is based on an extensive field study and evaluation of six causative factor attributes such as geology, slope, soil overburden, hydrology, landform and land use patterns in the area. While maps are available in 1:50,000 scale and 1:10,000 scale, 1:50,000 scale maps are available for Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Kandy, Matale, Kalutara, Galle, Matara and Moneragala districts. These maps display the distribution of the severity of landslide hazard potential in a given area.\"</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>\"Landslide mitigation measures also include nature-based solutions which are interventions that make use of natural processes and ecosystem services to address hazards such as floods, erosion and landslides. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) is one of the effective and sustainable techniques to reduce risk of disasters,\" he added.</p><p>\"The role of plants in improving slope stability and minimising soil erosion can be divided into two categories; hydrological and mechanical mechanisms. However, both these mechanisms have positives and negatives. For example in the hydrological mechanism, foliage intercepts rainfall, causing adsorptive and evaporative losses that infiltrate precipitation to infiltrate. However, the depletion of soil moisture by root adsorption may encourage the soil to crack, thus increasing infiltration capacity. On the other hand, roots reinforce soil, increasing soil shear strength in the mechanical mechanism. But plants exposed to the wind could transmit dynamic forces to the hill.\"</p><p>Prof. Nawagamuwa further said that some of the benefits of nature-based solutions in stabilising slopes include the greater ability to catch rainfall when there's a high density of the canopy and leaf area. \"This interception reduces and delays rainfall to the soil surface. A tree's roots will increase soil shear strength via the tensile strength of its own roots and provide slope-shearing resistance during or after heavy rainfall on shallow landslides.\"</p><p>Site-specific landslide risk assessment</p><p>\"When choosing a site, all elements at risk including houses, buildings, infrastructure facilities, lifelines, topography, hydrology and ecological features, soil formations and socio-economic data related to populations likely to be exposed are being considered,\" he explained.</p><p>But when selecting plants several aspects need to be looked into. \"Architectural features and structure of plant root systems play a significant role in shallow slope stabilisation and erosion control. Ecological significant and compatibility with surrounding environment also needs to be considered. Native plant species are preferred because they tend to tolerate drought and need little irrigation, fertilisers, pest and disease control and demand less trimming. Prof. also emphasised on aboveground plant structure and belowground root system which stabilise slopes by intercepting and absorbing water, retaining soil, retarding run-off velocity, increasing surface roughness, rainwater interception and evapotranspiration.\"</p><p>Speaking about natural vegetation types, he said that the dominant vegetation in the wet zone is tropical evergreen forests with tall trees, broad foliage and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. On the other hand, subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in higher altitudes. Montane vegetation at highest altitudes tends to be stunted and windswept.</p><p>Recommended plant species</p><p>Grasses - Cymbopogon citrates- suitable for tropics and is known to be a good soil conditioner in worn out land. The plants quickly produce a bulk of organic material attracting worms and other beneficial creatures, quickly enriching the soil. The grass is useful for soil improvement and erosion control.</p><p>Small tree (Shrub) - Coffee arabica-suitable for tropics and subtropics. The plant firmly holds onto soil and is a wind barrier. Erosion control can be achieved by cultivating coffee with low spacing.</p><p>Medium size tree - Tremaorientalis- the plant can be found in secondary forests in the wet and intermediate zones. The tree has an extensive root system that enables to hold soil together and is categorised as a tree with high anchoring root index.</p><p>Large tree - Micheliachampaca- it is found in tropical and subtropical, moist broadleaf eco-regions. These are elevations of 200-1600 metres. These plants are known to hold soil tightly while acting as a wind barrier. The presence of roots increases the effective cohesion of soil, resulting in the increase of shear strength.</p><p>While drawing examples from a few case studies done in Sri Lanka Prof. Nawagamuwa said that certain challenges exist in applying nature-based solutions for landslide risk management in Sri Lanka. \"Designers lack confidence in the use of vegetation for slope stabilisation, there's a lack of knowledge about soil bioengineering and landscaping measures to stabilise unstable slopes and there's limited interest in allocating resources for associated research, capacity building and knowledge enhancement of</p><p>landslide professionals.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about three billion people. More than 80% of the human diet is provided by plants. As many as 80% of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-based medicines for basic healthcare.</p><p>But loss of biodiversity threatens all, including our health. It has been proven that biodiversity loss could expand zoonoses - diseases transmitted from animals to humans- while, on the other hand, if we keep biodiversity intact, it offers excellent tools to fight against pandemics like those caused by coronaviruses.</p><p>While there is a growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to future generations, the number of species is being significantly reduced by certain human activities. Given the importance of public education and awareness about this issue, the UN decided to celebrate the International Day for Biological Diversity annually.</p><p>Current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems will undermine progress towards 80% of the assessed targets of eight Sustainable Development Goals.

It's a phrase that's been on the lips of scientists, officials and environmental activists a lot in the last few months: ecosystem restoration. This year, June 5, World Environment Day, marks the official launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, a 10-year push to halt and reverse the decline of the natural world.</p><p>What exactly is an ecosystem and how do you restore one? To answer the first question an ecosystem is a place where plants, animals and other organisms, in conjunction with the landscape around them, come together to form the web of life. Ecosystems can be large, like a forest, or small, like a pond. Many are crucial to human societies, providing people with water, food, building materials and a host of other essentials. They also provide planet-wide benefits like climate protection and biodiversity conservation. But in recent decades, humanity's hunger for resources has pushed many ecosystems to the breaking point.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, most political leaders and top business tycoons know little and care less about biodiversity. We hope they would educate and enlighten themselves to give more attention to this. The people also need to play a part.

Instead of just being residents, we need to be citizens who act effectively for the common good and play a bigger role in vital issues such as preserving biodiversity.</p><p>English broadcaster, biologist, natural historian and author David Attenborough says, it is that range of biodiversity that we must care for - the whole thing - rather than just one or two stars.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

As reported by the State of the Global Climate 2021 published by the World Meteorological Organization in May, 'the most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, were the seven warmest years on record,' and global mean temperatures in 2021 were '1.11 \u00b1 0.13 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average.'</p><p>The report further states that 'the acute impacts of weather and climate are most often felt during extreme meteorological events such as [...] heatwaves,' and that heatwaves and extreme heat had devastating effects and caused deaths across different world regions, which in many cases would have been 'virtually impossible without climate change.'</p><p>Global warming leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves as well as extended periods of high temperatures, which can harm human health, wellbeing, and livelihoods. In particular, already vulnerable or weakened groups, such as the elderly, children, or the economically disadvantaged, are at risk of severe impacts that can worsen chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions and even lead to death. Furthermore, natural ecosystems, biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and many other aspects of human society and economy can be adversely affected by heatwaves and heat stress.</p><p>Due to the 'urban heat island effect,' cities and urban agglomerations are hit especially hard by these rising temperatures. They become hotter than rural areas because of their population density, the higher concentration of 'sealed' surfaces that absorb and retain heat, and other factors such as air pollution. For Colombo, it has been estimated that average temperatures may have already risen by 1.6 degrees Celsius due to the heat island effect, which would be significantly higher than the global average.

Other collective resilience-building measures can include heat hotlines, community check-ups, or community cooling centres.</p><p>In addition to this, heat adaptation encompasses a range of nature-based interventions and actions. For one, making cities greener tends to make them cooler as well, as plants provide shade as well as cooling through evapotranspiration. This can include urban forestry-planting more trees and generally increasing the vegetation cover-as well as the development of green corridors, parks, and rooftop gardens.

The Sixth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year states that 'overall adverse economic impacts attributable to climate change, including slow-onset and extreme weather events, have been increasingly identified,' and that 'global aggregate net economic damages generally increase non-linearly with global warming levels.' Rising temperatures and progressive climate change impacts will severely affect economies around the world, particularly those that are already vulnerable and have limited financial resources available.</p><p>To avoid and adapt to this, systems transitions are needed for energy generation, infrastructure, land use, industry, society, and key economic sectors such as food systems, export products, trade, tourism, or the garment and textile industry. These sectors are vulnerable to climate change, but they can also offer solutions and serve as levers of change. By building on existing natural resources and human capacities-including ecosystem services, green infrastructure, and local and traditional knowledge-as well as investing in innovation and transformative adaptation, vulnerable sectors can turn from liabilities into engines of growth.</p><p>However, a large-scale transition requires significant resources, including in the form of finance, technology, and technical expertise. Domestic public funds are unlikely to be sufficient for this, especially as they are already strained due to the increasing intensity and interconnected nature of climate risks and economic impacts. The IPCC report highlights this as well, stating that 'adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages and through impeding national economic growth.' To close the looming finance and protection gaps, it is therefore vital to secure and scale up bilateral, multilateral, and private sector funding from a range of sources.</p><p>Foresight and planning for long-term resilience</p><p>There are multiple avenues of financing that can be explored in the context of climate change adaptation, resilience-building, and economic recovery. As outlined in the three previous columns, natural ecosystems and biodiversity can be harnessed to attract funding, while the framework of a just transition can serve to accelerate economic transformation and stimulate growth. However, policy coherence and early, anticipatory action that pre-empts or prevents shocks are equally important factors to survive in a changing climate.</p><p>Currently, countries across the world are mostly reacting and responding to climate shocks and other unexpected events on an ad-hoc basis without pre-arranged resources. Anticipatory and risk-informed investment for resilient economic growth can minimise these shocks and greatly enhance the ability of key stakeholders to deal with them. Through investment in a climate-smart and resilient economy as well as the use of diverse financial instruments, including insurance and insurance-linked instruments, early action finance, or national contingency funds, countries can save money, protect lives and assets, and adapt in proactive ways to seize emerging opportunities.</p><p>For example, countries can use different kinds of bonds-such as sustainability bonds, climate bonds, green bonds, resilience bonds, or the new category of blue bonds-to raise funds for starting or scaling up projects that commit to climate-smart, sustainable, green, and/or resilient outcomes. These debt instruments are usually asset-backed or ringfenced to ensure that funds will go towards their intended purpose, and they present a powerful opportunity to invest in projects that offer a return of investment beyond merely repaying the loan with interest.

It is therefore important to understanding existing and upcoming governance and policy frameworks on the national, regional, and global level that can facilitate such approaches and protect both the environment and human communities.</p><p>The central role of oceans</p><p>From a climate change mitigation lens, oceans are indispensable, as they absorb almost a quarter of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions and 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. They stabilise the Earth's climatic systems and produce approximately half of the Earth's oxygen. Furthermore, oceans support climate change adaptation by providing livelihoods, transport, a potential source of renewable energy (in the form of wave energy, ocean thermal, or offshore wind), and a host of ecosystem services. The world's seas are also habitats to a wealth of biodiversity and host an incredible variety of species of marine animals, plants, and microorganisms.</p><p>On the flipside, oceans are facing climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and other threats. Ocean acidification, ocean warming, species extinction, overfishing, plastic pollution, waste dumping, oil spills, shipping accidents, and various human activities all present serious challenges to marine and coastal ecosystems that need to be addressed through concrete plans and actions.</p><p>Within a country's territorial sea (extending 12 nautical miles from the coast) and exclusive economic zone (extending 200 nautical miles), such actions mainly fall under national jurisdictions and can be guided by domestic frameworks. In many cases, these national frameworks also connect to regional processes, such as regional fisheries management organisations or the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), of which Sri Lanka is a part. Globally, the importance of oceans has also been highlighted in climate change negotiations-as just one example, the cover decision of the recent Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) contains a sub-section focused on oceans-or in the discussions around a global treaty on plastic pollution, which explicitly includes 'plastic pollution [...] in the marine environment.'</p><p>The high seas treaty</p><p>However, these frameworks only address certain aspects of ocean governance, and countries' jurisdictions do not extend to the high seas, which form the majority part of the world's oceans. Accordingly, a new treaty is needed to protect 'biodiversity in oceans beyond national jurisdiction,' (BBNJ) which refers to living marine resources found in the high seas and on the seabed. The high seas contain a significant part of overall marine biodiversity, including many unique and/or vulnerable species that are already threatened by overfishing, pollution, and the impacts of climate change.</p><p>An International Seabed Authority was established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1994, but there has not been any governing body or international legally binding instrument to safeguard biodiversity in the open ocean so far. However, after long and strenuous negotiations in New York earlier this month, a landmark agreement was reached on a new 'high seas treaty' to govern BBNJ.

Such solutions include policies and national strategies but also mobilisation of the private sector, the harnessing of market forces, and public-private partnerships. Particularly in developing and emerging economies, young entrepreneurs can play a critical role in working towards this goal and contributing to adaptive, inclusive, and sustainable solutions.</p><p>Entrepreneurs are key for a dynamic and growing economy. They bring new goods, services, or technologies to the market and can act as catalysts for transformative change. Entrepreneurship is focused on building a business from concept to market maturity and beyond, but it does not necessarily contribute to climate action, environmental conservation, or social justice. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between different kinds of enterprises and their role in the context of overarching global, national, and local challenges.</p><p>The concept of climate entrepreneurship</p><p>Start-ups and innovative businesses are engines of economic growth and can create income, employment opportunities, products, and many other tangible benefits for their communities and countries. Building on this, sustainable and climate-friendly enterprises focus not only on economic but also on environmental and social aspects, such as reducing their resource footprint or engaging in fair trade, localised supply chains, and energy efficiency.</p><p>Climate entrepreneurship goes one step further and puts climate action at the heart of the business case. From this perspective, revenue and clean, green, and responsible business practices are not opposed, but rather complementary to each other. Climate entrepreneurship is about strategic alignment of business goals with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is about looking ahead and planning for a changing climate, for less reliable weather patterns, extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related risks. In addition, climate entrepreneurship also aims to identify opportunities and re-imagine problems, as well as to understand the skills, services, and products that are needed to drive climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>In the age of climate change, there will be growing demand for energy, particularly clean and renewable energy; for sustainable and regenerative food systems; and for resilient, mobile, and digitalised financial services and systems.

This could be in the energy sector, where there will be a clear momentum to shift towards clean and renewable energy sources; but it could also be about alternative value chains; innovative agricultural practices and alternate protein production; risk-informed planning and infrastructure development; digital solutions and frontier technologies; health and sanitation sector actions in the face of heat waves and shifting disease vectors; nature-based solutions and green infrastructure; or circular economy and waste management.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["In the age of climate change, there will be growing demand for energy, particularly clean and renewable energy; for sustainable and regenerative food systems; and for resilient, mobile, and digitalised financial services and systems.

The Daily FT caught up with her before her departure to get a quick recap from her on the tenure in Sri Lanka which was momentous with several key developments in terms of bilateral cooperation between the UK and Sri Lanka and UK's support to Sri Lanka. Incidentally, after assuming duties in August 2019 Hulton's first print interview was also with the Daily FT in October same year (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.lk/Opinion-and-Issues/On-a-quest-to-take-UK-SL-ties-from-good-to-great/14-688682\">https://www.ft.lk/Opinion-and-Issues/On-a-quest-to-take-UK-SL-ties-from-good-to-great/14-688682</url>). Here are excerpts from the interview with Hulton days prior to her departure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: You've been in Sri Lanka through extraordinary times. What are your reflections?</p><p>Sri Lanka has gone through some challenging times in the last few years. I know the effects of the economic crisis are still being widely felt and I am glad that we have been able to support Sri Lanka in a range of ways. This has included providing \u00a3 3 million humanitarian assistance through cash transfers to support the most vulnerable communities. I have been able to visit some of these groups and hear how the funds have helped their food security and medical needs.</p><p>We are also providing economic support for Sri Lanka through multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and United Nations. We have welcomed the Government of Sri Lanka's commitment to implementing the economic reform program supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility and encourage Sri Lanka to continue engaging with the IMF and EFF program to build investor confidence, drive growth and bolster Sri Lanka's development.</p><p>Q: Can you highlight some of the other key areas of UK-SL cooperation?</p><p>UK Sri Lankan cooperation continues to grow and there have been some recent developments in the area of business and trade. The UK is Sri Lanka's second largest export market. In 2022, the total trade in goods and services between UK-Sri Lanka was \u00a3 1.3 billion - an increase of 11.6% from the previous year. The UK's new trading preferences scheme is now in force - and there are significant benefits for Sri Lanka.</p><p>The Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) allows Sri Lanka to trade with the UK tariff-free on 92% of goods, increasing the competitiveness of Sri Lankan products in the UK market. As the demand for sustainable, fair-trade, and healthier products continues to grow in the UK, Sri Lankan business is well placed to develop in this market.</p><p>Environmental cooperation has also been a strong pillar of our partnership. The UK was proud to host the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) on Climate Change solutions in Glasgow in 2021. Sri Lanka has made some strong commitments which we want to support through a range of collaborative environmental projects which underpin the goals of the Glasgow Climate Pact. These projects have included work to protect biodiversity, implement nature based solutions, support climate adaptation and resilience efforts and protect wildlife in Sri Lanka. We will continue this work through the UK's Climate Action for a Resilient Asia Program which will include funding projects that mobilise climate finance, strengthen water security, conserve ecosystems and biodiversity, and help vulnerable communities lead local adaptation efforts.</p><p>The Blue Planet Fund reinforces the UK's global leadership on marine issues, including the call to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030 and existing commitments to tackle plastic pollution. The UK Ocean Country Partnership Program for Sri Lanka under the Blue Planet Fund, will deliver marine science technical assistance across the three core themes of marine pollution, biodiversity loss and supporting sustainable seafood.</p><p>We also partnered with UNICEF to provide lifesaving medical equipment for high-risk pregnant mothers and infants during the pandemic. And scientists from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Oxford University collaborated together on a UK-funded project, to support vital immunology research. The UK is also known for our role at the UN Human Rights Council. We want to support Sri Lanka in addressing the issues raised in the current resolution. We are doing this by working with civil society and grassroots organisations through a number of projects, such as landmine clearance, sustainable resettlement of internally displaced people, including livelihoods support, with a particular focus on women headed households.</p><p>We have also worked with local partners to support effective responses to online gendered hate speech and cyber-sexual gender-based violence in Sri Lanka. We hope that Sri Lanka will address the legacy of the war and work towards building a fully inclusive society where people from all backgrounds can thrive.</p><p>Education remains one of our strongest connections. The UK is recognised across the world for its high-quality education. Four out of the world's top ten universities are in the UK, and there are more than 45 UK higher education institutions and professional bodies represented in Sri Lanka. These offer a variety of courses in partnership with over 50 local institutes and I've loved having the opportunity to hear about their work whilst I've been here. Students have a wide range of choices to study either in the UK or in Sri Lanka to obtain a world class qualification.</p><p>We're also keen to make people aware of the scholarship opportunities available to Sri Lankan students and to encourage applications from across Sri Lanka. Chevening is the UK Government's prestigious fully-funded scholarship program - I love catching up with Chevening alumni here, who are excelling in a wide range of fields. Every year the scholarship sends selected Sri Lankan students to the UK to complete a one year master's program in any subject they choose at any university, fully paid. We look for candidates who have leadership potential and an excellent record of achievement as well as a strong desire to make a difference in their country.</p><p>It's a pleasure to work alongside the British Council here who are well known for their educational opportunities. They build connections between people in the UK and Sri Lanka through arts, culture, education and the English language. They deliver close to 100,000 UK exams on an annual basis, creating new pathways and opportunities for students, and young professionals.</p><p>I was so pleased to be able to join them last week to attend a filmed performance of Sleeping Beauty from the Royal Opera House. It was also an honour to welcome the Graetian Awards to Westminster House in the last few weeks of my time here - my congratulations to the two winners! I have really enjoyed getting to know Sri Lankan literature better and honoured to have had the opportunity to meet some of the authors of these incredible works.</p><p>Q: As you look back on your time here, what have been some of the most memorable occasions?</p><p>We have had some special moments of celebration, with the Queen's Baton visiting Sri Lanka ahead of the Commonwealth Games hosted in Birmingham. Her Late Majesty The Queen celebrated her Platinum Jubilee year and the occasion was marked by a series of special events in London, as well as the lighting of Platinum Jubilee beacons in the UK and overseas, including in Sri Lanka. When she passed away last year we were all touched by the heartfelt messages of condolence from so many people here, often sharing their memories of her visits.</p><p>We were also able to celebrate a historic event - the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla. It was a wonderful opportunity to bring many of the colleagues and partners we work with in Sri Lanka together and witness the special moment together.</p><p>This is an important year for the UK and Sri Lanka as we mark 75 years of bilateral relations. We are celebrating this through '75 Stories' highlighting remarkable stories of Sri Lankans in the UK, and British nationals here in Sri Lanka - underlining the strong people to people links between our two countries.</p><p>Over the last four years, I have been able to travel to different parts of the country, including with visitors like Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office Minister Lord Ahmad. I have found experiencing Sri Lanka's rich religious and cultural heritage very rewarding and it has meant I have been able to meet people of diverse faiths and backgrounds and better understand a range of perspectives. We have also had a visit from the UK Prime Minister's Trade Envoy for Sri Lanka Lord Davies of Abersoch. It was great to be able to build on online meetings and bilateral engagements he had joined us for and welcome him here. With Lord Davies, we have been engaging with the business community, particularly through the Council for Business with Britain, and Government stakeholders to explore how we can further deepen our bilateral trade ties.</p><p>As I get ready to depart back to the UK, I want to thank everyone who has supported and worked with us in the last few years.

Adaptation measures-for example, flood protection, nature-based solutions, or climate-smart agriculture practices-can reduce the vulnerability of human systems and help people withstand or recover from impacts. However, there are hard and soft limits to adaptation that depend on physical limitations as well as available resources, capacities, technology, and finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Loss and damage in the climate negotiations</p><p>The concept of 'loss and damage' is used in climate negotiations to refer to the negative impacts of climate change on people, livelihoods, and ecosystems that go beyond the limits of adaptation. In the negotiation process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), developing countries have pressed for an inclusion of loss and damage since at least the 1990s. The concept became formalised with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism in 2013 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, which contains a section dedicated to loss and damage (Article 8). Broadly speaking, key areas of concern are the implementation of comprehensive risk management approaches, improved understanding of slow-onset events, non-economic losses, and human mobility, and enhanced action and support.</p><p>The latter point has drawn considerable attention at the last two global climate change conferences (COP26 and COP27) and led to the recent decision to establish a separate fund for loss and damage. However, while negotiations on the modalities and operational arrangements for this fund will take place throughout the year and towards COP28, three other questions are also of crucial importance: what exactly does loss and damage mean for those affected, what kinds of support are needed on the ground, and how can a global fund help to provide them?</p><p>Loss and damage comes in many shapes and forms.</p><p>On the one hand, there are impacts that can directly be measured in economic terms: damage to infrastructure and assets, loss of working hours, reduced productivity, destroyed houses. On the other hand, many facets of loss and damage are intangible or much harder to quantify, for example, loss of life or health; displacement or climate-induced migration; loss of territory, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, or societal identity; and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p><p>As identified by the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there is currently a 'disproportionate emphasis on economic loss and damage while intangible, non-economic losses and damages are relatively less measured and reported.' Simultaneously, it is clear that 'aggregate losses and damages would be higher if non-economic values are considered,' indicating the importance of understanding and considering these aspects of loss and damage in any assessment and intervention.</p><p>Cultural loss and damage</p><p>Cultural loss is a key aspect of non-economic loss and damage that needs further investigation to enhance a detailed understanding of what it entails and facilitate the development of evidence-based policies, plans, and actions. Especially in the context of the anticipated loss and damage fund and the availability of further means of support through an operationalised Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, it is important for countries such as Sri Lanka to identify and quantify forms of loss and damage as well as potential mechanisms to address them.</p><p>Cultural loss can affect individuals, communities, or societies in a multitude of forms. For example, it could manifest as the loss of traditional arts and crafts such as textile-making, masks, pattern stitching, or woodwork. When climate change impacts force communities to change their way of life and migrate away or shift towards new livelihoods, the transition of such practices can get interrupted, and the knowledge lost. Similarly, climate-induced changes to ecosystems can lead to a reduced availability of raw materials or the disappearance of vital species involved in traditional artisanal processes. Depending on the exact climate impacts in an area, communities can lose access to traditional resources, ingredients, diets, meeting spaces, or animals and plants of cultural significance.</p><p>For much the same reason, customs, traditions, ritual, or ceremonies can become lost as well, as can local dialects, vocabulary, or even entire Indigenous languages as their speakers are displaced and assimilate into new host communities. Heat can make outdoor places less hospitable and lead to shrinking spaces for informal engagement and meetings, while sea level rise can destroy both tangible and intangible cultural heritage or cause a permanent loss of territory. Further inland, floods, landslides, or storms can irreversibly affect heritage sites, archaeological sites, and places of cultural or spiritual significance.</p><p>Cultural loss is very much human loss and can gravely affect individuals or families. Fear of cultural loss can result in worry, anxiety, or sadness, affecting mental health and the underlying sense of safety and security within a community. Furthermore, past losses leave trauma and can lead to long-term psychosocial issues that manifest in substance abuse, depression, or a deterioration of social cohesion and solidarity.</p><p>There are many ways in which climate change directly or indirectly impacts lives and livelihoods, be it through extreme weather events or long-term processes. Understanding the exact nature of the consequences of these impacts that go beyond physical or economic loss and damage is an important prerequisite to work with affected communities, design effective interventions, and establish support structures that can channel available funds towards the most vulnerable, which in turn can help to access and mobilise finance from within and beyond the UNFCCC process.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Climate change impacts people, livelihoods, and ecosystems around the world, particularly in climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka.

Fernando had the dream of producing the world's first genuinely ethical tea which has come true.</p><p>With Merrill himself dedicating the 'birthplace' of Dilmah to the Genesis Project on May 6, last year (2022), it has now become a second 'home and workplace' for its first pioneers, selected through a rigorous process - six from around 120 applications.</p><p>Dilmah has within the folds of the Genesis Project, in addition to the Lost Ingredients Lab, a Digital Library, a Co-Working Space, a Market Space and a Townhall Space.</p><p>The Lost Ingredients Lab has been made possible with Euros 500,000 (around Rs. 178 million) from the European Union (EU), the first time it has given a grant to a Sri Lankan corporate, and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) of the German Federal Government. The technical consultants for this lab are Good Life X (GLX).</p><p>On Friday, soon after the unveiling of the Lost Ingredients Lab kitchen, senior chef Anura Uduwara Arachchi from Water's Edge Hotel demonstrated how the snacks the invitees and participants would later savour were prepared using 'lost' or 'not-given-due-place' ingredients such as gotukola, seaweed and jakfruit.</p><p>When the Sunday Times visited the Genesis Project on Thursday to meet the pioneer entrepreneurs, all systems were set to go, less than a year after its dedication.</p><p>Green and healthy are the products of Lakmini Weerakkody (29) from Bandaragama. While attending work from home, she was able to try out her hand at dehydrating vegetables, fruit and green leaves because she knew that a lot went to waste because they were perishables.</p><p>Banking on her food technology background, Lakmini was able to make a small machine and carry out trials on right temperatures for dehydration for different fruit, vegetables and green leaves, without destroying their natural properties and nutrition.</p><p>Employing and empowering two women in the area, she was sending samples with much emphasis on gotukola (Centella asiatica) amounting to about 500 kilos a month in 2019 to businessmen who were exporting them. Putting by most of her salary, she had been able to expand her business in 2022 and now owns a quality-certified small factory as well as a bigger machine.</p><p>Heading Lak Nature International, an all-female business which has given 20 women in the low-income bracket a way to eke out a living, she produces 3,000 kilos of dehydrated products a month.</p><p>Through the golden opportunity of the Genesis Project, this 'Gotukola Goddess', as she is called with affection, would be pitching her signature products of gotukola porridge, tea, soup and salad, with the hope of widening her horizons over the seas.</p><p>It is another plant product - seaweed - that Shawn Senarath (24) from Colombo will put forward for attention and investment through his business Ceylon Aqua and Agri, as he says with conviction that there is much potential for it.</p><p>Getting seaweed from farmers, a majority of whom are women, in Jaffna and Mannar, he says it is a stable income generator because the harvesting can be done in 50 days. While seaweed strengthens the coastal eco-system and restores it rather than taking anything away from it, value-addition and vertical integration of this product could bring into the country much-needed foreign exchange because it is a popular and nutritious food in many countries.</p><p>Shawn is offering sea-moss gel which has 92 of the 102 minerals essential for human well-being.</p><p>Burger patties and nuggets, both jakfruit based are what Sahan Bakmiwewa (28) from Colombo puts up for grabs to investors through his company dubbed Plant Based Studios.</p><p>He was engaged in organic spice exports from his Matale factory when numerous were the queries from the west about polos, the tender jakfruit. Why, he wondered, and found to his amazement that with many going down the vegan pathway, the attraction of polos was its meat-like texture which made it a good vegan substitute.</p><p>Sahan too tried to go vegan, but the resolve lasted only three days, he smiles, for the food was not very tasty but it was very expensive.</p><p>While his company is also producing rice milk made from traditional rice varieties, he is hoping that investors would pick up the polos burger patty and nugget and make them sizzle in hotels, restaurants and cafes locally and later internationally.</p><p>From the earth and the sea, the Sunday Times is transported to the virtual, when Sharmilan Somasundaram (28) from Batticaloa introduces us to his start-up Niftron which is offering 'blockchain' technology.</p><p>This technology, a service platform, is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network, he says, explaining that a blockchain database stores data in 'blocks' that are linked together in a 'chain'.</p><p>Sharmilan underscores that there is no paper trail or documents which could be fiddled with. A blockchain, say with regard to an organic product, would leave clear traceability from farm to market, with consumers being able to scan a QR Code and see its journey.</p><p>Citing a few examples, he says that this service platform can be used to trace the story of the cultivation of traditional rice varieties, Sri Lankan women in the apparel industry who stitch intricate lace and whether plastic manufacturers are in reality using recycled raw material.</p><p>It is another traceability solution with a different tweak that Mathangey Sathiyamoorthy (27) from Colombo is putting forth through her company, Polar.</p><p>This solution uses the Internet of Things (IOT) technology, she says, allowing the tracking of any type of perishable food through all stages of production, processing and distribution.</p><p>Picking up a stock of vegetables being transported from a Sigiriya farm to a market shelf in Colombo in a truck with cooling facilities, Mathangey says this platform and device would send real-time data and alerts when necessary on the condition of the stock. Then if there is a disturbance in the temperature which could cause a deterioration of the vegetables, immediate action could be taken to correct it. Global expansion is what she is looking for.</p><p>Joining on Zoom from Matale is Kapila Weeratunga Arachchi (59), an entrepreneur who develops and manufactures different types of dryers through his company Saviru Technologies and Services, for businesses engaged in dehydration techniques for vegetables and fruit.</p><p>His dryers with a capacity ranging from 5 kilos to 5,000 kilos can work with wood, oil, gas or electricity.

It has distinguishable elements including a hazard, exposure, vulnerability, response options, values, magnitude, likelihood, and temporal characteristics, and is further shaped by socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Whether they are faced by an individual, community, company, or national level, risks are multifold, complex, and interconnected. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In general, risks fall into categories such as market risks, liquidity risks, credit risks, operational risks, production risks, legal and regulatory risks, environmental risks, and many others. In the age of climate change, climate risk has emerged as a crucial additional category of risks that affects all sectors and areas of the economy, for example through extreme weather events, shifting weather patterns, and long-term processes including sea level rise and ecosystem degradation.</p><p>Climate change and risk finance</p><p>To manage climate-related or climate-compounded risks, entities have a range of options, for example risk prevention (reducing exposure), risk reduction (reducing vulnerability), risk analytics leading to risk-informed planning, and risk transfer, which is usually done through indemnity-based or parametric insurance mechanisms.</p><p>Risk finance is an integral part of risk management and vital to addressing the multitude of risks connected to climate change. At its core, risk finance is about finding ways to compensate for the potential of losses or damages in the most effective and least costly way possible. Depending on the risk, the entity, and available mechanisms and frameworks, risk finance can take many different forms and vary significantly in volume.</p><p>Cost of risk (COR) is a quantitative measure of the total direct and indirect expenditures dedicated to mitigating the risk exposures confronting an organisation in pursuit of its objectives. However, it is important to note that risk finance cannot cover the entirety of risks faced by different entities.

According to experts from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), travelers are now more likely to demand a focus on sustainability, connections with local communities, open-air and nature-based cultural experiences-in other words, the ethos of travel in our little island home. Before global travel restrictions, the tourism sector in Sri Lanka was the third-largest export earner accounting for around 5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 with the sector directly employing 250,000 people and up to 2 million, indirectly. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka nearly doubled from 1.5 million to 2.3 million from 2014 to 2018. Revitalizing this sector through a speedy, clean and green recovery has the potential to provide tangible benefits to the Sri Lankan economy and communities across the island.</p><p>Building Back Tourism</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has been focused on just that: building back tourism as a resilient and sustainable sector. The newly developed Tourism Roadmap, \"Putting People First: Building a More Resilient Tourism Sector in Sri Lanka\", aims to rebrand Sri Lanka which, for decades, has been pegged as a mass low-spending market, to an unmissable, signature experience recognized for its niche, indigenous products and services around nature, wellness, culture and adventure. It also aims to redesign the industry to protect it's people. Sri Lanka's tourism is still reeling from the devastating Easter Attacks in 2019, and are only just getting its bearings together from the global travel collapse and effects of COVID-19. This roadmap for Sri Lanka, aims to provide social protection nets for those in the industry to withstand such untimely events in the future. UNDP will continue to assist the Government of Sri Lanka in updating the Tourism Development Strategic Action Plan 2021-2024, while also enabling Sri Lanka to transition to sustainable tourism by creating guidelines and standards for nature-based tourism. Prior to the pandemic, SLTDA put sustainability at the core in reviving this sector, by launching the National Sustainable Tourism Certification in 2018 with financial and technical assistance from the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN). Such programmes are essential, as tourism is often a source of pollution and biodiversity degradation with the benefits of tourism not trickling down to local communities. This certification scheme is geared towards promoting sustainable accomodations, destinations and tour operators.</p><p>The first phase of obtaining certification for accommodations was successfully completed, while SLTDA and UNDP are currently focused on obtaining Sustainable Destination Certifications for 9 destinations across the 9 provinces in the island. This certification scheme enables tourist destinations to be rated based on the overall quality of service and exclusiveness of the experience. Currently, 28% of total revenue from visiting international tourists is generated through biodiversity related attractions. This certification will further contribute to tourism, by attracting more eco-conscious tourists which will generate more revenue to help improve the biodiversity of these destinations. Despite the high value of these attractions, hardly any revenue is put back into developing and conserving these attractions and its surrounding habitats. The Destination certification looks at sustainably managing the existing biodiversity, by encouraging key tourist destinations to invest 0.5% (equivalent to 5 million USD per annum) back into biodiversity management.

Scientists have declared our actions in the next 10 years to be catalytic in bringing the Earth back within its planetary boundaries-bending the curve on biodiversity loss, controlling greenhouse gas emissions, keeping global temperature rise below 1.5degC, and preventing climate change.</p><p>The anthropogenic mass, which consists of human-made inanimate objects such as houses, roads and plastic - is doubling its weight roughly every 20 years. As of 2020, anthropogenic masses have begun to exceed global living biomass. This means, we have used up nearly 50% of the world's natural resources as raw materials for our existence. Humanity today uses the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to provide resources for our use and absorb waste. We use more ecological resources and services than nature can regenerate -and added with the increase in rates of pollution and ecological degradation, we are now at a tipping point.</p><p>Future of our Civilization at Risk</p><p>Global warming is leading to the premature collapse of vital ecosystems necessary for our survival. Since our existence and the Earth's resources are intrinsically intertwined, these planetary changes will have catastrophic impacts on life as we know it. Advancing development, while erasing such planetary pressure is the next frontier for human development.</p><p>Amidst the torrential monsoon rains increasing risks of flooding, and heavy winds from 'Cyclone Yaas'- the second cyclonic depression in the Indian Ocean for the month of May- tearing through the island, while battling the third and the worst wave of COVID-19 that Sri Lanka has seen thus far, it has never been more evident that the time to act is now.</p><p>Our little island is one of 36 biodiversity hotspots in the world and has one of the highest rates of biological endemism. It is home to a rich ecosystem because of its climatic diversity and coastal influences. Our ecosystems act as our lifeblood; it recycles nutrients, provides clean water and energy, sustains the country's water production, and sequesters carbon and slows the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution.</p><p>Ecosystems: A Natural Climate Solution</p><p>As Sri Lanka's climate vulnerability and extreme weather events increase, apart from providing essential services, these ecosystems are also the solution to the climate crisis. Specifically, our ecosystems are capable of providing nature-based solutions to reduce climate vulnerability and impacts on communities. Forested watersheds sustain water supplies to people experiencing water stress, while feeding economic development and biodiversity.</p><p>Mangroves, other coastal vegetation, sand dunes, wetlands, and offshore coral reefs protect our coastline from the impacts of wave surges and extreme storms, while our forests are essential for flood, erosion control and headwater protection. Beyond this natural buffer, our ecosystems are the 'natural climate solution' providing us with cleaner air, reduced CO2in our atmosphere, climate resilient livelihoods, sustainable economic benefits and green growth, all through nature-based solutions to development.</p><p>While climate change threatens our ecological integrity, we too are threatening our ecosystems. According to the Sixth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity, in 2019, overfishing, destructive fishing methods, coastal zone development, pollution, unregulated and unsustainable tourism practices were some of the key drivers of degradation in Sri Lankan coastal ecosystems. The 2018 UNREDD National Action Plan and Investment Framework affirmed that habitatfragmentation, encroachment, urbanization, irrigation development, resettlement, transportation development, and private agriculture ventures were some of the key threats to our forests, grasslands and wetlands.</p><p>Dr. Buddika Hapuarachchi, Policy Specialist and Team Lead for Climate and Environment at UNDP in Sri Lanka, asserts the severity of the potential and novel risks communities and environment may be subject to. He notes, \"The recent fire on the cargo ship carrying hazardous substances; MV X-Press Pearl, and the heavy pollution of our coastline that followed was unexpected - but is evidence to the fact that additional and potential threats to our environment are exponential and compounding, and will require significant recovery time and resources.\"</p><p>At the heart of developmental progress</p><p>Although Sri Lanka has been pursuing 'low-carbon development', cross-sectoral policy inconsistencies, and structural issues have decreased the country's environmental sustainability. The increase in disaster losses and damages has also led to decelerated economic growth. According to the World Bank, in 2018, the economic growth of Sri Lanka reached a 16-year low of 3.3% due to the prolonged disaster losses over the years, especially those in 2017. This has resulted in an increase in food insecurity and multidimensional poverty from 11.9 % in 2019, to 14.3%in 2020, which is above three million people. Five years after the ratification of the Paris Agreement, it's clear that conserving, restoring and financing nature remains imperative, and as a nation, it is imperative that we avoidcreating new risks. We must place policy and legislative changes, multisectoral collaboration and innovative financing approaches at the heart of all developmental progress in the next ten years if we are to reverse the effects of these disasters.</p><p>At this critical juncture of COVID-19 recovery, the policy and fiscal choices made at this point will lock in the country's economic and developmental future. \"This is an ideal opportunity for Sri Lanka to push long-overdue climate and environmental sustainability actions, delink economic growth from fossil-fuel dependency and emissions, and promote climate-and nature-based solutions,\" says Dr. Hapuarachchi. Sustainable public-private partnerships must be encouraged, while transforming agriculture to a carbon sink, and ensuring that the 'whole of system' approach is applied when adapting, mitigating and eliminating vulnerabilities. Dr. Hapuarachchi sums up that, \"in short, balanced inclusive green growth [is what we need]. Development, that is socially inclusive and drives economic growth, employment and poverty reduction, while maintaining the healthy functioning of</p><p>our ecosystems\".</p><p>A Decade of Hope</p><p>World Environment Day 2021 calls for urgent action to revive our damaged ecosystems as we kick off the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030). Ecosystem restoration is a global undertaking at massive scale. It means repairing billions of hectares of land - an area greater than China or the USA - so that people have access to food, clean water and jobs. It means bringing back plants and animals from the brink of extinction, from the peaks of mountains to the depths of the sea. But it also includes the many small actions everyone can take, every day.</p><p>Sri Lanka has already taken a step in the right direction, making significant progress affirming these green commitments by setting ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement; through the development of sectoral development plans, relevant policies, strategies and guidelines to fulfill these climate commitments. These efforts are now being supplemented by the Government and development agencies pushing towards a 'systems shift' for green-centric development in the country.</p><p>The moment is now</p><p>While the impending risks and threats are daunting, Sri Lanka has always adopted a culture of resilience and collective action. When in need, we step up to the task, ensuring that no one is left behind while we build forward better.</p><p>This is our moment. We cannot turn back the time - but our actions today will determine our future. We are the generation that can make peace with nature. Let's restore, regenerate, renew, reuse, regreen and rewild our environment for a better and more sustainable future.

Had we invested earlier and massively in renewable energy, we would not find ourselves once again at the mercy of unstable fossil fuel markets.</p><p>Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century. But the battle for a rapid and just energy transition is not being fought on a level field. Investors are still backing fossil fuels, and governments still hand out billions in subsidies for coal, oil and gas - some US $11 million every minute.</p><p>There is a word for favouring short-term relief over long-term well-being. Addiction. We are still addicted to fossil fuels. For the health of our societies and planet, we need to quit. Now.</p><p>The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a livable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition.</p><p>To that end, I have called on G20 governments to dismantle coal infrastructure, with a full phase-out by 2030 for OECD countries and 2040 for all others.</p><p>I have urged financial actors to abandon fossil fuel finance and invest in renewable energy. And I have proposed a five-point plan to boost renewable energy round the world.</p><p>Five-point plan</p><p>First, we must make renewable energy technology a global public good, including removing intellectual property barriers to technology transfer.</p><p>Second, we must improve global access to supply chains for renewable energy technologies components and raw materials</p><p>In 2020, the world installed 5 gigawatts of battery storage. We need 600 gigawatts of storage capacity by 2030. Clearly, we need a global coalition to get there.</p><p>Shipping bottlenecks and supply-chain constraints, as well as higher costs for lithium and other battery metals, are hurting deployment of such technologies and materials just as we need them most.</p><p>Third, we must cut the red tape that holds up solar and wind projects. We need fast-track approvals and more effort to modernise electricity grids. In the European Union, it takes eight years to approve a wind farm, and 10 years in the United States. In the Republic of Korea, onshore wind projects need 22 permits from eight different ministries.</p><p>Fourth, the world must shift energy subsidies from fossil fuels to protect vulnerable people from energy shocks and invest in a just transition to a sustainable future.</p><p>And fifth, we need to triple investments in renewables. This includes multilateral development banks and development finance institutions, as well as commercial banks. All must step up and dramatically boost investments in renewables.</p><p>We need more urgency from all global leaders. We are already perilously close to hitting the 1.5degC limit that science tells us is the maximum level of warming to avoid the worst climate impacts.</p><p>To keep 1.5 alive, we must reduce emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by mid-century. But current national commitments will lead to an increase of almost 14 per cent this decade. That spells catastrophe.</p><p>The answer lies in renewables - for climate action, for energy security, and for providing clean electricity to the hundreds of millions of people who currently lack it. Renewables are a triple win.</p><p>There is no excuse for anyone to reject a renewables revolution. While oil and gas prices have reached record price levels, renewables are getting cheaper all the time.</p><p>The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85 percent over the past decade. The cost of wind power fell by 55 per cent. And investment in renewables creates three times more jobs than fossil fuels.</p><p>Of course, renewables are not the only answer to the climate crisis.

It will be held by President Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister, in the next two years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile in a curtain raiser interview yesterday ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa said that not only the energy crisis but also the food crisis and COVID 19 threat still existed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\" ADB has tried to respond to these new challenges through various measures and we will continue to provide ordinary project financing, policy-based loans, budget financing for private sector and quite recently we have enhanced one of our existing financial instrument called CSF which would provide emergency financing to support DMCs to expand their countercyclical fiscal expenditure to mitigate the shocks coming from external events like food security and so on. Those are the short term measures but in the long term we are reviewing our projects in our pipeline for DMCs to see how we can support our DMCs to build very strong, robust and sustainable food systems through climate - smart agriculture, digitalization of the food value chains and nature based solutions, he said.</p><p>Developing Asia experienced a negative economic growth rate of negative 0.8% in 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic and it was the first economic contraction which happened in this area for the last 60 years. In 2021 it rebounded to 6.9% and this year 2022, ADB projects 4.3%. The reason for the rebound last year includes a couple of things. First the very mild health impact of the Omicron variant, second, progress in vaccination in this area and third very robust, strong performance of exports throughout this region. However, the space to recover varies among economies and remains very uneven among economies.</p><p>\"So we have to bear in mind four possible downside risks to the economic outlook of this region. First, the slowing down of China's economy due to the very stringent zero-COVID policy and second, there is still a possibility of emergence of a more lethal COVID 19 variant. Thirdly, the economic negative impact caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And fourthly, instability in the financial market due to the very aggressive rapid monetary policy normalization by some advanced economies. The Omicron outbreaks have been very short-lived in general and milder than the previous waves. Actually the number of COVID 19 in this region has dramatically dropped, declined. ADB also responded very quickly to this pandemic. In April 2020, we announced a US$ 20 billion COVID 19 comprehensive assistance package. Also in December the same year 2020 we announced an additional financial instrument for procurement of vaccines by developing member countries with the amount of USD 9 billion. So far we have committed USD 33 billion to support our DMCs to fight against the COVID 19 pandemic. Out of this USD 33 billion, USD 10 billion was for very quick disbursing budget financing called CPRO and USD 8 billion was for private sector financing, including very short-term trade financing. And USD 4 bn was for vaccine financing.</p><p>\"We are not completely out of the woods so we will continue providing those budget financing and private sector financing and also vaccine financing in addition to the ordinary project financing as necessary. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has posed a very serious risk to the economic outlook to this region. There are two kinds of risks; one is direct impact and indirect impact. Direct impact through trade, capital transactions with Russia and also remittance coming from Russia has been relatively limited to developing Asia as a whole except for a couple of countries in Central Asia, Caucasus and Mongolia who have traditionally maintained a very close trade and economic linkage with the Russian Federation.</p><p>On the other hand, the indirect impact and indirect risk has been locked through a very steep price increase in food and energy. I am quite sure importers, import countries of food and energy will see this year's import bills. Much more expensive than last year's, which means adding inflationary pressure on the economy.\"</p><p>Asakawa said that a number of central banks in this region have already started increasing policy interest rates to quell the inflation pressure which would add additional constraints on economic growth prospects of this region. Also indirect impact includes the deterioration of market sentiment which would depress consumers', producers', and investor confidence. So fighting for safety and tighter financial conditions globally might spur some sort of capital outflow movement from this region.</p><p>Together with the steep increase in food prices, the possible reduction of fertilizer supply by Russia would have a significant impact on the agriculture production of this region as well.</p><p>This has become a serious concern in terms of food security so this is exacerbating the already challenging situation due to the economic fallout of COVID 19 some political unrest notably in Afghanistan and Myanmar and droughts and other adverse weather events linked to climate change. He said the fight against climate change in this region will be won or lost and they have made important decisions on climate financing.</p><p>ADB has elevated their ambition from USD 80 billion to USD 100 billion of cumulative climate financing from 2019 to 2030. The commitment of USD 100 billion over 12 years is a big challenge for the ADB. \"We revised ADBs so-called energy policy which was very old. Under the new energy policy we officially decided to withdraw our financing for any new coal-fired power plants.</p><p>He also said they would use Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) to retire already existing coal plants and unlock investment in renewable energy so that they can promote the smooth transition from coal to renewable energy in each country. Due to the long lasting and low interest rate environment and also fiscal expansion to deal with the COVID 19 pandemic in almost every country the fiscal situation got worse. The time would thereby come for every country to change gear from fiscal expansion to fiscal consolidation. In that sense domestic resource mobilization (DRM) is very important. This means how to raise domestic tax revenue.</p><p>He said that globalization will come back and regional cooperation needs to be tightened up in trade and investment and despite the border closure and travel restraints introduced during the COVID period countries in the region have reopened and reconnected already. Another good example is the signing of the RCEP in November 2020 which has come into effect from January 2022. That was a strong signal and commitment by this region for open and free trade and investment systems.</p><p>****</p><p>ADB Annual Meeting begins</p><p>The 55th ADB Annual Meeting began yesterday with curtain raiser event discussion with President Masatsugu Asakawa covering the energy crisis, food security, climate change, COVID-19 recovery, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Asakawa offered his vision and ideas for change towards a better, greener, more sustainable, and resilient Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Urban areas are currently home to 4.2 billion people, and urban populations expected to grow by an additional 2.5 billion people by 2050. All regions of the world are expected to urbanise throughout the next decades, but urbanisation is likely to be faster and include larger numbers of people in developing countries, particularly in the African and Asian region. South Asia, to which Sri Lanka belongs, is projected to be the second most rapidly urbanising region in the world behind Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As centres of population and human activity, cities are responsible for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, which makes them critical contributors to climate change. For this reason, shaping the future of cities is central to solving the global climate crisis as well as to address biodiversity loss and the need for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Cities can reduce emissions and help mitigate climate change-for example through their infrastructure, the transport sector, buildings, energy usage, commercial activity, industry etc.-, but they can also enhance adaptive capacities of billions of people by providing them with the tools and enabling environment to better withstand climate change.</p><p>Cities as climate hotspots</p><p>Urban areas are potential catalysts for climate action, but they are also exposed and vulnerable to climate-related hazards and a multitude of short- and long-term impacts. For example, heat waves and heat stress, heavy rains, floods, storms, wildfires, and high winds already threaten cities around the world, while long-term processes such as sea level rise or water scarcity are expected to further affect urban areas throughout the 21st century.</p><p>This interconnection between cities and climate change is increasingly acknowledged in scientific literature and key global reports. For instance, climate change is prominently featured in the World Cities Report 2022 published by UN-Habitat, while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has dedicated a separate chapter on cities and human settlements in its latest assessment report (AR6).</p><p>The IPCC report highlights that 'in all cities and urban areas, the risk faced by people and assets from hazards associated with climate change has increased,' disrupting infrastructure and essential services as well as the links between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The IPCC report outlines that globally, 'the most rapid growth in urban vulnerability and exposure has been in cities and settlements where adaptive capacity is limited-especially in unplanned and informal settlements in low- and middle-income nations and in smaller and medium-sized urban centres.'</p><p>How cities manage these growing climate risks and protect especially their most vulnerable population groups will make a crucial difference going forward. Factors such as governance capacity, financial support, awareness, and available technology play a role for this response, but also social and cultural factors, skill-building, entrepreneurship, welcoming migrants, dealing with legacy infrastructure and its constraints, harnessing innovation, and integrating natural ecosystems into urban planning and development.</p><p>Merging urban and natural ecosystems</p><p>Urban areas can be seen as artificial ecosystems of their own which are characterized by complex systems of human interaction, employment, supply and value chains, markets, infrastructure, services, transport, communication, sanitation, water management, food provision, storage, and many other elements. However, they are also connected to the natural environment and non-human ecosystems, for example forests, urban wetlands, rivers and estuaries, lakes, beaches, or parks.</p><p>These ecosystems provide a multitude of services that can make a key difference in quality of life, human wellbeing, and climate or disaster risk reduction. For one, air and water quality can be significantly improved by wetlands, trees, and green spaces inside an urban area. Furthermore, natural ecosystems can provide provisioning services, regulate other aspects of the environment, and serve as sites for recreational activities or tourism. They also have the potential to protect human communities, infrastructure, and assets from disaster events and unexpected shocks-such as floods or storms-and reduce coastal erosion and land degradation. Finally, they can also serve as habitats for biodiversity and urban wildlife, especially in tropical countries such as Sri Lanka.</p><p>The IPCC report refers to evidence from cities around the world, including Colombo, on the effectiveness of risk reduction through zoning and land use to 'protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect.' This highlights the fact that green infrastructure offers many benefits and can make cities not only more liveable and beautiful, but also safer and more prosperous.</p><p>Building resilient and adaptative cities</p><p>In contexts of crisis and difficulty, cities have the potential to turn into engines of growth and recovery. They offer a way for people to come together, connect, and engage in collective efforts that can reap social, economic, and environmental benefits if planned and managed properly. Cities can breed innovation and climate solutions, including nature-based solutions and 'grey' infrastructure, but also solutions related to start-up ecosystems, education opportunities, frontier technologies, and capacity-building.</p><p>Cities tend to attract migrants from rural areas, but these migrants often end up settling into informal and unplanned ways that expose them to climate, health, and security risks. However, if migrants can be integrated into the fabric of the urban centre-with access to infrastructure, services, utilities, social protection, employment, and skills development-, they have the potential to enhance adaptation by making economic, social, and cultural contributions and strengthen rural-urban linkages that can make the entire region more resilient.</p><p>Transforming cities to become more climate-resilient and adapt to the current and projected impacts of climate change presents a key challenge for the 21st century. Climate-related disasters and long-term impacts will put millions at risk, including the most vulnerable population groups.

In addition, such actions can greatly benefit from aligning with global climate processes, national climate commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>The SDGs acknowledge that ending poverty, climate action, and biodiversity conservation must go hand-in-hand with spurring economic growth, improving health and education, and reducing inequalities. This holistic approach and its key principles are relevant for start-ups as well as corporations, and they should permeate all business decisions to guarantee future-proof development that connects to global trends and builds on their momentum.</p><p>Entrepreneurship today needs to be conscious of the need for sustainability and green growth. Throughout all aspects of a business-such as product design, operations, packaging, transport, or marketing-, principles of sustainability should be applied to reduce environmental footprints and resource use.

The rise of new sectors presents a chance to invest in relevant skills and capacities to foster innovation and paradigm-changing solutions.</p><p>With targeted capacity-building and support, entrepreneurs and start-ups across the country can contribute to sustainable economic recovery and diversification. Particularly in rural areas, entrepreneurship can be enhanced by fostering an enabling environment and start-up ecosystem, including institutional arrangements and policies, facilitating social dialogue, investing in skills development, training, and re-training, providing infrastructure and seed funding, and investing in social protection schemes that provide safety for workers, their families, and communities at large.</p><p>Climate resilience and mainstreaming risk management</p><p>In addition to sustainability, any business-from start-up to large enterprise-needs to acknowledge the complex landscape of risks in the current environment.

This includes physical infrastructure and technological solutions, but also climate-informed planning, risk analytics, ecosystem conservation and nature-based solutions, adjustments to the policy landscape, capacity-building of institutions and the workforce, insurance and social protection schemes, and a variety of other interventions.</p><p>In short, entrepreneurs, established businesses, government institutions, and other relevant entities need to act in risk-informed ways that adapt both to a changing climate and the reality of other risks and impacts. By learning from science and experience, risks can be avoided, reduced, or turned into opportunities, for example by adopting innovative practices, new technologies, or connecting traditional and modern knowledge.</p><p>Linking SDGs and climate-smart development</p><p>Research suggests that climate action has the potential to reinforce all seventeen SDGs, while a failure to act decisively on climate will likely undermine SDG achievements. If economic development and building back better are aligned with both climate action and sustainable development, they can therefore develop strong synergies and avoid negative feedback loops.</p><p>Linking climate change and sustainable development also offers an opportunity to leverage additional funding and tap available sources of climate finance.

When first created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in late 1993, December 29 (the date of entry into force of the Convention of Biological Diversity), was designated The International Day for Biological Diversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In December 2000, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted May 22 as the IDB, to commemorate the adoption of the text of the Convention on May 22, 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This was partly done because it was difficult for many countries to plan and carry out suitable celebrations for the date of December 29, given the number of holidays that coincide around that time of year. Sri Lanka, one of the world's best-known biodiversity hotspots, also marks the day every year.</p><p>UN Biodiversity conference</p><p>The Biodiversity Day 2022 slogan is \"Building a shared future for all life\". The slogan was chosen to continue building momentum and support for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the upcoming UN Biodiversity Conference.</p><p>Biodiversity remains the answer to several sustainable development challenges. From nature-based solutions to climate, health issues, food and water security, and sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity is the foundation upon which we can build back better.</p><p>But why should we care about biodiversity? There is no doubt that the planet is facing its greatest crisis. Global warming may lead to a major upheaval on Planet Earth. In other words, many species are vanishing before our very eyes.</p><p>Today, the rate of species extinction may be 1,000 times higher than the natural background rate. In fact, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that Nearly 30 percent of the 138,374 species assessed for its survival watchlist are now at risk of vanishing in the wild forever, as the destructive impact of human activity on the natural world deepens. UN's biodiversity experts have warned that a million species are on the brink of extinction - raising the spectre that the planet is on the verge of its sixth mass extinction event in 500 million years.</p><p>Rapid degradation of ecosystems</p><p>Recent surveys reveal that 21 percent of all known mammals, 30 percent of all known amphibians, 12 percent of all known birds, and 28 per-cent of reptiles, 37 per cent of freshwater fishes, 70 per cent of plants, 35 percent of invertebrates assessed so far are under threat.</p><p>The goal of halting the loss of biodiversity is the subject of several key international agreements. Each recognises the rapid degradation of ecosystems and habitats, the increasing threat to many species populations and the urgent need to take action that will halt the decline in irreplaceable natural resources. The main target is \"to achieve a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss\" and the one addressed at EU and Pan-European level is even more ambitious as to \"halt the loss of biodiversity\".</p><p>Red List assessments</p><p>There are some encouraging results in this regard. The latest update of the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species also highlights the potential for restoration, with four commercially fished tuna species pulling back from a slide towards extinction after a decade of efforts to curb overexploitation. The most spectacular recovery was seen in the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which leapt from \"endangered\" across three categories to the safe zone of \"least concern.\" \"These Red List assessments demonstrate just how closely our lives and livelihoods are intertwined with biodiversity,\" IUCN Director General Bruno Oberle said in a statement.</p><p>\"Humans are part of nature's rich diversity and have the power to protect or destroy it,\" says the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is hosted by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p>Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, is essential to sustaining the living networks and systems that provide us all with health, wealth, food, fuel and the vital services our lives depend on. Human activity is causing the diversity of life on Earth to be lost at a greatly accelerated rate. These losses are sometimes irreversible, impoverish us all and damage the life support systems we rely on every day. But we can prevent them to a great extent.</p><p>That is the message that activists hope to spread this year. The loss of biodiversity can be prevented if corrective action is taken early.</p><p>We must remember that the world's diverse ecosystems purify the air and the water that are the basis of life, stabilize and moderate the Earth's climate, renew soil fertility, cycle nutrients and pollinate plants.</p><p>But is there anything we can do to save our planet and hence, biodiversity? The goal is to prevent global warming, which has a direct effect on biodiversity. Here, according to the UN, are some of the things you can do to save the world:</p><p>Remedies</p><p>Take public transport, bike, walk, or carpool to work (or other destination) at least one day a week. Avoid air travel where possible; Buy food, preferably organic food-vegetables, fruits, dairy, eggs, and meat-from a village fair, not a supermarket; Eat sustainably harvested seafood and farmed fish that are herbivorous; Install LED light bulbs in your home-it will save electricity and replacement bulb costs each year, and reduce carbon emissions by a ton every three years; Turn off lights in empty rooms; Stop using chemical herbicides and pesticides where possible; Tell everyone what you are doing to conserve biodiversity and ask them to join you. Support people's representatives who act for biodiversity. Above all, buy an consume only what you really need, and re-use and re-cycle whatever and whenever you can.</p><p>It is not only the UN, Governments and international wildlife/conservation organisations that should work to protect biodiversity.</p><p>People too can participate in this process by caring for Life and Nature at all times.

However, this is what most of the residents in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, the administrative capital, and surrounding wetland areas still enjoy each morning, despite living in a highly urbanized setting. Of course, not all of them understand and appreciate that Nature's gift.</p><p>The Salalihini Sandeshaya by Ven. Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, a historic piece of Sinhala literature, also depicts the beauty of these environs in a bird's-eye view. This epic poem was written during the time of King Parakramabahu VI. The Kingdom of Kotte, which flourished in the 15th Century, was naturally protected by its wetlands.</p><p>\"We are living in a very unique city, but we are not very conscious about the environment around us. From every breath we take to every rupee we earn, we are dependent on the environment surrounding us,\" Dr. Chethika Gunasiri, an Environmental Scientist at the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation (SLLDC), emphasized at the outset of her recent lecture titled 'Living in the only wetland capital in the world' at BMICH in Colombo. It was organised by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) parallel to the World Wetlands Day which falls on February 2.</p><p>In her one-hour long thought-provoking speech, she underlined the major role played by urban wetlands to make the city liveable and resilient, and the challenges to their conservation.</p><p>When the cities are expanding, the urban wetlands are the first to be compromised. A study has found out that the wetlands in Colombo had shrunk by 40 percent from 1980s to 2014. We are losing the pristine wetlands at an annual rate of 1.2 percent. If this rate is continued, the consequences will be dire for all humans and animals in the city, including future generations.</p><p>Ramsar Wetland City</p><p>The natural landscape of Colombo is a low lying area filled with marshes and it is crisscrossed with man-made canals and lakes. Today, even after decades of rapid development and degradation, there are about 36 interconnected wetland patches in this mosaic, which is called the Colombo Wetland Complex (CWC) or the Colombo catchment. They cover an area of about 19 square kilometres out of the 121.5 square kilometres of the Colombo Metropolitan Region. Noteworthy, it provides a 50 percent contribution to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and has more than 2.3 million residents.</p><p>\"If the Colombo catchment is divided into three areas, the downstream, which is closer to the West coast, has no wetlands. The middle area is a retention area and houses all big wetlands such as the Kolonnawa, Heen-Ela and Kotte wetlands, Parliament Lake, Diyasaru Park and Kimbulawala Walk Way. It stores 37 percent of rainwater coming to this hydrological area. Upper side of the catchment consists mainly of paddy fields. The water coming into this area is diverting to neighbouring catchments,\" Dr. Gunasiri explained.</p><p>Colombo was among the first 18 cities the Ramsar Secretariat officially accredited as wetland cities in 2018. Dr. Gunasiri, who was a team member that prepared the Colombo Wetland Management Strategy and the application for the Ramsar Wetland City Accreditation for the Colombo City, thanked all the stakeholders who contributed to that landmark achievement as a country.</p><p>\"Colombo was the only capital city to get that title. Colombo City was re-branded and internationally recognized as a wetland city with this accreditation. Another 25 cities received this title in the last Conference of the Parties (COP) held in Geneva in November 2022. Altogether 43 cities have now been accredited as Ramsar Wetland Cities. These cities serve as examples and inspire deliberate actions for other cities toward sustainable urbanization,\" she added.</p><p>The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in the Iranian City of Ramsar, is the intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. As of now, 172 countries are signatory to it, and Sri Lanka became a part of it in 1992.</p><p>Natural sponge</p><p>A wetland is an ecosystem that comes in between a terrestrial ecosystem and deep water aquatic ecosystem. It is an intermediary stage. The main component of a wetland is water, and this water can be in different forms. The Ramsar Convention defines wetlands as \"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres\".</p><p>\"Wetlands usually have shallow water bodies, and because of that, they support a lot of biogeochemical cycles. That is the reason why wetlands are considered the most productive ecosystems in the world. Humans are strongly connected with them because they provide a lot of ecosystem benefits and services,\" Dr. Gunasiri expounded.</p><p>Serving as flood retention areas is a known function of wetlands. \"They act as natural sponges and protect the city from floods. The wetland soil, which is called hydric soil, has a high amount of clay and can absorb a lot of water. This is important as cities have a lot of impermeable surfaces,\" she observed.</p><p>Her lecture underlined that Colombo wetlands save Rs 15 billion every year through flood control. Colombo is vulnerable to floods, and the devastative flood event in 2010, during which even the Parliament Complex went under water, was an eye opener for the authorities as well as the public on the importance of conserving the remaining wetland patches, which are also the only green patches in the city.</p><p>\"This flood event transformed the way we looked at the Colombo Wetland Management. The Metro Colombo Urban Development Project, which primarily focused on hydrological solutions to the floods, started in 2012. The Wetland Management Division was established in the SLLDC in 2013. The Colombo Metropolitan Region Wetland Management Strategy, the first strategic document for the wise use of urban wetlands, came up (2013-2016), and wetland-based urban recreational and agriculture projects were actively started,\" she recalled.</p><p>More benefits</p><p>\"Wetlands are also considered as Nature's kidneys. As same as kidneys purify the blood, the wetland plants (reeds and floating vegetation) and the soil, in a process called phytoremediation, absorb toxic materials from water and convert them to non-toxic materials through a chemical process, and purifies the water,\" she elucidated, reminding that this function is of great importance as the water pollution is quite high in cities.</p><p>Touching on the financial aspect, she pointed out that the urban wetlands save Rs. 2 billion per year by cleaning polluted water.</p><p>Dr. Gunasiri drew the attention of the audience to the waste water problem in the Colombo Wetland Complex due to the mushrooming number of condominiums.</p><p>\"The horizontal expansion of Colombo is over now as there is no more space. We have started expanding it vertically with high rise buildings and condominiums. It does both good and bad. Sri Lanka does not have a sophisticated waste water management system. When the condominiums increase in number, a lot of people settle down in a small space, and the amount of waste water they produce is high. Though many are not yet aware about it, this is one of the biggest problems that we are going to face in the future,\" she noted.</p><p>Another important function of these ecosystems is that they cool the cities and help control temperature, thus making the cities more comfortable for humans and all other living beings. In that way, they also help save electricity used for air conditioning.</p><p>The Environmental Scientist pointed out that urban wetlands act as wildlife refuges, and because of that, they have high levels of biodiversity. Colombo wetlands are home to 277 animal species and 285 plant species, including many endemic and vulnerable species. For example, Colombo is the only city in the world where an urban fishing cat population is found.</p><p>In addition, she explained that urban wetland habitats are important for food security as 87 percent of total wetlands provide food for the citizens in Colombo. Moreover, these wetlands add aesthetic beauty to the city, and have a recreational value. Dr. Gunasiri brought up in her lecture that the country can generate at least Rs. 1.6 billion per year from recreation and tourism in these wetlands.</p><p>She observed the jogging tracks and parks in these areas serve two purposes. Firstly, they help improve the health of the people, and secondly, they bring people closer to the wetlands, enabling them to understand and appreciate their value. She mentioned that it was also a strategy to stop further encroachment of these areas.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Garbage dumping, land filling and human encroachments have become common problems to the urban wetlands.</p><p>\"With the construction of the Parliament Complex in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, a lot of developments and settlements started around this area, and a lot of marshes and paddy fields were cleared. In 1991, in order to protect that area from floods, 1,000 acres of marshes and active paddy fields around Parliament were acquired by the Government as flood retention areas. Those mainly included Kolonnawa, Kotte and Heen-Ela wetlands and Parliament upper retention area.</p><p>\"Recently, the Government re-demarcated those wetlands, and at that point it could be seen that some boundaries were going in the middle of home gardens, and sometimes even living rooms. That much of encroachment has happened in the last three decades,\" the environmental professional underscored.</p><p>The sensitive ecosystems of wetlands are heavily disturbed and destroyed due to garbage dumping. \"Even in highly managed public places such as jogging tracks and wetland parks, littering has become an issue. In some countries, people do not throw their litter until they find a dustbin, but our people are not like that. I admit that in some places garbage bins are not properly kept, but sometimes, even the dustbin is there, but the litter is out of the dustbin,\" she commented, adding that correcting such behaviours must happen from the school level.</p><p>She highlighted that alien invasive species pose a biological threat to Colombo wetlands. For example, she said that, the canal in Kolonnawa is covered with Water Hyacinth ('Japan Jabara'), the canal in the Diyasaru Park is covered with Salvinia and most of the wetlands in Colombo are covered with Pond Apple or 'Wel Atha'. Pond Apple has become a problem as it is making wetlands more terrestrial, negatively influencing functions of wetlands like water retention. Its removal has been difficult because the wildlife has adapted to it.</p><p>She also drew the attention of the audience that various Government agencies, such as the Urban Development Authority, Department of Wildlife and the SLLDC, own various parts of the CWC, and bringing them all to one table for decision making has become challenging.</p><p>Role of citizenry</p><p>Commenting on the issue of pollution of Beira Lake in the heart of Colombo, she said the major sewerage lines that discharge wastewater to the Lake have already been identified and stopped. \"This issue has been there for many decades now, and it has to be addressed with multiple solutions. We often come across new proposals in that regard and pilot studies have been conducted for them, but the main constraint in going into the mass scale is that they are not economically viable. The recent floating wetlands project has made some positive impact. We have to be careful that any solution that we implement does not negatively affect the many offices, hotels and business places around it,\" she added.</p><p>\"After all, Colombo is our Capital City and we cannot stop development. Both development and Nature have to go hand in hand. To achieve this end, we have to think of using urban wetlands as nature-based solutions for the environmental problems in the city.

As highlighted by the leading international science body for climate change, the IPCC, the scale of climatic changes is vast, and every fraction of a degree of temperature rise has huge implications. The Paris Agreement, which has been adopted by 197 countries, aims to limit global warming (as compared to pre-industrial temperatures) to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally to 1.5 degrees. However, to achieve this target, urgent action on the global, regional, national, and local level is needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Already, climate-related events (such as floods, storms, droughts, or heat waves) and processes (such as sea level rise, soil degradation, and increasing pests and diseases) impact lives and livelihoods in Sri Lanka. Food systems, water resources, and the coastal sector are among the most vulnerable sectors, but climate change affects many other sectors as well, for example health, human settlements, infrastructure, ecosystems and biodiversity, forestry, tourism, industry, or SMEs.</p><p>Climate change not only causes direct losses and damages in these sectors but also exacerbates other risks and disasters, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, both climate change and COVID-19 present more than just challenges: they also open up a range of chances and opportunities for individuals, households, companies, and governments.</p><p>Sustainable and green development</p><p>Climate change raises pressure and incentives to transform economies and societies. Action can be taken on all levels to change production and consumption patterns and adopt more sustainable, climate- and nature-friendly systems, but it needs to be taken now.</p><p>Reducing environmental and climate footprints-that is, the use of natural resources such as water, but also the output of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, or waste-is crucial to mitigate climate change and offers other important benefits as well. If households, companies, and countries improve their energy and resource use efficiency, invest in renewable energy sources, and turn their production systems cleaner, leaner, and less wasteful, it will render them more competitive, more productive, and less reliant on scarce resources. In addition, sustainable and green development will improve human health and wellbeing, ensure long-term survivability, and keep natural ecosystems and their services intact.</p><p>The global challenge of climate change also provides opportunities for sustainable, green, nature-positive, and socially responsible entrepreneurship on the national or local level in Sri Lanka. This includes entrepreneurship and start-ups focusing on renewable energy and clean tech, but also a much larger spectrum including food system innovation, sustainable fashion, ecotourism, holistic waste management, digitisation, re- or upcycling, and green finance.</p><p>Adaptation and resilience</p><p>As outlined in recent publications such as the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2021, climate-related risks, including the failure of climate action, are among the biggest threats to human survival and wellbeing worldwide. Climate risks are often complex, as they interact with other risks and vulnerabilities such as market risks or poverty and can affect large numbers of people at the same time.</p><p>Resilience is the ability to bounce back from shocks without losing everything. If a household, company, or country is climate-resilient, it can mobilise resources and recover from an unexpected event-a flood, a drought, the loss of a harvest-, for example through a budget reserve, a relief fund, an insurance scheme, or mutual cooperation. Through anticipatory planning, small investments (such as regular insurance premium payments) can prevent huge losses and make a significant difference. If resilience is strengthened, it can pay off not only against climate change but will be beneficial to deal with other shocks as well, including COVID-19 or market-related risks.</p><p>Science-based projections and probabilities for climatic changes are available for the years and decades to come. By investing in infrastructure, establishing risk management systems, and altering business practices now, companies and countries can adapt to these changes and position themselves to thrive under the anticipated new conditions. Adaptation measures can take many forms and incorporate ecosystems as well as social systems, ranging from more resistant infrastructure to better cultivation methods and nature-based solutions such as mangrove conservation or tree planting.</p><p>Building back better</p><p>Climate-related disasters continue to cause enormous losses and damages on a global scale, with the extreme weather events in 2021 alone causing hundreds of billions of USD in damages, not counting non-economic losses and impacts. With disasters like these becoming more frequent and intense, \"building back better\" could turn into a key principle. It recognises that the time following a disaster is an optimal period to make changes: to recover and reconstruct in a more resilient, sustainable way that will avoid a repeat of the same catastrophe in the future.</p><p>The \"building back better\" concept overlaps with adaptation and resilience-building but focuses on learning lessons from previous impacts to optimise the interventions taking place in the aftermath. This includes not only physical rebuilding but also adjustments to the enabling environment, such as policies, legal frameworks, guidelines, recovery packages, financial incentives, or subsidies, both within countries and through the international processes related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p>Looking forward</p><p>Climate change represents an immense challenge, but it also provides chances and possibilities. With proper support and enabling environment, entrepreneurs and start-ups can capitalise on the need for climate action and the business opportunities it unlocks. The transition toward sustainability, climate-friendliness, and green growth allows for the reconfiguration of policies, business practices, and infrastructure to render societies and economies more resilient, better adapted, and able to build back better in case of disasters.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Science-based projections and probabilities for climatic changes are available for the years and decades to come.

Fall armyworm - known in Latin form as frugiperda, or \"lost fruit,\" for its crop-wrecking potential - has dramatically spread eastwards from the Americas in the past five years Having established itself in most of Africa, and large swaths of Asia, it has lately been reported in Australia and parts of Oceania. Over 70 countries are now affected; there are fears that the Mediterranean fringes of Europe could be next.</p><p>Thriving in warmer climates, FAW primarily feeds on maize crops - but also on wheat, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetables and cotton.

Failure to use it wisely will lead to a sorry fate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, one of every six people on the planet live in areas facing severe water constraints. The vast majority of these are in Asia, even if Northern Africa, where one in five people confront very high water shortages and scarcity, represents the most urgent situation. Globally, the per capita availability of freshwater resources has declined by more than 20 percent in the past two decades.</p><p>Countries with ample water availability have a free lunch. Take Brazil, where for each resident there are almost 42,000 cubic metres of renewable freshwater annually. But much of it is in the Amazon Basin, little used by people. Large food-producing countries such as China and the United States of America are significantly reliant, both domestically and through trade, on rapidly depleting aquifers - the absence of evident water stress today is not evidence it will be absent tomorrow.</p><p>Africa's Sahel region and Central Asia are among the world's 51 Low-Income Food Deficit Countries. Central Asia and Africa's Sahel region, both face high water stress.</p><p>What is to be done?</p><p>Doing more with less is the short answer.</p><p>That means recognizing water's value. It has a price, and leveraging that price signal can demonstrably spur farmers to improve their water productivity. There is a range of methods: improved irrigation, better selection of crops, innovative storage and conservation methods, and a variety of nature-based solutions, often integrating aquaculture. All of them require robust and inclusive governance so that the basic needs of all, especially rural smallholders, can be met.</p><p>Any sustainable approach requires a solid grasp of existing conditions and needs - including access to safe drinking water, water for industrial development and the water requirements of ecosystems on a territorial scale, which are inadequately supplied by almost half of the irrigation systems in use today.</p><p>Water accounting and auditing, which are rarely done, should therefore be the starting point of any effective strategy for addressing water shortages and scarcity.</p><p>The State of Food and Agriculture 2020, a new flagship report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, takes an in-depth look at the question, mapping the flashpoints, surveying the world's varied water-management systems, and pointing to pathways for improvement.</p><p>Read it.</p><p>There is no time to weep, nor a need to do so. There are some upside scenarios. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa - where food insecurity and population growth are greatest - has quite ample horizons to expand irrigation, which can substantially boost agricultural productivity and at the same time assure efficient use of water. Currently, only three percent of cropland in that region is equipped for irrigation, but that is destined to grow and smart expansion can be fostered through targeted programmes that offer rural smallholders greater access to energy and credit. To be sure, that must be accompanied by equitable, inclusive and effective governance systems in order to avoid problems of excess groundwater extraction that are plaguing some other part of the world.</p><p>Lao Tzu, the sage of classical Taoism, noted that water \"greatly benefits all things, without conflict.\" He observed how it is fluid, soft and yielding, which as FAO's SOFA report notes does make it inherently rather difficult to manage. Paradoxically, he added, it will also wear away rock, overcoming whatever is hard.</p><p>We can and must learn and apply that skill to assure that it can continue to work its magic for the nearly 10 billion people who will live on our planet in 2050.</p><p>(The writer is Chief Economist, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Russia's brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. We issued the G7 Leaders' Statement on Ukraine, and with the clear intention and concrete actions set forth in it, we commit to intensifying our diplomatic, financial, humanitarian and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war efforts, and to continuing to counter the negative impacts of the war on the rest of the world, particularly on the most vulnerable people.</p><p>Disarmament and Non-proliferation</p><p>Together with the G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, we express our commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, through taking a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. We reaffirm the importance of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts to create a more stable and safer world. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We remain committed to the universalization, effective implementation, and strengthening of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, as well as the Chemical Weapons Convention. We welcome the steps taken to strengthen effective and responsible export controls on materials, technology, and research that could be used for military purposes in a way that keeps pace with rapid technological developments and recognize the central role of multilateral export control regimes in this regard.</p><p>Indo-Pacific</p><p>We reiterate the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, prosperous, secure, based on the rule of law, and that protects shared principles including sovereignty, territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes, and fundamental freedoms and human rights. Given the importance of the region, G7 members and our partners have taken respective Indo-Pacific initiatives to help strengthen our engagement. We underscore our commitment to strengthen coordination with regional partners, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its member states. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also reaffirm our partnership with Pacific Island countries and reiterate the importance of supporting their priorities and needs in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We welcome and further encourage efforts made by the private sector, universities and think tanks, which contribute to realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p><p>Global Economy, Finance and Sustainable Development</p><p>The global economy has shown resilience against multiple shocks including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and associated inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, we need to remain vigilant and stay agile and flexible in our macroeconomic policy amid heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook. In striving for strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, we are committed to a stability- and growth-oriented macroeconomic policy mix that supports medium-term fiscal sustainability and price stability. Inflation remains elevated and central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. Meanwhile, fiscal policy should continue to provide, as appropriate, temporary and targeted support to vulnerable groups suffering from the increase in cost of living and catalyze investment needed for the green and digital transformations while the overall fiscal stance should ensure medium-term sustainability. We also reaffirm our existing G7 exchange rate commitments. We reemphasize the importance of supply-side reforms, especially those that increase labor supply and enhance productivity. We also stress the crucial role of women and under-represented groups for the long-term success of our economies through promoting inclusion, diversity and innovation. We look forward to a successful review of the G20/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles of Corporate Governance to strengthen sustainability and resilience of the private sector. Recognizing that our economic and social structures have undergone dynamic and fundamental transformation, we underscore the multidimensional aspects of welfare and that these aspects should be brought into policymaking in a practical and effective manner. Such efforts will help preserve confidence in democracy and a market-based economy, which are the core values of the G7.</p><p>We will continue to closely monitor financial sector developments and stand ready to take appropriate actions to maintain financial stability and the resilience of the global financial system. We reaffirm that our financial system is resilient, supported by the financial regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis. We strongly support the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and standard-setting bodies on enhancing the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation. We will continue policy deliberation on digital money to harness the benefits of innovation such as payment efficiency as well as financial inclusion while addressing potential risks to the stability, resilience and integrity of the monetary and financial system. Effective monitoring, regulation and oversight are critical to addressing financial stability and integrity risks posed by crypto-asset activities and markets and to avoid regulatory arbitrage, while supporting responsible innovation.</p><p>We re-emphasize our strong political commitment towards the swift global implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy and to establish a more stable and fairer international tax system. We recognize significant progress in the negotiation of the Pillar 1 Multilateral Convention (MLC) and reaffirm our commitment to the swift completion of the negotiation so that the MLC can be ready for signature within the agreed timeline. We welcome the progresses in domestic legislation toward the implementation of Pillar 2. We will further provide developing countries with support for strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue sources, highlighting the importance of assistance for the implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution.</p><p>We recognize that achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030, reducing poverty, responding to global challenges including the climate crisis, and addressing debt vulnerabilities in low and middle-income countries are urgent, interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We are determined to do our part to mobilize the private and public resources needed to meet these challenges and support a just transition. Recognizing the importance of providing and protecting global public goods, we will support efforts to embed building resilience, sustainability and inclusiveness as integral elements in MDBs' efforts to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity. We will strive to enhance the development finance toolkit to mobilize additional financing from international financial institutions, bilateral partners, and the private sector to more effectively reduce poverty by better addressing vulnerabilities including climate change. We will work together and with partners to deliver this ambition and make concrete progress on this agenda at key moments over the coming year starting with the Summit organized in Paris on June 22-23 to revitalize global development financing, and continuing the momentum through the G20 Summit in New Delhi, the SDG Summit in New York, the 2023 World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meetings in Marrakech, the G20 Compact with Africa Conference in Berlin, and the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC-COP 28) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p>We are determined to take on a leading role in reversing the setback of progress towards the SDGs. Recognizing that 2023 is the halfway point to achieve the SDGs, we highlight the importance of the SDG Summit in September and will ambitiously contribute to a successful outcome. We reaffirm our commitment to revitalizing international cooperation and strengthen multilateralism. We will accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), and will do so in a comprehensive and gender-transformative manner including through locally-led development. We will also promote the concept of human security in the new era aiming to realize a society that leaves no one behind. We stress the critical role of development cooperation and international partnerships in addressing global challenges and the need to engage with international partners in solidarity. We also call for further domestic resource mobilization and efficient use of existing resources as well as mobilizing private financial assets to address financing gaps for sustainable development. We underscore the need for continued efforts to scale up official development assistance (ODA) and expand its catalytic use including through innovative financing mechanisms, recognizing the importance of respective commitments, such as the 0.7% ODA/GNI target that some countries adopted.</p><p>We remain concerned that serious challenges to debt sustainability are undermining the progress towards the SDGs and low-and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and wider global challenges. We reiterate the urgency of addressing debt vulnerabilities in these countries and fully support the G20's effort to improve the implementation of the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner, providing clarity to participants. We welcome the recent approval by the IMF board of a program for Ghana. Beyond the Common Framework, debt vulnerabilities in middle income countries (MICs) should be addressed by multilateral coordination. In this respect, we welcome the launch of the creditors' meeting for Sri Lanka under the three co-chairs, France, India, and Japan, and look forward to a swift resolution as a successful model for future multilateral efforts to address MICs' debt issues. We also stress the importance of private creditors providing debt treatments on terms at least as favorable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We welcome the development of Climate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDC) to enhance the safety net for borrowers facing the impacts of climate change. We welcome work by our finance ministers on this topic and encourage more creditors to offer CRDC for loan agreements. In order to enhance debt data accuracy and transparency, we invite all official bilateral creditors to join the data sharing exercise for debt data reconciliation, including through further advancing the G20's initiative in the area of debt data accuracy.</p><p>We encourage MDBs and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) to accelerate their efforts to increase their capacity to leverage private finance, including through implementing MDB reforms. In this regard, we strongly support and encourage to expedite the ongoing work on the evolution of the MDBs to review and transform their business models to better address transboundary challenges such as climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict, which are integral to achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity. This evolution should come with the most efficient use of their existing capital. To this end, we will contribute to developing an ambitious G20 Roadmap on implementing the recommendations of the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework Review and call on MDBs to make further progress in a comprehensive manner while safeguarding MDBs' long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. Building on key reforms to the WBG's mission and operational model along with financial reforms that can add up to $50 billion of financing capacity over the coming decade, we look forward to further progress at the WBG toward the 2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and beyond so that ambitious reforms can be made on a continual basis. We encourage other MDBs to join this initiative for a coordinated approach of MDBs as a system. We also call on MDBs to make the best use of policy and knowledge support, and explore strengthened approaches to promote mobilizing domestic resources and private capital as well as private sector engagement. We have further advanced our joint efforts to support countries most in need through the voluntary channeling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions. We welcome that additional pledges by Japan and France, amongst others, together with our previous contributions and commitments, put the global ambition of $100 billion within reach and call for the delivery of existing pledges and for further pledges from all willing and able countries to fulfill the ambition. We support the IMF achieving its agreed 2021 fundraising targets by the 2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and identifying all available options to put the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) which supports Low Income Countries (LICs), on a sustainable footing with a view to meeting the growing needs of LICs in the coming years. We will further explore viable options for enabling the voluntary channeling of SDRs through MDBs, while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets character and status of SDRs.</p><p>We stress the importance of narrowing the infrastructure investment gap in low and middle income partner countries, including by delivering financing for quality infrastructure, supporting efforts to advance policy reforms needed to attract investment, operationalizing country-led partnerships, and promoting upstream support including project preparation support. We reaffirm our shared commitment to the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and to working together and aiming to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027.We will continue strengthening global partnerships for public and private investments in sustainable, inclusive, resilient and quality infrastructure with partner countries. We will mobilize the private sector for accelerated action to this end. Our offer is fair and transparent and aims at accelerating global sustainable development with the focus on delivering impact at local level. We welcome the Factsheet on PGII that demonstrates how the G7 and partners have made concrete progress in fostering investments that will create lasting positive impacts and promote sustainable development. We reiterate our support to the G20 Compact with Africa as a key framework to enhance the business environment in Africa and call on reform-oriented partners to join and strengthen this initiative.</p><p>We shared our determination to promote transparent and fair development finance and work together to address the gap in implementing existing principles such as debt transparency and sustainability, fair appraisal, selection, and lending practices for quality infrastructure investment. In this regard, we call on all actors to adhere to international rules, standards and principles, including the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These rules, standards and principles also include measures to safeguard the integrity of infrastructure investments.</p><p>We note the importance of addressing development, humanitarian, peace and security issues together. We are determined to address the unprecedented number of humanitarian crises, focusing on women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. In this regard, we commit to providing over $21 billion in total to address the worsening humanitarian crises this year, including in response to urgent food crises. Bearing in mind that many countries are vulnerable to disasters, including Small Island Developing States, we will accelerate international disaster risk reduction cooperation in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the output of its midterm review conducted by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). We emphasize the importance of a disaster preparedness approach and investment in human capital, goods and infrastructure that contribute not only to 'risk transfer' but also to 'risk reduction,' resulting in the strengthening of anticipatory actions. We remain committed to holding ourselves accountable, in an open and transparent way, for the promises we have made. In this regard, we endorse the 2023 Hiroshima Progress Report, following up on the G7's development-related commitments on food security and nutrition as well as refugees and migration.</p><p>We emphasize the transformative power of cities worldwide as drivers for every aspect of sustainable development. We will continue our cooperation on sustainable urban development and task our relevant Ministers to consider the development of principles on carbon neutral, resilient and inclusive cities and on the digitalization in cities, and to accelerate the use of data and technologies for cities. This work will support exchanges with our global partners, whose cities face some of the most significant challenges relating to climate change.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>Our planet is facing unprecedented challenges from the triple global crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution as well as from the ongoing global energy crisis. We are steadfast in our commitment to the Paris agreement, keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C global temperature rise within reach through scaled up action in this critical decade, halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, and ensuring energy security, whilst leveraging synergies and recognizing the interdependent nature of these challenges. While Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine impacts energy markets and supply chains globally, our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 at the latest remains unchanged. We emphasize our strong concern, amplified by the latest finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), at the accelerating and intensifying impacts of climate change, and highlight the increased urgency to reduce global GHG emissions by around 43 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035, relative to the 2019 level, in light of its latest findings. We reiterate our commitment made in Elmau last year to rapidly implement domestic mitigation measures aimed at achieving our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets and to increase our ambition including, for example, by adopting or strengthening sectoral targets, by developing non-CO2 sub targets, and by adopting stringent implementation measures. Mindful of our leadership role, and noting that emissions have already peaked in all G7 countries, we recognize the critical role of all major economies in limiting increases in global temperature over this critical decade and in subsequent decades. In this context, we underscore that every major economy should have significantly enhanced the ambition of its NDC since the Paris Agreement; already peaked its GHG emissions or indicated that it will do so no later than 2025; and in particular, included economy-wide absolute reduction targets and that cover all GHGs in its NDC. Accordingly, we call on all Parties - especially major economies - whose 2030 NDC targets or long-term low GHG emission development Strategies (LTSs) are not yet aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and net zero by 2050 at the latest, to revisit and strengthen the 2030 NDC targets and publish or update their LTSs as soon as possible and well before UNFCCC-COP28, and to commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Furthermore, we call on all Parties to commit at UNFCCC-COP28 to peak global GHG emissions immediately and by no later than 2025. We reaffirm our commitment to the Global Methane Pledge and we will step up efforts to collectively reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. We commit to actively contributing to securing the most ambitious outcomes of the first global stocktake (GST) at UNFCCC-COP28, which should result in enhanced, immediate and ambitious actions across mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and support. We call on all Parties to submit their next round of NDCs and LTSs well ahead of UNFCCC-COP30 that are informed by the outcomes of the GST, reflecting economy-wide absolute reduction targets including all GHGs, sectors and categories. These should reflect significantly enhanced ambition aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and should also include their revisited and strengthened 2030 targets.</p><p>Noting the importance of increasing the pace and scale of action on climate change, biodiversity loss and clean energy transitions, we will globally advance and promote a green transformation, working together to realize transformation of our economies to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 at the latest. We will engage with developing and emerging countries to accelerate emission reduction, including by supporting their transitions to climate resilient, circular, and nature positive economies and net-zero GHG emissions through various and practical pathways taking into account national circumstances. To that end, we reaffirm our strong commitment to supporting developing countries' just energy transitions, which will be supported by coordinated actions, including through the PGII. We welcome progress achieved on JETPs with South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, and also continue our discussions with India and Senegal. We take note of initiatives that are intended to support clean energy transition in countries around the world, such as Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) initiative, the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), 2050 Pathways Platform, Net Zero World (NZW), and the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge and underscore the importance of actions taken through such initiatives being aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. We will take further action on supply-side measures and recognize the need for further decarbonization efforts on the demand-side such as promoting changes in infrastructure and material use and end-use technology adoption as well as promoting sustainable consumer choice. We also recognize the vital role of sub-national governments in collaboration with other stakeholders and partners to advance climate and energy actions based on local needs and environmental conditions. We reaffirm the important role of high integrity carbon markets and carbon pricing to foster cost-efficient reductions in emission levels, drive innovation and enable a transformation to net zero, through the optimal use of a range of policy levers to price carbon. We support appropriate policy mixes including carbon pricing, non-pricing mechanisms, and incentives that effectively reduce emissions, and note that these could vary reflecting country-specific circumstances. We strongly support the OECD Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA). We look forward to advancing the open, cooperative, and inclusive Climate Club, in collaboration with international partners, to advance industrial decarbonization. We encourage private entities to commit to GHG net-zero emissions throughout the value chain via credible net zero pledges and transparent implementation strategies. We also encourage and promote private entities' work to foster innovation contributing to the emission reduction of other entities through decarbonization solutions. We welcome the progress of the Industrial Decarbonization Agenda (IDA) that decided to start working on implementation of the new Global Data Collection Framework for steel production and product emissions. We reaffirm our commitment to a highly decarbonized road sector by 2030, and recognize the importance of reducing GHG emissions from the global fleet and the range of pathways to approach this goal in line with trajectories required for keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C within reach. We are committed to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the road sector by 2050. In this context, we highlight the various actions that each of us is taking to decarbonize our vehicle fleet, including such domestic policies that are designed to achieve 100 percent or the overwhelming penetration of sales of light duty vehicles (LDVs) as zero emission vehicles (ZEV) by 2035 and beyond; to achieve 100 percent electrified vehicles in new passenger car sales by 2035; to promote associated infrastructure and sustainable carbon-neutral fuels including sustainable bio- and synthetic fuels. We note the opportunities that these policies offer to contribute to a highly decarbonized road sector, including progressing towards a share of over 50 percent of zero emission LDVs sold globally by 2030. Considering the findings of the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s Energy Technology Perspective 2023, we also note the opportunity to collectively reduce by at least 50 percent CO2 emissions from G7 vehicle stock by 2035 or earlier relative to the level in 2000 as a halfway point to achieving net zero and to track the progress on a yearly basis. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global efforts to achieve GHG lifecycle zero emissions from international shipping by 2050 at the latest. We commit to support this target and introducing intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 for the revised International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG reduction strategy, in line with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels through a credible basket of measures. We commit to accelerate global efforts to achieve the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s goal of net-zero emissions in international aviation by 2050, including making an effort for promoting and introducing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), introducing new technologies and improving operations, also building on ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).</p><p>In the face of the increasing threats posed by climate change, supporting climate-vulnerable groups is essential for ensuring human security and achieving resilient and sustainable development. We will continue to scale up and enhance support to strengthen the resilience of climate-vulnerable groups through enhancing climate change adaptation and climate disaster risk reduction, response and recovery and early-warning systems including through the Global Shield against Climate Risks and other initiatives related to early warning systems and the adoption of climate-resilient debt clauses. We reaffirm our commitments to the developed country Parties' goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020 through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. We will work together with other developed country Parties in order to fully meet the goal in 2023. We welcome discussions on an ambitious and fit-for-purpose new collective quantified goal (NCQG) which contributes as a global effort, from a wide variety of sources, public and private, to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement, including making finance flows consistent with a pathway toward low GHG emissions and climate resilient development. Recognizing the critical role of the G7 and that developed country parties should take the lead in mobilizing climate finance, we underscore the need for all countries and stakeholders, who have the capabilities and are not yet among the current providers of international climate finance, to contribute to global efforts in this regard.</p><p>We are committed to accelerating our own efforts to making financial flows consistent with a pathway toward low GHG emissions and climate resilient development, in line with Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement. We stress the importance of mobilizing finance especially including private finance focusing on further implementation and development of clean technologies and activities. We underline our commitment to consistent, comparable and reliable disclosure of information on sustainability including climate. We support the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) finalizing the standards for general reporting on sustainability and for climate-related disclosures and working toward achieving globally interoperable sustainability disclosure frameworks. We also look forward to the ISSB's future work on disclosure on biodiversity and human capital, in line with its work plan consultation. We remain committed to supporting the implementation and monitoring of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. We highlight the need for corporates to implement their net-zero transitions in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement based on credible corporate climate transition plans. We also highlight that transition finance, in line with keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise within reach, avoiding carbon lock-ins and based on effective emissions reduction, has a significant role in advancing the decarbonization of the economy as a whole. We look forward to an ambitious and successful second replenishment for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and reaffirm the need for robust G7 pledges. We urge other countries to do the same and underscore the need to broaden the GCF's contributor base by encouraging all potential contributors. We continue to accelerate efforts to respond to the Glasgow Climate Pact that urges developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from the 2019 level by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled-up financial resources. We also urge MDBs to commit to ambitious adaptation finance targets, announcing revised and enhanced 2025 projections, and call on non-G7 countries to enhance provision and mobilization including private finance for adaptation. We stress the key role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in mobilizing finance and call on them to mainstream climate and environment issues in their policies, investments, operations and governance. We also urge MDBs to increase finance for global public goods including climate finance and support ambitious regulatory reforms in developing countries via policy-based finance in order to foster the transition to net zero and enable private sector investment. Furthermore, in order to promote the development of carbon markets while ensuring their environmental integrity, we endorse the 'Principles of High Integrity Carbon Markets' to facilitate their implementation in carbon credit markets. We emphasize our extreme concern at the scale of impacts that are already resulting in economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and being felt globally, particularly by the most vulnerable. Alarmed by the adverse effects of climate change globally, we will scale up action and support to avert, minimize and address loss and damage, especially for the most vulnerable countries. This will include implementing the UNFCCC-COP27/The 4th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA4) decision to establish new funding arrangements, including a fund, for developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in the context of article 8 of the Paris Agreement, and providing support identified in the 'G7 Inventory on Climate Disaster Risk Reduction, Response and Recovery'.</p><p>Environment</p><p>We commit to realizing the transformation of the economic and social system towards net-zero, circular, climate-resilient, pollution-free and nature-positive economies and to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, in an integrated manner, while ensuring sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development and enhancing the resilience of our economies. Highlighting that enhancing resource efficiency and circularity along value chains reduces primary resource use and contributes to achieving our climate and other environmental goals, we encourage stakeholders and in particular businesses to strengthen their action. Thus, we endorse the Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency Principles (CEREP). We will increase domestic and international environmentally-sound, sustainable and efficient recovery and recycling of critical minerals and raw materials and other applicable materials while increasing circularity along the supply chains. We reaffirm that management and governance of water-related ecosystems are essential for all life on earth. We are actively engaging in relevant international fora including following up on the UN Water Conference successfully held this year.</p><p>Building on the G7 Ocean Deal, we commit to act towards realizing clean, healthy and productive oceans. We reaffirm our commitment to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and will take further actions to address this phenomenon in all its dimensions, including supporting developing countries and strengthening policy coordination among our relevant agencies and task them to take stock of their progress on this issue by the end of this year. In particular, we encourage non-parties to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) to join for further global acceptance and effective implementation of the PSMA. We welcome the conclusion of the negotiations for an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) and call for its rapid entry into force and implementation. We will continue to actively engage in the development of a regulatory framework on deep seabed mineral exploitation under the International Seabed Authority (ISA) that ensures effective protection for the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from such activities, as required under the UNCLOS. We are committed to end plastic pollution, with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040. With this in mind, we are determined to continue and step up our actions based on the comprehensive life cycle approach. We support the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) process, look forward to the next round of negotiation in Paris with a view to completing its work with an international legally binding instrument covering the whole life cycle of plastics by the end of 2024 and call for ambitious outcomes. We will make as much progress as possible on these issues and on the broader agenda of ocean protection by the UN Ocean Conference in 2025.</p><p>We welcome the adoption of the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, which is fundamental to human well-being, a healthy planet and economic prosperity, and commit to its swift and full implementation and to achievement of each of its goals and targets. In this regard, G7 members that are parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) commit to revise, update and submit our National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) aligned with the GBF and its goals and targets, or to communicate national targets reflecting as applicable all the goals and targets of the GBF in 2023 or sufficiently in advance of CBD-COP16. We will identify incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity by 2025, and redirect or eliminate them while scaling up positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity by 2030 at the latest, taking initial steps without delay. We call on all signatories to swiftly implement their commitments under the GBF and stand ready to provide support to developing countries. We reiterate our commitment to substantially increase our national and international funding for nature by 2025. We will ensure that our international development assistance aligns with the GBF. We call on the MDBs to increase support for biodiversity including through leveraging financial resources from all sources and deploying a full suite of instruments. To implement the GBF, we commit to substantially and progressively increasing the level of financial resources from all sources, and to align all relevant fiscal and financial flows with the GBF and call on others to do the same. We commit to supporting the establishment of the GBF Fund within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its successful launch at the GEF Assembly in Vancouver in August 2023, noting the importance of financial contributions from all sources to capitalize the new fund. We reaffirm our commitment to enhance synergies between finance for climate and biodiversity, including increased funding for Nature-based Solutions. We also commit to supporting and advancing a transition to nature positive economies, including through sharing knowledge and creating information networks among the G7 such as the G7 Alliance on Nature Positive Economy. We call on businesses to progressively reduce negative and increase positive impacts on biodiversity. We look forward to the publication of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures' (TNFD's) market framework and urge market participants, governments and regulators to support its development. We stress our commitment to achieving the target of effectively conserving and managing at least 30 percent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and at least 30 percent of marine and coastal areas by 2030 (30 by 30), nationally and globally, according to national circumstances and approaches through promoting the designation and management of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). We commit to conserving and protecting global marine biological diversity and sustainably using its resources based on the best available scientific evidence. In this context, we reconfirm our commitment under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to adopt, as a matter of urgency, proposals to designate Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Eastern Antarctica, the Weddell Sea and the Western Antarctic Peninsula, based on the best available scientific evidence. In this regard, we will support other countries by sharing best practices for protected areas and OECMs to achieve the GBF target of 30 by 30. We will enhance international cooperation on measures against invasive alien species. We reiterate our commitment to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030, and are committed to conserving forests and other terrestrial ecosystems and accelerating their restoration, supporting sustainable value and supply chains as well as promoting sustainable forest management and use of wood. We will work together, with high ambition to deliver integrated solutions to support the protection, conservation and restoration of high-carbon, high-biodiversity ecosystems, including by coordinating our offers through Country Packages on Forests, Nature and Climate, especially in countries which host vital reserves of carbon and biodiversity, with an initial focus on forests. We commit to continuing our efforts to reduce risk of deforestation and forest and land degradation linked to the production of relevant commodities and enhance cooperation with various stakeholders on this issue. We will, if appropriate, develop further regulatory frameworks or policies to support this.</p><p>Energy</p><p>We commit to holistically addressing energy security, the climate crisis, and geopolitical risks. In order to address the current energy crisis caused by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and achieve our common goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, we highlight the real and urgent need and opportunity to accelerate clean energy transitions also as a means of increasing energy security at the same time. While acknowledging various pathways according to each country's energy situation, industrial and social structures and geographical conditions, we highlight that these should lead to our common goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest in order to keep a limit of 1.5 \u00b0C within reach. In this regard, we invite the IEA to make recommendations by the end of this year on options how to diversify the supplies of energy and critical minerals as well as clean energy manufacturing. Through this, together with our partners, we seek to holistically address energy security, climate crisis, and geopolitical risk including the expansion of global use of renewable energy in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and keep a limit of 1.5 \u00b0C temperature rise within reach. Through our experience in coping with past and current energy crises, we highlight the importance of enhanced energy efficiency and savings as the 'first fuel,' and of developing demand side energy policies. We also need to significantly accelerate the deployment of renewable energies and the development and deployment of next-generation technologies. The G7 contributes to expanding renewable energy globally and bringing down costs by strengthening capacity including through a collective increase in offshore wind capacity of 150GW by 2030 based on each country's existing targets and a collective increase of solar PV to more than 1TW by 2030 estimated by the IEA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) through means such as each country's existing targets or policy measures. We recognize that low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia should be developed and used, if this can be aligned with a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway, where they are impactful as effective emission reduction tools to advance decarbonization across sectors and industries, notably in hard-to-abate sectors in industry and transportation, while avoiding N2O as a GHG and NOx as air pollutant. We also note that some countries are exploring the use of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives in the power sector to work towards zero-emission thermal power generation if this can be aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and our collective goal for a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035. We will enhance our efforts to develop the rule-based, transparent global market and supply chains for low carbon and renewable hydrogen based on reliable international standards and certification schemes adhering to environmental and social standards. We affirm the importance of developing international standards and certification including for a GHG calculation methodology for hydrogen production and mutual recognition mechanism for carbon intensity-based tradability, transparency, trustworthiness and sustainability. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035, and prioritizing concrete and timely steps towards the goal of accelerating the phase-out of domestic unabated coal power generation in a manner consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise within reach and urge others to join us. We will work towards ending the construction of new unabated coal fired power generation as identified in the IEA's Coal in Net Zero Transitions report in 2022 as one of the primary actions to be taken in line with the IEA net zero by 2050 scenario. We call on and will work with other countries to end new unabated coal-fired power generation projects globally as soon as possible to accelerate the clean energy transition in a just manner. We highlight that we ended new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation in 2021. We call on other countries, especially major economies to join us in fulfilling their commitments to do the same. We acknowledge that Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)/carbon recycling technologies can be an important part of a broad portfolio of decarbonization solutions to reduce emissions from industrial sources that cannot be avoided otherwise and that the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) processes with robust social and environmental safeguard, have an essential role to play in counterbalancing residual emissions from sectors that are unlikely to achieve full decarbonization.</p><p>We underline our commitment, in the context of a global effort, to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels so as to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest in line with the trajectories required to limit global average temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels, and call on others to join us in taking the same action. We reaffirm our commitment to the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 or sooner, and reaffirm our previous calls for all countries to do so. In view of the emerging need for net-zero and circular industrial supply chains in the transformation towards a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, we recognize the opportunities associated with decarbonized, sustainably and responsibly produced non-combustion feedstocks, and are committed to supporting our workers and communities in this transformation. We also highlight that we ended new direct public support for the international unabated fossil-fuel energy sector in 2022, except in limited circumstances clearly defined by each country consistent with a 1.5 \u00b0C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement, recognizing the importance of national security and geostrategic interests. It is necessary to accelerate the phase out of our dependency on Russian energy, including through energy savings and gas demand reduction, in a manner consistent with our Paris commitments, and address the global impact of Russia's war on energy supplies, gas prices and inflation, and people's lives, recognizing the primary need to accelerate the clean energy transition. In this context, we stress the important role that increased deliveries of LNG can play, and acknowledge that investment in the sector can be appropriate in response to the current crisis and to address potential gas market shortfalls provoked by the crisis. In the exceptional circumstance of accelerating the phase out of our dependency on Russian energy, publicly supported investment in the gas sector can be appropriate as a temporary response, subject to clearly defined national circumstances, if implemented in a manner consistent with our climate objectives without creating lock-in effects, for example by ensuring that projects are integrated into national strategies for the development of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen. We will further utilize neutral and impartial statistical data made available by international organizations such as the IEA and strengthen their data-collection and analysis functions, with a view to stabilizing energy markets. We emphasize the importance of strengthening forums for communication and cooperation between producing and consuming countries with a view to stabilizing energy markets and mobilizing necessary investment consistent with climate goals. Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy recognize its potential to provide affordable low-carbon energy that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, to address the climate crisis and to ensure global energy security as a source of baseload energy and grid flexibility. They commit to maximizing the use of existing reactors safely, securely, and efficiently, including by advancing their safe long-term operation, in addressing the current energy crisis. They also commit, domestically as well as in partner countries, to supporting the development and construction of nuclear reactors, such as small modular and other advanced reactors with advanced safety systems, building robust and resilient nuclear supply chains including nuclear fuel, and maintaining and strengthening nuclear technology and human resources. They will work with like-minded partners to reduce dependence on Russia. The G7 underlines that the highest standards of nuclear safety and security are important to all countries and their respective publics. We welcome the steady progress of decommissioning work at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO)'s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, and Japan's transparent efforts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based on scientific evidence. We support the IAEA's independent review to ensure that the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water will be conducted consistent with IAEA safety standards and international law and that it will not cause any harm to humans and the environment, which is essential for the decommissioning of the site and the reconstruction of Fukushima.</p><p>Clean Energy Economy</p><p>Emphasizing that the global climate and energy crisis highlights the urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition towards achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and to transform our energy systems, we underline the necessity of economic diversification and transformation, including in supply chains. In order to further promote clean energy transitions on a global scale, we are determined to increase our efforts and, in particular, will pursue secure, resilient, affordable, and sustainable clean energy supply chains, including those for critical minerals and clean energy technologies. In implementing energy transitions, we also reaffirm the importance of working collectively to avoid market distortions and ensuring a global level playing field. We will continue to work with international partners to realize a clean energy economy through concrete actions as laid out in the Clean Energy Economy Action Plan.</p><p>Economic Resilience and Economic Security</p><p>Ensuring economic resilience and economic security globally remains our best protection against the weaponization of economic vulnerabilities. Recalling our commitment from the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we will advance economic policies that enhance global economic resilience and economic security to protect against systemic vulnerabilities. To this end, we will engage in dialogue and follow a cooperative approach within the G7 as well as with partners beyond the G7 and globally, including in collaboration with developing countries. In so doing, we will promote international rules and norms in order to facilitate trade and promote economic resilience, based on the rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. Our efforts will include taking action to make our supply chains and those of our partners around the world more resilient, sustainable and reliable, as well as appropriate measures to promote prosperity for all. We will also promote trust and security in critical infrastructure. We will enhance ongoing collaboration to address non-market policies and practices that exacerbate strategic dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities, harm our workers and businesses, and can undermine international rules and norms. Building on our resolve in Elmau to increase vigilanceand enhance our cooperation to address risks that undermine global security and stability, we will enhance collaboration by launching the Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion to increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion, and further promote cooperation with partners beyond the G7. We will deepen our strategic dialogue against malicious practices to protect global supply chains from illegitimate influence, espionage, illicit knowledge leakage, and sabotage in the digital sphere. We affirm our shared responsibility and determination to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. In this context, we hereby adopt the G7 Leaders' Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security.</p><p>We reaffirm the growing importance of critical minerals in various fields, especially for the global clean energy transition, and the need to manage economic and security risks caused by vulnerable supply chains. We support open, fair, transparent, secure, diverse, sustainable, traceable, rules- and market-based trade in critical minerals, oppose market-distorting practices and monopolistic policies on critical minerals, and reaffirm the need to build resilient, robust, responsible, and transparent critical mineral supply chains. We are committed to strengthening our preparedness and resilience against emergencies such as market disruptions, and considering ways to jointly address any such disruptions, including through the support of the IEA's 'Voluntary Critical Mineral Security Program.' We welcome joint progress in efforts to diversify supply chains, including the refining and processing of critical minerals, such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). We will support local value creation in critical minerals supply chains in line with the WTO rules. We will promote domestic and international recycling of critical minerals in collaboration with developing countries. We affirm that strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards will ensure benefits to local communities, including people living in the vicinity of areas with mineral reserves and refining and processing plants, protect workers' rights, and promote transparency, while giving due consideration to upstream and midstream environments. In order to further promote the clean energy transition we reiterate the need to establish sustainable an resilient supply chains for critical mineral resources and products manufactured using such resources. We welcome the 'Five-Point Plan for Critical Mineral Security' adopted by G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers and instruct them to implement the plan.</p><p>Trade</p><p>We stand united in our commitment to free and fair trade as foundational principles and objectives of the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, which proves more important than ever in the current geopolitical environment. We confirm that honoring these foundational principles is essential to creating resilient global supply chains that are transparent, diversified, secure, sustainable, trustworthy, and reliable, and that are fair for all and responsive to the needs of global citizens. We affirm our attachment to transparency, coordination and to the respect of WTO rules in our respective policies. This global trading system must be inclusive and ensure that the prosperity it can bring is felt by all, including those that have been traditionally underrepresented. To this end, we will continue to work with non-G7 partners, in particular developing country partners, which are integral partners in supply chains and in the global trading system. Based on the outcome of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12) and looking ahead to achieving a successful MC13, we underscore the importance of working towards WTO reform, including by conducting discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all Members by 2024 and by reinforcing deliberation to respond to global trade policy challenges. In addition, we call on all WTO members to work together to secure the prompt entry into force of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, to engage constructively on recommendations for additional provisions that would achieve a comprehensive agreement on fisheries subsidies, and the plurilateral initiatives including the joint statement initiatives (JSIs), and to make permanent the Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions. We are committed to accelerating the WTO JSI E-Commerce negotiations and working to conclude an ambitious outcome by the end of 2023. The outcome should be high standard and commercially meaningful. Free and fair trade flows, consistent with our commitment to our multilateral trading system, play an important role in the green and just transition. We will continue our collaboration at the WTO including to facilitate and promote trade in environmental goods and services, and technologies. We reaffirm our shared concerns with non-market policies and practices, including their problematic evolution, that distort global competition, trade and investment. We will further step up our efforts to secure a level playing field through the more effective use of existing tools, as well as development of appropriate new tools and stronger international rules and norms. We will seek to ensure that our responses to unfair trading practices will not create unnecessary barriers to our partners' industries and are consistent with our WTO commitments. We reaffirm that export controls are a fundamental policy tool to address the challenges posed by the diversion of technology critical to military applications as well as for other activities that threaten global, regional, and national security. We affirm the importance of cooperation on export controls on critical and emerging technologies such as microelectronics and cyber surveillance systems to address the misuse of such technologies by malicious actors and inappropriate transfers of such technologies through research activities. We task our Trade Ministers to deepen these discussions towards the G7 Trade Ministers' Meeting in October, and to explore, both within and beyond the G7, coordinated or joint actions where appropriate against trade-related challenges, including economic coercion.</p><p>Food Security</p><p>We remain deeply concerned with the ongoing and worsening global food security and nutrition situation, with the world facing highest risk of famine in a generation. Multiple factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring energy prices, the climate crisis and shocks, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water security and armed conflicts have contributed to the global disruption and disorder in food systems and supply chains and the deterioration in global food security in recent years. In particular, Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine has drastically aggravated the global food security crisis. We are committed to continuing our efforts to address pressing issues to improve global food security including through initiatives already launched by the G7 and relevant international organizations, building on the positive outcomes achieved. Stressing that we have exceeded our joint commitment of $14 billion to the global food security announced at the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we will continue to provide assistance in the food and nutrition related sectors to vulnerable countries and regions affected by the current food security crisis, in particular in Africa and the Middle East. Given the scale of the needs across the Horn of Africa, we have collectively met our commitment from Elmau and have effectively delivered assistance to tackle one of the worst droughts in the region's history. We also call on other international donors to step up their contributions in this regard. We further call on Russia to lift its measures that hinder the exports of Russian grain and fertilizers. Given Ukraine's essential role as a major exporter of food to the world, we are seriously concerned about the current and future impact of Russia's deliberate disruption of Ukraine's agricultural sector on food security in the most vulnerable countries. Building on our commitment made at Elmau, we continue to provide support for the restoration of Ukraine's agriculture sector, including support to its efforts in identifying and evidencing illegal seizure of Ukrainian grains by Russia, through the creation of a grain database which can be used to verify the origin of grain shipments. We reaffirm the importance of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes and President Zelenskyy's Grain from Ukraine Initiative. We reiterate the critical importance of continued and scaled-up implementation of the UN and Trkiye-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) in order to further facilitate grain exports from Ukraine and enable stable supply to those in need. We call on Russia to stop threatening global food supplies and to allow the BSGI to operate at its maximum potential and for as long as necessary. We reiterate the importance of ensuring rules-based, open, fair, transparent, predictable, and non-discriminatory trade and avoiding unjustified restrictive trade measures to keep the food and agricultural markets open and call on our G20 partners to do the same. We welcome the Ministerial Decision on World Food Programme (WFP) Food Purchases Exemption from Export Prohibitions or Restrictions adopted at the MC12 and call for its full implementation. We call for more concrete actions to address export restrictions imposed by agricultural producer countries on global food security, recognizing that such measures have a disproportionate effect on countries at greater risk of famine and acute food insecurity. We emphasize the necessity of market transparency and accurate information backed by neutral and impartial data and analysis to prevent arbitrary measures and reduce market volatility in addressing ongoing and future food crises, and commit to strengthening the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as well as various efforts by international organizations in this regard. We underscore the importance of strengthening the capacity of low and lower-middle income countries to collect, analyze and use high quality agricultural, market and food security data and maintain the quality of data. We also recognize the value of dialogue between food exporting countries and importing countries to develop a shared understanding on crisis responses.</p><p>We share the view that it is essential to focus on each human and enable stable access to affordable, safe, sufficient and nutritious food for each and every individual. In our pursuit to ensure that all people can progressively realize their right to adequate food, we affirm the need to protect and assist members of the most vulnerable populations, including women and children, in all aspects of food security from short-term food crisis responses through medium to long-term efforts to make food systems sustainable. Nutrition is also fundamental from the viewpoint of a human centered approach, and we highlight the importance of improving access to healthy diets, including through school meal programs. We recognize the urgent need of establishing inclusive, resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems including through enhancing, diversifying and ensuring sustainability of local, regional and global food supply chains as well as through solving structural bottlenecks. This includes increasing local production capacities by making use of existing domestic agricultural resources and by facilitating trade, sustainable productivity growth with climate adaptation and mitigation and biodiversity conservation, and sustainable food consumption. We promote a wide range of innovations and technology which is suitable for local, environmental and farming conditions and benefits all stakeholders including smallholder farmers. We also underscore the role of the private sector, including small and medium enterprises and startups, in research and development (R and D) as well as responsible investment. We recognize the need to maintain the availability, affordability and accessibility of fertilizers, to diversify the production to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions, and to promote more efficient and responsible use of fertilizers and soil health, including through the use of appropriate and safe fertilizers, for stable and sustainable agricultural production. We acknowledge the importance of supporting fertilizer value chains including local fertilizer production in line with WTO rules and through supporting the use of local sources of energy in consistency with a 1.5\u00b0C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement. We strengthen broader partnerships on those efforts including through the UN Food Systems Stocktaking Moments. We commit to taking concrete steps with partner countries as outlined in the annexed 'Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global Food Security', and call for broader cooperation in the international community.</p><p>Health</p><p>We renew our strong commitment to developing and strengthening the global health architecture (GHA) with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core for future public health emergencies to break the cycle of panic and neglect, recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented impact on the international community. To this end, we commit to further enhancing political momentum toward more coordinated and sustained leader-level governance for health emergency prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) that ensures legitimacy, representation, equity, and effectiveness, noting the ongoing discussions including on a new instrument on pandemic PPR (WHO CA+), targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting (HLM) on pandemic PPR in September 2023 and the need to avoid duplication and ensure coherence between these processes, stressing the leading role of WHO. We also applaud the landmark decision at the 75th WHA to work towards increasing the share of assessed contributions to 50 percent of WHO's 2022-2023 base budget, and which takes into account the importance of monitoring of budgetary proposals as well as progress on reforms, with a view to sustainably finance the organisation to fulfil its leading and coordinating role in global health. We also reaffirm our commitment to strengthening collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR including through the ongoing and essential work of the G20 Joint Finance and Health Task Force (JFHTF). We welcome the launch of the Pandemic Fund (PF), look forward to the successful execution of its first call for proposals, and encourage active participation and increasing contributions to the PF from a broader donor base. We also commit to working together, including by sharing work plans and tracking, encouraging efforts and progress in priority countries to achieve the G7's target of supporting at least 100 Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) in implementing the core capacities required in the IHR, for another 5 years until 2027 as committed in 2022. We also highlight the need for strengthening financing for pandemic response. To this end, we commit to thoroughly assess how existing financing sources can be used in pandemic response and to explore a surge financing framework that allows us to complement existing mechanisms through better coordination and deploy necessary funds quickly and efficiently in response to outbreaks without accumulating idle cash. In this respect, we welcome the G7 Shared Understanding on Finance-Health Coordination and PPR Financing endorsed by the G7 Finance and Health Ministers at their joint session. Reaffirming that strengthening international norms and regulations is essential to enhance pandemic PPR, guided by equity, we reiterate our commitment to contributing to and sustaining momentum on the negotiations of WHO CA+ with a view to adopting it by May 2024 and on the negotiations of targeted amendments to strengthen the IHR, together with all stakeholders. Furthermore, we reiterate the importance of timely, transparent and systematic sharing of pathogens, data and information in a safe and secure manner, ensuring the respect of relevant data protection rules, for multisectoral and integrated surveillance of emerging and ongoing health threats both in ordinary times and in emergencies, in line with the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness. We also recognize the importance of strengthening and maintaining sufficient and high-quality human resources for health worldwide at all times, such as the public health and emergency workforce including consideration of Global Health Emergency Corps. We will support the further enhancement of a global network of experts and trainings, including through initiatives such as the WHO Academy, promote decent work with equal payment for work of equal value and protect health workers during emergencies and conflicts among others. We recognize the integral role civil society plays, including by reaching those in vulnerable situations, and recommit to working together for a healthier future for all.</p><p>We commit to reverse the first global decline in life expectancy in more than seven decades emphasizing the importance of achieving UHC by 2030 and accelerating progress toward SDG 3. We recommit to working alongside global partners to assist countries to achieve UHC by supporting primary health care (PHC) and developing and restoring essential health services, to achieve better than pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2025, as part of our effort to strengthen health systems in ordinary times. We commit to supporting countries to strengthen PHC delivery, including through health workforce strengthening We also commit to support bringing survival rates back to better than pre-pandemic levels, including by reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality, and consistent with the full range of SDG targets and indicators related to UHC on which we will also support progress. We recognize the importance of financial risk protection to prevent people from slipping into poverty due to health care costs. To this end, we endorse the 'G7 Global Plan for UHC Action Agenda' and note the importance of a global hub function, in support of relevant international organizations, including for financing, knowledge management, and human resources on UHC. We reaffirm the essential role of UHC in addressing various health challenges significantly set back by the pandemic, including in humanitarian contexts, such as tackling communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, polio, measles, cholera, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including mental health conditions, realizing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all, and promoting routine immunization, healthy ageing, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We are committed to spearheading research in this regard, including with a focus on understanding post COVID-19 conditions. We noted the historic outcome of the Global Fund's 7th replenishment and welcome the financial support from the G7 and further countries towards ending the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We call for continued support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to stay on track for polio eradication by 2026. We will build on the success of the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit in 2021 for the Paris N4G in 2024 to improve nutrition. We also commit to further promoting comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all individuals, including maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, especially in vulnerable circumstances. Recognizing the increasing need for overarching, system-level coordination and alignment of global health partnerships including the Global Health Initiatives and their interface, we will take collective actions to avoid fragmentation and duplication, ensure accountability, maximize impacts, and reinforce country leadership with a view to enhancing governance in global health and to supporting the achievement of UHC. In this regard, we look forward to the outcome of the Future of Global Health Initiatives. We reiterate our determination to further contribute to achieving UHC, including through making the most of and ensuring synergies among the upcoming UNGA HLMs on UHC, tuberculosis, and pandemic PPR. In order to contribute to global health towards the post COVID-19 era, with a view to supporting the achievement of UHC as well as strengthening PPR, we highlight our financial contributions totaling more than $48 billion from the public and private sectors. We also call for further domestic resource mobilization as well as efficient use of existing resources. We emphasize the important role of the private sector towards sustainable financing in global health, including through impact investments and endorse the Triple I (Impact Investments Initiative) for Global Health.</p><p>We reaffirm that innovative initiatives including those related to digital health are keys to strengthening GHA and achieving UHC. We will reiterate the urgent need to foster innovation and to strengthen research and development of safe, effective, quality-assured and affordable medical countermeasures (MCMs) as underlined by the 100 Days Mission. We commit to enhancing equitable access to MCM, including by addressing issues relating to manufacturing and delivery. In this regards, we will continue to contribute to ongoing processes, including in the G20, on an end-to-end MCM ecosystem, aligned with the ongoing discussions on the WHO CA+ and which should actively contribute to the diversification of MCM production and address the priority of the most vulnerable partner's needs and expectations, including in terms of global governance, in cooperation with relevant partners including the WHO, the WB, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Global Fund, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and Unitaid and Medicines Patent Pool, regional organizations and the private sector. To this end, we announce the G7 Hiroshima Vision for Equitable Access to MCMs and launch the MCM Delivery Partnership for equitable access (MCDP) to contribute to more equitable access to and delivery of MCMs based on the principles of equity, inclusivity, efficiency, affordability, quality, accountability, agility and speed. We commit to work across providers of development finance, for the purpose of identifying concrete options this summer for providing for the liquidity for global health organizations to procure and deliver MCMs earlier in a crisis. This supports the mapping exercise for surge financing to be conducted by the WHO and World Bank and presented at the G20 Finance and Health Task Force and the UNGA HLM, contributing to ongoing negotiations on the WHO CA+. We also reiterate our commitment to addressing global health threats including those exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution through integrated measures and by applying a holistic One Health approach. Recognizing the rapid escalation of AMR globally, we continue to commit to exploring and implementing push and pull incentives to accelerate R and D of antimicrobials as well as promoting antimicrobial access and stewardship for their prudent and appropriate use toward the UNGA HLM on AMR in 2024. We remain committed to promoting policies and resources to care for people living with dementia and welcome the development of potentially disease modifying therapies for the various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Labor</p><p>We emphasize the importance of investment in human capital to ensure a just transition, in response to structural changes such as digital and green transformations as well as demographic changes including societies that are ageing, in part due to declining birth rates. In order to facilitate these transformations, we commit to supporting individuals through reskilling and upskilling measures, along with a combination of appropriate social protection and active labor market policies. As reskilling and upskilling to support workers to adapt to these changes are investments in human capital and should not be seen as a cost, we must continue to provide adequate investment necessary to address workforce transition needs including vocational training and life-long learning. We commit to efforts towards achieving a virtuous cycle of workers' well-being and social and economic vitality, which will lead to sustainable growth and real wage growth in line with productivity, contributing in turn to further investment in human capital. We emphasize that freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining play an important role in promoting decent work and wage growth. We are resolved to build an inclusive labor market that ensures decent and good quality jobs for all and leaves no one behind, especially, women and under-represented groups, including persons with disabilities, older persons and youth, while engaging constructively with social partners and other stakeholders. We also work towards quality job creation, universal access to social protection, and further improving gender equality in the labor market. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women and girls, and has highlighted the unequal distribution of care work as a key cause of gender inequalities, while showing the essential role paid and unpaid care work plays in the functioning of our societies and economies. We commit to addressing underlying discriminatory social and gender norms, such as unequal sharing of paid and unpaid care-work and housework, promoting and protecting social security including parental leave, providing support for childcare and other field of care work and care economy, including by facilitating access to infrastructures and long-term care. In particular, we reaffirm the need to support and promote parenthood protection to ensure parents can combine work and family and personal life and actively contribute to all spheres of our society. We also highlight the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute unpaid care, reward care workers fairly, while generating sufficient care jobs to meet the demand for care, and give care workers representation in social dialogue and collective bargaining. We recognize the importance of enhancing work engagement and worker retention through various measures such as promoting health and well-being at work, ensuring occupational safety and health, and supporting the inclusive and equitable career development of workers. We commit to promoting decent work in line with SDG 8, including through technical cooperation, as well as ensuring respect for international labor standards and human rights in global value chains, in particular the fundamental conventions adopted by the International Labor Organisation (ILO). We reiterate our commitment to the effective abolition of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and child labor. We reaffirm our commitment to taking measures to strengthen our cooperation and collective efforts towards eradicating all forms of forced labor from global supply chains. We commit to continuing to promote decent work and protect rights-holders in global supply chains through a smart mix of mandatory and voluntary measures, including through legislation, regulations, incentives and guidance for enterprises and to engage constructively in discussions at the UN and the ILO in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders to explore ideas and options for a consensus-based legally binding instrument at the international level that adds value to the existing legal and policy approaches and is implementable. We endorse the Action Plan for Promoting Career Development and Greater Resilience to Structural Changes developed by Labor and Employment Ministers.</p><p>Education</p><p>We commit to making progress for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, including vocational education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all to build resilient, just and prospering societies. Recent crises have led to decreased access to education and increased learning loss amongst children and youth, especially girls, and those in the most marginalized and vulnerable situations. As education is a catalyst to achieving all of the SDGs, we reaffirm the importance of upholding education and building more resilient education systems, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. We reiterate our firm determination to uphold the G7's previous commitments to protecting educational opportunities for all learners, and to promoting gender equality as well as the empowerment of all women and girls in all their diversity, in and through education including by prioritizing global ODA in this regard. We welcome the UNSG's Transforming Education Summit (TES) in September 2022, and call for continued support to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), Education Cannot Wait (ECW) and UN agencies including the UNESCO and UNICEF as key partners in helping countries to build stronger education systems for the most marginalized children. We also reiterate the importance of foundational learning and the need for the G7 to increase investment in people in a more equitable and efficient way to provide quality learning opportunities that prepare all learners, especially children with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive and improve their own well-being, noting that education is a human right. We continue to break down gender-related barriers and underlying discriminatory social norms from pre-primary through higher education for more resilient, inclusive and gender-transformative education. We continue to encourage international exchanges between youth and international talent mobility and circulation among academics, students, and researchers, as well as cooperation between higher education and research institutions. We acknowledge the importance of investment in support of human resources that can contribute to resolving social issues while simultaneously achieving economic growth through education. We will strive for an educational environment and lifelong learning opportunities where every child can fulfil their own potential, including through the improvement of instruction. This could include promoting small class size, an improved Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environment and the effective use of digital technology to support teaching and learning, while not exacerbating the digital equality gaps.</p><p>Digital</p><p>We recognize that, while rapid technological change has been strengthening societies and economies, the international governance of new digital technologies has not necessarily kept pace. As the pace of technological evolution accelerates, we affirm the importance to address common governance challenges and to identify potential gaps and fragmentation in global technology governance. In areas such as AI, immersive technologies such as the metaverses and quantum information science and technology and other emerging technologies, the governance of the digital economy should continue to be updated in line with our shared democratic values. These include fairness, accountability, transparency, safety, protection from online harassment, hate and abuse and respect for privacy and human rights, fundamental freedoms and the protection of personal data. We will work with technology companies and other relevant stakeholders to drive the responsible innovation and implementation of technologies, ensuring that safety and security is prioritized, and that platforms are tackling the threats of child sexual exploitation and abuse on their platforms, and upholding the children's rights to safety and privacy online. We continue to discuss ways to advance technology for democracy and to cooperate on new and emerging technologies and their social implementation, and look forward to an inclusive, multi-stakeholder dialogue on digital issues, including on Internet Governance, through relevant fora, including the OECD Global Forum on Technology. We commit to further advancing multi-stakeholder approaches to the development of standards for AI, respectful of legally binding frameworks, and recognize the importance of procedures that advance transparency, openness, fair processes, impartiality, privacy and inclusiveness to promote responsible AI. We stress the importance of international discussions on AI governance and interoperability between AI governance frameworks, while we recognize that approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members. We support the development of tools for trustworthy AI through multi-stakeholder international organizations, and encourage the development and adoption of international technical standards in standards development organizations through multi-stakeholder processes. We recognize the need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI, which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors, and encourage international organizations such as the OECD to consider analysis on the impact of policy developments and Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) to conduct practical projects. In this respect, we task relevant ministers to establish the Hiroshima AI process, through a G7 working group, in an inclusive manner and in cooperation with the OECD and GPAI, for discussions on generative AI by the end of this year. These discussions could include topics such as governance, safeguard of intellectual property rights including copy rights, promotion of transparency, response to foreign information manipulation, including disinformation, and responsible utilization of these technologies. We welcome the Action Plan for promoting global interoperability between tools for trustworthy AI from the Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting. We recognize the potential of immersive technologies, and virtual worlds, such as metaverses to provide innovative opportunities, in all industrial and societal sectors, as well as to promote sustainability. For this purpose, governance, public safety, and human rights challenges should be addressed at the global level. We task our relevant Ministers to consider collective approaches in this area, including in terms of interoperability, portability and standards, with the support of the OECD. We express our interest in possible joint cooperation in research and development on computing technologies. We also task our relevant Ministers to consider ways to further promote digital trade.</p><p>We reaffirm that cross-border data flows, information, ideas and knowledge generate higher productivity, greater innovation, and improved sustainable development, while raising challenges related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property protection, and security including that of data and cloud infrastructure. We reiterate the importance of facilitating Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) to enable trustworthy cross-border data flows and invigorate the digital economy as a whole, while preserving governments' ability to address legitimate public interest. We stress our intention to operationalize this concept and our support for cooperation within the G7 and beyond to work towards identifying commonalities, complementarities and elements of convergence between existing regulatory approaches and instruments enabling data to flow with trust, in order to foster future interoperability such as through supporting multi-stakeholder engagement, leveraging the role of technologies, and clarifying domestic and municipal policies and due processes. In this regard, we endorse the Annex on G7 Vision for Operationalising DFFT and its Priorities from the Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting, and the establishment of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership. We task our relevant Ministers to continue working to deliver substantive outcomes and subsequently report back to us. We welcome the OECD Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities as an instrument to increase trust in cross-border data flows among countries committed to democratic values and the rule of law. We emphasize our opposition to internet fragmentation and the use of digital technologies to infringe on human rights. In this context, we should counter unjustified obstacles to the free flow of data, lacking transparency, and arbitrarily operated, which should be distinguished from our measures implemented to achieve the legitimate public policy interests of each country. We seek to increase trust across our digital ecosystem and to counter the influence of authoritarian approaches. We recognize the importance of secure and resilient digital infrastructure as the foundation of society and the economy. We are committed to deepen our cooperation within the G7 and with like-minded partners to support and enhance network resilience by measures such as extending secure routes of submarine cables. We welcome supplier diversification efforts in ICTS supply chains and continue to discuss market trends towards open, interoperable approaches, alongside secure, resilient and established architecture in a technology neutral way. Under the JapaneseG7 Presidency and against the background of early deployments of Open Radio Access Network (RAN), we have exchanged views on open architectures and security-related aspects and opportunities. We recognize the need to bridge the digital divides, including the gender digital divide, and the importance of initiatives to use data and technology for cities, such as smart city initiatives, to promote digital inclusion and address challenges in urban development. We will facilitate inclusive development and enable greater employability and movement of digital experts, and restate our commitment to supporting other countries to increase digital access under principles of equity, universality and affordability while ensuring that security, interoperability, the protection of personal data and respect for human rights including gender equality are built into global connectivity.</p><p>Science and Technology</p><p>We support the development of advanced technologies, research infrastructures and highly-skilled human resource networks that will drive innovation to solve global challenges and enable the next stage of economic growth. To this end, we promote international talent mobility and circulation. The G7 will promote open science by equitably disseminating scientific knowledge, publicly funded research outputs including research data and scholarly publications following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. This will enable researchers and people to benefit from and contribute to creating knowledge, innovation and solutions to global challenges. We further commit to working together to promote responsible global science and technology cooperation and use of emerging technologies such as advanced computing and biotechnology with partners sharing common values and principles in research and innovation. This includes a better understanding of the seas and the ocean in the context of climate change and utilizing very large research infrastructures. We are committed to fostering and promoting a common understanding of values and principles in research and innovation through dedicated multilateral dialogues, including in the area of research security and research integrity, and international joint research based on the philosophy of open science. We welcome the forthcoming launch of the G7 Virtual Academy and release of the Best Practices Paper on Research Security and Integrity. These efforts will contribute to addressing the various challenges that arise at the intersection of security, economy, and scientific research.</p><p>We reiterate our commitment to promoting the safe and sustainable use of outer space, given our ever-greater reliance on space systems. Restating the importance of addressing the issues of space debris, we strongly support the implementation of international guidelines adopted at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space as urgent and necessary. We welcome national efforts to develop further solutions for space debris mitigation and remediation as well as further research and development of orbital debris mitigation and remediation technologies. Furthermore, we commit not to conducting destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing and encourage others to follow suit in order to ensure the security, stability and sustainability of outer space.</p><p>Gender</p><p>Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls is fundamental for a resilient, fair, and prosperous society. We endeavor to work with all segments of society to ensure full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls in all their diversity as well as LGBTQIA+ persons in politics, economics, education and all other spheres of society, and to consistently mainstream gender equality in all policy areas. In this respect, we commit to redoubling our efforts to overcome longstanding structural barriers and to addressing harmful gender norms, stereotypes, roles, and practices through such means as education and achieve a society where diversity, human rights and dignity are respected, promoted and protected and all people can enjoy vibrant lives free from violence and discrimination independent of gender identity or expression or sexual orientation. We welcome the work of the Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and look forward to strengthening it further. We look forward to the first revision of the G7 Dashboard on Gender Gaps and the publication of the first implementation report this year, which aims to monitor past G7 commitments to make progress on gender equality.</p><p>We express our strong concern about the rollback of women's and girls' rights in particular in time of crisis and we strongly condemn all violations and abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms for women and girls and LGBTQIA+ people around the world. We further recognize the essential and transformative role of comprehensive SRHR in gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment, and in supporting diversity, including of sexual orientations and gender identities. We reaffirm our full commitment to achieving comprehensive SRHR for all , including by addressing access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care. We are committed to championing, advancing and defending gender equality and the rights of women and girls in all their diversity, at home and abroad, and will work together to thwart attempts to undermine and reverse hard-won progress in this area. In this regard, we commit to advancing, implementing and strengthening the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda including its application to disaster risk reduction (DRR), through partnership with the WPS-Focal Points Network and support for National Action Plan development, and to promote intersectional approaches. We highlight the leading role of women in preventing violent conflict, delivering relief and recovery efforts, and forging lasting peace, and pledge to champion the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace and political processes. We commit to strengthening our efforts to eliminate conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, and the importance of providing comprehensive support and meaningful participation for victims and survivors, using a survivor-centered approach. We further commit to eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based harassment and abuse both offline and online as well as aid-related sexual exploitation and abuse. We are committed to ensuring the right to education for all, and emphasize the importance of promoting equitable access to safe, gender-transformative quality education as well as to taking measures to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sectors and education, and close the gender digital gap. We see this as key to promote women's entrepreneurship, which is an essential building block to address the climate, nature and development challenges. We also commit to promoting reskilling and upskilling, fostering decent work conditions, strengthening financial inclusion of women in all their diversity, and eliminating the gender pay gap. We further reiterate our commitments to promoting women's full empowerment as well as their full and equal participation in decision-making processes at all levels, including in leadership positions. We recognize that quality care plays an essential role in the functioning of our societies and economies, but is a key cause of gender inequalities due to its gender unequal distribution.</p><p>To advance our commitments, we emphasize the need to overcome the fragmentation and marginalization of gender equality issues by enhancing our efforts to integrate and deepening gender mainstreaming for a substantial transformation of our societies. In this regard, we call for a continuous, holistic and comprehensive approach to promote gender equality by creating a 'nexus' that bridges the political and security, economic and social spheres and advocate for maximizing the efficiency and the impact of multi-sectorial policies and of our actions across diverse dimensions of policy implementation. We stress the importance of such a nexus approach in our foreign and sustainable development policy and in our ODA and endeavor to support the nexus. We reaffirm our commitment to make every effort to collectively increase the share of our bilateral allocable ODA advancing gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment over the coming years. In this regard, we welcome 'the Fact Sheet: Promoting Gender Mainstreaming through the nexus approach' made by our experts and look forward to further progress in this area.</p><p>Human Rights, Refugees, Migration, Democracy</p><p>We reaffirm our commitment to upholding human rights and dignity of all, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so that everyone can participate fully and equally in society. We commit to firmly speaking out against human rights violations and abuses, and at the same time, listening to and assisting the countries and civil society organizations that seek to defend and promote human rights through dialogue and cooperation. Recognizing the need to deepen discussions within and beyond the G7 on business and human rights, we intend to strengthen cooperation and collective efforts, including by accelerating exchange of information, towards ensuring respect for human rights and international labor standards in business activities and global supply chains, and further enhancing resilience, predictability and certainty for businesses, and call upon others to join us in these efforts. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting refugees, supporting forcibly displaced persons and supporting host countries and communities, ensuring the full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of refugees and displaced persons, and defending and promoting the rights of marginalized people or persons facing vulnerable conditions exacerbated by conflict, crisis, and displacement, including freedom from sexual and gender-based violence. We call upon the international community to follow suit. We commit to fighting against impunity and holding perpetrators to account for the most serious crimes of international concern, including conflict-related sexual violence, together with improving documentation. In this regard, we recall the need to strengthen international architecture to prevent conflict-related sexual violence in the future. We acknowledge the importance of the discussions of the International Law Commission's draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity. We continue to work with the international community towards the second Global Refugee Forum in December 2023. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of refugees, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with the Global Compact on Refugees, national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p>We reaffirm our commitment to ensuring the safe, orderly, and regular migration around the world. We recognize the important economic and social benefits that migrants can bring to our countries. We commit to ensure full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We remain committed to preventing irregular and often highly dangerous migration whether by land or sea. We commit to joint efforts to tackle the organized criminal networks which facilitate illegal migration and the dangerous journey of migrants and asylum seekers, profiting off some of the most vulnerable. We call for firmness in dealing with this ruthless criminality that puts lives in danger and poses risks to the internal security of G7 partners. In this regard, we will intensify efforts to break the business model of organized criminal networks, including through cooperation to disrupt the supply chains that enable the criminal and exploitative operations of those engaged in the trafficking and smuggling of human beings. To this end, we will task relevant Ministers to deepen partnerships to enhance our understanding of the root causes and work together with partners around the world to address this complex challenge.</p><p>We reaffirm our shared belief that democracy is the most enduring means to advance peace, prosperity, equality and sustainable development. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting the information environment by supporting media freedom and online freedom, including protection from online harassment and abuse, internet shutdowns and disruptions, as well as addressing foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which is designed to undermine trust in democratic institutions, and sow discord in the international community. We strongly condemn the widespread use of information manipulation and interference by Russia in order to gain support for its war of aggression against Ukraine and to obscure the facts of its aggression. Through the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), we will work to strengthen our collective efforts to counter threats to democracy, including such manipulation, with full respect for international human rights law, in particular freedom of expression. We will work towards ensuring that fact-based, quality and trustworthy information is promoted, and call on digital platforms to support this approach. We will increase cooperation on these issues with government and non-governmental partners from all regions who share the determination to promote access to such information, including through supporting relevant international initiatives, such as the Partnership for Information and Democracy, and efforts by the UN and OECD.</p><p>Countering Terrorism, Violent Extremism and Transnational Organized Crime / Upholding the Rule of Law / Anti-Corruption</p><p>We reiterate our strong commitment to working together with all relevant actors to counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism, both online and offline, as well as transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, child sexual abuse and exploitation, corruption, fraud, intellectual property theft, ransomware threats, cybercrime and environmental crimes, as well as money laundering and terrorist financing in a unified, coordinated, inclusive, transparent and human-rights-based, gender-responsive manner. In countering the exploitation of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes and countering the misuses of technologies for criminal purposes, we will continue our utmost efforts to enhance global cooperation and digital response capacity. In this regard, building on our collaboration and on efforts through existing frameworks such as the Christchurch Call, and recalling previous commitments, including maintaining tightly controlled lawful access, we call on the private sector to step up their efforts to address the problem of dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content online and to prioritize safety by design, and stop, in particular, child sexual exploitation and abuse on their platforms. We support the efforts of our partner countries to sign and ratify the relevant international agreements such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and those of the Council of Europe such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, in the wide spectrum of cooperation by criminal justice and other relevant authorities that form the basis for efficient cross-border cooperation. We also recognize the significant public health and security threat of illicit synthetic drugs and will strengthen our cooperation to address it, engaging with other willing countries and the private sector.</p><p>We will also strengthen bilateral, regional and multilateral coordination and cooperation in the field of law and justice, such as providing technical assistance to countries to develop and implement laws, and capacity building related to the justice sector. We will continue to step up our fight against corruption, promoting good governance and strengthening accountable, transparent, equitable and community-oriented law enforcement to make progress on many of our shared priorities, which will lead to safer and more secure societies and thus contribute to the promotion of the rule of law and respect for human rights. We further recognize that corruption and related illicit finance and proceeds of crime drain public resources, can often fuel organized crime, enable kleptocratic systems to accumulate wealth and power at the expense of citizens, and undermine democratic governance. We will pursue a stronger and more unified approach in rigorously enforcing international anti-corruption obligations and standards, and enhancing law enforcement cooperation, including through relevant regional and international organizations, and holding corrupt actors accountable. Recalling the importance of beneficial ownership transparency for the integrity and transparency of democratic systems, we reaffirm the importance of supporting African partners in establishing and strengthening registers of beneficial ownership.</p><p>Regional Affairs/China</p><p>We stand together on core foreign policy and security challenges to build a more secure and prosperous future. We also reaffirm our determination to work with a wide range of partners to address pressing global challenges and to ensure that the international system is able to respond effectively to these issues.</p><p>We stand together as G7 partners on the following elements, which underpin our respective relations with China:</p><p>We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China. We act in our national interest. It is necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the international community and the size of its economy, on global challenges as well as areas of common interest.</p><p>We call on China to engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources in the framework of the Paris and Kunming-Montreal Agreements, addressing vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs, global health and macroeconomic stability.</p><p>Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China's economic progress and development. A growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying. We will take steps, individually and collectively, to invest in our own economic vibrancy. We will reduce excessive dependencies in our critical supply chains.</p><p>With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China, and strengthening the international trading system, we will push for a level playing field for our workers and companies. We will seek to address the challenges posed by China's non-market policies and practices, which distort the global economy. We will counter malign practices, such as illegitimate technology transfer or data disclosure. We will foster resilience to economic coercion. We also recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten our national security without unduly limiting trade and investment.</p><p>We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.</p><p>We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to security and prosperity in the international community. There is no change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. We call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.</p><p>We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights situation in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang where forced labor is of major concern to us. We call on China to honor its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, which enshrine rights, freedoms and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.</p><p>We call on China to act in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular relations, and not to conduct interference activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and our economic prosperity.</p><p>We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.</p><p>There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization activities in the region. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the UNCLOS and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 12, 2016, is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.</p><p>North Korea</p><p>We strongly condemn North Korea's unprecedented number of unlawful ballistic missile launches, each of which violated multiple UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). We demand that North Korea refrain from any other destabilizing or escalatory actions, including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology, which undermine regional stability and pose a grave threat to international peace and security. Such reckless actions must be met with a swift, united, and robust international response. This must include further significant measures to be taken by the UN Security Council. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the goal of North Korea's complete, verifiable, and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in accordance with relevant UNSCRs. We are concerned about North Korea's choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of the people in North Korea. We call on North Korea to accept repeated offers of dialogue, including from Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.</p><p>Myanmar</p><p>We remain deeply concerned about the deteriorating security, humanitarian, human rights, and political situation in Myanmar, and we express our solidarity with its people. We continue to support ASEAN's efforts including its continued engagements with all stakeholders in Myanmar to implement the Five-Point Consensus, including through Indonesia as the ASEAN Chair and ASEAN special envoy to Myanmar. We continue to call on the Myanmar military to immediately cease all violence, release all political prisoners and those arbitrarily detained, create an environment for an inclusive and peaceful dialogue, and return the country to a genuinely democratic path. We reiterate our call on all states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar. We also call for full, safe, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people, especially the most vulnerable.</p><p>Afghanistan</p><p>We note with grave concern increased threats to stability and the dire humanitarian and economic situation in Afghanistan. We call on the Taliban to uphold its counterterrorism commitments and to ensure the territory of Afghanistan cannot be used to threaten or attack any country, to plan or finance terrorist acts, or to shelter and train terrorists. We express our strongest opposition to the Taliban's systematic violations on human rights and fundamental freedoms, and call for the immediate reversal of unacceptable decisions, especially those against women and girls. All Afghans must enjoy full, equal, and meaningful participation in all spheres of public life, and have access to humanitarian assistance and basic services. We call upon the Taliban to respect UNSCR 2681/2023 and the UN Charter, including Article 8, and to ensure unrestricted operations of the UN in Afghanistan. To remedy the persistent lack of political inclusivity and representation, we urge the Taliban to take significant steps to engage in credible, inclusive and Afghan-led national dialogue, in which all Afghans can be involved. We recognize the need for conveying unified messages to the Taliban in coordination with other international partners.</p><p>Iran</p><p>We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. We remain deeply concerned about Iran's unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. A diplomatic solution remains the best way to resolve this issue. In that context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action continues to provide a useful reference. We call on Iran to take prompt and concrete actions to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments, including nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards obligations. We reiterate our profound concern over Iran's systemic human rights violations and abuses, including its repression of popular feminist protest as well as the targeting of individuals, including women, girls, minority groups, and journalists, in and outside of Iran. We call on Iran's leadership to end all unjust and arbitrary detentions.</p><p>We express our grave concern regarding Iran's continued destabilizing activities, including the transfer of missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies to state and non-state actors and proxy groups, in breach of UNSCRs including 2231 and 2216. Iran must stop supporting Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. In particular, we call upon Iran to cease transferring armed UAVs, which have been used to attack Ukraine's critical infrastructure and kill Ukrainian civilians. We welcome initiatives to improve bilateral relations and de-escalate tensions in the region, including Iran and Saudi Arabia's recent agreement to restore ties. We emphasize the importance of ensuring maritime security in the Middle East's waterways and call on Iran not to interfere with the lawful exercise of navigational rights and freedoms by all vessels.</p><p>Israel and Palestine</p><p>We call on Israelis and Palestinians to take steps to build trust toward the realization of a two-state solution. To this end, all parties must refrain from unilateral actions, including settlement activities and incitement to violence. We reiterate our support for the historic status quo in Jerusalem. We welcome the recent meetings between Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and the United States and hope their commitments will be fulfilled in good faith. We will continue our support for Palestinian economic self-reliance and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.</p><p>Syria</p><p>We remain firmly committed to an inclusive, UN-facilitated political process consistent with UNSCR 2254 in Syria. We reaffirm that the international community should only consider normalization and reconstruction assistance once there is authentic and enduring progress towards a political solution. We express our continued support for the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and are committed to accountability for those responsible for the use of chemical weapons and violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable. We call for full and unhindered humanitarian access to all Syrians in need, particularly through UN cross-border aid for which there is no alternative in scope or scale. We remain committed to the enduring defeat of ISIS, including durable solutions for ISIS detainees and displaced persons remaining in Northeast Syria.</p><p>Middle East and North Africa</p><p>We further express our support to preserve stability and prosperity in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Regarding Yemen, we call on all parties to secure a durable ceasefire and work towards a comprehensive, durable, and inclusive Yemeni-led political process under UN auspices. We encourage the Tunisian government to meet the democratic aspiration of its people, to address its economic situation and to reach an agreement with the IMF. We also support efforts to achieve stability and unity in Libya under the auspice of the UN in coordination with the African Union and the Arab League. We urge all Libyan stakeholders to work constructively on the political process in order to hold free, fair, and inclusive presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of 2023.</p><p>Central Asia</p><p>We reaffirm our engagement with Central Asian countries to address various regional challenges, including the consequences of Russia's war of aggression, the destabilizing effect of the situation in Afghanistan, food and energy security, terrorism, and climate change. We are determined to foster trade and energy links, sustainable connectivity and transportation, including the 'Middle Corridor' and associated projects to enhance regional prosperity and resilience.</p><p>Africa</p><p>We are deepening our partnerships with African countries and regional organizations, including the African Union. We have each expressed support to African calls for stronger representation in international fora, notably the G20. We reiterate our strong commitment to supporting governments in the region to address, in a manner consistent with international law, the underlying conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, violent extremism, and instability across Africa. We are seriously concerned about the growing presence of the Russia-affiliated Wagner Group forces on the continent and their destabilizing impact and human rights abuses. Keeping in mind the situations in West Africa and the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes regions, we will work together to support African-led efforts on peace, stability and prosperity on the continent. In this regard, we welcome the positive developments stemming from the cessation of hostilities agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, and call on both parties to remain committed to full implementation. We also call for international support for the Somali President's reform priorities and the fight against al-Shabaab. We reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We welcome the cessation of hostilities agreed in March and call for its full implementation. We condemn the advance of the UN-sanctioned March 23 Movement armed group (M23) and join African leaders in calling for M23 to withdraw unconditionally from all territories it controls. We are also seriously concerned about the spread of terrorist threats and activities towards coastal countries in West Africa, and are available to lend our support in addressing those threats.</p><p>Sudan</p><p>We strongly condemn the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. This threatens the security and safety of civilians, undermines efforts to restore Sudan's democratic transition, and could affect the stability of the region. We urge the parties to end hostilities immediately without pre-conditions and return civilian-led democratic government. We call on all actors to renounce violence and take active steps to reduce tensions, and ensure the safety of all civilians, including humanitarian personnel. The parties to the conflict must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, ensure the safety of all civilians, including humanitarian personnel, and not impede or restrict the delivery of life-saving aid. We commend the bravery and fortitude of humanitarian agencies working in Sudan. We acknowledge the generosity of Sudan's neighbors who, despite facing significant humanitarian challenges of their own, host a growing number of Sudanese refugees. We commit to supporting response operations in Sudan and across East and North Africa and the Sahel region for refugees and returnees.</p><p>Latin America and Caribbean</p><p>We highlight the importance of enhancing cooperation with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to uphold shared interests as well as values. We are committed to working with regional partners to address economic challenges, climate change, biodiversity loss, natural disasters, and other global issues. We reiterate our commitment to strengthen coordination with Latin American and Caribbean partners and other actors to promote the rule of law, respect for human rights, and meet the elevated humanitarian and security needs in the region, especially in Venezuela, Haiti, and Nicaragua. With respect to the ongoing crisis in Haiti, we underscore the importance of working towards Haitian-led solution for a return to stability and need to hold accountable those who cultivate violence, corruption and instability.</p><p>Kosovo and Serbia</p><p>We welcome the Agreement on the path to normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia and its Implementation Annex, reached under the EU facilitated dialogue in Brussels on February 27 and in Ohrid on March 18 respectively. In order to unlock its full potential for the citizens of Kosovo and Serbia and for advancing good-neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans, we call on both parties to implement expediently and in good faith their respective obligations.</p>", "publisher": "NewsIn.Asia", "instances": ["To implement the GBF, we commit to substantially and progressively increasing the level of financial resources from all sources, and to align all relevant fiscal and financial flows with the GBF and call on others to do the same.

We also commit to supporting and advancing a transition to nature positive economies, including through sharing knowledge and creating information networks among the G7 such as the G7 Alliance on Nature Positive Economy.

The message is clear, we are in a planetary emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, 2021 is pivotal because this is also the year that significant global conferences on climate change and biodiversity take place. Widely considered the last chance for world leaders to commit to desperately needed climate action and biodiversity conservation before we reach the 2030 deadline, the decisions made at these conferences and the actions that follow will definitively decide the future of our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A global movement on much needed radical climate action</p><p>At the recently concluded high-level event at United Nations General Assembly that outlined transformative actions and financing to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, emphasized that protecting, conserving, restoring biodiversity and sustainable usage can be nature positive and deliver multiple co-benefits for the environment, climate and sustainable development as a whole. The ongoing COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity will see the adoption of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework-a strategic vision and a global roadmap for the conservation, protection, restoration and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems for the next decade-is a promising sign of a global movement that is pressing on much needed radical action.</p><p>The answer to our planetary emergency and economic growth largely lies in nature and biodiversity, in immediate, sustained and transformative change in our societies and way of life; but most importantly, in our policy, economic and finance infrastructures. The choices made at this juncture as we are recovering from the COVID-19 hit economic downturn, and in the wake of time-critical climate findings will determine development and fiscal policies for the next decade and the future of our planet. Yet, even today, investments in nature and biodiversity are few and far between.</p><p>The world has not yet learnt its lessons</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme's Biodiversity Finance Initiative's (BIOFIN) 2021 iteration of the Little Book of Investing in Nature reports that the current annual biodiversity conservation financing still produces a biodiversity financing gap of USD 598-824 billion per year by 2030. Even though COVID-19 starkly reinforced the need to fund actions that enhance the resilience of ecosystems and address the shortcomings in areas such as food security, climate action, water security, human health and enhanced resilience to disaster risk, it is evident that the world has not yet learnt its lessons.</p><p>According to research by the World Economic Forum, half of the gross world product is highly or moderately dependent on nature. Agriculture, construction, food and beverages are the largest sectors that are dependent on nature, and these generate USD 8 Trillion in gross value added. Yet, there seems to be a lack of understanding that our biodiversity underpins our global economic systems and our climate solutions.</p><p>The 2021 State of Finance for Nature report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has found that investments in nature-based solutions will have to triple by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050 if we are to have a shot at solving the planetary emergency. A move towards green development is the only sustainable growth trajectory for our societies and economies, and green financing is at the core of it.</p><p>Investing in and financing nature is the way forward</p><p>So, what is green financing? A relatively new concept to Sri Lanka, green financing is any structured finance activity put towards an environmental outcome. UNEP defines it as an increasing level of financial flows (including banking, micro-credit, insurance and investment) from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors to better manage environmental and social risks, take up opportunities that bring both a decent rate of return and environmental benefit, and deliver greater accountability. For our societies and economies to thrive, we also need the natural systems that we depend on to thrive. And, investing in and financing nature is the way forward.</p><p>This is true to Sri Lanka, as well. As a country heavily dependent on nature and biodiversity, both socially and economically, the cost of deprioritizing investments in it is high. Although Sri Lanka has historically pursued low-carbon development and has balanced achieving high levels of human development with the lowest per capita emission rates, recent policy inconsistencies and structural issues have limited the country's sustainability. According to the Financial Needs Assessment conducted through the BIOFIN programme, Sri Lanka will need a total of LKR 31 billion (USD 250 Million) for the period of 2018 - 2024 to reach the country's critical biodiversity targets.</p><p>Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN)</p><p>Currently, the BIOFIN programme-a UNDP managed global collaborative partnership is striving to bridge this financing gap. The programme follows four approaches; to generate new income; increase the efficiency of existing resources; realign existing resources; and avoid future expenses.</p><p>Through this programme, a Biodiversity Finance Plan has been formulated consisting of 16 financial solutions that fit into each of these four strategic approaches. Sri Lanka is currently piloting three of these solutions.</p><p>1. Payment for ecosystems services that generate new income, where mini-hydropower plants invest part of their profits into conserving their catchment area.</p><p>2. A sustainable tourism certification scheme, which is a future cost avoidance strategy working with key government partners like the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and a host of private sector partners including hotels, to impact the environment positively through tourism operations or reduce their negative impacts significantly.</p><p>3. In partnership with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), a finance programme that works to mainstream sustainable financing initiatives and promote sustainable investments within the island's finance landscape. This works to realign existing resources and incentivize sustainable and green activities within all levels of society.</p><p>A push towards Green Development</p><p>Delving further into the third solution, for instance, if a business owner seeks a loan to fund their operations, the bank could offer lower interest rates if the business owner makes changes to his business plan to have no impacts on the environment or if they actively work towards conserving the environment.</p><p>Currently, the programme, with the CBSL, has developed a Roadmap for Sustainable Financing in Sri Lanka, established a knowledge-sharing platform through the Sustainable Banking Initiative which advances sustainable banking principles and implementation, compiled case studies, and developed an e-learning course.</p><p>At least six banks in the country have initiated sustainable financing activities voluntarily at the moment, and coupled with this momentum the BIOFIN programme hopes to engage more smaller banks in Sri Lanka to develop similar financing products. Further, as a national effort, the programme is in the process of developing the sustainable financing taxonomy with the CBSL with the aim of contributing to the country's broader policy push towards green development.</p><p>Yet, Sri Lanka needs more. As a country with significant vulnerabilities to climate change impacts, now severely fiscally restricted due to our two-year-long struggle with COVID-19, Sri Lanka's green and biodiversity financing is not near enough to meet the set biodiversity targets. Although there's no formal evidence, given the pace of climate change and impacts, we can deduce that our adaptation costs too are rising disproportionately to our adaptation finances.</p><p>We have not yet fully understood the value of nature and biodiversity, and it is high time we fought to build forward better as our resilience is in our biodiversity and nature.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Lanka Business Report.
