This took place around 18-22 January 2003. Almost 70% of the area's pastures, pine plantations and natural parks were severely damaged.

How knows whether they will make a claim for air pollution to a Climate Court in the years to come?</p><p>Reading between the lines, we see messages on Twitter stating what it really is like in New South Wales: 'the sky was just black, the Sun was red, and we saw men beating back the flames\u2026\u2026\u2026'.</p><p>Clamour for Climate Change</p><p>From tomorrow 3 January 2020, two Australian States of New South Wales and Queensland have declared the State of Emergency as the bushfires are a serious threat to heavily populated areas in their states.</p><p>The Volunteer Firefighters who up to now have been a volunteer force will from now on be paid for their firefighting work.</p><p>The Security Services, the Australian Army and Navy have also been recruited to help in the operation.</p><p>Citizens of towns and cities in the devastated areas are fleeing to the beaches in search of refugee.</p><p>This has led many around the world to seek answers whether the bushfires in Australia can be linked to Climate Change?</p><p>As many know or may know, the science around Climate Change is complex. It is not the cause of bushfires, according to some scientists.</p><p>But what we know for sure is that the average temperature in Australia now is running about 1 degree centigrade above the longterm average.

In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the 93-year-old Sir David made the direct link between the ongoing bushfires and climate change. \"As I speak, south-east Australia is on fire. Why? Because the temperatures of the Earth are increasing,\" he said. \"We have been putting things off year after year. We've been raising targets, saying 'oh well, if we do it in the next 20 years ...' the moment of crisis has come.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 10.7m hectares of land has burnt so far in the Australian bushfires, including 80% of the Blue Mountains, and 50% of the Gondwana world heritage rainforests.</p><p>While Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has talked down suggestions, there are climate change deniers in his party, several Australian government MPs have continued to downplay the role of global heating on the bushfire crisis and Mr Morrison has attempted to pivot the debate from acting on climate change to resilience and adaptation, the Guardian quoted the BBC as saying.</p><p>Sir David said the world could no longer prevaricate and delay decisions, and the change needed to be made not by appealing to optimism but by highlighting it is a life or death decision.\"This is not just having nice little debates and arguments and then coming away with a compromise. This is an urgent problem that has to be solved,\" he said.</p><p>\"And what is more is that we know how to do it, that's the paradoxical thing, that we are refusing to take steps that we know have to be taken. \"And every year that passes makes those steps more and more difficult to achieve.\"</p><p>He said China needed to step forward and announce it would curb carbon output because of climate change, and everyone else would \"fall into line\".\"That would be the big change that one could hope would happen.\"He said the public mood had already shifted.\"People can see the problem, particularly young people can see the problem, and that must force</p><p>governments to take action.\"</p><p>In Sri Lanka also we are experiencing the drastic effects of climate change, with prolonged droughts, and unusually heavy rains with floods, at times we do not expect. Most climate change analysts believe we are still depending far too much on fossil fuels or coal power and the new government needs to give top priority to clean energy initiatives including solar power and wind power. As we prepare to celebrate Independence Day on February 4 we need to remember that freedom is linked to responsibility. To the extent we carry out our responsibilities as good citizens, to that extent only, do we have a moral right to claim rights and freedom. To the extent, we fail in our responsibilities and live in a selfish or self-centred way to that extent we forfeit our rights and freedom. While the government and big organisations handle mega projects we also make our little contributions by saving water and electricity, using public transport whenever possible and even going back to the bicycles because it will not cause any pollution but in a positive way will provide good exercise. With non-communicable diseases like diabetes reaching alarming rates in Sri Lanka nutritionists say a balanced diet and lifestyle including exercise are effective ways to curb this trend.</p><p>Almost a half-century ago the then Finance Minister Dr. N. M. Perera, saying he saw the \"dim light of the distant dawn\" advised people to cultivate home gardens so that the food we eat could be to a larger extent non-polluted. But his plea fell into the category of wisdom that is gone with the wind. Today we are eating either imported food part of which is processed rubbish while even local food is polluted by unscrupulous traders who use dangerous substances as preservatives.</p><p>We hope that as we celebrate Independence Day most of us will take the responsibility of playing a role in the battle against climate change and the related issue such as poverty alleviation, and a peaceful resolution of conflicts, in addition, we need to encourage talented young people to use their creative and imaginative skills to tackle issues like climate change because it is the young people who will suffer most if global warming is not checked.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

That video sent a strong message, which unfortunately drowned in the din of worldly events. The video is about the importance of 'Mother' Nature. What strikes the message home was its strong ending:</p><p>\"Nature doesn't need people; People needs nature\" and \"I do not need you but you depend on me\" That is what is important for us to inculcate in the younger generation. To live in harmony with nature.</p><p>That the fact the earth existed-according to high priests of science-4.5 billion years ago; and it will be for billions of years to come. The average life expectancy of a human being is just 79 years as at today. 79 years upon 4,500,000,000. The Sun also has about 5 billion years more.
