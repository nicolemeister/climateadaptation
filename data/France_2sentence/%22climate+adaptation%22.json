These achievements reflect the collective efforts of scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs working for a more sustainable, competitive, and resilient Europe.<br/></p><p><br/>Yet we find ourselves in a world increasingly defined by geopolitical instability, climate disruption, and economic uncertainty. Europe must double down, accelerate its transition and scale up investments in research and innovation. To do so effectively, we must ensure that the brightest minds and boldest ideas can thrive within Europe's borders.<br/></p><p><br/>Three pillars - delivering real results, urgency for acceleration, and unlocking Europe's potential - must guide our work going forward.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Research and innovation are already delivering</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Since the launch of the European Green Deal in 2019, the EU has placed R&amp;I at the heart of its policy agenda. The climate contribution of Horizon Europe, the EU's flagship research programme, will reach 35%, or more than (EURO)30 billion by 2027. Spending on biodiversity-related R&amp;I has increased to 8.7% and will reach 10% by 2027. Over (EURO)3 million contributed to improving air quality.<br/></p><p><br/>This funding is translating into real-world impact. R&amp;I projects are actively piloting net-zero farming, restoring ecosystems, and developing real-time digital tools for climate adaptation. Full-scale demonstrators are showing how circular production can be applied to materials and textiles. In the bioeconomy, European startups are generating more sustainable alternatives to intensively-farmed food, and fossil fuel-based plastics, chemicals and fuels - helping build new industrial value chains, technologies and jobs. In water-related cleantech, Europe leads the world, accounting for approximately 40% of water-related technology patents. In addition to underpinning Europe's frontier businesses in water technologies and services, EU R&amp;I funding helps find solutions that make our farms more resilient to drought, our energy, mining and agrifood business more water-smart, and our rivers, lakes and groundwater resources less impacted.<br/></p><p><br/>These initiatives demonstrate that the green transition is already underway!<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changing context, changing needs</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>At the same time, the context in which we operate has changed dramatically. In the six years since the European Green Deal was announced, the EU has faced multiple overlapping crises - from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine to devastating floods and fires, conflicts, humanitarian and environmental crises that are shaking our world. Alarmingly, 2024 was the first on record to exceed 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures.<br/></p><p><br/>This evolving context calls for a new level of ambition. To safeguard Europe's resilience and the well-being of EU citizens, we must become more competitive and resource-efficient, strengthen our supply chains, and reduce dependencies. Moreover, the EU has a political, moral and legal commitment to reach climate neutrality by 2050.<br/></p><p><br/>To stay on track, the EU must accelerate the implementation of the European Green Deal and leverage new initiatives such as the Clean Industrial Deal and the Competitiveness Compass. EU R&amp;I Missions and Partnerships are already fostering collaboration across all levels of governance and helping engage citizens and industry in transformative change. Overall, however, progress remains partial. More ambition is needed to achieve our 2030 climate and environmental objectives.<br/></p><p><br/>The message is clear: R&amp;I works. R&amp;I delivers. And it must be scaled up to meet the urgency of the moment.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Creating the conditions for innovation to thrive</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Delivering a competitive green transition requires more than funding. It demands a thriving research and innovation ecosystem that attracts and retains talent, supports startups, and protects scientific freedom.<br/></p><p><br/>To make Europe a destination of choice for researchers worldwide, structural improvements are necessary. Challenges such as limited job security, uncompetitive salaries, and mobility barriers must be addressed. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Choose Europe</emphasis> initiative is an important step in this direction. Through the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ERA Act</emphasis>, we intend to improve working conditions for researchers and address administrative hurdles including visa processes. We will propose to enshrine scientific freedom in law. And provide (EURO)500 million in funding for the period 2025-2027 through the European Research Council, Horizon Europe, and Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions.<br/></p><p><br/>The EU must live up to its commitment to investing 3% of GDP in research and development. At the same time, we must create the right framework conditions to support the scale-up of green and clean technologies. While Europe leads globally in clean tech patents - accounting for 22% of the total - we must build on this advantage. In 2023, green tech was the only area where EU venture capital investment levels matched those of the US.<br/></p><p><br/>To maintain this momentum, the recently announced <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy</emphasis> will help clean and green innovators grow faster and further by cutting red tape, improving access to financing, and facilitating market access across the Single Market.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Europe has the tools, the talent, and the technological edge to lead the global green transition. The progress we've seen so far shows what is possible when research and innovation are placed at the heart of our policy agenda. To fully deliver on this promise - and to ensure the benefits reach all corners of our society - we must scale up our efforts.<br/></p><p><br/>Only by harnessing the full power of research and innovation can we deliver a competitive green transition and a better future for EU citizens.<br/></p><p><br/>Let's continue working together to make it happen.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Marc Lema\u00eetre is the Director-General at DG for Research and Innovation, European Commission.</emphasis><br/></p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["The text below is a lightly edited and shorter version of his closing remarks.

The global market for climate adaptation solutions-such as advanced weather analytics, parametric insurance, and water-efficient infrastructure- is projected to be worth USD 2 trillion annually by 2026.</p><p>Welcoming the attendees, Professor Patrick V. Verkooijen, President &amp; CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, lauded the diplomatic community for recognizing that adaptation is not merely a defensive measure but an essential component of global economic strategy: \"We are already in the 'Resilience Endgame'. We must prepare today for the 1.5-degree world. The devastating global impacts we see today need not define the society of tomorrow. The escape plan is to double down on adaptation and capture its incredible economic dividends.\" He added that \"the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, our flagship initiative, the largest adaptation program in the world, has shown us that growth and building resilience are intrinsically linked. But we can do so much more - together. Adaptation is about future-proofing our economies, protecting critical infrastructure, safeguarding food supplies, and ensuring that new opportunities can thrive in changing conditions. By rallying together, we multiply the impact of innovative investments and encourage the 'resilience dividend'-the powerful, compounding benefits that flow from forward-thinking action.\"</p><p>Delivering remarks, Professor Jan Peter Balkenende, Former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Minister of State, and Executive Board Member of the GCA, emphasized that genuine progress on climate resilience will unlock broad-based dividends: \"What happens in the most vulnerable countries does not stay there. Climate change amplifies food insecurity, migration, and conflict. In fragile states, environmental stress can become a security threat. Europe and the world must take this seriously. Investing in resilience is not only right - it is wise.\" He added that \"This is why we need true global cooperation, based on shared interest and shared responsibility.\"</p><p>Reflecting on adaptation efforts in Africa and beyond, H.E. Halima Mucheke, Ambassador of the Republic of Kenya in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, spoke about the significance of GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi: \"Kenya is proud to host the GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi which will intensify support for adaptation programs across Africa, leading these programs North-South. Around the world, resilient infrastructure is the hot new investment class. Climate adaptation is a framework for protecting infrastructure, securing food systems and creating new business and job opportunities. And it is being aided by a thriving market in climate solutions.\" He added that \"The continent's leading initiative in this area - the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP) - has already channelled more than $15bn to strengthen essential systems against climate shocks. These funds are helping to secure the adaptability and livelihoods of nearly 60 million vulnerable people in 40 countries.

The paper was written by Ishac Diwan, Martin Kessler, Vera Songwe, Martin Guzman and Stiglitz, and was presented at a discussion panel in Addis Ababa on 23 July.</p><p>Funds from international finance institutions intended to address climate change are 'leaking out,' and are being used to pay off debts to private creditors and non-Paris Club lenders, the paper argues. That creates a need for debt relief to create room for increased lending to support recovery and green growth, it says.</p><p>The proposal focuses on countries that do not have a problem with their overall level of debt, but have short-term difficulties in servicing it. It calls for the creation of a 'Bridge Program' led by international financial institutions, which would seek to establish three-way agreements. Debtor countries would be responsible for developing 'ambitious' strategies to invest in growth, multilateral institutions would increase their support, and all other creditors would refrain from withdrawing capital prematurely.</p><p>The result, the paper says, would be 'country-led, credible multi-year programs for recovery and green growth'. Among the ingredients would be debt restructuring from bilateral lenders if required, principal reductions from private creditors for countries unable to meet their financial obligations, and rollovers for countries still able to do so.</p><p>Zambian 'deep freeze'</p><p>The case of Kenya, the paper argues, shows dangers that need to be avoided. Borrowing via a $1.5bn Eurobond, which was sold in February with a 10.375% yield, plus embarking on an austerity programme, the paper says, is 'not an example of a sustainable path'.</p><p>The proposal drew a sharp response on the discussion panel from Patrick Njoroge, who until June was the governor of Kenya's central bank. Njoroge criticised the 'flippant' willingness of the paper's authors to entertain further sovereign defaults.</p><p>The reality, he says, is that countries don't know what a default will entail. In the case of Zambia, he argued, the effect of default was to 'put the country into deep freeze for three years. No government in their right mind wants to default'.</p><p>The proposal, Njoroge argued, needs to be 'more ambitious' on debt relief in the light of a detailed analysis of the climate-adaptation needs of sovereigns.</p><p>Vera Songwe, founder and chair of the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility for developing countries and a co-author of the paper, responded by stressing the validity of the distinction between countries which face challenges to their solvency and those which simply have liquidity issues. 'We are not asking countries to default,' and neither is the market, she said.</p><p>Yet interest rates of 10% or more, Songwe argued, shows that the market 'doesn't trust either the borrowing country, or the IMF - or both'. Growth, rather than debt forgiveness, she said, is the only way forward for developing countries.</p><p>The authors are now seeking to establish a group of African countries which are interested in adopting the proposal.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 97, "title": "Arcadis Q2 and Half Year 2025 Results: Strong margin, well positioned for growth", "published": "2025-07-31", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRESS RELEASE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Arcadis</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Second Quarter and Half Year Results 2025</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strong margin, well positioned for growth</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEY HIGHLIGHTS</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Net revenues were (EURO)1,937 million: stable year-on-year on an organic basisIncreased Key Client order intake further improving backlog quality (3% ytd organic growth) Strong operating EBITA margin of 11.3% in the quarter, with substantial strategic investments to accelerate future growth and further cost efficienciesIntegration of recently acquired WSP Rail and KUA Data Centers unlocking new growth opportunities in GermanyWell positioned for growth in the second half of 2025: large contracts ramping up, increased UK spending and improved market stability</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amsterdam, 31 July 202</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- Arcadis, the world's leading company delivering data-driven sustainable design, engineering, and consultancy solutions for natural and built assets, reports (EURO)965 million net revenues for the second quarter, reflecting a stable performance on an organic basis year-on-year and continued operational improvements with an operating EBITA margin of 11.3% in the second quarter, while substantially investing in strategic initiatives to accelerate future growth and further cost efficiencies.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alan Brookes, CEO Arcadis, said:</emphasis>\"In the first half of 2025, Arcadis demonstrated good performance, with continued strong demand in North America and Europe offsetting more challenging conditions in UK and Australia.

This was largely offset by a softer UK market, where revenues declined by 8% year-on-year due to the delayed outcome of the government's Spending Review. In addition, a pause in Australia's infrastructure market and a shift in our US Environment business towards a higher quality portfolio also weighed on overall growth.</p><p>Total backlog was supported by significant order intake from clients in Pharmaceuticals, Data Centers, Energy Transition, US Water, and Rail, offsetting contracts winding down in US Environmental Restoration, Semiconductors and Mobility clients in UK and Australia.</p><p>We are well positioned for growth in the second half of 2025, supported by the ramp-up of large contracts, increased UK spending, and improved market stability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OPERATING EBITA MARGIN</emphasis>Operating EBITA margin was 11.3% for the quarter, up from last year's underlying margin of 10.8% after adjusting for the (EURO)6.6 million Middle East provision release. Margin improvement was supported by strategic levers, including the expansion of our Key Clients program, now representing 67% of Net Revenues (up from 59% last year) and a rise in Global Excellence Centers' contribution to 15% (from 13% last year), with headcount now at 5,100 and preparations for the opening of our new center in Bucharest, Romania underway. Continued project selectivity, combined with ongoing investments in people and digital platforms, supported further efficiency gains. We remain on track with our strong margin trajectory towards the 12.5% target for 2026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REVIEW OF THE HALF YEAR 2025</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFIT &amp; LOSS ITEMS</emphasis>Net revenues totaled (EURO)1,937 million and were stable on an organic basis year-on-year. The operating EBITA margin was strong at 11.1% (H1'24: 11.1%<sup>1)</sup>). Non-operating costs were (EURO)31 million, driven by right-sizing and restructuring efforts mainly in the UK in the first quarter. Net finance expenses decreased to (EURO)20 million (H1'24: (EURO)23 million), mostly driven by on average lower interest rates on loans and borrowings. Net income from operations decreased by 4% to (EURO)121 million (H1'24: (EURO)126 million), or (EURO)1.35 per share (H1'24: (EURO)1.40).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOW</emphasis>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 68 days at the end of H1'25 (H1'24: 66 days). Net Working Capital as a percentage of annualized quarterly gross revenues was 13.4% (H1'24: 12.7%), with a strong June revenue performance driving up the receivables position. Free cash flow in the quarter was a positive (EURO)2 million resulting in (EURO)-136 million for the half year (H1'24: (EURO)-88 million), in line with seasonal trends and impacted by (EURO)26 million higher cash out versus last year as 2024 benefitted from lower cash taxes in the US, and we made prepayments for Q4 2025. Net debt increased to (EURO)1,039 million (H1'24: (EURO)1,016 million) leading to a Net Debt / Operating EBITDA ratio of 1.8x (H1'24: 1.9x), well within the strategic range of 1.5-2.5x.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RESILIENCE</emphasis></p><p>Strong growth in Energy Transition in Germany, Climate Adaptation in the Netherlands, and Water Optimization in the US was partially offset a temporary slowdown in the UK due to delays in the AMP8 cycle not offsetting reduced infrastructure-related environmental work. Strong backlog development was supported by large framework contracts renewed at the start of the year, and underpinned by key wins in Water, Energy Transition, and Nuclear. In the UK, revenue from AMP8 Water contracts is set to gradually increase, with orders starting to be called off at the end of the second quarter. Additionally, our expanding Energy Transition backlog is expected to support near-term revenue growth. The margin benefited from disciplined project selection and effective cost management. Significant investments in talent for Energy Transition and in AI-driven Water solutions further strengthens our position to capture growth opportunities in these markets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PLACES</emphasis></p><p>Net revenues were impacted by delays in major capital expenditure decisions from Industrial Manufacturing and Property &amp; Investment clients, which was partially offset by strong performance in the US Pharmaceutical and Data Center sectors. The acquisition of KUA in Germany further enhanced our position in the high-growth Data Center sector. Solid order intake was supported by a significant US Pharma win, driving near term growth. Furthermore, the conclusion of the UK Spending Review and substantial European government spending plans are enhancing pipeline opportunities with Key Clients in areas such as housing, defense, transport hubs and healthcare, positioning us well for the second half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOBILITY</emphasis></p><p>North America delivered a steady performance, supported by the planned ramp-up of large US and Canadian projects secured last year. Overall, results were tempered by the delayed outcome of UK's Spending Review and a pause in Australia's infrastructure market. However, we ended the quarter with significant rail contract wins in Netherlands, Canada and the UK. In Germany, integration of the WSP Rail acquisition is progressing well and unlocking new growth opportunities. The benefits from rightsizing initiatives in the UK and Australia, implemented in the first quarter, are expected to become more evident in the coming quarters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTELLIGENCE</emphasis></p><p>Revenue was driven by our Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) solutions, which supported key rail clients in North America, as well as strong demand for our Tolling and Travel IQ products in the US. During the quarter, our Enterprise Decision Analytics (EDA) platform secured advisory wins with Property &amp; Investment clients in the Places segment and with Water Optimization projects in Resilience.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 9, Source: Company Website, 324 words </p><p>July 07: Tikehau Capital raises EUR1 billion to support Egis' next phase of growth, with backing from an Apollo S3 / ADIA consortium and Neuberger Berman as co-lead investors</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, announces a capital raise for its portfolio company Egis, reaffirming its long-term commitment to supporting the company's international expansion. This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion. The fund aims to support Egis' growth trajectory and accelerate its global development, particularly through strategic acquisitions. This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients). This transaction marks the fourth investment made through the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation. With this transaction, the second vintage has surpassed EUR2 billion in capital raised, just one year after its first closing, reaching a size 1.5 times larger than its predecessor. Egis is a global leader in architecture, consulting, engineering, construction and mobility services. The company designs, develops and operates smart infrastructure and buildings that address climate change challenges while fostering more balanced, sustainable and resilient development. Tikehau Capital initially acquired from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) a control position in Egis in January 2022 through the first vintage of its flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy to support Egis' objectives of executing strategic acquisitions to expand internationally. Egis exceeded the growth targets it set out in 2022 several years ahead of plan; and since then it has more than doubled its EBITDA and exceeded its revenue targets, with revenue surpassing EUR2.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 9, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 9, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments.

This strategy has raised almost 4001million euros over its two vintages and has now invested 150 million euros in 16 companies including Trustpair, Chapsvision and Egerie in France and VMRay in Germany</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; Bond Yield of 3.36%:</p><p>The dividend yield of 4.02% is 1.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.36%.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 9, Source: Company Website, 324 words </p><p>July 07: Tikehau Capital raises EUR1 billion to support Egis' next phase of growth, with backing from an Apollo S3 / ADIA consortium and Neuberger Berman as co-lead investors</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, announces a capital raise for its portfolio company Egis, reaffirming its long-term commitment to supporting the company's international expansion. This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion. The fund aims to support Egis' growth trajectory and accelerate its global development, particularly through strategic acquisitions. This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients). This transaction marks the fourth investment made through the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation. With this transaction, the second vintage has surpassed EUR2 billion in capital raised, just one year after its first closing, reaching a size 1.5 times larger than its predecessor. Egis is a global leader in architecture, consulting, engineering, construction and mobility services. The company designs, develops and operates smart infrastructure and buildings that address climate change challenges while fostering more balanced, sustainable and resilient development. Tikehau Capital initially acquired from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) a control position in Egis in January 2022 through the first vintage of its flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy to support Egis' objectives of executing strategic acquisitions to expand internationally. Egis exceeded the growth targets it set out in 2022 several years ahead of plan; and since then it has more than doubled its EBITDA and exceeded its revenue targets, with revenue surpassing EUR2.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 9, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 9, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments.

The topline increased, driven by higher interest rate levels, although the increase was partly offset by normalised loan impairment charges.\u00a0Income rose significantly driven by the higher interest rate levels.

Relative to 2023, there was a decrease in total lending. Nominal residual mortgage debt at Realkredit Danmark fell by around DKK 12 billion to DKK\u202f795 billion at end-2024.\u00a0We are continuing our efforts to digitalise mortgage financing processes, support advisory differentiation and use intelligent data-driven processes to support a personal and proactive customer approach tailored to specific needs and lifecycle events.The green transition is an important focus area for both private homes and commercial properties.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 9, Source: Company Website, 324 words </p><p>July 07: Tikehau Capital raises EUR1 billion to support Egis' next phase of growth, with backing from an Apollo S3 / ADIA consortium and Neuberger Berman as co-lead investors</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, announces a capital raise for its portfolio company Egis, reaffirming its long-term commitment to supporting the company's international expansion. This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion. The fund aims to support Egis' growth trajectory and accelerate its global development, particularly through strategic acquisitions. This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients). This transaction marks the fourth investment made through the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation. With this transaction, the second vintage has surpassed EUR2 billion in capital raised, just one year after its first closing, reaching a size 1.5 times larger than its predecessor. Egis is a global leader in architecture, consulting, engineering, construction and mobility services. The company designs, develops and operates smart infrastructure and buildings that address climate change challenges while fostering more balanced, sustainable and resilient development. Tikehau Capital initially acquired from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) a control position in Egis in January 2022 through the first vintage of its flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy to support Egis' objectives of executing strategic acquisitions to expand internationally. Egis exceeded the growth targets it set out in 2022 several years ahead of plan; and since then it has more than doubled its EBITDA and exceeded its revenue targets, with revenue surpassing EUR2.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 9, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments. The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses. This marks the first investment under the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace and defense, and the 15th portfolio investment since the strategy's launch in 2020. This strategy is designed to support small and mid-sized aerospace companies in scaling their operations, adapting to market changes, accelerating digitalization, and advancing their transition towards more sustainable practices.

The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 9, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators.

This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion.

This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients).

The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 9, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 9, Source: Company Website, 324 words </p><p>July 07: Tikehau Capital raises EUR1 billion to support Egis' next phase of growth, with backing from an Apollo S3 / ADIA consortium and Neuberger Berman as co-lead investors</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, announces a capital raise for its portfolio company Egis, reaffirming its long-term commitment to supporting the company's international expansion. This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion. The fund aims to support Egis' growth trajectory and accelerate its global development, particularly through strategic acquisitions. This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients). This transaction marks the fourth investment made through the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation. With this transaction, the second vintage has surpassed EUR2 billion in capital raised, just one year after its first closing, reaching a size 1.5 times larger than its predecessor. Egis is a global leader in architecture, consulting, engineering, construction and mobility services. The company designs, develops and operates smart infrastructure and buildings that address climate change challenges while fostering more balanced, sustainable and resilient development. Tikehau Capital initially acquired from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) a control position in Egis in January 2022 through the first vintage of its flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy to support Egis' objectives of executing strategic acquisitions to expand internationally. Egis exceeded the growth targets it set out in 2022 several years ahead of plan; and since then it has more than doubled its EBITDA and exceeded its revenue targets, with revenue surpassing EUR2.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 9, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 9, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments.

ESG</p><p>2.1 May 27: Tikehau Capital and Dunman Capital Partners acquire Frankfurt office property for conversion into service apartment complex</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, and Dunman Capital Partners, the Frankfurt-based real estate investor, today announce the acquisition of a centrally located property on Querstrasse in Frankfurt city centre, with the intention of transforming it into a service appointment apartment complex. The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 9, Source: Company Website, 324 words </p><p>July 07: Tikehau Capital raises EUR1 billion to support Egis' next phase of growth, with backing from an Apollo S3 / ADIA consortium and Neuberger Berman as co-lead investors</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, announces a capital raise for its portfolio company Egis, reaffirming its long-term commitment to supporting the company's international expansion. This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion. The fund aims to support Egis' growth trajectory and accelerate its global development, particularly through strategic acquisitions. This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients). This transaction marks the fourth investment made through the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation. With this transaction, the second vintage has surpassed EUR2 billion in capital raised, just one year after its first closing, reaching a size 1.5 times larger than its predecessor. Egis is a global leader in architecture, consulting, engineering, construction and mobility services. The company designs, develops and operates smart infrastructure and buildings that address climate change challenges while fostering more balanced, sustainable and resilient development. Tikehau Capital initially acquired from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) a control position in Egis in January 2022 through the first vintage of its flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy to support Egis' objectives of executing strategic acquisitions to expand internationally. Egis exceeded the growth targets it set out in 2022 several years ahead of plan; and since then it has more than doubled its EBITDA and exceeded its revenue targets, with revenue surpassing EUR2.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 9, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe GeneraleAssurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 9, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments.

The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses. This marks the first investment under the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace and defense, and the 15th portfolio investment since the strategy's launch in 2020. This strategy is designed to support small and mid-sized aerospace companies in scaling their operations, adapting to market changes, accelerating digitalization, and advancing their transition towards more sustainable practices. J.P. Morgan is supporting Tikehau Capital via a unitranche financing to underpin this significant transaction in the European aerospace and defense landscape. Founded in 1980, ScioTeq has built a strong reputation for designing and manufacturing high- performance visualization and computing systems for demanding environments. Its product portfolio addresses Avionics, Defense and Security, and Air Traffic Control, and supports leading global defense contractors and aerospace manufacturers. Headquartered in Belgium, the Group operates additional production sites in France and the United States, and has commercial offices in India and Singapore, enabling it to serve customers across Europe, North America, and Asia.

This issue of senior unsecured bonds will carry an annual fixed coupon of 4.250%. The bonds will be issued and are expected to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris on 8 April 2025. The strong investor demand, with an oversubscription of 2.8 times, reflects the Company's solid credit profile and investor confidence in a challenging market environment.

These bonds are rated BBB- by the financial rating agencies S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>1.4 Funding/Capital</p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>1.5 Board and Management</p><p>May 19: Xavier Musca joins Tikehau Capital as Chairman of the Supervisory Board</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the appointment of Xavier Musca as Chairman of its Supervisory Board, succeeding Christian de Labriffe, who will continue to support the Group in the role of Special Advisor.

The Justice Department took the aggressive step of pre-emptively suing two states to try to prevent them from even filing lawsuits like these.       </p><p>Environmentalists are growing concerned that the industry will rehash past efforts to lobby for a federal immunity provision, similar to the 2005 shield law that protects gun makers from liability when their weapons are used in crimes.       </p><p>The lawsuits have taken on greater importance, their supporters say, as the Trump administration retreats from policies to fight climate change and wean the nation from burning fossil fuels. As states and cities face rising costs from flooding, wildfires and other disasters intensified by global warming, they view litigation as one of the few remaining ways to bolster their budgets.       </p><p>\"The climate crisis is here, and the costs of surviving it are rising every day,\" said Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii this month as he announced that his state would join the parade of lawsuits. \"The burden should fall on those who deceived and failed to warn consumers about the climate dangers lurking in their products.\"       </p><p>His remarks were notable given that just hours earlier, the Justice Department, in a major escalation, had sued his state, and also Michigan, to try to prevent them from filing such lawsuits. Pamela Bondi, the United States attorney general, called the suits a threat to national security and \"illegitimate impediments to the production of affordable, reliable energy that Americans deserve.\"       </p><p>Ms. Bondi also announced suits against New York and Vermont over their new climate superfund laws, which seek to impose liability for past emissions on companies to fund climate adaptation projects.       </p><p>Michigan's attorney general, Dana Nessel, has indicated the state will proceed with its lawsuit.       </p><p>But the Justice Department's actions could deter other states and municipalities from filing, or even sway ones who have sued to abandon their cases. A day after Ms. Bondi's announcement, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico quietly dropped its case. A spokeswoman for Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n said the suit had been filed by a previous administration and that she was committed to a \"pro-growth energy agenda.\"       </p><p>The oil companies and their allies argue that the litigation is an attempt by local officials to wrest power over energy policy away from the federal government.       </p><p>When states and cities \"try to create policy through judicial fiat in a random, haphazard way throughout the country, in multiple jurisdictions, you're creating havoc in the free market,\" said Alan Wilson, attorney general of South Carolina, in a recent briefing hosted by the Washington Legal Foundation, which promotes free enterprise.       </p><p>Supporters say the cases are a step toward accountability. A report Wednesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, detailed what it said was decades of evidence of a cover-up by oil companies. \"Without intervention, these companies will continue their deception, delaying the urgent action needed to mitigate further climate destruction,\" the report said.       </p><p>Both arguments have gotten mixed receptions from judges.       </p><p>Many of the cases spent years bogged down in debate about whether they should proceed in state courts (where they were filed) or be moved to federal courts (where oil companies anticipate they would be more likely to prevail). The oil companies argue that the matters fall under federal law.       </p><p>Two recent attempts to get the Supreme Court to review the cases have failed. In one, oil companies had petitioned the justices to review a ruling by the State Supreme Court of Hawaii that a lawsuit brought by Honolulu could proceed in state court.       </p><p>The other was a more unusual request, by attorneys general in Republican-led states including Mr. Wilson, the South Carolina attorney general, to block Democratic-led states from suing oil companies over climate change. However, observers expect the high court to revisit the matter in the future, once the cases have progressed in state courts.       </p><p>The claims in the three dozen or so lawsuits vary, but generally include allegations like violations of consumer protection laws, deception and public nuisance. None have gone to trial yet.

Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 10, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

The company is positioned as a long-term partner to major fastener manufacturers.</p><p>Since its acquisition by Tikehau Capital in June 2021 as part of its private equity aerospace strategy, Brown Europe has significantly expanded its business and contributed to the post- Covid recovery of the aerospace sector. This growth, which has been particularly sustained in Europe, has been accompanied by a strengthening of the management team, local recruitment and significant investment in the company's buildings and industrial facilities.</p><p>Now at a new level of development, Brown Europe is well positioned to benefit from a new strategic partner, as it seeks to diversify its customer base internationally, expand its product portfolio and capabilities and reduce supply chain risks. STS Metals' ambitions for the company align perfectly with these goals.</p><p>\"This transaction would mark the first divestment of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace, confirming our leadership in the aerospace and defence sector, where we invest in niche players with leading market positions and support their growth.</p><p>SECTION 3 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; Bond Yield of 3.38%:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.86% is 1.14 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.38%.

These species are crucial to Europe's forests, and their potential loss could disrupt forest ecosystems.<br/><br/><br/>The study shows that certain life-history traits, such as wood density, leaf area, and seed mass, are key predictors of how tree species will adapt to or suffer from climate change.<br/><br/><br/>Species with larger leaves, high wood density, and low height tend to fare better under future climate conditions.<br/><br/><br/>The availability of water during the warmest quarter is critical for tree growth, and droughts will exacerbate the problem, especially in more continental climates like Eastern Europe. This will affect reproductive success and increase tree mortality rates.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dramatic shift in forest management</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>The study suggests forest management strategies to shift from managing conifer-dominated forests to mixed or broadleaved forests, as the latter are more resilient to changing climate conditions.<br/><br/><br/>To maintain forest productivity and stability, transitioning to multi-species, age-diverse forests is recommended, even if they have lower timber production. This approach will increase resilience to climate extremes, such as droughts and heat waves.<br/><br/><br/>However, the study argues that the shift from conifer to broadleaved forests could lead to significant biodiversity loss, impacting species dependent on coniferous ecosystems, including certain rare plants and fungi.<br/><br/><br/>The study highlights that forest changes will affect ecosystem services, such as wood production, air purification, and flood prevention. Deciduous forests, for example, reflect more sunlight, which could slightly slow down regional warming, but the broader ecosystem consequences are negative.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest management adaptation</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Introducing non-native species to fill gaps left by vulnerable trees may not work long-term, as they will also struggle with changing climate.<br/><br/><br/>Some species are already showing similar responses to extreme droughts and heatwaves, indicating that they, too, may not thrive in the future climate.<br/><br/><br/>That is why the study stresses the urgency of implementing adaptive forest management strategies, especially considering the earlier-than-expected changes.<br/><br/><br/>Rather than focusing solely on timber production, forest management should prioritise forest resilience, ensuring that ecosystems remain functional despite climate shifts.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benefits of climate adaptation</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>A recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3005~35f938a452.en.pdf\">working paper</url> published by the European Central Bank (ECB) addressing the urgent and complex challenge of climate adaptation, particularly in Europe, highlights the need for immediate action due to accelerating global temperatures and increasing climate-related extreme events.<br/><br/><br/>Despite climate adaptation being hindered by a lack of clear understanding of what it entails, inadequate policy frameworks, and an unclear financial taxonomy, it benefits forest management by avoiding damages, generating economic gains, and providing socio-environmental benefits.<br/><br/><br/>Adaptation focuses on managing and reducing the impacts of climate change, in contrast to mitigation, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Effective adaptation requires dynamic, context-specific strategies that minimise damages, build resilience, and support economic stability.<br/><br/><br/>While the Paris Agreement set a global adaptation goal, commitments remain vaguely defined, mentions the paper. In Europe, the EU Climate Law mandates progress on adaptation, but legal obligations are still evolving, and climate litigation is rising.<br/><br/><br/>The financing gap for adaptation is substantial, with public sector contributions dominating and private investments lagging. Innovative financial instruments (catastrophe bonds, green bonds) are emerging to close the gap, but insurance coverage for high-risk regions is still insufficient.<br/><br/><br/>The paper urges immediate and substantial coordination, investment, and innovation to scale up adaptation efforts. Legal frameworks and financial innovations are critical to minimising the socioeconomic and environmental risks posed by a warming planet.<br/><br/><br/>It also stresses the need for more granular data, improved climate risk forecasting, and a holistic approach to economic governance and finance to align adaptation with broader climate and development goals.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/europes-conifer-trees-severely-impacted-by-climate-change-urgent-action-needed/\">Europe's conifer trees severely impacted by climate change; urgent action needed</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com\">Euractiv</url>.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["That is why the study stresses the urgency of implementing adaptive forest management strategies, especially considering the earlier-than-expected changes.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 10, Source: Company Website, 324 words </p><p>July 07: Tikehau Capital raises EUR1 billion to support Egis' next phase of growth, with backing from an Apollo S3 / ADIA consortium and Neuberger Berman as co-lead investors</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, announces a capital raise for its portfolio company Egis, reaffirming its long-term commitment to supporting the company's international expansion. This transaction marks the launch of Tikehau Capital's first private equity continuation fund dedicated to Egis, with a size exceeding EUR1 billion. The fund aims to support Egis' growth trajectory and accelerate its global development, particularly through strategic acquisitions. This investment is backed by the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy, as well as a leading group of investors including as co-lead investors: - A consortium comprising of Apollo S3 and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (\"ADIA\") and - Neuberger Berman (managed funds on behalf of clients). This transaction marks the fourth investment made through the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation. With this transaction, the second vintage has surpassed EUR2 billion in capital raised, just one year after its first closing, reaching a size 1.5 times larger than its predecessor. Egis is a global leader in architecture, consulting, engineering, construction and mobility services. The company designs, develops and operates smart infrastructure and buildings that address climate change challenges while fostering more balanced, sustainable and resilient development. Tikehau Capital initially acquired from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) a control position in Egis in January 2022 through the first vintage of its flagship private equity decarbonisation strategy to support Egis' objectives of executing strategic acquisitions to expand internationally. Egis exceeded the growth targets it set out in 2022 several years ahead of plan; and since then it has more than doubled its EBITDA and exceeded its revenue targets, with revenue surpassing EUR2.2 billion in 2024.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 10, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments. The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses.

The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 4 of 10, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

This strategy has raised almost 4001million euros over its two vintages and has now invested 150 million euros in 16 companies including Trustpair, Chapsvision and Egerie in France and VMRay in Germany</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 10 of 10, Source: Company Website, 316 words </p><p>July 25 2024: Tikehau Capital has entered into exclusive discussions to sell Brown Europe to STS Metals, a portfolio company of Tinicum</p><p>Paris, 25 July 2024 - Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, is pleased to announce that STS Metals, a manufacturer of titanium, stainless steel, nickel-based and other specialty alloys, has entered into exclusive discussions to acquire its portfolio company Brown Europe, a specialist in wire drawing of high-performance alloys for the aerospace industry.</p><p>Brown Europe is a leading European player in its markets, specialising in the production of wires and bars in alloy steels, stainless steels and superalloys, mainly for the manufacturing of fasteners used in aerospace applications. The company operates two facilities in France: one in Brive-la-Gaillarde and another in Laval-de-Cere. Over the past 39 years of operations, Brown Europe has developed specialised expertise in wire drawing and processing. The company is positioned as a long-term partner to major fastener manufacturers.</p><p>Since its acquisition by Tikehau Capital in June 2021 as part of its private equity aerospace strategy, Brown Europe has significantly expanded its business and contributed to the post- Covid recovery of the aerospace sector. This growth, which has been particularly sustained in Europe, has been accompanied by a strengthening of the management team, local recruitment and significant investment in the company's buildings and industrial facilities.</p><p>Now at a new level of development, Brown Europe is well positioned to benefit from a new strategic partner, as it seeks to diversify its customer base internationally, expand its product portfolio and capabilities and reduce supply chain risks. STS Metals' ambitions for the company align perfectly with these goals.</p><p>\"This transaction would mark the first divestment of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace, confirming our leadership in the aerospace and defence sector, where we invest in niche players with leading market positions and support their growth.</p><p>SECTION 3 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; Bond Yield of 3.4%:</p><p>The dividend yield of 4.0% is 1.18 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.4%.

The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses. This marks the first investment under the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace and defense, and the 15th portfolio investment since the strategy's launch in 2020. This strategy is designed to support small and mid-sized aerospace companies in scaling their operations, adapting to market changes, accelerating digitalization, and advancing their transition towards more sustainable practices. J.P. Morgan is supporting Tikehau Capital via a unitranche financing to underpin this significant transaction in the European aerospace and defense landscape. Founded in 1980, ScioTeq has built a strong reputation for designing and manufacturing high- performance visualization and computing systems for demanding environments. Its product portfolio addresses Avionics, Defense and Security, and Air Traffic Control, and supports leading global defense contractors and aerospace manufacturers. Headquartered in Belgium, the Group operates additional production sites in France and the United States, and has commercial offices in India and Singapore, enabling it to serve customers across Europe, North America, and Asia. Since 2021, ScioTeq has been backed by OpenGate Capital (\"OpenGate\"), a private equity firm headquartered in both New York and Paris, which will retain a minority stake alongside Tikehau Capital to support the next phase of ScioTeq's growth.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 10, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 10, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

Our strategy positions us well to achieve sustainable growth, supported by ongoing investments and strategic acquisitions which are strengthening our position in key growth markets. With a record-high backlog and strong pipeline, our medium- to long-term prospects remain solid and we continue to be on track to meet our strategic targets for 2024-2026.\"</p><p>KEY FIGURES</p><p>1) Underlying growth excl. impact of FX, acquisitions, footprint reductions, winddowns or divestments2) EBIT(D)A excluding restructuring, integration, acquisition, and divestment costs3) Free cash flow: cash flow from operations adjusted for capex and lease liabilities4) Book-to-bill: net order intake / net revenues</p><p>INCOME STATEMENTNet revenues totaled (EURO)972 million with flat organic growth and a foreign exchange impact of +1.1%. Growth was driven by our key markets in the US and Germany, offset by a slowdown in infrastructure spending in the UK and Australia, and continued volatility in clients' short-term spending on the back of government policy uncertainties. Non-operating costs totaled (EURO)22 million driven by right-sizing and restructuring efforts mainly in the UK and Australia.</p><p>ORDER INTAKE &amp; BACKLOGBacklog totaled (EURO)3.7 billion (Q1'24: (EURO)3.3 billion) with an organic growth of 2.8% in the quarter. Client demand for Resilience solutions remained strong, though this was slightly tempered by Places, as some clients took longer to make larger capex decisions in the current market environment. Mobility order intake reflected typical lumpiness, while visibility remains strong, supported by several significant project opportunities in the pipeline for the years ahead. Our project pipeline remains strong across all Global Business Areas (GBAs) with a focus on enhancing our position in high-growth markets.</p><p>BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues\u00a0was 12.9% (Q1'24: 11.6%) and Days Sales Outstanding\u00a0(DSO) was 67 days (Q1'24: 64\u00a0days) mainly driven by the planned ERP roll-out of the remaining part of the North American business. Free cash flow in the quarter was (EURO)-138 million (Q1'24: (EURO)-97 million), which was in line with seasonal trends and the year-on-year difference was mostly driven by the timing of some annual software payments.</p><p>OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTSRESILIENCE</p><p>The demand for our Resilience solutions remains strong, particularly in North America, Germany and the Netherlands, with Water Optimization, Climate Adaptation, and Energy Transition serving as key growth drivers. While some large remediation projects are concluding, other significant capital programs, such as AMP8 in the UK, are starting, and we continue to focus on high-growth, high-value offerings that enhance backlog quality. In the US, the water market is experiencing increased activity, with changes in regulations and funding schemes creating additional pipeline opportunities.</p><p>PLACES</p><p>Places revenues were impacted by clients in the industrial manufacturing sector taking longer to finalize large capex decisions, alongside overall softness in the UK market. However, pharmaceutical clients announced significant expansions in their investment programs in the US, creating promising pipeline opportunities. Government clients continued to deliver strong results, driven by sustained demand in healthcare and education. Momentum in the data center sector remains strong. The acquisition of KUA Group in Germany, announced and completed this quarter, further strengthens our capabilities in the European data center market, solidifying our position in this high-growth sector.</p><p>MOBILITY</p><p>The Mobility market remains strong in the US, Germany and the Netherlands offset by a slowdown in infrastructure spending in the UK and Australia. The ramp up of significant contract wins secured in the second half of last year is progressing as planned. However, this has created a temporary gap as the new projects ramp up while existing projects, including major programs in the UK and Australia, are ramping down. As we realign resources and reposition parts of the business, delivery is more phased than in the past, reflecting the growing scale of our projects and contributing to a softer first quarter. Additional opportunities entered the pipeline, particularly from government investments in Germany and the US, and from the recent WSP Infrastructure Engineering acquisition. We are well positioned for future growth from our strong backlog and pipeline, underpinned by our global expertise and continued investment in talent and capabilities.</p><p>INTELLIGENCE</p><p>Revenues were supported by our integrated digital real-time asset monitoring solution Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) for North American Key Clients, while organic growth was moderated by some awards being delayed to later into the year. We secured substantial wins for parking management software, HotSpot, securing future revenue for the year, but not recorded in order intake yet, in accordance with our accounting policies. Integrating Intelligence solutions into other GBAs' offerings continues to act as a strong differentiator in securing large projects, and we see ample opportunity to further extend Intelligence products to Key Clients.</p><p>2024-2026 STRATEGY \"ACCELERATING A PLANET POSITIVE FUTURE\"\u00a0On 16 November 2023, Arcadis presented its 2024-2026 Strategy \"Accelerating a planet positive future\" and its 2026 financial targets; these include: organic net revenue growth of mid to high single digits over the cycle, operating EBITA margin of 12.5% in 2026, Net Debt / Operating EBITDA of 1.5-2.5x with an Investment Grade credit rating and a dividend payout ratio of 30-40% of Net Income from Operations.</p><p>FINANCIAL CALENDAR\u00a0</p><p>16 May 2025 - Annual General Meeting of Shareholders31 July 2025 - Second Quarter and Half Year 2025 Results30 October 2025 - Third Quarter 2025 Trading Update</p><p>Arcadis IR investor calendar:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lzEI7tq43mSRwuPHBJpwMNgCoS2Vhj50kmWllrpjXo-9tbs4qJIp-faT-wYqfUIznOVnvl8lfZR40DcWLG57mDgeQE0zDYZ4V9UinCKu-R2TC7_beW5kXzYxwiFlv1PqVimGS_5Qhkd4X0epYqjYWjtkdDIuVjl_gYVNC2icEujmR7uI03Jn9YfN1Ze-8f4Z\">https://www.arcadis.com/en/investors/investor-calendar</url></p><p>ARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine Disch | +31 (0)615376020 |<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4mil-weyOKgUdXfillHTHXvNP1i7Nj54mT9gvlizXwjoWNaV9urLFYdw8twrCQCASt3KI1mZGhDhuwrAYWFuuFGohDIj8DEJopR1GfZJBpC2rOEPLDVVs3VAHpUfz1Hr\">christine.disch@arcadis.com</url></p><p>ANALYST WEBCAST\u00a0\u00a0Today at 14:00 CEST<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lzEI7tq43mSRwuPHBJpwMNgCoS2Vhj50kmWllrpjXo-9tbs4qJIp-faT-wYqfUIznOVnvl8lfZR40DcWLG57mPd_W2h4veDmPPAWDztKoqtHnSKOmK1G8mVUExLaiCvUR-eXS90848Q33Vz-7OjI_7Jlil2tWVJjGAWqCArvxIM6r3mrx1ATMYFFtmDJygkVGFeWMwQ07l7qf55C_vbZL2Vq591gZ-jm6afUKZPB5k5PwrU-aT1YtnZ6gRN7IER3S_CE53Rz2w6sYpQNLYU6Ww==\">https://www.arcadis.com/en/investors/investor-calendar/2025/q1-2025-trading-update</url></p><p>ABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the world's leading company delivering data-driven sustainable design, engineering, and consultancy solutions for natural and built assets.

The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses. This marks the first investment under the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace and defense, and the 15th portfolio investment since the strategy's launch in 2020. This strategy is designed to support small and mid-sized aerospace companies in scaling their operations, adapting to market changes, accelerating digitalization, and advancing their transition towards more sustainable practices. J.P. Morgan is supporting Tikehau Capital via a unitranche financing to underpin this significant transaction in the European aerospace and defense landscape. Founded in 1980, ScioTeq has built a strong reputation for designing and manufacturing high- performance visualization and computing systems for demanding environments. Its product portfolio addresses Avionics, Defense and Security, and Air Traffic Control, and supports leading global defense contractors and aerospace manufacturers.

The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 12, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 10, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 10, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments.

property for conversion into service apartment complex</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, and Dunman Capital Partners, the Frankfurt-based real estate investor, today announce the acquisition of a centrally located property on Querstrasse in Frankfurt city centre, with the intention of transforming it into a service appointment apartment complex. The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>3.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 10, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 10, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments. The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses. This marks the first investment under the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace and defense, and the 15th portfolio investment since the strategy's launch in 2020. This strategy is designed to support small and mid-sized aerospace companies in scaling their operations, adapting to market changes, accelerating digitalization, and advancing their transition towards more sustainable practices. J.P. Morgan is supporting Tikehau Capital via a unitranche financing to underpin this significant transaction in the European aerospace and defense landscape. Founded in 1980, ScioTeq has built a strong reputation for designing and manufacturing high- performance visualization and computing systems for demanding environments. Its product portfolio addresses Avionics, Defense and Security, and Air Traffic Control, and supports leading global defense contractors and aerospace manufacturers. Headquartered in Belgium, the Group operates additional production sites in France and the United States, and has commercial offices in India and Singapore, enabling it to serve customers across Europe, North America, and Asia. Since 2021, ScioTeq has been backed by OpenGate Capital (\"OpenGate\"), a private equity firm headquartered in both New York and Paris, which will retain a minority stake alongside Tikehau Capital to support the next phase of ScioTeq's growth.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 10, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

This sale is the first divestment of Brienne III, the first vintage of the Group's private equity strategy dedicated to cybersecurity.

This has driven sustained margin expansion and further strengthened our strong market positions. In a fast-changing environment, we have been able to secure a record order intake providing long term visibility and anchoring our positions with our key clients. We continue to see sustained commercial momentum on long term projects despite increased volatility from geopolitical uncertainty following a high number of elections in 2024 weighing on short-term spending patterns. In 2025, we will accelerate the investments in our strategy implementation.

Good order intake in the quarter was driven by Resilience and Places, while Mobility fell slightly following a very strong third quarter with multiple large, multi-year wins. Operating EBITA margin improved to a record fourth quarter high of 12.6% (Q4'23: 11.4%) driven by an optimized portfolio and a higher Global Excellence Centers (GEC) contribution.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REVIEW OF THE FULL YEAR 2024: PROFIT &amp; LOSS ITEMS AND BACKLOG</emphasis>Net revenues totaled (EURO)3.9 billion with an organic growth of 5%, reflecting good growth in Energy Transition, Climate Adaptation and Intelligent Highway solutions while being offset by the impact of increased selectivity in project pursuits. The operating EBITA margin increased to 11.5% (2023: 10.4%) driven by continued focus on sustainable project choices, a higher GEC contribution and internal efficiencies from standardization and automation efforts. Non-operating costs were (EURO)29 million driven by portfolio optimizations and merging of our offices.</p><p>Net financing expenses were (EURO)53 million (2023: (EURO)65 million), decreasing year on year as a result of an increased net derivative asset position. Net Income increased by 52% to (EURO)243 million (2023: (EURO)160 million) leading to a record EPS of (EURO)2.70. Net Income from Operations (NIfO) increased by 20% to (EURO)270 million (2023: (EURO)226 million), or (EURO)3.00 per share (2023: (EURO)2.51), as a result of improved performance.</p><p>Backlog Net Revenues ended at a record (EURO)3.7 billion resulting in an organic growth of 16%. A record order intake of (EURO)4.4 billion was driven by projects for clients in Mobility, Technology, Energy Transition and Climate Adaptation, and resulted in a Book-to-Bill of 1.14x for the year. Our strong backlog position and growing project pipeline are providing significant visibility on future performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RESILIENCE</emphasis></p><p>Resilience performance continued to be strong in the fourth quarter of 2024 with ongoing selectivity towards Key Clients in high growth markets, capitalizing on Arcadis' market positions. Despite elections and geopolitical events, our key markets US and Europe remained healthy with good wins in Energy Transition and PFAS supporting strong order intake, while significant pipeline opportunities emerged in Climate Adaptation. During 2024 we were awarded 8 AMP8 framework agreements in the UK, which will support our order intake and net revenues in coming years, with investments to accelerate over the respective cycle of 2025-2030. A significant improvement in margin was driven by an improved project portfolio and automation &amp; standardization in our project pursuit process, in line with our priorities for the first year of our strategic cycle for 2024-2026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PLACES</emphasis></p><p>Places revenue was strong for the full year for Canada and Continental Europe, while being offset by further repositioning of the portfolio through selectivity and our focus on high end solutions. At the same time this resulted in a sustained operating margin expansion. Strong order intake development was driven by good wins in the data center, semiconductor and public facilities space. AI investments and the subsequent need for increased energy and water supply in the technology sector are fueling the demand for our sustainable and integrated solutions and driving significant pipeline opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOBILITY</emphasis></p><p>Mobility recorded strong revenue growth for the full year driven by sizeable project delivery in the US as well as through leveraging of our European workforces' skillset and GEC engagement. Quarterly growth was impacted by a number of current large projects coming to their end, while at the same time we commenced the initial phases of large, multi-year projects won earlier in 2024. The significant order intake resulted in improved visibility on future performance, while increased investments across our key geographies drive additional pipeline opportunities. The Mobility business achieved solid margin improvement, driven by a higher GEC contribution, internal efficiencies from standardization and automation efforts, while absorbing sizeable investments in the digital space.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTELLIGENCE</emphasis></p><p>Intelligence started accelerating its investments in product strategy and development, technology platform harmonization, advanced data analytics and AI. The leveraging of existing client relationships and integration of Intelligence solutions into offerings from other GBAs continued to act as a differentiator in winning large-scale projects, such as AMP8 wins in the UK, Fraser River Tunnel in Canada and the Georgia Department of Transportation in the US.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOW</emphasis></p><p>We achieved Net Working Capital as percentage of annualized quarterly gross revenues\u00a0of 10.8% (2023:\u00a09.3%). As a result, Days Sales Outstanding\u00a0(DSO) was 61 days (2023: 56\u00a0days). Free cash flow was (EURO)183 million for the quarter resulting in (EURO)228 million for the full year (2023: (EURO)190 million), driven by improved performance and disciplined net working capital management. The strong cash performance resulted in further deleveraging from 1.7x Net debt / operating EBITDA in 2023 to 1.3x for 2024, below the strategic target range of 1.5 - 2.5x. Net debt decreased to (EURO)739 million (2023: (EURO)873 million) and includes a (EURO)51 million share buyback program for long term incentive purposes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COST SYNERGIES FROM IBI AND DPS ACQUISITION MATERIALIZED</emphasis></p><p>Cost synergy realization from IBI and DPS acquisitions in 2022 has materialized well in line with expectations to (EURO)20 million (2023 year end: (EURO)5 million) through the rationalization in workplaces, IT integration and technology platform improvements, as well as the rationalization of overheads, insurance and support driving operational synergies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACQUISITION OF KUA GROUP</emphasis>On 12 February 2025, Arcadis entered into a definitive agreement to purchase KUA Group (KUA) for (EURO)70 million on a cash and debt free basis, representing ~8x KUA's 2024 EBITDA. KUA is one of Germany's leaders in complex data center design and excels in architecture, design and engineering, and planning and permitting services. These capabilities complement Arcadis' strengths in site selection due diligence, program and cost management, and sustainability advisory.</p><p>KUA has successfully delivered significant growth, nearly doubling its revenue over the last 3 years. Germany, the second largest data center market in Europe, is seeing accelerated growth of AI investments. Data centers are a key growth area for Arcadis' Places and Resilience GBAs, and this acquisition will significantly enhance our position in the European market creating substantial revenue synergy opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024-2026 Strategy \"accelerating a planet positive future\"</emphasis>On 16th November 2023 Arcadis presented its 2024-2026 Strategy \"Accelerating a planet positive future\" and its 2026 targets.

The asset, originally constructed in 1990, offers approximately 8,000 square metres of usable space. It will undergo a comprehensive refurbishment, once existing leases expire as scheduled over the next two years. Upon completion, the project will comprise approximately 172 units designed to accommodate both long-term stays and traditional hotel operators. The project is part of Tikehau Capital's pan-European value-add real estate strategy and represents the third investment of the second fund vintage in Germany. The project is financed through an Article 9 fund, in accordance with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Sustainability and ESG criteria are central components of the development approach, with the aim of significantly increasing the property's energy efficiency and ensuring its long-term usability. Dunman Capital Partners brings extensive expertise in revitalising existing properties. The company specialises in mixed-use urban properties and handles local project management. \"With this investment, we are sending a clear signal for sustainable urban development and future-oriented living concepts in German cities\", says Steffen Meinshausen, Head of Real Estate Germany at Tikehau Capital. \"This project reflects our ambition to revitalise existing buildings in a way that enhances energy performance, supports mixed-use living and aligns with our broader Article 9 investment strategy.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 2 THE PAST YEAR: PRESS RELEASES</p><p>2.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire</p><p>Press Release article 1 of 13, Source: Company Website, 262 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital, Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group join forces to launch a private equity fund dedicated to European defense and security, available through life insurance and retirement savings products</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, in partnership with Societe Generale Assurances, CNP Assurances and CARAC Group, three leading insurers, announces the launch of an innovative private equity fund dedicated to the strategic sectors of defense, cybersecurity and European security. The fund, structured mainly around private equity strategies managed by Tikehau Capital1, will be available as unit-linked products in the life insurance and retirement savings policies of the three partners from September 2025. Initiated by Tikehau Capital, this Article 8 fund has an initial commitment of 150 million euros, invested in equal parts by the three partner insurers. This capital contribution reflects their shared desire to support the strengthening of French and European industrial and technological capabilities, against a backdrop of growing challenges to strategic autonomy in defense and security. The aim is to support the emergence of future European leaders, while promoting job creation and economic dynamism in France and Europe. The strategic sectors of aeronautics and cybersecurity, which are essential to our defense, will receive particular attention because of the size and growth momentum of their markets. Many high-potential companies in these fields are also distinguished by the dual nature of their activities, both civilian and military - a factor that strengthens their resilience and encourages cross-fertilization between defense and civilian industries.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 13, Source: Company Website, 294 words </p><p>June 16: Tikehau Capital enters into exclusive discussions to acquire ScioTeq, a European leader in advanced visualization and computing solutions</p><p>Tikehau Capital, a global alternative asset manager, announces it has entered into exclusive discussions for the acquisition of ScioTeq, a Belgium-based provider of rugged, high-performance display systems and mission-critical electronics that support situational awareness in the most demanding environments. The transaction is being executed through Tikehau Capital's dedicated private equity aerospace and defense strategy, which supports the growth, modernization, and ownership transition of high- potential industrial businesses. This marks the first investment under the second vintage of Tikehau Capital's private equity strategy dedicated to aerospace and defense, and the 15th portfolio investment since the strategy's launch in 2020. This strategy is designed to support small and mid-sized aerospace companies in scaling their operations, adapting to market changes, accelerating digitalization, and advancing their transition towards more sustainable practices. J.P. Morgan is supporting Tikehau Capital via a unitranche financing to underpin this significant transaction in the European aerospace and defense landscape. Founded in 1980, ScioTeq has built a strong reputation for designing and manufacturing high- performance visualization and computing systems for demanding environments. Its product portfolio addresses Avionics, Defense and Security, and Air Traffic Control, and supports leading global defense contractors and aerospace manufacturers. Headquartered in Belgium, the Group operates additional production sites in France and the United States, and has commercial offices in India and Singapore, enabling it to serve customers across Europe, North America, and Asia. Since 2021, ScioTeq has been backed by OpenGate Capital (\"OpenGate\"), a private equity firm headquartered in both New York and Paris, which will retain a minority stake alongside Tikehau Capital to support the next phase of ScioTeq's growth.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 13, Source: Company Website, 180 words </p><p>June 05: Tikehau Capital launches its first ELTIF 2.0 semi-liquid private debt fund</p><p>Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group, announces the launch of Tikehau European Private Credit (TEPC)1, its first semi-liquid private debt fund for private investors2 accessible outside French life insurance.

Tikehau Capital's investment in November 2020 has played a key role in accelerating the growth of Preligens, which has increased revenues tenfold (from EUR3 million to nearly EUR30 million), expanded operations in the US and Asia, and now employs around 250 people, including 140 R&amp;D engineers. This sale is the first divestment of Brienne III, the first vintage of the Group's private equity strategy dedicated to cybersecurity. This strategy has raised almost 4001million euros over its two vintages and has now invested 150 million euros in 16 companies including Trustpair, Chapsvision and Egerie in France and VMRay in Germany</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>Press Release article 9 of 13, Source: Company Website, 316 words </p><p>July 25 2024: Tikehau Capital has entered into exclusive discussions to sell Brown Europe to STS Metals, a portfolio company of Tinicum</p><p>Paris, 25 July 2024 - Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset manager, is pleased to announce that STS Metals, a manufacturer of titanium, stainless steel, nickel-based and other specialty alloys, has entered into exclusive discussions to acquire its portfolio company Brown Europe, a specialist in wire drawing of high-performance alloys for the aerospace industry.</p><p>Brown Europe is a leading European player in its markets, specialising in the production of wires and bars in alloy steels, stainless steels and superalloys, mainly for the manufacturing of fasteners used in aerospace applications.

Why should pro-Hamas South Africa, Beijing's point country in Africa, receive billions of dollars in aid from us? We should support our friends instead.'</p><p>The comments come after President Trump on 7 February suspended bilateral aid to South Africa over legislation that allows the expropriation of white farmers' land in limited circumstances.</p><p>Primorac also tore into President Daniel Chapo's disputed election in Mozambique.</p><p>'The government, just two months before we came here, provided their port in order to allow the Chinese navy to project their power into the western Indian Ocean,' he said. 'So there has to be a much better affinity between what we do on the development aid side and diplomacy.'</p><p>Pressed on the issue during a break in the hearing, Mast said he agreed aid should be dictated by political considerations.</p><p>'If these are policies of diplomacy, right, there's a transaction to that diplomacy, right? They need something. We want to help with that hand up, but there's something that we need from the country or region as well,' Mast told The Africa Report.</p><p>'And if we're being taken for granted, and their partner is China, they're going to learn, as I've said to many, that they don't know how good they had it until it's gone.'</p><p>Pushing back</p><p>'Absolutely ridiculous.' 'Utter nonsense.' 'Not accurate.'</p><p>The Democrats' witness, former USAID chief Andrew Natsios, did not mince words when asked about accusations by Trump and his government overhauler-in-chief Musk that USAID was a fundamentally corrupt agency.</p><p>A conservative who served as administrator under President George W. Bush, Natsios said he eliminated dozens of programmes Republicans did not agree with during his time in office without gutting the agency as Musk and Trump are doing now.</p><p>'Humanitarian assistance and health should be done based on need only, not on politics,' he told The Africa Report. 'The rest of the budget should be allocated based on strategic interests.'</p><p>He called abandoning countries that don't toe the US line a 'mistake'.</p><p>'The visibility of USAID makes it easier for American diplomats to deal with these countries,' Natsios said. 'The most influential American institution in most of these countries is not the Defence Department or the State Department. It's USAID.'</p><p>By abandoning countries like South Africa and Mozambique, he said, the US would be ceding ground to its rivals.</p><p>'Wherever there are natural resources, the Russians are making these deals, and the Chinese,' he said. 'We should be in there.'</p><p>He also defended the tourism programmes Mast attacked, pointing out that the sector accounts for more than 10% of jobs in Egypt.</p><p>Winners and losers</p><p>Some African governments will no doubt be pleased with the changes at USAID.</p><p>Mast opened the hearing by referencing a recent exchange with Ugandan Ambassador to the US Robie Kakonge, who has criticised USAID support for LGBT initiatives after the country passed its anti-homosexuality law.</p><p>During a debate last month at the US Institute of Peace, he said, Kakonge 'stood up and said, these programmes were not doing anything to improve relations between our nations'.</p><p>African leaders have also opposed the climate programmes that curtail the development of fossil fuels.

At the same time, the growing protection gap, meaning the difference between insured losses and the actual economic damage caused by climate disasters, is an increasingly significant threat to communities, businesses, and economies worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The insurance industry with its capacity to invest, manage risk, and innovate, has a pivotal role to play in helping to address and mitigate the impact of climate change globally. Nevertheless, success will also depend on how well we work with policymakers and other sectors to fully leverage our industry's potential and deliver tangible solutions that can make a difference.</p><p>We must move beyond traditional models of risk transfer and embrace collaborative solutions that protect people, infrastructure, and economies in an increasingly volatile climate. We must also take full advantage of technologies to enhance our perception and evaluation of climatic risks, and to strengthen our resilience and our capability to tackle them effectively. Furthermore, pooling resources and expertise through public-private partnerships is critical to help develop new models that provide more comprehensive and affordable insurance coverage, especially for those most vulnerable to climate-related risks. The latter also includes small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) around the world, which play a crucial role in the global economy as a key lever in driving growth, development, and employment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A growing problem</emphasis></p><p>Climate change has a profound impact on both, our economies and our daily lives with climate-related disasters projected to cause economic losses amounting to $12.5 trillion by 2050. In the same period, climate change is expected to result in approximately 14.5 million additional deaths with climate-induced impacts accounting for a further $1.1 trillion in extra costs to healthcare systems, creating a significant additional burden on already strained infrastructures and medical and human resources (source: World Economic Forum, 2024). Climate change therefore impacts everything from our environment, social aspects, and infrastructure to lives and livelihoods around the world.</p><p>The insurance industry is faced with increasing costs due to more frequent and severe natural disasters, which leads to higher premiums and reduced availability of coverage in high-risk areas. In addition, the global natural catastrophe protection gap widened again in 2023, rising 5.2% to reach an estimated 62% of events being uninsured (source: Swiss Re Institute).</p><p>In this context, as weather hazards intensify due to climate change, risk assessment and insurance solutions need to keep up with the fast-evolving risk landscape and there is an urgent need for action by providing dedicated natural catastrophe (nat-cat) coverage and climate-adaptation insurance products.</p><p>New insurance products will also need to be developed, tailored to cover emerging climate risks. Parametric insurance is one such example. It provides payouts based on predefined weather events, helping to quickly support affected communities and businesses.</p><p>Furthermore, financial inclusion programmes, improving access to insurance in underserved markets, play an important role in ensuring that vulnerable populations have the financial protection they need against climate-related disasters. Similarly, prevention measures are very important to decrease the level of risk exposure to natural disasters whilst helping to raise awareness, support risk mitigation, minimise losses and promote greater sustainability.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Giulio-Terzariol_Generali_15820.jpg\">Link to Image</url><br/>Giulio Terzariol<br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting SMEs</emphasis></p><p>SMEs represent around 90% of all firms globally, accounting for approximately 70% of global employment and contributing up to 70% of global GDP (source: World Economic Forum, 2021). This means that supporting SME resilience against climate risks is vital to ensure the stability of the global economy and our financial system. This includes developing holistic risk management solutions that combine risk transfer and risk mitigation tools, which can be done by bundling insurance products with new technologies and leveraging alternative distribution partners to reach SMEs more effectively.</p><p>At the same time, educational programs are being expanded to help SME owners better understand climate risks and adopt sustainable business practices. As an example, Generali's SME EnterPRIZE initiative has enhanced this commitment, fostering sustainability among SMEs and supporting them in</p><p>building climate-resilient business models. In many European countries, including Italy, regulatory frameworks have also evolved to mandate catastrophic risk insurance for businesses. This marks an important step forward in educating, raising awareness and protecting SMEs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role of insurers</emphasis></p><p>Long-term global competitiveness of Europe depends on accelerating both green and digital transitions to meet the twin goals of decarbonising the economy and integrating advanced technologies into our industries. The insurance industry has a significant role in facilitating this transformation, leveraging its expertise in risk management and long-term investment. However, achieving this transition requires significant financial resources. The 2024 Mario Draghi report estimates that Europe would need between (EURO)750 to 800 billion in additional annual investments to remain competitive on the global scale and make the green, digital and social transition a reality.</p><p>The insurance industry, as a long-term investor, manages over (EURO)10 trillion in assets (source: Insurance Europe, 2023-2024 annual report), and is well-positioned to direct these resources towards sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy projects, and technological innovations that enhance productivity and reduce environmental impact. Yet, releasing this potential requires clearer regulatory frameworks, alongside public-private partnerships to mobilise the necessary financing. It is also crucial to establish a level playing field with other financial services actors that fully recognises insurers' long-term horizon.</p><p>The time for concrete and practical solutions that address the ever-increasing climate protection gap is now. Through our Lifetime Partner 27 strategy, Generali remains committed to addressing the climate protection gap, leveraging global expertise to drive innovation, enhance resilience, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

The overall utilization of the fleet was higher compared to 2023, with a particularly busy year for the crane vessels and heavy marine transport fleet. The division benefitted from healthy demand in both the offshore wind and traditional oil &amp; gas markets, with good project execution. Approximately 50% of revenue was related to offshore wind projects. The most significant foundation installation projects were located along the US East Coast. Subsea Cables had a busy 12 months following a couple of relatively quiet years, with sizable projects in Germany and the Netherlands.</p><p>Our Heavy Marine Transport and Marine Services business units completed some high-profile projects. A large FPSO was disconnected and towed from Brazil to a European recycling yard. The BOKA Vanguard transported the FPSO Opportunity to Turkey and then collected the stripped-down Fremantle Highway - a car carrier that Boskalis salvaged in the summer of 2023 - in Rotterdam for delivery in China. Early in 2024, Boskalis acquired eight large oceangoing tugs from ALP Maritime. These vessels were very busy in their first year at Boskalis and are proving to be extremely versatile.</p><p>Subsea Services and Marine Survey again made strong contributions.

At the same time, we raise our full-year guidance to a profit after tax of DKK 11.00-11.75 billion. This means that we expect profit for 2024 to exceed profit for 2023, which was Nykredit's best year so far. For the fourth consecutive year, we are set to deliver our best full-year performance to date, which only goes to show that Nykredit is stronger than ever. The final full-year financial results will in part depend on the global economic outlook, which is impacted by a generally tense geopolitical landscape that continues to add some uncertainty about the economy and our operating conditions.Our good performance is chiefly driven by continued growth and increasing market shares across the board. Over the year, Nykredit Bank has grown its lending volumes to personal and business customers alike, and the Group has increased its mortgage lending to homeowners and business customers. Furthermore, Wealth Management's assets under management have increased. Our performance also reflects the sound financial health of our customers, leading to a reversal of impairment charges for the period. Moreover, we have managed to maintain a relatively steady cost/income ratio.During the period under review, financial market tailwinds had a positive impact on the Group's investment portfolio income, leading to a satisfactory return on equity. We benefited less than our competitors from the higher interest rate level, as mortgage lending accounts for a significantly larger part of Nykredit's business volumes than banking. At the same time, we have chosen to lower the cost of borrowing for our customers to reflect Danmarks Nationalbank's interest rate cuts during the year. Thanks to our good results, Nykredit and Totalkredit are well placed to support our customers and foster development and growth all over Denmark.In Nykredit Bank, we have reduced the interest rates on a number of loan products by 0.75 percentage points during the year. We see this as the right thing to do as a customer-owned bank. We therefore offer attractive interest rates on both deposits and loans, especially for home purchases, energy renovation and climate adaptation. In early 2024, we raised the KundeKroner discount on customers' administration margin payments on mortgage loans to 0.20% from 0.15%, which has made it even more attractive for our Totalkredit customers to finance their homes with us. By offering attractive value propositions we continue to demonstrate to our customers all the advantages of banking with a customer-owned financial provider.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Highlights from the Q1-Q3 Interim Report 2024:</emphasis></p><p>Nykredit has recorded a return on average equity of 12% for Q1-Q3/2024.Nykredit Bank's lending increased to DKK 99.9 billion at end-September 2024 from DKK 92.2 billion at end-September 2023.Totalkredit's mortgage lending increased to DKK 895.8 billion at end-September 2024 from DKK 876.2 billion at end-September 2023.Assets under management by Nykredit Wealth Management were up 19% on Q1-Q3/2023 to DKK 513.6 billion at end-September 2024.Nykredit's cost/income ratio was 31.1% in Q1-Q3/2024 and has decreased compared to the same period last year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact:</emphasis>For further comments, please contact Orhan G\u00f6kcen, Head of Press Relations, tel +45 31 21 06 39.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/f48e26b3-f8d7-48e4-9458-d3fc4a2692c5\">Nykredit_Realkredit_Group_Q3_24_2024-11-07_EN</url></p>", "publisher": "GlobeNewswire - English", "instances": ["75 percentage points during the year.

We continue to see good opportunities in our project pipeline driven by stimulus fund allocations, including public investments in universities and hospitals, and reshoring of industrial manufacturing facilities.</p><p>MOBILITY</p><p>The significant order intake for Mobility resulted from large multi-year wins in North America, the Netherlands and Australia booked in the quarter. We were able to secure these wins on the back of strong client relationships, our integrated cross-GBA offering, and relevant global expertise from comparable programs such as HS2 and Lower Thames Crossing in the UK, the LA Regional Connector in the US, and the Rozelle Interchange tunnel in Australia. These projects will generate revenues for multiple years, providing further visibility on the future performance. This quarter's good revenue growth was driven by sizeable project delivery in the US, leveraging our European workforce's skillset and Global Excellence Center engagement.</p><p>INTELLIGENCE</p><p>Solid revenue growth in North America driven by our Enterprise Decision Analytics (EDA) solution. Integrating Intelligence solutions into our offerings from other GBAs continued to act as a strong differentiator, playing a pivotal role in winning large-scale projects, which was exemplified by the Fraser River Tunnel win.

Climate fallout in Africa cannot be contained so adaptation action can and must scale at breakneck speed across the continent. The world has to double down on adaptation at the UN climate summit in Egypt just weeks away.\"</p><p>He added that \"We need an adaptation delivery breakthrough for Africa at COP27. That means adaptation finance visibly flowing in Africa. It means the financial ask on wealthy nations for the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program and its Upstream Financing Facility is delivered by COP27. If we fail, all the progress of Glasgow's COP is at risk.\"</p><p>The Summit's five-point Communique highlighted that Africa was at a tipping point due to being most exposed to the food crisis triggered by the Ukraine conflict as well as the frontline of the global climate breakdown. It underscored that Success at COP27 will depend on whether the needs of Africa, the world's most climate-vulnerable continent, are met, with finance flowing into key country-led adaptation programs such as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP).</p><p>Macky Sall, President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union said:</p><p>\"You have to adapt or die. We do not have the choice. Our time to act is coming to an end. Africa must prioritize adaptation. Africa needs to invest massively in adaptation and resilience. As Chairperson of the African Union, I urge Africa's development partners to fully fund the AAAP and make it an exemplary model of what is possible when we collaborate. This impact will be enhanced through your support to the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility and the African Development Bank's Climate Action under the ADF Replenishment. The AAAP is what delivers on the vision of the Africa Adaptation Initiative.\"</p><p>\"COP26 marked a breakthrough thanks to your determination to put adaptation on the global agenda by doubling adaptation finance. Now, with your help, we must keep that promise. With your support, the AAAP can make this vision a reality,\" concluded President Macky Sall.</p><p>The Summit highlighted that Africa is warming faster than other regions. Its underlying socio-economic vulnerabilities also mean that nine out of ten of the world's most vulnerable countries are in Africa, where food expenses make up 75% of the income of the continent's poorest groups when more than a fifth of all Africans are already food insecure. The number of Africa's poorest nations at high risk of debt distress has also tripled in the past decade.</p><p>President Akufo Addo of Ghana and Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) said:\u00a0</p><p>\"If we want Africa to thrive, we must adapt to climate change.

Crucially, we expect progress and we expect to see how funds will flow into country-led programs like the AAAP.\"</p><p>President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and co-host of the PreCOP27 said:</p><p>\"We are here because we believe the AAAP is needed not just for Africa, but for the world. When Africa wins, the world wins. We cannot let Africa be held back and undermined by the climate crisis. We need partnership to forge a resilient future. With an African COP this year, we cannot miss out on a win for Africa on climate. To secure that win, we need to at minimum see the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility mobilized, positioning the AAAP to drive the full $25 billion in adaptation projects on the ground.\" He added that \"our Pre-COP meeting in Kinshasa next month aims to springboard the priorities of Africa and the most vulnerable nations to center-stage at COP27. As a part of the Pre-COP we will also host the CVF's high level Forum of Vulnerable Nations event because this is the voice that matters the most in the climate crisis.\"</p><p>Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, said:</p><p>\"The Glasgow decision urges developed countries to collectively double adaptation funding by 2025. This must be delivered in full, as a base line. Developed countries need to provide, by COP27, a clear roadmap of how and when they will deliver on this commitment.\"</p><p>The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations also underscored that delivery on adaptation finance will be a \"litmus test\" for countries honouring their end of the Glasgow Pact, and joined the call for COP27 to deliver a breakthrough on implementation for adaptation.</p><p>The Summit at the GCA's floating headquarters in Rotterdam harbour announced US$55 million in new contributions from the United Kingdom ($23m), Norway ($15m), France ($10m), Denmark ($7m), among other supporters to the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility managed by the GCA, whose 1:100 leverage ratio will influence over 5 billion in climate adaptation investments across Africa. The Upstream Financing Facility was described by GCA Chair and 8<sup>th</sup>Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon as the \"transmission belt\" for the best global and regional knowledge and innovation directly to large-scale investment projects in Africa.</p><p>Donors announcing new funding commitments to the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility at the Summit further commented, as follows:</p><p>President of COP26 Alok Sharma:</p><p>\"COP26 was an important milestone for adaptation, but we have to pick up the pace and turn commitments made in the Glasgow Climate Pact into urgent action if we're to protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>As agreed at COP26, developed nations need to at least collectively double climate adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025.</p><p>Public finance will not be enough, which is why initiatives such as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme are key to mobilising private sector engagement and investment for adaptation.\"</p><p>Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, Minister of International Development, Norway:</p><p>\"Norway has committed to double our climate finance and at least triple support to adaptation by 2026. For Norway, GCA is a key partner in advancing the climate adaptation and food security agenda. We welcome GCA's cooperation with the African Development Bank on the AAAP. AAAP's objectives are fully in line with our priorities. How can we - together - minimize the risk of climate disasters? How can we make food systems more resilient - making the most vulnerable better placed to cope with the next drought, flood or plague? How can we - at the same time - create much needed jobs, especially for the youth? AAAP is definitely an important part of the answer. I would therefore encourage more partners to join our efforts.\"</p><p>Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, Minister of State for Development, Francophonie and International Partnerships, France:</p><p>\"France remains highly committed to tackling climate change and supporting adaptation in African countries.

It suggests that countries develop climate \"adaptation pathways\" that set the direction of travel, combining current and future climate risk data.</p><p>Given current information, the report estimates that the cost of climate adaptation will vary between (EURO)34 to (EURO)110 per person per year, depending on where they live. Total adaptation costs in the European Union up to the 2030s could be between (EURO)15 billion to (EURO)64 billion annually - suggesting a necessary scale of adaptation finance between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent of EU GDP.</p><p>\"Adaptation pathways combine the needs and priorities across all economic and administrative sectors,\" explains Solene Dengler, a senior climate change adaptation specialist with the World Bank who worked on the report.</p><p>\"This means countries need to carry out more and better studies both at national and sectoral levels to identify adaptation gaps, costs, and benefits of adaptation measures and track adaptation expenditures and implementation,\" said Dengler.</p><p>The report concludes several specific case studies such as wildfires and extreme heat in Bulgaria, floods impact transport in Romania, and wildfire prevention in the forestry sector in Sweden.</p><p>But for costs to be correctly estimated so governments can steer financing in the right direction, better data is needed.</p><p>\"There is a lack of information on projected impacts of climate risks for the short to medium term from the 2030s to the 2050s), especially to inform sectoral or investment portfolio assessments,\" says Dengler.</p><p>She remarked: \"Strengthening a country's financial resilience will also require improved macroeconomic modelling that can better capture extreme impacts and take into account adjusted macroeconomic impacts when policymakers are considering a package of adaptation measures. At the EU level, the recent European Climate Risk Assessment and this report are important contributions to this evolving knowledge base.\"</p><p>In the end, neither climate change adaptation nor climate change mitigation strategies should distract from the other, she said, \"Climate change adaptation is complementary to climate change mitigation. Acting on both is economically beneficial, can reduce direct losses from disaster and climate impacts and have broader social and environmental benefits.\"</p><p>The report concludes that a major scale-up of public, private, and blended finance will be necessary and investment planning and financial strategies are not yet adequately informed by an understanding of the costs of climate change adaptation at national and EU levels.</p><p>One area of concern is that too much of the disaster and climate risk is managed through budgetary instruments at the EU level and by EU Member States, with gaps concerning pre-arranged funds and the use of risk transfer mechanisms, such as risk insurance.</p><p>Response operations to wildfires account for approximately one-third of total response costs in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/topics/civil-protection-mechanism/\">European Union Civil Protection Mechanism</url> budget. But if the EU experienced wildfires this year similar to the extremes of the 2017 season, there would need to be a 70 per cent increase in the annual budget. This, the report concludes, shows that not enough planning has gone into matching financing needs with disaster potential based on previous experience.</p><p>\"The major takeaway is that the EU's substantial climate risks require system-wide transformational adaptation, which includes reforming institutions, legal frameworks, and sectoral strategies,\" said Dengler, adding: \"A piecemeal approach is no longer enough.

African leaders demand renewed commitments to the Paris Agreement that seeks to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and money from developed countries that have historically been the world's biggest polluters.</p><p>The continent accounts for about 4% of greenhouse gas emissions and has contributed only a negligible amount of carbon dioxide that is warming the planet's atmosphere. But climate change is not just an environmental problem.</p><p>It can also contribute to conflict, for example when changing rainfall patterns make land less arable in areas where farmers compete for water and land. Well aware of these risks, the African Union (AU) is working to finalise a Common African Position on Climate, Peace and Security, a consensus document endorsed by the 55 member states.</p><p>A 'threat multiplier'</p><p>Although not legally binding, a common position benefits from lengthy diplomatic negotiations and African states can use it to advocate for important issues globally. The AU should adopt this powerful statement at its annual summit in February 2025 and coordinate with climate negotiators to ensure that climate resilience is a key part of Africa's climate change agenda.</p><p>Appointing an AU climate-security envoy could help with this coordination and amplify Africa's voice in global climate forums and conferences like the G20, which made the AU a permanent member in September 2023.</p><p>The AU has long recognised that climate change is a 'threat multiplier': it makes existing problems worse. Since 2016, the AU has commissioned a range of studies that examine how climate change and conflict are connected. In addressing these links, the AU is carving out a distinct role as climate change remains a divisive issue in institutions like the UN Security Council.</p><p>The AU also encourages its member states to incorporate climate adaptation into their national security planning and has appointed an adviser on climate, peace and security, with support from international partners.</p><p>In August 2024, in consultation with outside experts and member states, the AU Commission published the African Climate Security Risk Assessment. The report describes climate-related security risks across the continent, such as droughts that destroy crops and deadly floods that displace communities. Southern Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel experienced these threats in 2024.</p><p>The timing is opportune because global climate forums are finally paying more attention to the link between conflict and climate. The COP29 climate conference is hosting a special Peace Day on 15 November, where attendees will discuss climate financing in fragile conflict-affected regions, building on the momentum from last year's COP28 in Dubai.</p><p>At that conference, more than 90 countries and organisations, including Crisis Group, called for more grants to help conflict-affected regions and to accelerate climate resilience projects.</p><p>The search for common ground</p><p>The AU can add its weight to the climate security agenda through the Common African Position (CAP). While the AU Peace and Security Council has discussed the draft position, the Assembly of Heads of State now needs to adopt it and incorporate its recommendations in the agenda of the Africa Group of Negotiators, currently chaired by Kenya. Without the endorsement of negotiators on the global stage, the CAP is little more than a statement with limited leverage to shape global policy.</p><p>A core tenet of Africa's common position is that wealthy countries like the US have historically been the world's biggest polluters and should therefore be held responsible for making affordable financing available.</p><p>Yet among the countries that require climate finance support, conflict-affected states are the least likely to get it. When vulnerable countries like Niger and Burkina Faso receive 'climate finance', they mostly get loans.</p><p>The AU calls for grants to support African countries without deepening their debts, along with mechanisms to track and ensure that promised funds are delivered.</p><p>Another African priority is integrating climate and conflict early warning systems. Currently, one third of the global population lacks effective climate warning systems, such as functioning weather stations, while existing early warning systems in the Horn and West Africa often treat climate risks and conflict risks separately.</p><p>The AU also emphasises the importance of local adaptation measures that involve women, refugees and marginalised groups.</p><p>Challenges and resilience</p><p>The AU's ambitious goals face significant challenges, particularly when it comes to funding. AU member states should urgently make additional money available to complement the international contributions the organisation relies on.</p><p>They could also allocate money from the AU Peace Fund to support the climate work of the Department of Political Affairs, Peace and Security. Only then can Africa transform the CAP from an aspirational blueprint into concrete action.</p><p>Crisis Group research from Cameroon to South Sudan shows that building resilience to increasingly severe extreme weather requires creative thinking and investment - but also that basic investments in dams, roads, water treatment plants and weather stations can go a long way towards protecting people from the harmful consequences of droughts and floods.</p><p>Helping build resilience to extreme weather in Africa is not merely an environmental necessity - it is a cornerstone of peace and stability.

Karuaihe-Martin, based in Windhoek, is also managing director at Namibia National Reinsurance Corporation, or NamibRe.</p><p>Harmonised regulations, she says, will create greater certainty for insurers and reinsurers, and allow them to scale across the continent. Africa's regions, she says, must not be afraid to borrow regulatory innovations from other regions. Increased co-operation, she argues, will lead to more inter-Africa transfers of skills and capital. More public-private partnerships are also needed to improve capacity, Karuaihe-Martin says. 'You don't have to reinvent the wheel.'

Karuaihe-Martin points to the African Development Bank's Africa Climate Risk Insurance Facility for Adaptation (ACRIFA) as a project that can help close the gap. According to ACRIFA, the continent has annual climate adaptation finance needs of about $73bn between 2020 and 2030, yet annual commitment years have been running at about $29.5bn. The facility aims to mobilise $1bn of grants, concessional funding and high-risk capital for climate insurance solutions.</p><p>The Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, a 2021 commitment by African insurers including NamibRe to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, can help unlock more investment, Karuaihe-Martin says. Improving the data available to insurers is a fundamental challenge. The pricing for cover, especially for large, unpredictable risks such as Mpox, becomes difficult if data is lacking, she says.

The company's SecondSky cover, which is placed above crops, absorbs heat while letting light through. The result is an extension of the growing season and a reduction in energy and water consumption of around 30%.</p><p>The company was set up in 2018 at Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and in 2023 partnered with the Saudi Downtown Company, an urban development project owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.</p><p>Iyris, previously known as Red Sea, this year divested its farming activities in Saudi Arabia. That will allow the company to focus on its core business, Keppler says. The target is farm operations with low-to-medium levels of technology globally, with India and Brazil among the target markets. Iyris in September partnered with Egypt's Hyma Plastic as its manufacturing and distribution partner in the country.</p><p>Three African green-tech startups to watch</p><p>The technology doesn't require farmers to alter their existing planting behaviour or adopt new supply chains. Farmers need to 'touch and feel' innovations before they are convinced, Keppler says. 'Agriculture is a 'show me' story.'</p><p>The company is also present in Morocco and South Africa, and aims to expand its presence on the continent. Current growth is financed by working capital, but the company is likely to be in the market for larger fundraising over the next year, Keppler says. 'We have an asset-light expansion strategy.'</p><p>The solution provides a financial return within one crop cycle, with yields increasing by 20% to 30% after adoption, Keppler says, with strawberries, raspberries and tomatoes among the best performers. The aim is to give farmers 'all the tools to mitigate heat and reduce the resource intensity of agriculture'.</p><p>Flooded fields and methane</p><p>Israel-based companies are playing a leading part in developing precision agriculture solutions. An example is Netafim, which started in 1965 as a kibbutz, a communally organised agricultural settlement, in Israel's Negev desert. Netafim is now part of Orbia, which trades on the Mexican stock exchange.</p><p>Netafim CEO Gaby Miodownik estimates that about 75% of the irrigated fields in the world are flooded. Climate change, he argues, has rendered the practice obsolete. The method uses too much water, he says, and growing crops in flooded fields produces methane. Flooded-field rice cultivation alone accounts for about 10% of global methane emissions.</p><p>Opinon: Empowering agripreneurs is next stage in Africa's agribusiness revolution</p><p>Netafim's 'drip irrigation' system supplies water only to a crop's root areas, and can also be used for precision irrigation supply. The company said in a July submission to the US Department of Agriculture that drip irrigation has the highest water and nutrient use efficiency of all irrigation systems.</p><p>The use of herbicides and pesticides, the company says, are also reduced as water and nutrients are supplied directly to the root zone, giving weeds less chance to grow.

The Israel-based biotech focuses on agriculture and plant genomics. The company's Casterra business supplies castor seeds for uses such as biofuels and biopolymers.</p><p>Castor's status as a 'niche' crop historically meant a lack of scientific research interest, largely grown by small farmers with low yield performance, Haviv says. That castor can be used as aviation fuel, and can be grown in marginal and semi-arid soils, creates an opportunity for large-scale African cultivation, Haviv says. 'You won't compete with the food chain,' Haviv says. 'This is the direction the world should go in.'</p><p>Kenya oil refinery eyes biofuel production to revive KPRL</p><p>The EU in 2022 banned palm oil and soybean as a biofuel or biodiesel feedstock. Castor oil is renewable, biodegradable, has a low sulphur content and is considered by the EU as a green fuel. In October, Casterra announced the delivery of over 100 tonnes of castor seeds to an African customer. The seeds were cultivated in Kenya and processed at a production facility near Naivasha, which opened in August.</p><p>Haviv aims to develop more new castor plant varieties adapted to local conditions. He wants to expand Casterra's existing partnership with Italian oil major Eni SpA to grow castor for grain, which would then be crushed for oil. Eni is betting on biofuels as part of its strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>Gates doubles down on GMOs to fix African agriculture during Nigeria trip</p><p>Kenya and Brazil, Haviv says, are being evaluated as possible sites for the project. That would remove the need to ship the castor oil, and would open the door to cosmetic and medical applications as well as aviation fuel, he says.</p><p>A longer-term aim is for the company to become a supplier of castor-based oil, rather than just grain, with its own crushing factory. The main bottleneck, Haviv says, is growing enough castor. 'It's a huge opportunity for Africa.'</p><p>There's no other solution besides castor oil for the 'holy grail' of decarbonising aviation fuel, says Casterra CEO Yoash Zohar.

A new report for the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, titled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.freiheit.org/publikation/grand-challenges-europe-2050\">Grand Challenges for Europe 2050</url>, paints a detailed picture of what lies ahead for the continent.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This horizon scan identifies the key challenges Europe will face by mid-century and offers insights from experts on the pressing need for a shift in mindset, policy innovation, and collective action. At its heart, the report calls for radical change to address the interconnected issues of climate change, demographic shifts, economic instability, and technological dependence. However, it is not all doom and gloom-the right actions today could carve out a future where Europe thrives, not just survives.</p><h>A Crisis of Mindset: Fear of Change and the Status Quo</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perhaps one of the most profound insights from the report is the \"European Mindset\" challenge. While the need for change is critical, there remains a disconcerting lack of appetite for it. A paradox emerges: the more the need for transformation grows, the less willing European societies are to embrace it. Experts interviewed for the report highlight that Europe's entrenched conservatism, particularly among older generations, has stifled the continent's ability to dream big and solve problems with bold solutions. This reluctance is compounded by political systems that prioritize short-term gains over long-term progress.</p><p>In a rapidly aging society, there is an increasing fear that the next generation will not live better lives than their predecessors-a sentiment that stifles innovation. The report suggests that this mindset must change if Europe is to solve the grand challenges that lie ahead. Political leaders, it argues, must inspire citizens to embrace a new vision, one where change is not only necessary but also celebrated.</p><h>Climate Change: Time Is Running Out</h><p>Europe's climate crisis is unfolding at an alarming rate. According to the report, the continent is warming at more than twice the global average, and while the EU has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, significant challenges remain. Climate adaptation strategies must go beyond mere pledges; they must be backed by robust policies, investments in renewable energy, and a recalibration of industries reliant on fossil fuels.</p><p>Moreover, climate change will have uneven effects across Europe. Southern regions, such as Spain and Italy, will face scorching heatwaves and droughts, while northern regions may see heavy rainfall and flooding. Climate change will exacerbate existing inequalities between countries and regions, making collaboration and solidarity more important than ever.</p><p>If Europe is to meet its 2050 climate goals, it needs more than just incremental steps. The report calls for accelerating climate action through large-scale investments in green technologies and fostering innovation in areas like GreenTech and renewable energy. These steps are critical for not only addressing the environmental crisis but also creating new economic opportunities that could serve as pillars of growth for the continent.</p><h>Demographic Shifts: The Silver Tsunami</h><p>By 2050, Europe will be an older and smaller continent. The number of individuals over the age of 65 will surpass those under 15, posing unprecedented challenges to social services, healthcare, and the labor market. This \"silver tsunami\" will stretch pension systems, reduce workforce participation, and shift economic dynamics across Europe.</p><p>The shrinking and aging population also means that Europe's economic vitality is at risk. Without young, dynamic workers, innovation slows, and growth stagnates. The report urges policymakers to adopt proactive measures, such as raising the retirement age, promoting lifelong learning, and integrating migrants into the workforce to fill gaps left by aging workers. Additionally, immigration policies must be reformed to attract younger, skilled workers from outside Europe, particularly from regions with growing labor forces, like Africa.</p><h>Economic Instability: Fragmentation and Debt</h><p>Europe's economic landscape is a patchwork of regional disparities, incomplete integration, and looming public debt crises. Demographic changes will only compound these issues, as the shrinking workforce struggles to support an aging population. The report emphasizes that without stronger economic cooperation and the completion of the single market, the EU risks deeper economic fragmentation.</p><p>Furthermore, Europe's technological dependency on non-European powers, particularly the US and China, could weaken its global competitiveness. The report underscores the need for Europe to regain its technological sovereignty by investing in research and development (R&amp;D), particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and other critical technologies. Without this, Europe risks becoming increasingly dependent on foreign technologies, threatening both its economic stability and its geopolitical independence.</p><h>The Rise of Political Fragmentation and Extremism</h><p>Politically, Europe is facing a crisis of legitimacy. Rising support for far-right movements, fueled by economic insecurity and a loss of trust in democratic institutions, threatens to destabilize the continent. The report highlights the need for political innovation to counteract these trends. Restoring public trust in democracy requires addressing the root causes of dissatisfaction-economic inequality, political disenfranchisement, and a sense of cultural dislocation.</p><p>At the same time, Europe must guard against the external threats posed by authoritarian regimes like Russia and China, both of which seek to undermine European unity. Geopolitical instability, particularly the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, is likely to persist, adding to Europe's long-term security concerns.</p><h>Technological Dependency: Europe's Digital Dilemma</h><p>Europe's technological future is precarious. The report warns that Europe risks falling further behind in key areas of innovation, particularly in AI. As the US and China continue to dominate the global tech landscape, Europe's relative lack of investment in R&amp;D threatens to leave it technologically dependent on non-European powers. This dependency could undermine Europe's ability to safeguard its data, infrastructure, and economic autonomy.</p><p>To combat this, the report calls for massive investment in technological sovereignty. Europe must create its own competitive tech ecosystem, one that fosters homegrown innovations and reduces its reliance on US and Chinese tech giants. This is crucial not just for economic resilience but also for maintaining the continent's political independence in the face of growing cyber threats and data sovereignty concerns.</p><h>A Call for Courageous Leadership</h><p>At its core, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Grand Challenges for Europe 2050</emphasis> report calls for a new kind of leadership-one that is courageous, visionary, and willing to break free from the constraints of the status quo. The challenges outlined in the report are complex and interconnected, requiring bold and innovative solutions that go beyond traditional policy responses.</p><p>The clock is ticking, and Europe can no longer afford to tinker around the edges. The need for systemic change has never been more urgent. The path to a prosperous, free, and vibrant Europe in 2050 exists, but only if its leaders, institutions, and citizens are willing to embrace the scale of the challenge and act with the ambition that the moment demands. Europe's future is not set in stone-by choosing action over inertia, it can still shape the course of its destiny.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Climate Change: Time Is Running OutEurope's climate crisis is unfolding at an alarming rate.

Ms. Bunu said she did not think she would survive.       </p><p>Scenes of devastation could be seen across Maiduguri on Friday. Dead people and animals floated past. People were trapped in schools and on rooftops. Some slept on the highway.       </p><p>Over the weekend, many people were rescued across the city after being trapped by the floodwaters for days. The ground floor of the main hospital was submerged, destroying vital equipment, samples and the polio laboratory.       </p><p>Rising waters swept crocodiles and deadly snakes out of the zoo and into communities, while 80 percent of the zoo's animals drowned, according to a statement from Ali Don Best, the general manager of the Borno State Museum Park, where the zoo is.       </p><p>In Nigeria and in most of the region, the floods are hitting communities already racked by conflict, displacement and poverty.

Netafim is now part of Orbia, which trades on the Mexican stock exchange.</p><p>Miodownik estimates that about 75% of the irrigated fields in the world are flooded. The practice is widespread as it avoids weeds which can't survive under water. Miodownik argues that the model is outdated at a time of climate change. The method uses too much water, he says, and growing crops in flooded fields produces methane. Flooded-field rice cultivation alone accounts for about 10% of global methane emissions.</p><p>Netafim's system supplies water only to a crop's root areas, and can also be used for precision irrigation supply. Miodownik says that average water savings versus flooded cultivation are about 50%, with crop yields improved by 30% or more, and methane emissions eliminated. 'It's about growing more with less.'</p><p>Climate change will reduce the value of farmland in Africa in the long term by between 36% to 61%, and more than 50 million people in Africa will be pushed into 'water distress,' according to a 2024 study by the University of Witwatersrand's Philip Kofi Adom. Rainfed crops in Africa will be the hardest hit, with irrigated crops likely to prove the most resilient, the study finds. Yet some farmers in Africa, Miodownik says, can currently do little more than 'pray for rain' as climate change undermines yields.</p><p>About 25 million hectares of African land are being irrigated with floods, according to the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems, and about 50 million people practice flood-based farming on the continent. CGIAR points to the benefits of flooded fields and says it's possible for the efficiency of the practice to be improved.</p><p>Rwanda project</p><p>The concept of 'drip irrigation', as Netafim's approach is known, was discovered by accident. Members of the 1965 kibbutz noticed that a tree which was given water in measured amounts was growing better than others which were indiscriminately watered.</p><p>Today, the company's main African presence is in South Africa and Morocco and it has subsidiaries in 40 countries globally. It has 21 manufacturing plants, including one in Morocco, and revenue of over $1 billion.</p><p>The Gabiro agribusiness hub in Rwanda is a joint venture between Netafim and the Rwandan government agreed in 2019. The first phase of the project, covering 5,600 hectares, is now being commissioned. A planned second stage would add 10,000 hectares and would take about two years to build, Miodownik says. There's date yet for a start to second-stage work, and further investment is needed, he adds.</p><p>Rwanda's ministry of agriculture says the hub will create 4,000 jobs. Miodownik says that the model can be replicated elsewhere. The major obstacle, he says, is the initial funding requirement. The first phase of the Rwanda project cost $70m.</p><p>Miodownik says the onus is on governments to find solutions. They can recoup the outlay by charging farmers who will have higher incomes for use of the infrastructure. High-value crops such as fruit, vegetables and wine grapes are the easiest way to justify the outlay, while cotton is harder, he adds.</p><p>Institutions such as the World Bank and IFC can help provide initial funding, he says.

All our employees deserve a big compliment for the dedication, professionalism and teamwork with which we were able to achieve these successes.</p><p>At Dredging &amp; Inland Infra, the vessels were very well occupied on large projects in the Middle East, Far East and Europe. We worked hard on the development of innovative infrastructure, such as the Fehmarnbelt tunnel in Denmark and Manila International Airport. We were also busy with various climate adaptation projects, such as the protection of a stretch of coast of Togo and Benin and closer to home, the reinforcement of the Markermeer dike north of Amsterdam. Climate adaptive measures received a lot of attention during COP28 in Dubai. With our coastal defense and riverbank protection activities, we offer innovative solutions to protect against the effects of climate change. The requirement for such measures became apparent late 2023 when large parts of Europe were under threat of flooding due to extreme weather.</p><p>With our Offshore Energy activities, we once again made a significant contribution to the energy transition.

Both trailing suction hopper dredgers and cutter suction dredgers were very well utilized at over 40 weeks. Last year Boskalis' projects included the construction of the new Manila airport in the Philippines, the innovative polder (Pulau Tekong) and port expansion (Tuas Terminal 2) in Singapore and a new port for a futuristic sustainable city in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Last year, Boskalis was also active internationally in providing climate adaptation solutions (coastal defenses, dikes and rivers) with which we protect against the effects of climate change. In the Netherlands, Boskalis was active on a large number of projects such as the ongoing multi-year project to strengthen the Markermeer dike north of Amsterdam, and in West Africa part of the eroded coastline of Togo and Benin was restored and strengthened as part of the West African Coastal Areas Management program.</p><p>At Offshore Energy, revenue increased 41% with a very strong operational result. All business units contributed to these particularly strong financial figures, with the largest absolute increase coming from the offshore wind business. Last year, half of the divisional revenue came from offshore wind and Boskalis was active on 29 offshore wind projects during the year, including sizable installation projects in Taiwan, Europe and the United States.</p><p>Our Marine Transport &amp; Services business unit carried out some high-profile projects with its heavy transport vessels, such as the transportation of the heavily damaged 330-meter FPU Zafiro Producer on the BOKA Vanguard to a scrapyard in cooperation with Salvage. The most recent additions to the group - Subsea Services and Marine Survey - again made very strong contributions. Across the board, the division was able to successfully respond to strong market demand from both the offshore wind and traditional oil and gas markets.</p><p>Salvage had a busy and good year with numerous high-profile projects, including the FSO Safer oil removal project in Yemen, where 180 million liters of oil were removed from this old and decaying tanker. And last summer Boskalis successfully managed to save the Dutch Wadden Islands from a potentially major environmental disaster by successfully extinguishing and salvaging the burning car carrier Fremantle Highway.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL POSITION</emphasis>Boskalis' financial position is healthy. With a cash position of EUR 769 million and only EUR 246 million in debt, Boskalis has a financial net cash position of EUR 523 million. With the available cash and cash equivalents and (unused) bank facilities, Boskalis has an immediately available financing capacity of more than EUR 1.0 billion. The solid solvency increased to 52.4% and Boskalis comfortably meets its financial covenants.</p><p>The size of the order book amounts to EUR 6.0 billion. With the well-filled order book and favorable market outlook, we are positive about the outlook for 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAFETY &amp; PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENTS</emphasis>Safety is a top priority at Boskalis. With the help of our NINA (No Injuries, No Accidents) safety program, everything is aimed at ensuring that our employees and subcontractor personnel return home safely every working day.</p><p>Last year a great deal of attention was paid to the Human Excellence strategic pillar. Besides personal development of our employees, recruiting well-trained personnel is an important part of this pillar. As an extension to the head office in the Netherlands and to accommodate our growth ambitions, a new office is being developed in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Already, nearly 300 colleagues of 20 different nationalities work here and the size of the office is expected to double in the coming years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INNOVATION</emphasis>In addition to our craftsmanship and years of experience, our innovative strength is an important distinguishing factor. This concerns both innovative modifications to our existing equipment, the design of and investment in new fuel-efficient equipment, alternative contract structures we enter into with our clients and the pioneering working methods we develop on projects. Where we are always looking for opportunities to grow and create sustainable value, we also seize opportunities to reduce our impact on the environment. For example, in October 2023, we announced the order for a new state-of-the-art trailing suction hopper dredger that will be equipped to run on methanol. In addition, over the past year we have equipped a number of offshore vessels with innovative energy storage systems, reducing fuel consumption as well as CO2 and nitrogen emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROAD TO NET ZERO</emphasis>In 2023, we made good progress in our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and completed a study on how to measure and monitor our \"road to net zero by 2050\" progress. We support the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) transition path to net-zero 2050 established in July 2023. As part of this path, there is a medium-term ambition for the maritime sector to reduce carbon intensity.

The African Union endorsed AAAP's two financing mechanisms. The first mechanism is the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility hosted by GCA, which has already influenced over $5.2bn in investment for adaptation in Africa since its inception in 2021. The AfDB administers the second financing mechanism through the climate set aside under the ADF-16 replenishment, which builds on the AfDB's commitment to finance $12.5 billion of adaptation programs - half of the AAAP investment target.</p><p>About the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA)The Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) is an international organization that works as a solutions broker to accelerate action and support for adaptation solutions, from the international to the local, in partnership with the public and private sectors.

GCA has a worldwide network of regional offices in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire; Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Beijing, China.</p><p>About the Africa Climate Action SummitThe Africa Climate Action Summit in Nairobi will be held from September 4th to September 6th. This summit is expected to bring together leaders, experts, and policymakers from across the world to discuss the pressing issue of climate change and its impact on Africa. The Africa Climate Action Summit will focus on a number of key areas, including adaptation, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and climate finance. Participants will share their experiences, best practices, and strategies for addressing climate change, and will work to develop a roadmap for African countries to achieve their climate goals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/073270ab-35ae-4e43-b0e9-3c7e399a1aff\">His Excellency William S.

Two New Pledges Show Why.", "published": "2023-12-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Money is a very big sticking point at this year's United Nations climate summit. Part of the problem is that American promises often go unmet.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When there's a global crisis, wealthy countries tend to find money. In the United States, that was the case for the coronavirus pandemic. And for military aid to allies like Ukraine.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the global climate crisis? It's complicated.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris visited the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and promised $3 billion for the Green Climate Fund, which benefits poorer nations. But Biden administration officials already are acknowledging it will be a struggle to persuade Congress to approve the money.       </p><p>Then, on Sunday, John Kerry, President Biden's climate envoy, announced at the talks a new carbon credit initiative in which more than a dozen major companies including Walmart, Pepsi and McDonald's will help developing countries pivot away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. The creation of the program is a tacit acknowledgment that governments simply aren't putting up the trillions of dollars needed to fund the energy transition.       </p><p>One of the big tests facing this summit, known as COP28, is whether it will fare any better than earlier climate talks at shoring up anything close to the money that's needed.       </p><p>None of what is being discussed and promised at the meeting - whether it's tripling of renewable energy, adapting to the hazards of a hotter world, or compensating countries for the irreparable losses of climate change - can happen without huge sums of money. Not to mention the mounting frustration of leaders from the global south over unkept promises of aid. Money is crucial to restoring confidence.       </p><p>\"The world needs long-term money,\" the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, said on Saturday in a statement on behalf of a coalition of climate-vulnerable countries. \"We give thanks to the progress made but it does nothing but assuage consciences. Choosing between people and the planet is a false choice. The world has enough funds.\"       </p><p>One of the biggest shortfalls is for funds that would help developing countries cope with climate impacts, like rising sea levels and extreme heat. A United Nations report concluded recently that rich countries had reduced their aid for climate adaptation efforts between 2020 and 2021, the most recent year for which comprehensive data is available.       </p><p>All the while, the needs of those developing countries have grown sharply. Countries promised to double adaptation aid at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. Even if that happens, it comes nowhere close to meeting the need: an estimated $215 billion to $387 billion a year between now and 2030 for climate adaptation alone. That's 10 to 18 times as much as the current public finance flows, the United Nations report found.       </p><p>The effort to triple renewable energy worldwide requires ratcheting up clean energy spending to $4.5 trillion in annual investment, from $1.8 trillion today, by 2025, according to the International Energy Agency, particularly in energy-hungry emerging economies and poor countries.       </p><p>\"The reality is that without much more finance flowing to developing countries, a renewables revolution will remain a mirage in the desert,\" said Simon Stiell, the chief of the U.N. climate change agency, at the opening of the conference. \"COP28 must turn it into a reality.\"       </p><p>This year, climate negotiations have already brought some progress. The $100 billion in annual climate aid that rich countries had agreed to shore up by 2020 came through, three years late. Countries approved a new fund to pay poor countries for the losses and damages they are witnessing already, but that is, for now, voluntary. Right now, there's about $420 million in the kitty.       </p><p>Jennifer Morgan, Germany's climate envoy, said in an interview that she had detected a positive shift in the dynamics since her country announced $100 million for the loss-and-damage fund.       </p><p>\"It enabled developing countries to focus on other agenda items here,\" Ms. Morgan said, adding, \"It builds trust with them, and this process is all about trust.\"       </p><p>At the start of the talks last week, the United Arab Emirates, the oil-rich host, announced a new $30 billion fund aimed at drawing billions more in private investment, including from the world's biggest financier, BlackRock.       </p><p>But the United States, the world's largest economy and the world's biggest climate polluter in historical terms, is facing intense pressure at the summit to step up its public financing.       </p><p>Biden administration officials at climate summit insisted that the U.S. president is committed to securing climate aid for the developing world. Mr. Biden has pledged to deliver $11.4 billion annually in climate assistance by 2024, and officials this week said that the administration was on track to deliver more than $9 billion this year.       </p><p>Much of that money is allocated through  multilateral climate funds, as well as loans and other financing for clean energy projects through agencies like the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. Over the past three years, that agency's annual climate finance commitments have grown to more than $3.7 billion from less than $500 million, the administration said in a fact sheet.       </p><p>The Biden administration also put $1 billion into the Green Climate Fund, but only by drawing on discretionary funds within the State Department after Republicans blocked a direct allocation.       </p><p>The big question for the United States now is whether a divided Congress or a future administration can deliver on the Biden administration's newest promises.       </p><p>\"The problem is, the U.S. is not a reliable partner,\" said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, an environmental group. \"It's been three years since Biden entered the White House and we haven't seen much in terms of previous finance promises.\"       </p><p>Republicans, who control the House, are overwhelmingly opposed to international climate aid, and have repeatedly slashed Mr. Biden's requests. Congress approved just $1 billion of the president's $11 billion request for global climate assistance for the fiscal year 2023. Former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden's likely challenger for the 2024 election, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement and ended all payments to the Green Climate Fund.       </p><p>Some lawmakers are already preparing for a fight. Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said he believed the United States should not \"spend another penny on crooked U.N. slush funds.\"       </p><p>\"We're still working to get the $11 billion,\" John Podesta, a top White House climate adviser, said. \"It takes a lot of work with this current Congress to do that, but we're hard at it.\"       </p><p>And yet the Biden administration also has made choices. When the president drew up a list of multibillion-dollar priorities in October that he said required urgent approval from Congress, he chose military aid to Israel and Ukraine, arming Taiwan and increasing security along America's southern border.       </p><p>Then the White House issued a second plea: to fund natural disaster response in the United States, child care centers and high-speed internet. Money to help the world's poorest countries cope with global warming did not make the cut.       </p><p>Mr. Podesta said international climate finance was not listed in that supplemental request because it was focused on \"critical priorities that we think can pass this Congress, and certainly have bipartisan support, really, in both houses.\"       </p><p>David Victor, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, was more blunt.       </p><p>\"Transferring funds to other countries is not very popular in the United States right now,\" he said. He noted that the emergency aid package to Israel and Ukraine had not yet won approval because House Republicans were still negotiating over changes to U.S. border policy.       </p><p>\"The country has turned inward,\" Mr. Victor said. \"It's turned populist and it is at best trying to fund these two very expensive wars.

But the harsh truth is that developing nations are going to have to pay most of that money back \u2013 with interest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the world's wealthiest economies pledged in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion a year towards climate action for developing countries by 2020, few present at the COP15 questioned the urgency of the task before them. Certainly not then-UK prime minister Gordon Brown, the first person to propose the figure in a speech delivered in the months leading up to that year's climate summit in Copenhagen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his \"manifesto\", the sombre Scot listed an almost Biblical litany of disaster sweeping across the developing world: 325 million people \"seriously affected\" by drought, dearth, deluge or disease; a further half a billion souls at extreme risk; and 300,000 lives lost, every year, to the effects of climate change.</p><p>\"In the developing world, climate change is already devastating lives,\" he said.</p><p>According to the best estimates of the OECD, 2022 may have finally marked the first year the wealthiest economies finally kept their promise in delivering the funds desperately needed by developing nations to adapt to a warming world and to mitigate the impacts on populations most vulnerable to the climate crisis. But behind the rhetoric of first-world reparations for the global harm caused by a century and a half of fossil-fuel-led industrial development squats an uglier reality: most of the money that makes its way to developing nations in public climate finance is going to have to be paid back \u2013 with interest.</p><p>Market-level interest rates</p><p>OECD data from 2016-2020, the most recent we have, shows that loans made up 72 percent of international climate finance. Of that number, three-quarters of the loans from multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank were non-concessional, or loans issued with interest rates set at market levels. Just one quarter of international climate finance over the same period took the form of grants.</p><p>More worryingly, Oxfam estimates that the proportion of non-concessional finance is growing. In their Climate Finance Shadow Report released in June 2023, the organisation estimated that the annual average of non-concessional instruments in climate finance had reached $28 billion \u2013 42 percent \u2013 in 2019-20, while concessional lending remained largely on the same level as the previous two years.</p><p>Although MDBs accounted for much of this market-rate lending, a small number of wealthy countries continue to use loans as their main form of climate finance. Of all the bilateral providers, France leads the pack in lending, with a massive 92 percent of its bilateral public climate finance taking the form of loans.</p><p>And while a large share of that lending is made up of concessional or \"soft\" loans, which are offered at more favourable interest rates or longer repayment schedules, an alarming 17 percent of its bilateral climate finance is non-concessional. For Spain, that number is a staggering 85 percent. More than half of Austria's climate financing is non-concessional, according to Oxfam's analysis, as is almost a third of the United States' climate financing.</p><p>Paying back billions \u2013 with interest</p><p>Put together, this adds up to tens of billions of dollars every year that countries of the Global South will one day be forced to pay back to the world's wealthiest nations and development banks \u2013 with interest. And with global interest rates rising steeply, the cost of servicing those debts year after year will eat into the already-stretched budgets of countries buckling under the weight of debts that are getting harder to pay back.</p><p>Danielle Koh, policy analyst at the NGO Reclaim Finance, said that the problem partly arises from the sheer magnitude of the challenge of raising funds to tackle the climate crisis.</p><p>\"The scale of climate funding required is enormous,\" she said. \"To rely only on public financing would not be sufficient to meet 1.5\u00b0C pathway-aligned targets, and loans at market rates could attract and mobilise private capital.\"</p><p>By including loans at their full face value, Koh said, wealthy countries are also able to claim credit for meeting their climate pledges far beyond what they are actually giving away. Of the more than $83 billion that was claimed to have been raised in 2020, Oxfam estimates the actual value for developing countries to be between just $21 and $24 billion. And while non-concessional finance is not counted towards countries' official development assistance spending more broadly, this distinction has yet to be made when it comes to funding climate action.</p><p>\"In providing financing to developing countries, loans at market rates could be favoured because developed countries can count such loans towards being able to fulfil climate financing commitments while at the same time avoiding giving direct grants or other concessional types of financing, which would be more costly,\" said Koh.</p><p>Counting non-concessional loans as climate finance may not just be disingenuous, but dangerous. Sixty percent of low-income countries are already either in or on the verge of debt distress, forced to spend five times more every year on servicing their debts than they do on climate adaptation.</p><p>Counterproductive debt burden</p><p>Safa' Al Jayoussi, climate justice adviser at Oxfam Middle East and North Africa, said that adding to low-income countries' debt burden would make them more vulnerable, rather than more resilient, to the ravages of the climate crisis.</p><p>\"It's a big risk, because countries are already distressed,\" she said. \"Developing countries are dealing with a lot of loans from the World Bank and other institutions that are causing more austerity. Adding more pressure to the countries ... will impact those most vulnerable to climate change. This kind of funding is making adaptation and mitigation to climate change more difficult.\"</p><p>According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), public debt has been growing faster in developing nations than in their developed counterparts over the past decade. Faced with compounding crises of Covid-19, climate change and the cost-of-living crisis, the number of countries facing high levels of debt has increased dramatically, from just 22 countries in 2011 to 59 countries in 2022.</p><p>And debt is costing developing nations dearly. On average, African countries pay interest rates four times higher than those of the US, and eight times higher than Germany. To service those debts year after year, countries have little choice other than to redirect funds that may otherwise have gone to badly underfunded sectors such as health or education. In the ten years between 2010 and 2020, the number of countries where interest spending accounted for 10 percent or more of their public revenues rose from 29 to 55.</p><p>More debt, then, seems to be the last thing the developing world needs.</p><p>\"There is a real danger that this could lead to high debt burdens in developing countries,\" Koh said. \"With global rising interest rates, the cost of servicing debt for developing nations will rise substantially. Loans in foreign currencies could expose developing countries to soaring costs over servicing their debt in the case of exchange rate fluctuations or depreciations over time. In the long term, repaying climate debt not only diverts financial resources away from developing other sectors, but could lead to economic and fiscal instability.\"</p><p>Hans Peter Dejgaard, senior consultant at INKA Consult and a specialist in climate finance, said that while it made sense to finance some renewable energy infrastructure in middle-income developing countries through loans as commercially viable projects, too much reliance on loan-based financing would put poor countries in an impossible position if interest rates continued to rise.</p><p>He cited a World Bank loan of $400 million to the Philippines in early 2022 aimed at accelerating climate-related objectives. After the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates to just under 6 percent in April 2023 to fight rising inflation, he said, the total repayments that the Philippine government would have to make over a period of 20 years had potentially risen from $482 million to $686 million \u2013 a 42 percent increase.</p><p>\"This will affect their social and education budget,\" he said.</p><p>Reclaim Finance's Koh said that the cost for financing climate action should not be borne by the countries least able to afford it.</p><p>\"There is no 'one model fits all' when it comes to funding climate finance, but there are certain principles that we can rely on to guide our approach,\" she said. \"For example, that concessional financing and grants should be favoured over market-rate loans, whether through initiatives like the Loss and Damage Fund or others, to help developing countries build resources for climate adaptation and mitigation while avoiding increasing their debt burden.\"</p><p>For Al Jayoussi, that very burden should instead be borne by the countries most responsible for fuelling the worsening climate crisis.</p><p>\"Developing countries didn't even cause climate change,\" she said. \"We need to revamp and change the finance structure that caused climate change in the first place.
