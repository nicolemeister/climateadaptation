The findings show substantial performance disparities in these ESG funds:</p><p>Over a six-year period, the difference in annualised returns between the best and worst ESG funds is 6.5% when adjusting for differences in market exposure.When removing effects due to differences in industry exposure, the difference remains high at 4.9%.Over single years, the dispersion can be even more dramatic, reaching a maximum of 22.5% in terms of returns adjusted for market exposures, and 25.3% in terms of industry-adjusted returns.</p><p>Commenting on the study, Felix Goltz, co-author, and Research Director at Scientific Beta, said, \"The large dispersion in returns shows that fund returns are not principally driven by a common sustainability factor. Instead, fund returns largely depend on fund-specific choices of how to integrate ESG information. This suggests that ESG investors face substantial fund selection risk. Importantly, traditional fund selection strategies like relying on past performance or tracking error are inadequate for predicting future ESG fund performance.

Since then, Tendele's attempts to expand new operations that encompass 21 million hectares at Somkhele have been bogged down by multiple litigation.</p><p>Dirty or clean?</p><p>Environment rights attorney Kirsten Youens, co-founder of the All Rise non-profit, has sued Petmin on behalf of what she says are 3,900 community members. She accuses the company of spoiling local ecosystems and not auditing families resettled due to its mining. Some families still live within areas 'unacceptably close' to anthracite pits, and those who lost land haven't been properly compensated, she says.</p><p>Anthracite is a dirty coal, she adds, referencing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's designation of it as one of the highest carbon dioxide (CO2) coal contributors to greenhouse emissions.</p><p>Petmin CEO Jan du Preez tells The Africa Report that the detractors are 'a handful of community members [less than 2%] being manipulated by a group of lawyers who have their own agenda'. The agenda is for anti-mining non-profits to maintain foreign philanthropic funding for their causes. A total of 128 of the 145 families who agreed to be relocated have already signed compensation packages averaging R750,000 ($40,000) per household.</p><p>Du Preez further emphasises the mine's importance. When in operation, Somkhele, which produced approximately 1,6 million tonnes per annum, is the only remaining mine that can produce anthracite in the quantities and qualities required by the South African ferrochrome industry.</p><p>Looking at the investment climate, equity-raising risks, pricing, and regulatory bottlenecks - is anthracite coal mining in South Africa sustainable for the next 30 years?</p><p>Yes, it is sustainable. As the world continues to grow, and urbanisation continues, steel will be required and the demand for anthracite as an input will remain.</p><p>South Africa will still require thermal coals as part of the base load to generate electricity. There are thousands of jobs at stake in this industry and South Africa's just transition will take time.</p><p>Given the seeming fierce opposition in KwaZulu Natal, will Somkhele resume business?</p><p>Yes, it will. There is a large shortage of anthracite in South Africa, and the local ferrochrome industry is forced to import replacement products at great cost, thus also putting their businesses at risk and the jobs of over 90,000 people in this industry.</p><p>The mine has the support of the majority of the community, the unions, employees, the municipality, the local traditional council and the royal family.</p><p>If opponents shut down the mine, what will be the effects on the KwaZulu Natal economy and South Africa?</p><p>Should Somkhele Coal Mine be unable to recommence, the impact on the local economy will be catastrophic.</p><p>We have determined that should the mine operate for the next 10 years, R4.7bn ($248mn) indirect benefits will be contributed by the mine to local community members. South Africa will also lose out on billions of rands in taxes as well as state royalties.</p><p>There will also be an impact on [the] South African ferrochrome industry, where the need to import replacements for the mine products at high costs and increasing electricity costs could lead to major job losses.</p><p>Opponents say Tendele Mine is fuelling pollution and environmental waste in northern KwaZulu Natal. Is the type of coal mined clean?</p><p>Anthracite is preferred over other types of coal because it is considered to be the cleanest. It can be used as little as possible to generate extensive amounts of heat without having to pollute the environment. Thus it is environmentally cleaner than other fossil fuels and due to its low sulphur content, anthracite produces virtually no smoke or particulate emissions.</p><p>Anthracite is a cleaner coal. Tendele does not sell one tonne of anthracite to Eskom but rather supplies the South African ferrochrome industry with anthracite used as a reductant.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "A Planetary Crisis Awaits the Next President", "published": "2024-04-25", "bodyText": "<h>ABSTRACT</h><p>The return of Trump to the White House would be disastrous for the planet.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 21, "title": "New Scientific Beta Study Shows that Sustainable Investing Underperforms Standard Index Funds", "published": "2023-10-02", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Press Release - October 2, 2023</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New Scientific Beta Study Shows that Sustainable Investing Underperforms Standard Index Funds</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Findings show that 'real-world' ESG performance is unremarkable</emphasis></p><p>A new study from Scientific Beta, entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NFNVkZmJnb8vRp5SI5qgw3FbbxzgKMauq8QAnjhKYEbxIXMv9G_ZZlqfZLBnuJs4Iax3BnvXebOQhznYhCw-_9I7PWiGYutRPEN5laF6eTN2T_J42JEm8VP2rVP-7PLxsWt6-vmBSp-Dw6tUKx9H1VRBWdRGiw5wo3T7Z97T0aW8hwglqYsJbxwu5Uk72aiGtRCr1GQsWXI4aMhf0Q_qXNSe-kNvcb9403BEbZ_Z38aIPXU5O44SuCb1qGDhHlsc\">Sustainability Alpha in the Real World: Evidence from Exchange-Traded Funds</url>,\" assesses the performance of sustainable investing from a value-weighted portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that follow systematic Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing strategies in the US equity market.</p><p>The study finds that sustainable investing did not deliver higher returns than standard index funds.

Unlike traditional climate indices and benchmarks, which combine financial and climate criteria, either in the form of tilts applied to reference cap weights, or of carbon intensity score optimisation under tracking error constraints, the CIC indices make the weights of stocks depend solely on their climate performance. This strong methodological choice provides the CIC index with all of its consistency by avoiding financial considerations contradicting climate considerations.</p><p>CICI is positioned for implementing the recommendations of the Net-Zero investment coalitions at the portfolio-construction level. In particular, the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative (PAII) Framework states that one of the key elements of a \"Paris aligned stewardship approach\" is to develop an engagement strategy with a feedback loop to portfolio construction. CICI allows for the practical implementation of this approach where engagement and portfolio construction are neither mutually exclusive nor independent and instead can and should be mutually reinforcing. The CICI portfolio construction methodology thus greatly bolsters the power of an investor's engagement strategy by establishing its credibility thanks to the consistency between the actions that it undertakes to engage companies on better climate alignment, and the investment decisions with respect to the same companies.</p><p>Commenting on the launch of the CICI offering, Dr No\u00ebl Amenc, CEO of Scientific Beta, said, \"The weighting approach at the heart of CICI maximises the possible synergies between portfolio construction and engagement.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By putting their money where their mouths are, investors bolster the potential for successful engagement.</emphasis>In this respect, Scientific Beta's Climate Impact Consistent Indices not only align with ESG impact considerations but also promote real-world impact through a unique approach to portfolio construction.\"</p><p>About Scientific Beta:Scientific Beta aims to be the first provider of a smart factor and ESG/climate index platform to help investors understand and invest in advanced factor and ESG/climate equity strategies.

Its remit has arguably never been so urgent with 2020 ranking as one of the hottest years on record. Yet on the eve of the April 22-23 talks, the summit is already bearing fruit: The EU announced Wednesday it had reached a major climate deal exceeding the Paris accord targets, which climate scientists say are now necessary if a climate catastrophe is to be avoided.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US-hosted climate summit of 40 world leaders, which runs Thursday through Friday, will be held virtually and is expected to yield tougher carbon emissions targets as countries recognise the need to make firmer pledges to protect the planet. Earlier this week, US President Joe Biden hinted he would commit to cutting US greenhouse gas emissions at least by half from 2005 levels by 2030 in what climate change advocates agree is\u00a0a\u00a0\"highly ambitious but still achievable\" goal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Wednesday,\u00a0however, the 27-member states of the EU had pre-empted the US to announce a landmark decision to become the world's first carbon-neutral continent by 2050 under a provisional new climate law.</p><p>The targets set under the draft European law would better the Paris target of 40 percent by 2030 by cutting greenhouse gases by at least 55 percent by the end of the decade from 1990 levels.</p><p>Biden's summit is expected to re-invigorate debate and ramp-up sluggish climate goals at a critical moment.</p><p>According to the UN's World Meteorological Organization State of the Climate study published Monday, last year ranked as the hottest on record in a tie with 2016 and 2019. The study found that in 2020 the temperature was 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, despite Covid-19 lockdowns, which drastically reduced levels of worldwide pollution. The increase inched temperatures closer towards the threshold set by the Paris agreement to restrict the global temperature increase within 1.5C to 2C degrees to avoid irreversible climate damage.</p><p>The study concluded there was a 'relentless' intensification of the climate crisis in 2020.</p><p>Biden's summit comes before the next major UN climate summit (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, where countries in the Paris agreement are expected to update their emissions targets for the next decade.\u00a0What transpires from the talks over the next two days could well be instrumental in setting the tone for COP26.</p><p>FRANCE 24 spoke to \u00c5sa\u00a0Persson, research director of the\u00a0Stockholm Environment Institute, ahead of the US-led climate talks to find out what's at stake and what leaders need to do to achieve a bolder climate narrative.</p><p>FRANCE 24: The EU pre-empted Biden and set their own ambitious carbon emissions targets \u00a0- 55 percent cuts by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, up from the Paris accord target of 40 percent. The European Greens wanted to hit 60 percent. Is it a good enough deal?</p><p>\u00c5sa\u00a0Persson: It is incredibly important that the EU continues to show climate leadership of this kind and in order to give incentive to other countries to join this race. In terms of the 2030 targets, it's a little less than what science demands but it's a good deal in that it's an agreed deal that has broad support as it crosses political party lines and states. That's necessary to have a strong foundation for more specific policies. This new EU package sends a strong signal that we need to see stronger action and no backtracking of any sort on policies. At the end of day, we can debate levels of targets but what the climate cares about is the result. At this moment we need to work with the targets that have been agreed and move into measuring results.</p><p>A report by the Global Energy Monitor\u00a0shows that despite China\u00a0making a\u00a0\"world-leading\" pledge to get to net-zero by 2060\u00a0it added enough coal-fired power plants in 2020 to cancel out the number of plant closures. Is China paying lip service and is it waiting for the rest of the world to commit before it makes real changes?</p><p>The world is certainly waiting to see more concrete plans on how to reach net-zero targets \u2013 including more near-term targets and actions \u2013 so there's still a chance for China to step up and provide a plan. However, the new data is very worrying. It shows a lack of coherence. But we also see this in many other countries which continue to invest in fossil fuel production while offsetting climate targets. Coal power in China is on a much bigger scale, so it's important they show how they intend to be coherent in their policy.</p><p>What's important to note with this international summit is that it's partly about international diplomacy and countries showing leadership and luring others to join them. But at the same time, for a country to set ambitious targets there needs to be strong domestic support. Any new targets need to make sense in terms of domestic politics.</p><p>The WMO State of the Climate report released Monday showed that in 2020, temperatures rose by 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, despite dramatic reductions in global pollution due to lockdowns. Given this grim outlook, what would constitute a successful outcome at these talks?</p><p>Three things. The first and most urgent is for countries to immediately halt investment in fossil fuels to ensure their economic recovery from the pandemic is indeed green as many promised but which has yet to be delivered.</p><p>If more countries announce 2030 targets as the US is expected to do, it's a positive step in climate ambition. Many had hoped for a higher target that would also take into account climate equity for how the US has a track record of higher historical emissions. It's a good target and sends the right signal to the US economy.</p><p>And the third successful outcome would be if more countries commit to provide climate finance to vulnerable countries in the developing world. With more extreme weather, disasters and challenges it's so very important from a solidarity point of view that new financial commitments are made. We already have a Green Climate Fund, an\u00a0international mechanism that started around the time of the Paris agreement. The US has been a laggard in providing its share of funding. However, the US has now announced a major commitment to this, so they are catching up. Yet if you look at the total level, all developed countries need to provide additional finance.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron admitted he had made a mistake in underestimating the impact of his 'green transition' policy on ordinary people, which included a tax on diesel. He said governments need to \"accompany\" ordinary people to help them and industry transition. What do leaders need to do to ensure that the burden of the cost of slowing global warming is more equitably shared?</p><p>This is the key issue now. That we seriously start our climate transition by\u00a0changing our energy system, transport system, and even\u00a0how we produce food. First, we need to think about how we make sure we create jobs and good jobs associated with this big change. Secondly, like the French example, pay close attention to inequality to ensure that climate transition and policies don't disproportionately affect poorer or vulnerable groups. So, use compensation mechanisms and targeted support to make sure we don't reinforce existing inequalities. And also for leaders to provide a compelling future vision and national identity of what a climate-transformed society would look like.</p><p>How do we make it work for everyone?\u00a0How do we make it attractive\u00a0and a\u00a0story that people want to be part of? For example, in Sweden we have a lot of heavy industry, like steel, and they've made bold commitments to go fossil free, and this is engaging local governments and other industry. This is becoming a source of national pride and belief in the future. Stories are important to ensure broad support.</p><p>It's always an interplay between industry and government because the government sets framework conditions and high-level targets, but we need brave industry leaders to change their business models and innovate.</p><p>A new report by the International Energy Agency this week showed carbon emissions are expected to bounce back this year \u2013 last year they dropped because of the pandemic. As the economy opens up, there will be a compensation effect.</p><p>While the main summit is going to be COP 26 in Glasgow, what's positive about the US with this meeting is it's trying to increase momentum and what they plan to contribute to stabilising the global climate.</p><p>What is at stake at these climate talks compared to five years ago and the Paris Climate Pact?</p><p>The same issues are at stake: The health of our planet, security and the prosperity of humans. But we see a completely different urgency at this point because we have a very short time window to accelerate a green transition. Now we have five years less, so it's even more urgent.</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": ["The first and most urgent is for countries to immediately halt investment in fossil fuels to ensure their economic recovery from the pandemic is indeed green as many promised but which has yet to be delivered.

Her 2020 presidential campaign website outlines her intent to end the mass incarceration of Americans and particularly Black Americans, and begin a shift from policies that punish drug use by legalising cannabis and expunging prior marijuana convictions. Her website also said she planned to end mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, eliminate private prisons and detention centres, and open a Bureau of Children and Family Justice that would protect the civil rights of minors in the justice system.</p><p>Four days after George Floyd died while being detained by police, Senator Harris issued a statement calling the deaths of Black Americans in encounters with police and would-be vigilantes \"the result of broader systematic racism\".\u00a0 She co-introduced the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 to train police to eschew racial profiling and ban the federal use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants, which allow police to enter suspects' homes without first announcing their presence. The act would also create a national registry to ensure that officers who are fired for misconduct cannot join police departments in other jurisdictions.</p><p>But Harris's record as a \"reformer\"\u00a0when she served as California's attorney general and San Francisco district attorney is the subject of debate.

Harris wrote she would examine prescription drug costs to bring them into line with foreign prices, and create \"a comprehensive maternal health programme to dramatically reduce deaths\" among women and infants of colour. She proposed phasing in this system over 10 years and allowing private insurers to continue offering plans, provided they were in line with federal rules.</p><p>In 2019 Harris unveiled a plan that would require states with a history of seeking to restrict abortion rights to obtain federal approval before any such law took effect, citing a new Alabama law that allows doctors performing abortions to be sentenced to up to 99 years in prison.</p><p>\"We cannot tolerate a perspective that is about going backward and not understanding women have agency, women have value, women have authority to make decisions about their own lives and their own bodies,\" she said in an interview with MSNBC.</p><p>Gun control</p><p>Harris proposed on her campaign website that gun sellers who sell five or more firearms per year carry out background checks on all buyers and supported banning the import of AR-15-style assault weapons that perpetrators have used in at least five recent US mass shootings, including the 2018 murder of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. She also wants the US Congress to repeal the Protection of Commerce in Arms Act, a 2005 law that keeps law-violating gun manufacturers and sellers from being held accountable for gun violence. Harris said during her presidential campaign that,\u00a0if elected, she would punish and fine gunmakers and vendors for \"willful and serious\" violations of US and state law, including making assault weapons attractive to children via video games. She has also proposed allocating money collected from fines for mental health treatment and local \"violence intervention\" programmes.</p><p>LGBTQ rights</p><p>Harris supports the passage of the Equality Act, legislation that would expand landmark civil rights laws including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected categories. She co-introduced the Census Equality Act, which would have allowed LGBTQ people to identify as such when responding to the 2020 US Census but the bill did not advance for a Senate vote.\u00a0Harris has cited her creation of one\u00a0of the nation's early LGBTQ hate crimes units as San Francisco DA, and her opposition to the legal idea of \"panic defence\" used by alleged perpetrators of hate crimes against LGBTQ people as California AG. She also declined to enforce a ban on same-sex marriage that California voters approved on a 2008 referendum while serving as AG,\u00a0a stance she took several years before a Supreme Court ruling made same-sex marriage legal throughout the US.</p><p>The president of LGBTQ rights organisation Human Rights Campaign, Alphonso David, called Harris \"an exceptional choice\" for VP.</p><p>Income inequality and the economy</p><p>In 2018 Senator Harris announced a proposal called the LIFT (Livable Incomes for Families Today) the Middle Class Act, which would give tax credits to families earning less than $100,000 and single people earning less than $50,000; her campaign website cited a study that said more than half of American households could not cover an unforeseen $500 expense. She has also supported a tax credit for tenants whose rent and utility bills exceed 30 percent of their gross income.</p><p>Harris has called for $100 billion to help potential homeowners in communities in which government agencies and banks once systemically refused home loans to Blacks and other minorities, an illegal practice known as redlining. She has also called for a $60 billion investment in science and technology education at institutions of higher learning that have historically served minority students.</p><p>Harris has argued that investing a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure would create more than 15 million jobs.</p><p>During her presidential run, she proposed spending $385 billion on repairing and upgrading public transportation networks such as roads and rails, and $250 billion on safe drinking water infrastructure, citing a report that noted racially and ethnically diverse US communities had lower-quality drinking water.</p><p>\"What happened to the people of Flint, Michigan was unbelievable,\" Harris tweeted in March 2018, referring to the majority-Black city where a 2014 government decision to save money by sourcing drinking water from a local river led to unsafe lead levels, complaints of hair loss and rashes, and an increase in miscarriages and fetal deaths.</p><p>\"A shocking example of government irresponsibility and systemic racism,\" Harris wrote. \"Nearly four years later, we cannot forget about them.\"</p>", "publisher": "FRANCE 24 (English)", "instances": ["When police unions spoke out to prevent public access to disciplinary hearings in 2007, she also held her tongue, the Times reported.

Harris said in a June debate while running for president that she would rejoin the Paris Agreement to fight climate change \"on day one\" should she win.
