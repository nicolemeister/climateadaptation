Born of the 2013 merger between Glencore and Xstrata, it is one of the world's largest commodity traders, sitting astride global markets for coal, copper, zinc, and more. With its fingers in everything from marketing thermal coal to trading wheat, it has long played a dual role-both producer and trader-a distinction that gives it agility in turbulent markets, and a global footprint that rivals oil majors and tech giants in influence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But even titans face headwinds. In its 2025 half-year results, Glencore reported a 14% fall in adjusted EBITDA, down to $5.43 billion from $6.34 billion a year earlier. This is due to a stew of weaker coal prices, a sharp 26% fall in copper output, and operational snags at key assets. The copper drag was particularly pronounced in Collahuasi, Antamina, Antapaccay, and KCC-mines that, in CEO Gary Nagle's words, are expected to \"step up\" in the second half. That's a big if.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Under the surface: profitability and positioning</emphasis></p><p>Dig deeper and the company's industrial business-essentially, its mining operations-took the bigger blow, with EBITDA sliding 17% to $3.8 billion. Its marketing arm held up more robustly, with EBIT down just 8% to $1.4 billion, a testament to Glencore's resilience in the face of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, including ongoing U.S. tariff tensions and volatility in the Middle East.</p><p>Glencore is also bearing the cost of past bets. Capital expenditure for the half reached $3.2 billion, alongside $1.8 billion in shareholder returns. That spending, coupled with an uptick in working capital, pushed net debt to $14.5 billion-up 30% from the end of 2024. While that figure may raise eyebrows, Glencore insists it retains \"significant financial headroom,\" with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.08x, set to fall to 1.0x after accounting for proceeds from its Viterra sale.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Optimism by design?</emphasis></p><p>It would be easy to frame Glencore's report as a red flag. But Nagle's commentary offers a different lens: one of positioning. The company sees opportunity in the disruption. It's targeting $1 billion in recurring cost savings by the end of 2026-over half of which it expects to lock in by the end of next year. There is also a clear expectation that copper output will rebound in the second half, supported by planned sequencing and better grades.</p><p>Beyond the operational, Glencore continues to bet big on long-term commodity demand. As global electrification and green infrastructure projects ramp up, the company believes supply will struggle to keep pace with need-particularly in critical metals like copper and cobalt. That structural bullishness is reflected in its increased long-term guidance for its marketing EBIT: now pegged at $2.3-3.5 billion, with a new midpoint 16% higher than before.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Staying in London: A not-so-minor decision</emphasis></p><p>Perhaps most tellingly, Glencore has decided to stay put. After openly contemplating a shift to a U.S. primary listing-a move some of its FTSE peers have pursued-it has opted to remain listed in London. The calculus? A U.S. move \"would not add value for shareholders,\" the company said, suggesting that the gravity of Wall Street does not yet outweigh the familiarity and advantages of the City.</p><p>With $3.2 billion earmarked in total shareholder returns for 2025, including dividends and a $1 billion buyback programme, Glencore is telegraphing strength even amid softness.</p><p>Glencore may have stumbled in H1 2025, but it has not strayed from its long-term narrative: global demand will outpace supply, and it intends to be at the centre of that squeeze.\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "MarketScreener (English)", "instances": ["There is also a clear expectation that copper output will rebound in the second half, supported by planned sequencing and better grades.

The tour is precisely timed.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United against the States</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>In the face of ongoing US economic aggression, the EU and China share a vital interest in stabilising global trade norms, safeguarding institutions, and fostering diversified trade networks that buffer against unilateral shocks.<br/><br/><br/>Both sides have continuously hinted at approaching each other with a renewed vision, with Beijing recently extending a hand of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/china-seeks-united-trade-front-with-eu-opposing-us-bullying-tariffs/\">collaboration</url> to the EU to oppose the US and its \"unilateral acts of bullying\".<br/><br/><br/>The bloc has also signalled a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-hints-at-measured-approach-to-china-offering-to-rebalance-trade-relations/\">shift</url> in its approach to China, opting to improve and balance its strategic trade and investment relations. However, Brussels insists on levelling the playing field.<br/><br/><br/>In the spirit of this rapprochement, the sides are <url normalizedValue=\"http://rferl.org/a/eu-china-remove-sanctions-trump-trade-war/33395521.html\">reportedly</url> in the final stages of discussing lifting sanctions on European lawmakers. Later in the year, as this year marks five decades of diplomatic relations, a bilateral summit will be held in Beijing.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Countering the 'Trump assault'</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Despite differences, the EU and China can shape a new global economic compact. Former Greek Finance Minister Georgios Papakonstantinou <url normalizedValue=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2025/04/taking-the-pulse-in-light-of-trumps-tariffs-should-europe-get-closer-to-china?lang=en\">argues</url> that Europe now has no option but to get closer to China to brave what he calls the \"Trump 2.0 assault on the global order\".<br/><br/><br/>Papakonstantinou sees potential for collaboration in areas such as climate change. In more contentious areas like trade and tech, he advocates for balanced engagement that respects economic interdependence while acknowledging fundamental differences in values.<br/><br/><br/>Former European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m sees an opportunity to revive the frozen Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), contingent on China lifting sanctions on European individuals. Although Europe needs Chinese green tech, it is wary of unfair trade practices and overdependence on critical materials.<br/><br/><br/>Noah Barkin, senior advisor with Rhodium Group's China practice, states that while Trump's tariffs have worsened Europe's economic vulnerabilities in relation to China, the reprieve has given the EU leverage. He suggests that access to the EU market should be conditional on China investing in Europe under strict conditions.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limited damage</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>An initial <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bruegel.org/analysis/economic-impact-trumps-tariffs-europe-initial-assessment\">assessment</url> by the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel on the economic impact of Trump's tariffs indicates that, while potentially serious, the shock in the EU will be manageable. Tariffs on steel, aluminium, and vehicles will remain despite the 90-day moratorium, from which only China is exempt.<br/><br/><br/>Studies suggest that the US trade and GDP would suffer more than the EU's, partly because the US depends heavily on imported consumer goods and manufacturing inputs. EU exports to the US might decline only slightly, while US exports to the bloc could fall dramatically.<br/><br/><br/>Despite the risk of trade diversion from China due to high US tariffs on Chinese goods, the threat to EU industries appears limited. Most Chinese exports to the US do not compete directly with EU production, and those that do represent small portions of overall EU exports.<br/><br/><br/>Although Trump's tariffs are steep, their overall impact on the EU is relatively contained. Policymakers can mitigate regional and sectoral damage with redistributive policies, trade agreements, and domestic reforms. Trade diversion from China may even have deflationary benefits for the EU, concludes Bruegel.<br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pragmatic multilateralism</emphasis><br/><br/><br/>Although Europe and China might appear misaligned at first glance, the preservation of the global economic order unites them. For both Brussels and Beijing, Trump's tariff-heavy agenda threatens market access, disrupts supply chains, and undermines global trade rules.<br/><br/><br/>There is an opportunity for the EU and China to work together. This does not require alignment of values - it is an opportunity to act as pragmatic partners. Both could benefit from deeper alignment on digital trade standards, green infrastructure investments, and joint efforts to keep the world integrated into the global economy.<br/><br/><br/>Trump's tariffs are more than just a bilateral issue; they threaten global prosperity. In this reality, EU-China cooperation is not a luxury but rather a necessity. The bloc must become a global actor, not just a global market, in partnership with Beijing, although on its own terms.<br/><br/><br/>[Edited By Brian Maguire\u00a0| <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]<br/><br/></p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["There is an opportunity for the EU and China to work together.

First, between 11 and 13 February, the steering committee of the Board of Governors will rule on the 'compliance' of these candidacies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Romuald Wadagni, Benin's finance minister, eventually withdrew. That leaves South Africa's Bajabulile Swazi Tshabalala, Senegal's Amadou Hott, Mauritania's Sidi Ould Tah, Chad's Mahamat Abbas Tolli and Zambia's Samuel Munzele Maimbo. Which of them stands the best chance of winning on 29 May?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bajabulile Swazi Tshabalala: Going it alone?</p><p>Strengths</p><p>She is the only woman in the race. Among the Bank's 80 member countries, many shareholders now say it is time for a woman to lead the institution.</p><p>Until her resignation in October 2024, she was first vice-president - essentially the AfDB's number two. She long enjoyed the favour of Akinwumi Adesina, from whom she claims continuity. However, she left on poor terms with the Nigerian president of the Bank.</p><p>She also served as vice-president for finance, and takes credit for helping set up several financial innovations, including hybrid capital.</p><p>She knows the AfDB inside out - its processes, its culture, and most of the governors who will be voting.</p><p>She is backed by Africa's most industrialised country, and benefits from Cyril Ramaphosa's diplomatic influence. South Africa holds this year's G20 presidency, a first for an African nation.</p><p>The Southern African Development Community (SADC) had agreed to back Zambia's Samuel Munzele Maimbo as its sole candidate. Ignoring this usual non-aggression pact within the regional bloc, South Africa submitted its own candidate on 1 October. As a result, the SADC enters the race divided.</p><p>So far, no other country besides South Africa (with about 5% of the AfDB's voting rights) has publicly endorsed her.</p><p>By emphasising Adesina's legacy, she also carries it. Yet a growing majority of shareholders favour a clean break, and want fresh leadership.</p><p>Sidi Ould Tah: The Go-Between</p><p>Strengths</p><p>He was the last candidate to declare. He took his time to consult allies and assess his chances. He is backed by Mauritania, his home country, and, The Africa Report has learned, by C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, led by the influential Alassane Ouattara. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire hosts the AfDB's headquarters and holds almost 4% of the voting rights. He hopes to serve as a link between the Arab world and sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>For a decade, he has led the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), whose size grew tenfold under his leadership. He thus has a strong track record managing a multilateral development bank.</p><p>BADEA was founded by the Arab League. Its shareholders include Saudi Arabia (25%) and Kuwait (15.7%), both of which also hold stakes in the AfDB. A number of African countries are members too, from Egypt and Morocco to Algeria, Somalia and the Comoros. Should those states unite behind him, that may prove decisive, since together they hold over 20% of the votes.</p><p>He has never worked for the AfDB, a plus for shareholders seeking a break with the outgoing administration.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>He is discreet and cautious - possibly too much so for a job that is both political and highly visible. Then again, after a presidency sometimes considered too expansive, that might work in his favour.</p><p>So far, he is backed by just one sub-Saharan African country, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, while some rivals have won official endorsements from entire regional blocs.</p><p>Mahamat Abbas Tolli: The Banker</p><p>Strengths</p><p>He was the first to enter the race, over a year ago, and has held numerous meetings to secure support. He has the clear backing of Chad, his home country.</p><p>He is also backed by the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and by the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Taken together, that bloc represents one-fifth of African countries.</p><p>Tolli's CV fits the job description. He chaired the Development Bank of Central African States (BDEAC), was governor of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), and served as both finance minister and infrastructure minister in Chad.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>In terms of voting shares, the 11 members of CEMAC and ECCAS command just over 3.6% of the total. A third of that belongs to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is also expected to support Maimbo under the SADC and COMESA blocs.</p><p>He staunchly defends his time at the helm of the BEAC, despite criticisms and allegations of nepotism, which he denies.</p><p>Samuel Munzele Maimbo: The Western favourite?</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Zambian-born Maimbo is vice-president for budget, performance review and strategic planning at the World Bank. He is backed by nearly half of the continent through the endorsement of SADC (excluding South Africa) and COMESA, which brings together 21 members, from Tunisia to Eswatini.</p><p>He previously served as chief of staff to David Malpass, the former World Bank president known to be close to Donald Trump. This could help Maimbo, since the US, with about 6.5% of the votes, is the AfDB's second-largest shareholder (after Nigeria).</p><p>Many non-regional shareholders want a decisive break from the outgoing administration, and see him as the face of change.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Maimbo has spent most of his career in Washington, far from Africa. Some shareholders therefore brand him 'the Western candidate'. Even so, non-regional countries hold a combined 40% of the voting rights, so their backing is vital.</p><p>Although he enjoys the SADC's official support, South Africa chose to present its own candidate, so that regional front may fracture before election day. COMESA's support might also prove shaky.</p><p>Climate finance has become vital to development banking. Because of his links to Malpass - widely criticised for perceived climate scepticism - he faces questions from some shareholders.</p><p>Amadou Hott: The Heir</p><p>Strengths</p><p>He is regarded as Adesina's chosen successor. The Nigerian president of the AfDB appointed him as special envoy for the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA). This may mean Nigeria (the AfDB's largest shareholder, with 8.7% of the votes) will back him.</p><p>His CV also fits the job: he was Senegal's economy minister and a former AfDB vice-president for energy, green growth and climate change. He has solid private-sector experience, including at leading international banks.</p><p>Senegal's authorities fully support him, even holding a ceremony to kick off his campaign. Since launching his bid last September, he has visited key capitals to try to win over individual shareholders.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Being seen as Adesina's heir is both a strength and a weakness. Many shareholders want a clear break from the outgoing president's style of governance.</p><p>Unlike some rivals, he does not have the formal backing of a regional bloc. Even ECOWAS appears split, since C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is supporting Sidi Ould Tah.</p><p>His career has met some controversies. In 2013, on becoming the first director-general of Senegal's Sovereign Strategic Investment Fund (FONSIS), he was criticised for requesting a monthly housing allowance of 3 million CFA francs. Earlier, when managing Aliko Dangote's finances in the early 2010s, he was accused of conflicts of interest, given his closeness to the Nigerian billionaire.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": ["Because of his links to Malpass - widely criticised for perceived climate scepticism - he faces questions from some shareholders.

However, persistent and deep-seated regional inequalities highlight the policy's challenges and limitations, as reflected in the EU's 9th Cohesion Report and recent analyses from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While Hungary's average income level has approached EU standards, stark disparities remain between the country's regions, particularly in employment, education, and income.</emphasis><br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>Since the early 2000s, the EU has sought to build a more inclusive society by focusing on employment growth, skills development, and poverty reduction. These priorities have translated into measurable improvements across Hungary, especially in labour market resilience during crises, employment rates, and access to education. For instance, Hungary's employment rate for people aged 20-64 reached 80% in 2022, with several regions seeing an increase of over 15 percentage points. However, substantial regional variations remain, with the southern and northeastern areas lagging behind.<br/></p><p><br/>Poverty risk remains disproportionately high in some Hungarian regions. In 2022, the AROPE (at risk of poverty or social exclusion) rate for Hungary was lower than in previous years, yet still alarmingly high in areas like the Southern Transdanubia, Eastern, and Northern Hungary regions, where 22-26% of residents face poverty risk. Meanwhile, urban areas, notably Budapest, have attracted a concentration of higher-income, highly educated individuals, further exacerbating the urban-rural divide.<br/></p><p><br/>Nationwide, the employment gap between genders was around 11% in 2022, with women benefiting from better childcare, flexible work arrangements, and higher educational attainment. This progress, however, has been unevenly distributed, with underdeveloped regions seeing gender employment gaps of up to 16%.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">An even more divided country</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Hungary's overall GDP per capita has risen significantly, from 66% of the EU average in 2010 to 76% in 2022, partly due to foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in high-tech industries like electric vehicle manufacturing and battery production. Yet, this national growth masks severe regional disparities. Hungary's capital, Budapest, has outpaced other regions, achieving levels of GDP per capita far exceeding those of southern and eastern areas, where growth has stagnated. According to the IMF, such inequalities, if unaddressed, could widen further as green and digital transitions advance.<br/></p><p><br/>Regions with higher initial productivity and workforce participation, such as Pest and Gyor-Moson-Sopron, have seen faster economic growth than underdeveloped areas like Somogy and Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n. These findings underscore a persistent challenge: regions starting from a disadvantaged position struggle to catch up economically, suggesting structural barriers that inhibit convergence.<br/></p><p><br/>A strong focus of the EU's Cohesion Policy has been on improving education and workforce skills, which are crucial for long-term productivity and economic resilience. In Budapest, the share of adults aged 25-34 with tertiary qualifications reached around 58% in 2022, which stands in stark contrast to the national average of about 30%. Across many rural regions in Hungary, the proportion of individuals with higher education is considerably lower, ranging between 20% and 25%. This urban-rural divide in educational attainment places Hungary among EU countries with the most pronounced regional educational disparities, with only a few other nations, like Romania and the Czech Republic, showing comparable differences between their capital and rural areas.<br/></p><p><br/>EU-wide, about 42% of people aged 25-34 held a tertiary degree in 2022, making Hungary's rural regions trail behind this target by 10 to 15 percentage points. Such discrepancies underscore the need for targeted support in educational infrastructure and accessibility in Hungary's rural areas to close the gap, foster equal opportunities, and bolster economic resilience across all regions.<br/></p><p><br/>This educational divide is not unique to Hungary; however, the national average falls short of the EU's target, which aims for 45% of young adults to hold a tertiary degree. Increasing this figure is critical for the EU's green and digital transitions, as a skilled workforce will be essential to support industries undergoing technological advancements.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital and green transitions are double-edged swords</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>The digital and green transitions present both opportunities and risks for Hungary. On the one hand, digitalization offers pathways for economic growth. However, Hungary's preparedness for artificial intelligence (AI) integration is one of the lowest in the EU, especially in underdeveloped regions. The IMF has highlighted that Hungary's AI-readiness index hovers around 0.50, with a 45% employment rate in high-exposure occupations, underscoring the need for significant improvement in digital skills and infrastructure, particularly outside Budapest.<br/></p><p><br/>In terms of green transition, the IMF warns that a lack of targeted policies could deepen regional inequalities. Wealthier regions like Central Hungary have a higher share of \"green jobs,\" while less affluent areas may face challenges in adapting to carbon-neutral industries. The IMF estimates that Budapest could see productivity growth of up to 1.5% from AI and green investments, while other regions, such as the Northern and Southern Great Plains, might experience only modest growth. Targeted investments in digital and green infrastructure could help mitigate these inequalities, making the transition more inclusive.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bad governance may harm growth</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Good governance and institutional quality play a vital role in reducing regional disparities. The IMF's research indicates that governance quality-characterized by low corruption, well-functioning public institutions, and impartial public services-is statistically significant in promoting regional income convergence. These findings align with broader EU cohesion goals, which advocate for robust governance at all levels to foster a favourable business environment and stimulate private investment.<br/></p><p><br/>In Hungary, regional disparities in governance quality contribute to the unequal economic landscape. For instance, Budapest benefits from high institutional quality and low levels of perceived corruption, whereas rural areas struggle with governance challenges. By improving governance structures and implementing anti-corruption measures, Hungary can create a more balanced economic environment that supports private sector growth and reduces income inequality across regions.<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Balancing Progress and Equality</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>Hungary's case highlights the need for targeted policy interventions to address structural disparities. Investments in digital infrastructure and education, particularly in lagging regions, are essential for equipping the workforce with the skills needed in the evolving job market. Likewise, fostering private-sector research and development (R&amp;D) could accelerate regional income convergence by creating high-value jobs.<br/></p><p><br/>The EU and IMF findings emphasize that improving cohesion in Hungary will require a nuanced approach to economic development. The EU is already considering reforms to its Cohesion Policy framework to focus more on performance than regional allocation alone, a shift expected to begin around 2028. This evolution reflects a growing recognition that while aggregate national statistics may show progress, sub-national disparities often tell a different story. For Hungary, a combination of well-designed national and EU-level policies can help close these gaps, creating a more inclusive and resilient economic landscape for the future.<br/></p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["The IMF estimates that Budapest could see productivity growth of up to 1. 5% from AI and green investments, while other regions, such as the Northern and Southern Great Plains, might experience only modest growth.

Rotterdam's innovations in water management and climate resilience strategies, and Singapore's green infrastructure and transportation systems. These are models we are studying closely,' she says.</p><p>Catching up with Singapore or Rotterdam will not be an easy feat: It took Singapore more than five decades to assume the status of an urban city model, but Sackey says Accra has to 'start from somewhere'.</p><p>Waste management</p><p>Arguably, the most pressing issue facing the metropolis is waste management. Accra generates nearly 900,000 metric tonnes of solid waste annually and approximately 2,200 metric tonnes of waste per day, but only about 20% of this is recycled and the rest is dumped at landfill sites.</p><p>At these sites, there is open burning of waste, which affects public health. Scientists have also found that the landfills contribute an average of 44% of methane emissions, ultimately contributing to global warming.</p><p>As part of its global commitment to significantly reducing greenhouse gases, Sackey says the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) is actively promoting source separation of solid waste to make recycling easier. The initiative encourages households and businesses to separate organic waste from dry, recyclable materials.</p><p>'The source separation programme is designed to help us process organic waste into compost, and recycle the dry materials through upcycling. It's a win-win for the environment and green job creation in Accra,' she says.</p><p>Accra is one of over 100 cities around the world collaborating under a C40 Cities initiative that is facilitating collaborations among city mayors to confront the global climate crisis. Leveraging this platform, Sackey recently launched an Informal Waste Corporation Cooperative in Accra to integrate informal waste pickers into the city's waste management system. This is to assist in the collection, transportation and processing of recyclable materials from public spaces.</p><p>Additionally, through the Covenant of Mayors in Sub-Saharan Africa (CoM SSA) and the World Bank's City Climate Finance Gap Fund, the city is exploring the possibility of constructing a compost processing facility and a 400-ton capacity anaerobic digestion plant that will convert organic waste into compressed natural gas for use as energy in domestic cooking and industries.</p><p>'We are working with our partners to secure funding for these and other projects which will not only manage waste efficiently but also contribute to energy sustainability,' Sackey says. 'A lot of these projects, including technical supports from C40 Cities, are with the goal of creating green jobs in Accra and supporting the city's broader sustainability goals.'</p><p>Public transport</p><p>Another focus of Mayor Sackey is public transportation. Besides open burning of waste that pollutes the air, aged commercial vehicles known locally as 'trotro' - which dominate public transport operations within the Accra metropolis - contribute greatly to air pollution.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes 28,000 deaths in Ghana each year, and costs the country $2.5bn in economic loss. Sackey says she and her team are finding ways to improve urban mobility while addressing the climate risks posed by the current transport infrastructure.</p><p>Past government-backed efforts failed to popularise mass transit buses, such as the Metro mass bus transit system and the 'Aayalolo' bus rapid transit system, which sought to discourage the use of private vehicles and reduce congestion within the central business district.</p><p>'We are conducting climate risk assessments to identify the potential impacts on transportation infrastructure and to develop strategies for more resilient urban mobility,' Sackey says, betting on support from the World Bank and the C40 Cities Finance Facility to develop transportation infrastructure.</p><p>Accra's flooding crisis</p><p>The Accra metropolis is low-lying and water runoffs flow downward to it from other municipalities, wreaking havoc in flood-prone areas, including Dansoman and Chorkor, during the heavy rainfall season.</p><p>'The AMA has developed a comprehensive drainage map and an early warning system for flood-prone communities.Education and sensitisation is also key, to keep the drainages free from waste, and free the waterways,' says Sackey.</p><p>In 2017, President Akufo-Addo vowed to make Accra the cleanest city in Africa, but seven years down the line, it remains a pipe dream.</p><p>However, Sackey says: 'I am promoting cleanliness and environmental responsibility...

By retaining ownership of the EV ARC(TM) systems, Beam Global secures a steady, predictable revenue stream while delivering sustainable solutions. Globos Osiguranje is uniquely able to provide Driving on Sunshine sponsored EV charging for free to EV owners because EV ARC(TM) systems do not require utility electricity and do not generate costs for the energy dispensed. Providing the EV charging for free while monetizing the sponsorship significantly lowers administrative costs and risks. The amenity value delivered to site hosts enables Beam Global to receive highly favorable economic terms on the parking spaces in which the EV ARC(TM) systems are placed. This unique model means that sponsorship payments are not diluted by typical operating costs which might burden companies that do not have Beam Global's technology advantage.</p><p>\"I have been describing this sponsorship model for several years. The partnership with Globos Osiguranje at the Belgrade Airport is an exciting milestone for Beam Global as we continue to expand across Europe and it's very exciting in that it validates the Driving on Sunshine sponsorship model,\" said Desmond Wheatley, CEO of Beam Global. \"We are delighted to be working with Vinci. Airports represent a tremendous opportunity for sustainable infrastructure solutions but they cannot afford to have their parking lots disrupted by construction and electrical work because they work 365 days a year. With this sponsorship model and our zero construction deployments, we are opening doors for similar engagements in major travel hubs throughout the world. We're committed to providing clean, reliable off-grid EV charging solutions that not only meet the growing demand for public charging infrastructure but also create a sustainable, recurring revenue stream for Beam with very favorable terms and no disruption for our airport or other partners.\"</p><p>Five solar-powered EV ARC(TM) units are now deployed for public EV charging at the Belgrade Airport. Each off-grid unit can charge multiple vehicles at once, making it a resilient and sustainable solution for the airport's high-traffic environment. The systems are positioned in P1, Prime, the closest car park to the terminal building.</p><p>\"We are proud to be at the forefront of promoting sustainable energy solutions in Serbia through this sponsorship with Beam Global,\" said Sinisa Pratljacic, CEO at Globos Osiguranje. \"By sponsoring EV ARC(TM) products at one of Serbia's most frequented locations, we are taking an important step in our commitment to environmental responsibility and green innovation.\"</p><p>\"We are proud to make Belgrade Airport the first airport in the world to offer free, standalone, 100% solar-powered EV charging\" said Chivoine Rem, Belgrade Airport CEO.

This is not the case for Norfund. Determined to go further than its peers - like the World Bank's IFC, France's Proparco and the Netherlands' FMO - the Norwegian investment fund, focused on development and job creation, took this strategic direction in 2023. Active on the continent since 1997, it now has an African portfolio worth around $3.6bn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tellef Thorleifsson, who has been Norfund's CEO since 2018, is the driving force behind this reorganisation. Passionate about agribusiness (a field for which he created a fund in East Africa), he had already made his mark by co-founding the venture capital firm Northzone in 1996, which has since raised $1.5bn.</p><p>Thorleifsson talks to The Africa Report about Norfund's green strategy for the continent.</p><p>How does Norfund operate within Africa's economic landscape?</p><p>The environment is tough for businesses due to high exchange rates, limited availability of local currencies and rising food prices. Despite this, many countries in East and West Africa are showing rapid growth. Norfund continues to be counter-cyclical, investing heavily. We are not a regulated bank like Proparco or FMO, but rather a green investment fund prioritising social and environmental impact alongside profit. Two-thirds of our investments are focused on sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Norfund has been focusing on climate change for the past two years. What are your goals?</p><p>Our priority has always been job creation, especially in energy, which is key to development. We have identified target countries, like South Africa, to maximise the impact of our climate change efforts. For example, in countries where coal plays a large role in the energy mix, our goal is to prevent the construction of new thermal power plants. We want to do more for the continent - in many countries, the share of renewables in the energy mix is already significant.</p><p>Wake up to the essential with the Editor's picks.</p><p>Green infrastructure is one of your priorities, but your results have been limited so far...</p><p>That's true; we've only recently started. We have big ambitions in waste recycling, water and plastic. We had a team specifically working on these projects, but it's been challenging to find areas where local value chains align well with private entities. We've made some investments in plastic recycling and active funds. We're also trying to reduce energy consumption and pollution, but, overall, it's not easy to find investment opportunities in these segments.</p><p>Africa's tropical forests hold significant potential for reducing carbon emissions. Are you active in this area?</p><p>We have invested significantly in forestry, and in 2023, we launched the African Forestry Impact Platform with British International Investment (BII) and Finnfund, managed by the Australian company New Forests. However, while it's tempting to invest heavily in forestry to reduce our carbon footprint, this doesn't always benefit local populations. We prefer to invest directly in businesses, like cement factories, and help them reduce their CO2 emissions.</p><p>You mentioned the platform you launched with BII and Finnfund. Are you increasingly relying on such collaborations between development finance institutions (DFIs)?</p><p>We are going even further. Through the Arise platform, for example, we cooperate with Rabobank, FMO and NorFinance, and hold stakes in some of the largest banks, like Equity Bank and Ecobank. We can hold up to 35% of their capital, but, whenever possible, we involve private investors. Ideally, as in other parts of the world, we aim to combine DFIs [development finance institutions] with private investors to increase leverage.</p><p>Is it harder now to convince investors to come to Africa?</p><p>With high dollar interest rates and increased risk premiums, investors are looking for security. When bank deposits yield nothing, the appetite for risk grows, as does the willingness to invest in emerging markets. We see, especially in the energy sector, that increased subsidies are impacting the rise in internal rates of return (IRR), which measures the financial yield of an investment. Some investors wonder why they should invest in emerging markets when they can get sufficient returns in the US or Europe.</p><p>For Africa, the picture is mixed. There's still strong interest in the commodities and mining sectors, especially in areas that support the green transition. But overall, the situation is challenging. There's more funding coming from the Middle East or Turkiye. While it's in Africa's interest to diversify its sources of financing, these new players must adhere to the same standards [as Western investors] in areas like corporate social responsibility (CSR) and protecting local populations. Sometimes, certain investors are more cynical and focus only on maximizing profits.</p><p>In your latest annual report, you indicated a 20% IRR in climate change mitigation. How did you achieve such a result?</p><p>This high rate of return is tied to a few projects that saw their value increase significantly in a short period. Over the long term, this rate will decrease. Last year, across all activities, our return rate was quite low: 1.8% in dollars, while over the past five or six years, it averaged 5%. It's slightly higher in Norwegian kroner, but that currency has weakened against the dollar.</p><p>Returns are high, and it's important to keep funds moving, which means being able to sell. We typically invest for five years, and when we sell quickly, we can recycle the funds and invest each year two and a half times the amount allocated by the Norwegian government. This is the core of our strategy.</p><p>You have started investing in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Senegal, in renewable energy, distribution and banking...</p><p>The CFA franc and the monetary union, although debated, can be a significant advantage in terms of market access and stability. We'd like to strengthen our presence in these regions, but, for now, opening an office there isn't planned.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": ["We want to do more for the continent - in many countries, the share of renewables in the energy mix is already significant.

Holistic landscape restoration has more than just ecological benefits - by bringing people together to restore their landscape, it can build social cohesion and capital among and between communities, as well as serving as the backbone of thriving local and regional economies. By producing benefits for multiple sectors and stakeholder groups, holistic landscape restoration can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future in line with the EU Green Deal's vision.</p><p>Through Landscape Finance, policymakers could catalyse transformative change via holistic landscape restoration, making lasting impact on Europe's landscapes.\u00a0Here are some recommendations for how EU policymakers can integrate a Landscape Finance approach into their work:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. LANDSCAPES AND LANDSCAPE PARTNERSHIPS NEED TO BE RECOGNISED IN POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE AND TO MEET MULTIPLE TARGETS\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should allocate resources to support landscape partnerships that drive holistic landscape restoration</emphasis>. Public funds in the form of unrestricted and flexible grant funding should be made available to support multi- stakeholder landscape partnership and governance processes to catalyse restoration. This is the most catalytic of all funding opportunities within holistic landscape restoration as the partnership develops the vision and plan for the landscape, providing governance and driving long- term restoration.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implement incentives that are aligned to nature</emphasis>. It is critical to redirect or eliminate environmentally harmful incentives, such as subsidies, on behalf of activities that restore ecosystems and enhance ecosystem services. Accelerating the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and applying the reform with integrity will be instrumental in aligning nature and agricultural biodiversity objectives and finance. By aligning policies to reward benefits appropriately and financially penalise harms, governments can encourage nature-positive actions and discourage harmful ones.\u00a0</p><p>Holistic landscape restoration can serve as an enabling platform to streamline implementation of national plans targeting the same landscape. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National and regional development plans (including National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans) of EU member states should recognise landscapes and landscape partnerships</emphasis>, facilitating vertical and horizontal policy coherence and integration of national spatial planning and budgeting across sectors. This should be done to best suit the policy and fiscal systems of each country. However, regardless of each country's level of decentralised decision-making, landscapes can be leveraged to implement adaptation, nature restoration and drought plans, among other policies.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop harmonised accounting and reporting frameworks for landscapes </emphasis>that enable the private sector (companies and investors) to report against emerging sustainable finance regulations such as the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. PUBLIC FINANCE CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL, CATALYTIC ROLE IN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All guidance documentation for the Nature Restoration Law developed by the European Commission should explicitly recognise the value of landscapes in tackling multiple goals and be translated in national restoration plans</emphasis>. By fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among government agencies, NGOs, businesses and local communities at landscape level, diverse interests can be aligned, and resources pooled, to implement strategies that tackle multiple challenges in a cost-efficient and effective way.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should produce a guidance document on how to incorporate landscape restoration into national restoration plans</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop a mechanism with the mandate to provide earmarked funding for landscapes</emphasis>. Within the current multiannual financing framework (MFF), Directorates-General that will benefit from restoration (CLIMA, ENV, AGRI, EMPL, REGIO, SANTE, etc.) should earmark portions of their budgets for landscape restoration. These earmarked budget elements could be put under one governance system, a dedicated restoration fund. Equally, dedicated financial support should be considered in the new MFF (2028-2034). This could be done through a funding programme similar to the European Innovation Council Accelerator, targeted towards attracting private finance to holistic landscape restoration activities and processes - for example, by providing guarantees to de-risk investments, or by providing subordinated funding as part of a blended-finance approach. The European Investment Bank could provide advisory support to such a vehicle and/or provide co- investment.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. WITHIN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION, INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS SHOULD ADOPT A LONG-TERM HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE, INCORPORATING RESTORATION OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENHANCE CLIMATE RESILIENCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should provide public funding for landscape restoration initiatives to enable the integration of grey infrastructure projects with improvements in associated green infrastructure</emphasis>. Taking a holistic approach to these investments at landscape level will be more cost-effective, and it will improve the resilience of the total investment to the physical risks of climate change while generating multiple valuable public benefits. Large scale landscape restoration projects should get similar financial support and attention as large grey infrastructure projects.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We need Landscape Finance more than ever</emphasis></p><p>As farmers protests crank up a notch and EU officials threaten to dial back Green Deal measures, the question of how to achieve the EU Green Deal's vision has never been more pressing. More than ever, we need new financing frameworks like Landscape Finance to support nature restoration as well as help farmers to transition to more regenerative practices at landscape scale.

Our practical approach - the 4 Returns framework - is helping people worldwide to restore our home planet and keep it healthy for generations to come.\u00a0 In November 2023, Commonland co-authored a new report proposing the application of an investment concept called \"Landscape Finance\" as a financing approach for supporting holistic landscape restoration with a coalition of 19 environmental organisations, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/\">World Resource Institute</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goldstandard.org/\">Gold Standard</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/\">The Nature Conservancy</url>, and EIT <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate-kic.org/\">Climate KIC</url></p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["The European Investment Bank could provide advisory support to such a vehicle and/or provide co- investment. 3.

Large scale landscape restoration projects should get similar financial support and attention as large grey infrastructure projects."]}, {"relevance_score": 44, "title": "Europe unprepared for climate disaster, warns World Bank [Advocacy Lab Content]", "published": "2024-05-21", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate-related disasters cost Europe more than (EURO)77 billion last year, according to a new report.

And while European countries are taking major steps to prepare for these impacts, the reports conclude that more needs to be done - particularly in critical sectors such as those that provide emergency response services.</p><p>In half of EU member states, for instance, \u00a0there are fire stations located in areas that face more than one natural disaster hazard. Such lack of preparation for emergency services has already had impacts, says Zuzana Stanton-Geddes, a senior disaster response management specialist with the World Bank who was a team leader for the project.</p><p>During the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/experts-blame-poor-government-preparation-for-greek-fires-devastation/\">2023 wildfires in Greece</url> patients had to be evacuated from Alexandroupolis General Hospital because of where it was located, and during <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/climate-crisis-made-deadly-german-floods-up-to-nine-times-more-likely/\">Germany's 2021 floods</url> fire stations became inactive because they were in the flood zone.</p><p>\"The report shows that critical infrastructure like fire and police stations, hospitals, schools, roads, and power lines are often located in areas that are vulnerable to multiple hazards including floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and landslides,\" she said.</p><p>Stanton-Geddes added: \"Preparing for disasters and climate shocks is extremely important to Europe's policymakers and these reports provide tools, data, and evidence to boost both disaster preparedness and resilience to climate shocks for their people.\"</p><p>But this isn't to say that Europe's lawmakers aren't doing anything.</p><p>At the European level, there is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/opinion/the-eu-adaptation-strategy-is-everybodys-cup-of-coffee/\">EU Adaptation Strategy</url>, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/greece-under-scrutiny-for-failing-to-implement-eus-floods-directive/\">EU Floods Directive</url>, and various aspects of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/sections/climate-strategy-2050/\">European Green Deal</url> focusing on adaptation. The reports find several examples of best practices by national governments as well.</p><p>\"Portugal has invested a lot into comprehensive wildfire prevention and preparedness, such as with research and modern analytics, community-level actions, reforms towards integrated wildland fire management and fuel management,\" says Stanton-Geddes.</p><p>\"Portugal's efforts have inspired other countries to take similar actions. The Netherlands is a well-known example of flood risk management - with a mix of measures and investments - including nature-based solutions. Italy has been investing in and incentivizing multi-functional upgrading of public and private buildings and integrating seismic safety and energy efficiency.\"</p><p>\"Many European cities have also developed local climate adaptation plans and initiatives, such as green infrastructure, management of heatwaves, or improving flood risk management,\" she added, explaining: \"Cities like Vienna and Salzburg, in Austria, are tackling the urban heat island effect through a combination of actions ranging from greening and the use of reflective building materials to energy efficiency measures and investments in sustainable modes of transport.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Using data for adaptation financing</emphasis></p><p>One of the reports deals specifically with the issue of how to finance increased climate adaptation preparedness. It notes that early investment is much more cost-effective than later investment, and that prioritization is the best way to focus spending. This means that countries should focus financing on more risk-exposed areas or assets that may be vulnerable to disaster impacts and put people in danger or cause major disruptions, such as ageing infrastructure or critical networks.</p><p>The report notes that more research and data are needed on where those vulnerabilities are and what kinds of costs would be involved in remedying the situation. It suggests that countries develop climate \"adaptation pathways\" that set the direction of travel, combining current and future climate risk data.</p><p>Given current information, the report estimates that the cost of climate adaptation will vary between (EURO)34 to (EURO)110 per person per year, depending on where they live. Total adaptation costs in the European Union up to the 2030s could be between (EURO)15 billion to (EURO)64 billion annually - suggesting a necessary scale of adaptation finance between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent of EU GDP.</p><p>\"Adaptation pathways combine the needs and priorities across all economic and administrative sectors,\" explains Solene Dengler, a senior climate change adaptation specialist with the World Bank who worked on the report.</p><p>\"This means countries need to carry out more and better studies both at national and sectoral levels to identify adaptation gaps, costs, and benefits of adaptation measures and track adaptation expenditures and implementation,\" said Dengler.</p><p>The report concludes several specific case studies such as wildfires and extreme heat in Bulgaria, floods impact transport in Romania, and wildfire prevention in the forestry sector in Sweden.</p><p>But for costs to be correctly estimated so governments can steer financing in the right direction, better data is needed.</p><p>\"There is a lack of information on projected impacts of climate risks for the short to medium term from the 2030s to the 2050s), especially to inform sectoral or investment portfolio assessments,\" says Dengler.</p><p>She remarked: \"Strengthening a country's financial resilience will also require improved macroeconomic modelling that can better capture extreme impacts and take into account adjusted macroeconomic impacts when policymakers are considering a package of adaptation measures. At the EU level, the recent European Climate Risk Assessment and this report are important contributions to this evolving knowledge base.\"</p><p>In the end, neither climate change adaptation nor climate change mitigation strategies should distract from the other, she said, \"Climate change adaptation is complementary to climate change mitigation. Acting on both is economically beneficial, can reduce direct losses from disaster and climate impacts and have broader social and environmental benefits.\"</p><p>The report concludes that a major scale-up of public, private, and blended finance will be necessary and investment planning and financial strategies are not yet adequately informed by an understanding of the costs of climate change adaptation at national and EU levels.</p><p>One area of concern is that too much of the disaster and climate risk is managed through budgetary instruments at the EU level and by EU Member States, with gaps concerning pre-arranged funds and the use of risk transfer mechanisms, such as risk insurance.</p><p>Response operations to wildfires account for approximately one-third of total response costs in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/topics/civil-protection-mechanism/\">European Union Civil Protection Mechanism</url> budget. But if the EU experienced wildfires this year similar to the extremes of the 2017 season, there would need to be a 70 per cent increase in the annual budget. This, the report concludes, shows that not enough planning has gone into matching financing needs with disaster potential based on previous experience.</p><p>\"The major takeaway is that the EU's substantial climate risks require system-wide transformational adaptation, which includes reforming institutions, legal frameworks, and sectoral strategies,\" said Dengler, adding: \"A piecemeal approach is no longer enough. Adaptation measures must be mainstreamed and coordinated across sectors and ministries, including in planning, fiscal, and sectoral strategies.\"</p><p>[By Dave Keating\u00a0I Edited by Brian Maguire | <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["The Netherlands is a well-known example of flood risk management - with a mix of measures and investments - including nature-based solutions.

At the same time, tourism also causes environmental degradation and is a growing source of greenhouse gas emissions, notably from transport. How can tourism be reconciled with green objectives? Can emissions be reduced to zero?</emphasis></p><p>The Mediterranean is a precious ecosystem of life on land and below water, and also a cradle of diverse cultures, history and civilisations that makes it one of the top global tourism destinations.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, the future of the Mediterranean is under threat and concerns us all. A common vision and strategy, followed by firm action are required for its protection. It is a great challenge, and an even greater responsibility to act proactively to mitigate the environmental crisis in the Med and to ensure the well-being of its people, who are the first to be impacted by human activity.</p><p>To succeed in this goal, no country can do it alone. We need to cooperate to accomplish the Paris Agreement on climate change and set common targets and deadlines to achieve sooner than 2050 the reduction of 90% of greenhouse emissions from the transport sector, and such should be the case for tourism and travel.</p><p>We also need to align our national strategies and policies and act together for the protection of the environment, but also for sustainable business activity and sustainable jobs in the whole region. Because in the end, tourism is all about connecting people and places, and tourism\u2019s workforce is its strongest asset.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who are the leading countries or municipalities on sustainable tourism across the Mediterranean region? Are there best practices that are worth mentioning that others could draw inspiration from?</emphasis></p><p>Several destinations in the Mediterranean and Southern Europe region have partnered through Interreg and other European programs, and today represent success stories in how to work together, exchange best practices and implement ambitious plans that are already transforming popular destinations.\u00a0</p><p>I can speak of inspiring examples in my country Greece, where several islands are in the process of becoming sustainable. For example, Astypalea island has already shifted to e-mobility by switching from conventional to electric vehicles. </p><p>Tilos island is to become the first island in the Mediterranean 100% energy self-sufficient, using solar and wind for energy, and 80% of its waste is now recycled. Paros aims to become the first single-use plastic, waste-free island in the Med. </p><p>And Rhodes has launched the \u201cCo-Lab\u201d project for a holistic sustainable transformation of the destination\u2019s tourism value chain, for environmental, social and economic progress.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What initiatives is the European Union taking in order to promote more sustainable tourism?</emphasis></p><p>Tourism represents over 10% of the European economy and employment, and also supports social cohesion. It is a multiplier of growth, supporting almost every productive sector, such as transportation, energy, agriculture, construction, trade and creative industries.\u00a0</p><p>Therefore, tourism\u2019s sustainable transformation should be placed high on the European agenda. The European Parliament has adopted a resolution in March 2021 for the urgent need for an EU Strategy for sustainable tourism, the first to be drafted.\u00a0</p><p>Following our resolution, the European Commission presented last June the Transition Pathway for Tourism. This paper is basically shaping the guidelines for tourism stakeholders to take action and will lead to the European Agenda for Tourism 2030, following a wide consultation across Europe.\u00a0</p><p>Sustainable tourism strategies will not only help tackle seasonality by extending the tourism season but also prevent overtourism and its negative impact on the destination, by developing sustainable alternative tourism offering and green infrastructure in both the public and private sectors. </p><p>Tourism activities that will help preserve local culture, history and heritage, whether it is natural or cultural sites, but also local gastronomy and local products by local producers, and artefacts by local craftspeople, are part of a global trend and mindset about how each traveller can positively contribute to the destination. </p><p>Authentic travel experiences, such as nature-based activities, ecotourism, health tourism, sports tourism and cultural tourism, allow visitors\u2019 flows to spread year-round, but mostly create steady business and income to the benefit of the environment, the economy and the society.\u00a0</p><p>The European and national strategies for sustainable tourism will require significant funding for European stakeholders and especially SMEs. European funding is available through various instruments, which are however scattered and very difficult to access. </p><p>The EU needs to do more in terms of funding, such as creating a new budget line specifically for tourism and facilitating access to funding, especially for SMEs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cities like Venice have restricted access to large ships from their waters because of the environmental damage they can cause. In cities, ferries also emit toxic fumes that cause air pollution. Do you think a European framework is needed to address this nuisance? Or is this a matter best addressed at the local level?</emphasis></p><p>Common European guidelines and rules are definitely needed to prevent environmental harm from excessive marine activities. Indeed, several major cruise destinations and European ports are introducing restrictions to prevent environmental degradation. </p><p>The European Parliament adopted last month its legislative resolution concerning the EU rules on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport. The whole of Southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin relies heavily on shipping and on cruise activity, requiring stricter rules and more ambitious targets to tackle pollution. </p><p>We, therefore, called for the shipping sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 2% from 2025, 20% from 2035 and 80% from 2050 compared to 2020 levels. National and local governments, but also the private sector, have to take into account the emergency and align to adopt more effective measures the sooner as possible.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The European Union is considering restrictions on pollution from maritime fuels as well as measures to encourage electric mobility. What is the relevance of this for the tourism industry? Can clean mobility become a selling point for the Mediterranean?\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Electromobility is about to become the norm in our everyday life in the coming years, on how we move and travel.\u00a0The European Parliament recently voted on the resolution regarding the AFIR Regulation, part of the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package and the strongest legal framework we have come up with, to date. </p><p>The Regulation sets legally binding minimum requirements for member states to develop the necessary alternative fuel infrastructure, aiming to create a fully interconnected and interoperable network across Europe. </p><p>Our position is steady that we need in advance to secure adequate infrastructure across all European road networks and in popular spots within cities, to be able to cope with the increasing need for capacity of both residents, professionals, and visitors. </p><p>We know Europe is a leader globally in addressing climate change. I would like to see Europe also become a global example of green travel, being the most visited destination in the world.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some municipalities have started restricting access to sites or cities in order to prevent nuisance caused by tourism. Are we moving towards the end of mass tourism?</emphasis></p><p>Mass tourism is gradually giving its place to authentic personalised and diversified travel experiences, which have been trending in the past years. The pandemic and the priority on health safety have accelerated the changes in travel patterns. </p><p>We already see a swift shift in demand for experiences linked with health tourism, wellness, sports and outdoor activities in nature. Countries and destinations that in the past had relied heavily on mass tourism or almost exclusively on the sea-sun-sand are already shifting towards thematic tourism products based on their natural and cultural wealth that will bring new demand and new tourist flows throughout the year. </p><p>It is very important though, to have the right framework in place so that businesses can be supported to adjust to the new demand, in terms of tourism products and services. States also must provide a holistic strategy and action plan, with clear guidelines and the necessary funding for the infrastructure needed in destinations, for business activity to be able to develop such services, for the workforce\u2019s upskilling and reskilling, and eventually to attract new investments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The European Parliament has proposed that Member States draft national plans for sustainable tourism, as part of the COVID-19 recovery programme. What progress has been made on this? How much support is there for the idea?</emphasis></p><p>Transportation and tourism were the sectors mostly hit by the pandemic outbreak. In our resolution for the first EU strategy for sustainable tourism, we asked member-states to devise national plans for sustainable tourism development, with funding from the Next Generation EU program.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Especially countries that rely on tourism, should be able to rebuild a stronger, more resilient and more sustainable tourism sector. Yet, each country has been responsible for the national plan submitted, based on specific national priorities. </p><p>There is no way to track the exact amount each country has secured for tourism, as such actions are part of the wider horizontal national strategies, for example, digitisation and greening of the economy.\u00a0</p><p>What also is important, especially in times of crises, such as now, is that we are dealing with an acute shock in energy prices and inflation, countries should rethink their taxation policies, and implement tax reliefs on goods and services that are heavily related to tourism.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It is essential to support local, family-run, small and medium-sized businesses, which are at the core of hospitality and represent about 90 per cent of business in the wider tourism sector.\u00a0</p><p>And the most urgent priority of all is to support the workforce and restore jobs in the sector at the pre-pandemic levels.

Not only because it is a matter of social justice for the people living in these areas, but also because growing social and economic inequalities threaten cohesion. </p><p>If the transition to sustainability is not entirely fair, covering the needs of all citizens and all regions, a significant part of the human capital, entrepreneurship and jobs in several European regions is at risk of being lost. These areas also need to be facilitated for their green and digital transformation, and for adopting circular practices in green growth and blue economy.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You also mentioned the idea of creating a European crisis management mechanism to ensure a just transition to a green economy.

Last year, emerging markets including UAE, India and Chile accounted for 21% of the total green bond issuances in 2019.</p><p>In some ways the developing world has more to lose, with climate change expected to put increased pressure on food production, health and economic growth. Across Africa, we've seen positive steps from policy makers work to develop the structures that will give them access to the global green bond market. For example, Nigeria and Kenya have both developed frameworks to ensure local green bonds meet international certification standards and align with national priorities around food security, waste management and energy.</p><p>The two countries were therefore ahead of the European Union which agreed only in December on the EU taxonomy to provide investors with clarity on which activities are considered environmentally and socially sustainable.</p><p>Last month, Kenya issued the first local-currency green bond on the London Stock Exchange. While the bond's value is only US$42 million, it represents a turning point for Kenya's bond market. This is one of the first corporate bonds to be issued after Kenya's bond market collapsed in 2016 following failure of two banks.</p><p>These are important developments and the role of the UK government, which funded the creation of the framework through FSD Africa, shouldn't go unnoticed. But more work needs to be done to ensure that the opportunities being offered by Africa's green bond markets, are not being missed.</p><p>For a start, we must encourage collaboration and investment in green financing and adaptation from Africa's private sector. African businesses are not immune to the challenges of climate change and they cannot rely on governments only to supply project and infrastructural finance.</p><p>Green bonds will be a vital tool for the private sector to raise capital and become investors in the continent's green finance markets. We also need to recognise the role of public-private partnerships and tax incentives to encourage the entry of private investors. Kenya leads the way again, by enhancing governance structures and regulation as well providing tax incentives to help encourage investments.</p><p>Next, the international community must continue training initiatives which ensure policy makers have the skills to drive the regulatory changes required. A good example of this is the work undertaken by the Climate Bonds Initiative and FSD Africa in Nigeria last year, where the two organizations delivered training to the Securities Exchange Commission and the National Pensions Commission. Elsewhere, in Kenya, training on the country's National Treasury has been carried out to improve the capabilities of policy makers and regulators. We need to ensure policy makers have the skills needed to foster the continued growth of local green bond markets.</p><p>Lastly, governments across the continent must play a key role in developing and rolling out green bond regulations as well as encouraging market development.

There are ten years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and global momentum around transitioning to a green economy is growing.

It may also open doors to policy changes previously considered beyond reach. Economic analysis can help identify the most promising opportunities among them.</p><p>The economics of climate change is straightforward. Earth is warming both because greenhouse gases are costly to eliminate and because governments have permitted people to emit them into the atmosphere without penalty.</p><p>The classical remedy is a carbon tax, a fee on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Generally levied where fuels are extracted or imported, it discourages carbon emissions by making goods with larger carbon footprints more expensive. The World Bank reports that as of 2019, 57 local, regional and national governments have either enacted some form of carbon tax or plan to do so. When people must pay for their emissions, they quickly discover creative ways to reduce them.</p><p>Why, then, hasn't the United States adopted a carbon tax? One hurdle is the fear that emissions would fall too slowly in response to a carbon tax, that more direct measures are needed. Another difficulty is that political leaders have reason to fear voter opposition to taxation of any kind. But there are persuasive rejoinders to both objections.</p><p>Regarding the first, critics are correct that a carbon tax alone won't parry the climate threat. It is also true that as creatures of habit, humans tend to change their behavior only slowly, even in the face of significant financial incentives. But even small changes in behavior are greatly amplified by behavioral contagion - the social scientist's term for how ideas and behaviors spread from person to person like infectious diseases. And if a carbon tax were to shift the behavior of some individuals now, those changes would quickly spread more widely.</p><p>Smoking rates, for example, changed little in the short run even as cigarette taxes rose sharply, but that wasn't the end of the story. The most powerful predictor of whether someone will smoke is the percentage of her friends who smoke. Most smokers stick with their habit in the face of higher taxes, but a small minority quit, and still others refrain from starting.</p><p>Every peer group that includes those people thus contains a smaller proportion of smokers, which influences still others to quit or refrain, and so on. This contagion process explains why the percentage of American adults who smoke has fallen by two-thirds since the mid-1960s.</p><p>Behavioral contagion would similarly amplify the effects of a carbon tax. By making solar power cheaper in comparison with fossil fuels, for example, the tax would initially encourage a small number of families to install solar panels on their rooftops. But as with cigarette taxes, it's the indirect effects that really matter.</p><p>According to a 2012 study by the economists Bryan Bollinger and Kenneth Gillingham, a carbon tax that induced a family to install solar panels could be expected to stimulate a neighbor's copycat installation within four months, on average. Let another four months pass, and each of these two will have spawned additional installations of their own, for a total of four.</p><p>At the end of just two years' time, these figures suggest, the initial new installation will lead to 32 new installations. Contagion doesn't stop there, either, since each of these families will have shared news about their projects with friends and family in other locations.</p><p>Behavioral contagion also has been shown to influence dietary choices. People often eat meat because they grew up with, and continue to live among, people for whom substantial meat consumption is the norm. Because meat has a large carbon footprint, a carbon tax would make it more expensive relative to plant-based foods.</p><p>The direct effect of this price change would be small. But as some people shifted the composition of their diets, others would find it easier to shift as well. In short order, these positive-feedback effects would produce more widespread shifts in eating habits. Behavioral contagion would similarly amplify initial responses to a carbon tax in virtually every other energy-intensive activity.</p><p>Even with such gains in prospect, many legislators remain unenthusiastic because they perceive a carbon tax as being unpopular with voters. Many families have been struggling to make ends meet, they might say, and the last thing they need is a stiff new tax on energy use. But this problem has a simple solution, which is to adopt what economists call a revenue-neutral design. Under one version, all revenue from the tax would be returned to consumers in the form of monthly rebate checks.</p><p>Because the wealthy consume much more energy than others, they would contribute a disproportionate share of the revenue from a carbon tax. The top 10 percent of all income recipients account for almost half of carbon emissions worldwide, an Oxfam International study has found.</p><p>Use patterns are less skewed in the United States, but here, too, the wealthy live in bigger houses, drive bigger cars and, at least when the pandemic isn't raging, take many more trips to distant destinations. Even with equal rebates per capita, most people would get a monthly check for more than they'd paid that month in carbon taxes. Rebates could, of course, be distributed in a more progressive fashion.</p><p>Although low- and middle-income families would be net cash beneficiaries under this plan, the wealthy would pay more in tax each month than they would receive in rebates. Even so, prosperous voters would also come out ahead, on balance.</p><p>That's both because they would benefit disproportionately from the resulting reductions in climate losses and because they would otherwise have to shoulder much of the tax burden of climate adaptation measures. In short, compelling evidence suggests that a carbon tax would improve life outcomes for rich and poor alike.</p><p>Had carbon taxes been widely adopted decades ago, the planet would not be facing a climate crisis today. Critics are correct that it is too late for this measure alone to defuse the climate threat.

This is particularly pleasing given that the Bank's capital ratio is exceptionally strong and far in excess of the requirements made by the regulators. Regular operations developed positively in the quarter, and unusually high financial income, both from equities and fixed income holdings, had a very positive impact on the results. Improving regular operations therefore remains a key priority. The subsidiaries V\u00f6r\u00f0ur and Stefnir are performing well and Valitor, which is for sale, has reduced its losses after undergoing restructuring at the beginning of the year. The aim is to strengthen Valitor's core business, and the company's operations in Denmark were sold during the quarter.\u00a0 Although there is still some way to go before the goals of restructuring are fully realized, excellent results have already been attained.</p><p>Despite the positive second quarter results, the Covid-19 pandemic is still causing considerable uncertainty in the Bank's operating environment. The impact of the pandemic on the domestic and international economy will continue to leave its mark on operations. The key area of uncertainty is the performance of the Bank's asset portfolio. Loan impairments decreased significantly during the second quarter compared with the first quarter, although it must be remembered that further impairments may be required in the present economic climate. However, the Bank's robust capital and liquidity positions mean that it is well placed to cope with the current conditions.</p><p>There was strong demand for mortgages during the quarter, both new loans and the refinancing of existing loans. Lower interest rates undoubtedly played their part in this, and the Bank lent ISK 17 billion in the form of new mortgages during the second quarter. Furthermore, business support loans which formed part of the raft of government measures and which are partly or entirely government-backed, are proving popular and straightforward to process to our customers.</p><p>Arion Bank recently launched green deposits which are aimed at anyone wishing to help contribute towards a greener future. Initially green deposits will be used to finance investments by customers in vehicles which are powered by green energy. Green vehicles are an appropriate place to start as nearly all electricity in Iceland comes from sustainable sources. Offering our customers the option of green deposits is an innovative step in Iceland and in keeping with the Bank's environment and climate policy according to which we aim to focus more strongly on financing projects which relate to sustainable development and green infrastructure.</p><p>In May we merged our corporate services in the Reykjav\u00edk area into a single unit located at the Bank's headquarters.

The Bank reported net earnings of ISK 1,616 million for the same period of 2018. Return on equity was negative by 5.8% for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with a positive return of equity of 3.2% in 2018. Net earnings for the year 2019 amounted to ISK 1,100 million, compared with ISK 7,777 million in 2018. Return on equity was 0.6% in 2019, compared with 3.7% in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Net earnings from continuing operations amounted to ISK 5,209 million for the fourth quarter and ISK 14,055 million for 2019, compared with ISK 2,132 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and ISK 8,938 million for 2018. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are positively affected by ISK 1.1 billion by the sale of a mortgage portfolio to the Housing Financing Fund. Return on equity from continuing operations measured 10.8% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7.2% for the year 2019, compared with 4.3% for both the fourth quarter and the year 2018.</p><p>Total assets amounted to ISK 1,082 billion at the end of 2019, compared with ISK 1,164 billion at the end of 2018, which is in line with the Bank's strategy of increased revenues on risk weighted assets rather than loan growth. Loans to customers decreased by ISK 59.9 billion, or 7%, during the year which is largely due to the sale of the aforementioned mortgage loan portfolio of ISK 48 billion in October. In spite of the decrease the Bank was actively supporting its customers as ISK 24 billion of new loans were granted to corporates and individuals in the fourth quarter. Borrowings decrease by ISK 113.0 billion in 2019 or 27% mainly due to prepayments of structured covered bonds and the repurchase of EMTN bonds. Total equity amounted to ISK 190 billion, compared with ISK 201 billion at the end of 2018.</p><p>An important aspect of the Bank's capital optimizing process is the reduction of surplus capital. In line with the Bank's medium-term target of reducing its CET 1 ratio to circa 17%, the Bank paid dividends and bought back own shares in 2019 for the total amount of ISK 12.4 billion. The Board proposes a dividend payment in 2020 of ISK 10.0 billion equaling ISK 5.5 per share.</p><p>The Bank's capital ratio at the end of 2019 was 24.0%, compared with 22.0% at the end of 2018. The CET 1 ratio was 21.2% at the end of 2019, the same as it was at the end of 2018. The capital ratios take into account the proposal for ISK 10 billion dividend payment in 2020 and the on-going ISK 4.2 billion share buy-back program.</p><p>BENEDIKT G\u00cdSLASON, CEO OF ARION BANK</p><p>\"During the fourth quarter we saw clear indications that the organizational and strategic changes made at the end of the third quarter are delivering results, as Arion Bank reported earnings of ISK 5.2 billion from continuing operations during the quarter, the strongest quarter in 2019. The net interest margin increased and operating expenses decreased at the same time as customers repaid low yielding loans and the Bank prepaid expensive funding. Insurance activities delivered strong growth and we have high hopes for our continuing partnership with V\u00f6rdur and the benefits it will bring to our customers.\u00a0 The outlook is therefore bright in many areas of operations.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, companies held for sale weighed heavily during the year. Taking into account the negative impact of these companies, net earnings for 2019 only amounted to ISK 1.1 billion, and there was a net loss of ISK 2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. One of these companies is Valitor and towards the end of the year its board of directors decided to implement extensive organizational changes with the aim of consolidating the company's core operations and reducing its investment need. Valitor's budget for 2020 assumes that the company will be EBITDA positive during the year.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Bank remains strongly capitalized and one of our key priorities now is to optimize our capital structure through the issuance of Tier 2 and Additional Tier 1 capital, by using capital more efficiently in operations and by placing greater emphasis on financial activities which require less capital. Equity represents the Bank's debt to its owners and is the most expensive source of funding. It is therefore important not to have more equity than necessary. A share buy-back program was initiated in the second half of 2019 and dividends were paid during the year. It will also be proposed at the Bank's AGM in March to pay extraordinary dividends. Reducing core equity is vital in order for the Bank to achieve its target of 10% return on equity as growth opportunities offering satisfactory profitability are limited in an environment where interest rates are declining.</p><p>Another key factor in achieving satisfactory return on equity has to do with lending to major corporations. As a result of high capital requirements and extensive taxation the Bank is in actual fact unable to compete effectively with pension funds and international banks when it comes to lending to large companies. Therefore the focus at Arion Bank will be on providing these companies with expert advice and helping them find the most effective financing at any given time, as well as of course providing credit when required. Our strategy on lending to individuals and SMEs remains unchanged and despite our emphasis on the profitability of the loan portfolio rather than loan growth, the fourth quarter did see a healthy increase in new lending, totalling ISK 24 billion, of which loans to individuals amounted to ISK 10 billion.\u00a0</p><p>In December the Board of Directors adopted an ambitious environmental and climate policy and targets for the next few years. The policy dictates that Arion Bank is committed to contributing to efforts to ensure that Iceland can meet its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement and other local and international environmental and climate agreements. Our goal in 2020 is to evaluate the Bank's loan portfolio according to green criteria and establish targets in this respect. We will also increasingly turn our focus on to financing projects which relate to sustainable development and green infrastructure. Furthermore, we will require our suppliers to take into account the environmental and climate impact of their activities.\"</p><p>INVESTOR MEETING / WEBCAST IN ENGLISH ON 13 FEBRUARY AT 9:30 CET (8:30 GMT)</p><p>Arion Bank will be hosting a meeting / webcast on Thursday 13 February at 8:30 GMT (9:30 CET) where CEO Benedikt G\u00edslason, CFO Stef\u00e1n P\u00e9tursson, deputy CFO Eggert Teitsson and Head of Investor Relations Theod\u00f3r Fridbertsson will present the results and answer questions from participants.

They've mostly grown to like him, if not love him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Wall Street donors arrived at a fund-raiser for Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant earlier this year, campaign staff members asked if they wanted to sign up for pictures with the candidate. More than a few of the bankers and private-equity investors politely declined, opting to mingle over glasses of wine instead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was Feb. 13, and Mr. Biden had just been thrashed in the New Hampshire primary after finishing poorly in the Iowa caucuses a week earlier. He was in desperate need of both momentum and money. Still, as Mr. Biden confided to the private-equity executive who co-hosted the event that night: Win or lose, he planned to \"play my heart out to the very end,\" the executive, Jon Gray, later recalled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And finance executives have played a critical role in helping him do it. As Mr. Biden survived a turbulent winter to become the presumptive Democratic nominee running against President Trump, the millions of dollars Wall Street denizens donated to Mr. Biden and outside groups supporting his candidacy have helped him build a strong lead in national polls.</p><p>Wall Street has fared extraordinarily well under Mr. Trump: deep cuts to taxes, slashed regulations and, until the pandemic hit, record stock prices. But in recent months, dozens of bankers, traders and investors said in interviews, a sense of outrage and exhaustion over Mr. Trump's chaotic style of governance - accelerated by his poor coronavirus response - had markedly shifted the economic and political calculusin their industry.</p><p>More and more finance professionals, they say, appear to be sidelining their concerns about Mr. Biden's age - 77 - and his style. They are surprisingly unperturbed at the likelihood of his raising their taxes and stiffening oversight of their industry. In return, they welcome the more seasoned and methodical presidency they believe he could bring.</p><p>They may not exactly be falling in love with Mr. Biden. But they are falling in line.</p><p>\"I've seen meaningful numbers of people put aside what would appear to be their short-term economic interest because they value being citizens in a democracy,\" said Seth Klarman, founder of the hedge fund Baupost. A longtime independent, Mr. Klarman was at one point New England's biggest giver to the Republican Party. But in this cycle, he has given $3 million to groups supporting Mr. Biden. </p><p>Or as James Attwood, a managing director at the Carlyle Group and a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, put it, \"For people who are in the business of hiring and firing C.E.O.s, Donald Trump should have been fired a while ago.\" (Mr. Attwood contributed $200,000 in June to the Biden Action Fund, a joint committee with the Democratic National Committee.)</p><p>In May and June alone, the Biden Action Fund raised more than $11.5 million. That tally - a good measuring stick for Wall Street support because it was set up in part to draw contributions from that industry - included $710,000 from Josh Bekenstein, a co-chair of Bain Capital, and his wife.</p><p>But Wall Street money has proved to be a double-edged sword for Democrats, as Hillary Clinton discovered when she was hounded four years ago for delivering private speeches to Goldman Sachs and other firms. Progressive voters and activists - many of whom backed Mr. Biden's more liberal rivals in the primary - are particularly leery of any appearance of coziness with the finance industry.</p><p>Asked about Wall Street's role in Mr. Biden's current bid, the campaign invoked Mr. Biden's refrain that America wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, C.E.O.s and hedge fund managers.</p><p>\"Everything you need to know about this, Joe Biden has said himself throughout his career - and repeatedly on the trail since the earliest days of this campaign,\" said T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman.</p><p>As a senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden has for decades had relationships with credit-card companies there, but less of a presence in the financial power center of New York. He has counted a small circle of finance executives as supporters. Marc Lasry, the co-founder of Avenue Capital, for example, held a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden during his first run for president in 1988, and continues to back him now. The former hedge-fund executive Eric Mindich and the short-seller James Chanos have been supporters from well before the pandemic began. </p><p>It doesn't hurt that Mr. Biden has also not crusaded against Wall Street, the way his primary rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders did. Financial executives mostly seem to believe that while their taxes would rise in a Biden administration, they would not be subjected to the kind of \"fat cat\" rhetoric that soured some of their relationships with former President Barack Obama.</p><p>\"Rich people are just as patriotic as poor people,\" Mr. Biden told donors at a fund-raiser at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan last year. At a Brookings Institution gathering in 2018, he said, \"I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden's more benign stance toward the finance industry has provoked skepticism among advocates for stricter regulation. \"When the candidate doesn't have a clear plan on something like Wall Street reform, it tilts the playing field toward what is probably the most powerful industry in the world,\" said Carter Dougherty, a spokesman for Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group. \"We need more than 'not Trump appointees' when it comes to financial regulation.\"</p><p>While Wall Street financiers tend to be more socially liberal, they have collectively swung back and forth between parties. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics show the securities and investment community donating more to President George W. Bush in 2004, and then to Mr. Obama in 2008, and then to Mitt Romney in 2012, followed by Mrs. Clinton in 2016, than to their respective presidential rivals.</p><p>This year, it's Mr. Biden. Financial industry cash flowing to Mr. Biden and outside groups supporting him shows him dramatically out-raising the president, with $44 million compared with Mr. Trump's $9 million.</p><p>Last month, multiple Wall Street bundlers, including Alan Leventhal, the chief executive of Beacon Capital; Nat Simons, who runs a clean-tech investment fund; and Mr. Gray, Blackstone's president, held virtual fund-raisers for Mr. Biden. The giving has been so robust that the Biden campaign is now asking for at least $1 million in donations before it will confirm the former vice president's attendance at an event, say bundlers.</p><p>As the checks roll in, the Biden campaign has been carefully cultivating its relationship with the business community, with a focus on Wall Street. The outreach has included offering private briefings ahead of major policy rollouts and dangling various donor packages for the upcoming, and mostly virtual, Democratic National Convention.</p><p>In one call last month, two of Mr. Biden's top advisers on financial policy, Ben Harris and Jake Sullivan, led a wide-ranging conversation to preview the candidate's economic plan, which focuses on broad policy initiatives like investing in green infrastructure projects and minority-owned businesses. Two former Treasury secretaries, Robert E. Rubin and Jacob J. Lew, were part of the call.</p><p>Several major Wall Street executives and investors were also present, including Blair Effron, co-founder of the financial advisory firm Centerview Partners; Penny Pritzker, a fund-raiser and former commerce secretary; David Cohen, a top Biden bundler and Comcast executive; and Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google.</p><p>Mr. Ducklo said the call was one of dozens the campaign held with a variety of groups, including members of the labor and small-business communities.</p><p>Nonetheless, how Mr. Biden might affect their wallets is still a major concern for industry executives who aggressively fought the implementation of new regulations after the financial crisis of 2008. Some in the business community have suggested tweaks to the former vice president's tax and economic policies in ways that might soften the impact for companies.</p><p>At a separate July meeting with campaign staffers and a handful of Wall Street participants, Charles Phillips, chairman of the software company Infor and a onetime Morgan Stanley tech analyst, argued that Mr. Biden shouldn't make huge expenditures on infrastructure and other new programs without also identifying spending cuts. \"We can fund some of this by getting more efficient and getting rid of waste that no one will miss,\" Mr. Phillips recalled saying. He said he also argued for a simpler tax code with a corporate rate lower than Mr. Biden's proposed 28 percent.</p><p>In addition to those watching the policy details, many financiers are closely attuned to Mr. Biden's selection of a running mate, arguing that they might reconsider their votes if he were to choose someone like Ms. Warren, whose campaign sold coffee mugs that read \"Billionaire Tears\" in a nod to her proposed wealth tax on the superrich.</p><p>Some in the finance industry are concerned about Ms. Warren's emergence as an informal policy adviser, and the possibility that she could be installed as Treasury secretary.</p><p>Mr. Biden's policy platform on the issues affecting Wall Street's most affluent players has been relatively sparse. He has proposed a series of tax increases on businesses and on wealthy individuals, including raising the top marginal income tax rate and taxing capital gains as ordinary income for the richest Americans. But he has not embraced a wealth tax like Ms. Warren's, nor has he rolled out any kind of detailed policy plan focused on financial regulation.</p><p>Since Mr. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, the campaign has appointed Rufus Gifford, a former finance director for the 2012 Obama campaign, as a deputy campaign manager overseeing the money operation nationwide. Mr. Gifford is in regular touch with Wall Street donors, coordinating a slew of virtual fund-raisers and discussing campaign issues with deep-pocketed financiers.</p><p>In recent meetings with donors, Mr. Biden has said that while the wealthy are going to have to \"do more,\" the details of his tax hikes are still being hammered out, according to someone who has attended multiple fund-raisers but requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. At a virtual fund-raiser held in July, the candidate spoke of the need for corporate America to \"change its ways.\" But the solution, he said, would not be legislative.</p><p>Back in February, Mr. Biden had taken a precious day off the trail to collect a critical $800,000 at two New York fund-raisers, including the one Mr. Gray co-hosted. \"You're putting me in a position to be able to be very competitive,\" Mr. Biden said, thanking his Wall Street supporters.</p><p>A few of his finance industry donors, looking back, have privately remarked how the evening turned out to be the most quintessential of Wall Street plays: seeing a distressed asset at that time, and buying low.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["The outreach has included offering private briefings ahead of major policy rollouts and dangling various donor packages for the upcoming, and mostly virtual, Democratic National Convention.

And nearly 90,000 are dead in a continuing public health catastrophe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was not the scenario Joseph R. Biden Jr. anticipated confronting when he competed for the Democratic nomination on a conventional left-of-center platform. Now, with Mr. Biden leading President Trump in the polls, the former vice president and other Democratic leaders are racing to assemble a new governing agenda that meets the extraordinary times - and they agree it must be far bolder than anything the party establishment has embraced before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, neither Mr. Biden nor Mr. Trump has defined in itemized terms what an agenda for the first 100 days of a new presidency in the coronavirus era might look like. But on the Democratic side, far more than within the Republican Party, there is an increasingly clear sense of the nature and scale of the goals a new administration would pursue.</p><p>Mr. Biden's campaign has been rapidly expanding its policy-drafting apparatus, with the former vice president promising on Monday to detail plans for \"the right kind of economic recovery\" within weeks. He has already effectively shed his primary-season theme of restoring political normalcy to the country, replacing it with promises of sweeping economic change.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Biden signaled anew that he was willing to reopen his policy platform, announcing six policy task forces - covering issues including health care, climate and immigration, as well as the economy - that combine his core supporters with left-wing allies of Senator Bernie Sanders, his vanquished primary opponent.</p><p>The formation of those committees was aimed in part at easing divisions between Democrats that are already flaring on subjects like the size of a potential infrastructure bill and the intractable issue of health care. Despite having dashed Mr. Sanders's populist insurgency in the primary, Mr. Biden is still facing loud calls from his party's activist wing to adopt ideas he has firmly resisted, like single-payer health care.</p><p>But in several areas there are already strong signs of consensus within Mr. Biden's party, as once-cautious electoral and legislative tacticians shed their opposition to huge price tags and disruptive change amid a crisis that has melted traditional obstacles to government action.</p><p>Democratic leaders say that if they hold power next January, they must be prepared to move to pump trillions more into the economy; enact infrastructure and climate legislation far larger than they previously envisioned; pass a raft of aggressive worker-protection laws; expand government-backed health insurance and create enormous new investments in public-health jobs, health care facilities and child care programs.</p><p>Discussions are also underway, some of them involving Republicans, about policies that would ban stock buybacks and compel big corporations to share more of their profits with workers.</p><p>And there is more to come: Interviews with more than a dozen influential lawmakers, union leaders, think tank experts and advisers to Mr. Biden and other senior Democrats revealed an intensifying set of deliberations in the Zoom meetings of Mr. Biden's campaign, the skeletally staffed offices of Capitol Hill, and a web of conference calls and email chains initiated by powerful Democratic interest groups. Across all of them, there is a sense that Democrats must use the next six months - with an unpredictable campaign still in progress - to prepare to act swiftly in case they get the chance.</p><p>\"There is a recognition that this event is more transformative than 2008, more transformative than 9/11, more transformative than the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist Democrat.</p><p>The party's moderates, Mr. Warner said, had begun to think \"exponentially bigger\" about a legislative vision for overhauling the economy.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who since ending her presidential campaign has laid out an array of plans for countering the pandemic, said she saw a widening recognition within her party that it faced \"a big moment that we must meet with big ideas.\" Ms. Warren, who has recently spoken several times about policy with Mr. Biden, said she believed the former vice president saw the moment in similarly urgent terms.</p><p>\"The coronavirus has pushed to the front the need for real change,\" said Ms. Warren, a contender to be Mr. Biden's running mate. \"Families need more economic security and we need an economy over all that has more resilience and more protection built in for helping each other in a time of crisis.\"</p><p>For Mr. Biden and other leaders of the Democratic establishment, a difficult balancing act still awaits, as they navigate competing pressures from their party's left flank and the middle-of-the-road voters Mr. Biden is determined to court in the general election. If the current political mood and conditions of the country seems ready-made for promises of dramatic change, that does not necessarily mean most voters are hungering for the same wish list as the ideological left.</p><p>As Mr. Biden surely knows from his years as vice president - most of all the battle over the Affordable Care Act - voters who demand new policies from the government in one moment may not patiently endure the disruptions and unintended consequences that tend to accompany structural change, particularly in times of economic hardship.</p><p>Yet Mr. Biden has plainly changed his outlook on the mission he would pursue in office: As a newly announced presidential candidate last year, Mr. Biden presented himself as a tinkerer under whom \"nothing would fundamentally change.\"</p><p>That spirit was absent from a speech Mr. Biden delivered this month from his porch in Delaware, telling voters that his aim was \"not just to rebuild the economy, but to transform it.\"</p><p>The task of reimagining the economy is in many respects an unlikely one for Mr. Biden, whose driving interests for most of his career were foreign affairs and criminal justice. His most prominent stint as an economic leader came as vice president, when the Obama administration shepherded a reeling financial sector back to functionality and imposed new regulations on Wall Street - but stopped well short of seeking to overhaul the nature of the American private sector and rewrite the rules of the workplace.</p><p>Mr. Biden earned praise for his high-profile role overseeing the distribution of a $787 billion economic stimulus program. But the Recovery Act has come to be seen by many Democrats as something of a cautionary tale about governing in a recession: a law that stitched up a tattered economy but failed to spur a strong comeback, leading to deep electoral losses for the party.</p><p>It is a scenario Democratic leaders are determined not to repeat, particularly progressives who have long faulted the Obama administration for paring back the stimulus in the hope of winning Republican support.</p><p>Many of Mr. Biden's close advisers are veterans of the Obama administration with similar political scars from the last recession. But the Biden campaign has also begun to recruit and corral scores of other Democratic experts into a web of advisory groups aimed at generating policy faster and with greater ambition. Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden's policy director, said much of the campaign's energy was devoted to mapping out a \"quick slate of executive actions\" to address pandemic conditions and carry out other aspects of Mr. Biden's agenda.</p><p>But Mr. Biden is also soliciting input from a range of party luminaries outside his campaign, some of whom described him as eager for new ideas.</p><p>\"I think that he wants to work and support working families, and I think he's interested in hearing programs and thinking outside the box as far as what needs to be developed to achieve that goal,\" said Lee Saunders, president of the government workers' union Afscme, who has spoken several times recently with Mr. Biden.</p><p>Separate from the Biden campaign, about three dozen influential figures at labor unions, think tanks and other progressive institutions have convened a weekly virtual meeting \u00ad- known as the Friday Morning Group - with the same goal, according to multiple participants who spoke about the sessions on the condition of anonymity. Among its motivating forces is a view that liberal Democrats failed in the last recession to take the initiative in specifying plans for achieving large-scale change.</p><p>This convening of progressive minds, one of several brainstorming-and-planning initiatives underway in Washington, has mulled a range of policy options, including mainstream proposals like major new spending on public health and child care and less widely supported options like creating a universal basic income or offering a federal jobs guarantee.</p><p>Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than a million health care workers, said she had briefed Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate about her organization's view that it was time to \"change the rules of the economy for the long term,\" including a powerful expansion of the rights and employment benefits of lower-income workers.</p><p>\"We don't want to stand for any short-term fixes when we need a total overhaul,\" said Ms. Henry, who has also been in touch with the Biden campaign.</p><p>Hanging over Mr. Biden's plans will be uncertainty about elections for the House and Senate that will determine whether Mr. Biden would have cooperative Democratic majorities or face opposition from a Republican-held Senate aligned with conservative business interests. Mr. Trump, who has said little about his goals for another term, has begun accusing Democrats of imperiling an economic recovery by proposing new regulations and taxes.</p><p>For now, however, the political atmosphere seems to be one of demand for more aggressive action: One Democratic group, Navigator Research, that has been conducting daily polling on the pandemic, found large majorities of voters concerned that the government would do too little to help people and eager for the government to do more, even if it cost a lot of money.</p><p>Jake Sullivan, one of Mr. Biden's closest policy advisers, said the former vice president had not shed the underlying view of the American economy that defined his candidacy for much of the last year, when Mr. Biden rejected calls for his party to embrace the agenda of democratic socialism. But, he said, the external circumstances facing a potential Biden administration were different now.</p><p>\"We are going to have to do more, push further, be more creative coming out of this once-in-a-century pandemic - no doubt about it,\" Mr. Sullivan said.</p><p>According to several aides, Mr. Biden is expected to produce detailed plans for funding health care jobs and green infrastructure, and initiatives to rebuild the domestic manufacturing of critical supplies and help Americans who lost jobs in the most devastated industries find lasting employment.</p><p>In his speech on the economy this month, Mr. Biden also said he wanted to \"insist that big corporations, which we've bailed out twice in 12 years, set up and take responsibility for their workers and their communities\" - a striking flash of populist sentiment that Mr. Biden has not yet translated fully into policy.</p><p>Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a moderate Democrat who also ran for president last year, said he hoped Mr. Biden would embrace policies that would shift wealth and economic power away from the extremely rich and toward workers and middle-class people hit hardest by the pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Bennet, who has proposed a range of tax and health benefits for low- and middle-income households, said he saw a window for action that did not exist during the last recession.</p><p>\"I think there was not the same recognition, 10 years ago, that there is today, that we've had 50 years of an economy that only works for people at the very top,\" Mr. Bennet said, adding with blunt impatience: \"I think a decade of not achieving the stuff we need to achieve is probably enough.\"</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["Sullivan said.

Operating profit increased across all divisions, and in addition to growth in net sales, we succeeded in enhancing our operational efficiency. All of the divisions boosted their results even though the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on all of our businesses throughout the first half of the year. In the second quarter, material volumes began to recover and the prices of secondary raw materials continued to recover. Demand in the industrial segment was strong. We are now focusing on taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the recovery of the markets.</p><p>One of our strategic targets is to continuously improve customer satisfaction. In a customer satisfaction survey conducted in Finland in April, we achieved record results and customer satisfaction improved across all of our divisions. Employee satisfaction also improved.</p><p>We carried out three business acquisitions in the second quarter, strengthening our position in Environmental Services and Facility Services Finland's food hygiene and retail services in accordance with our strategy. The combined net sales of the acquired businesses amounted to approximately EUR 25 million in 2020. The acquisitions support our goal of annually increasing our net sales organically and through acquisitions by more than 5 per cent.</p><p>We received international recognition for our sustainability efforts. EcoVadis, a leading ratings platform for assessing sustainability, awarded the highest possible Platinum rating to L&amp;T in its assessment. This means we are in the top 1% of the 75,000 companies analysed by EcoVadis. We also received recognition in a study by the Financial Times and Statista, which listed European companies that achieved the highest reduction in emissions relative to net sales in 2020. Lassila &amp; Tikanoja was one of fourteen Finnish corporations on the list.</p><p>The new Waste Act entered into force in Finland on 19 July 2021. The new Waste Act implements the EU's new and more ambitious recycling requirements for municipal waste and packaging waste in Finnish legislation and also introduces national reforms to the collection systems concerning materials collected from housing properties. The amendments will enter into force in stages by 2025 and do not have an impact on L&amp;T in 2021.</p><p>The expansion of the sorting and separate collection obligations to businesses is estimated to increase the market for collecting and processing materials. The impact of the new Waste Act on the retail and industrial waste streams and the competitive landscape in areas will become clear by the end of 2025.</p><p>Municipalities will take on a larger role in collecting packaging materials and biowaste from residential properties. L&amp;T's direct customer agreements with housing properties will be transferred to municipal waste companies by the end of the transition period. The change will not have a direct impact on the collection of mixed waste from housing properties. Housing properties' contractual waste management services accounted for slightly over 10 per cent of the net sales of Environmental Services in 2020. The amendments will enter into force in stages by the end of 2025.</p><p>It is still too early to assess the overall impact of the new Waste Act. The trend of municipalisation of waste management for residential properties has reduced the household segment's share of the Environmental Services division's business portfolio significantly over the past 10 years. We have been able to compensate for these losses effectively by focusing on the growing corporate market.</p><p>The amendment to the Waste Act will not result in changes in L&amp;T's strategy. We are continuing to focus on the organic growth in the corporate customer market and business acquisitions, with the acquisition of Sihvari Oy's business operations in June being a good example of this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April-June</emphasis>Lassila &amp; Tikanoja's net sales for the second quarter amounted to EUR 198.7 million (183.2), up 8.5% year-on-year.

As part of the Action Plan for a Circular Economy, the EU approved a waste regulation package in summer 2018, with its key goal being to enhance compliance with the waste hierarchy, or order of priority, and increase the resource-efficient use and recycling of materials. The aim is for 55 per cent of municipal waste by weight to be prepared for reuse or recycling in 2025, 60 per cent by weight in 2030 and 65 per cent by weight in 2035. The goals for the recycling rate of packaging waste were also tightened.</p><p>The EU's new more ambitious recycling requirements for municipal and packaging waste will be implemented in Finland with the amendment to the Waste Act issued on 19 July 2021 and decrees issued under it. New obligations relating to the separate collection of waste fractions considerably stricter than the current ones will be adopted in order to achieve the recycling objectives.</p><p>In L&amp;T's view, stricter recycling targets that increase sorting at source, the separate collection of waste and the recycling business in Finland represent important steps forward.</p><p>However, still approximately 40% of Finns are left outside the tightening sorting obligations, living in small properties, and effective market-based instruments and incentives still under preparation are needed alongside the obligations.</p><p>The reform of the Waste Act will see municipalities take on a larger role in organising the collection of packaging materials and biowaste from housing properties. As a consequence of the reform, L&amp;T's direct customer agreements on the separate collection of packaging waste and biowaste with housing properties will be transferred to municipalities for competitive bidding. With regard to mixed waste, the possibility of a dual waste transport system for housing properties will remain in place, but its importance will decrease with the increase in the separate collection of packaging and biowaste. Housing properties' contractual waste management services accounted for slightly over 10 per cent of the net sales of Environmental Services in 2020.</p><p>It is still too early to assess the overall impact of the reform. The expansion of the sorting and separate collection obligations to businesses is estimated to increase the market for collecting and processing materials. In the housing property segment, the amendments will restrict the free market. In addition to the market-based instruments, the overall impacts will be influenced by the development of the volumes of separate collections with the tightening of the obligations. The amendments will enter into force in stages between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2024. The amendments will not have an impact on the operations of L&amp;T in 2021.</p><p>In the future, municipalities will put up waste management services for residential properties for tender more frequently and L&amp;T will participate in these tendering processes along with other operators. The trend of municipalisation of waste management services for residential properties has reduced the household segment's share of the Environmental Services division's business portfolio significantly over the past 10 years. L&amp;T has been able to compensate for these losses by focusing on the growing corporate market. We are continuing to focus in the corporate customer segment and execute acquisitions, with the acquisition of Sihvari Oy's business operations effective from 1 June 2021 being a good example of this.</p><p>L&amp;T published an updated outlook for the year 2021 on 27 July 2021. The updated outlook is as follows: net sales in 2021 are estimated to grow and adjusted operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NEAR-TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</emphasis>The measures and recommendations issued by the authorities to restrict the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting customer-specific production restrictions and adjustment measures are expected to potentially cause disruptions in service production during 2021. Customers are adapting their service agreements to the changing circumstances and the volumes of waste and secondary raw materials decrease when customer volumes decline. The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is reflected particularly in the demand for separately ordered services and makes it difficult to predict.</p><p>Fluctuations in the price of oil influence both fuel costs and the prices of oil-based secondary raw materials, such as recycled plastic and regenerated lubricants.</p><p>The company has several ERP system renewal projects under way. Temporary additional costs arising from system deployments and establishing the operating model may weigh down the company's result.</p><p>More detailed information on Lassila &amp; Tikanoja's risks and risk management will be provided in the 2020 Annual Report and in the Report of the Board of Directors and the consolidated financial statements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook for the year 2021, updated 27 July 2021</emphasis></p><p>Net sales in 2021 are estimated to grow and adjusted operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Previous outlook for the year 2021 (January 28, 2021)</emphasis></p><p>Net sales in 2021 are estimated to be at the same level and adjusted operating profit at the same level or better compared to the previous year.</p><p>Helsinki, 27 July 2021</p><p>LASSILA &amp; TIKANOJA PLC</p><p>Board of DirectorsEero HautaniemiPresident and CEO</p><p>For additional information, please contact:Eero Hautaniemi, President and CEO, tel. +358 10 636 2810Valtteri Palin, CFO, tel. +358 40 734 7749</p><p>Lassila &amp; Tikanoja is a service company that is putting the circular economy into practice.

(\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Northland</emphasis>\" or the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company</emphasis>\") (TSX: NPI) is pleased to announce an update on its long-term plans and objectives as well as provide its 2021 financial outlook, which will be further discussed at the Company's virtual investor day later today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the next decade, the global transition to renewable energy is expected to accelerate as de-carbonization efforts by governments and private entities increase and further electrification of the economy gathers momentum, resulting in significant opportunities for further growth in renewable power generation and green infrastructure, especially in offshore wind. Countries with land constraints and high carbon energy usage are increasingly adopting offshore wind to support their de-carbonization objectives and their renewable energy targets. As a global developer with extensive expertise in developing offshore wind projects, Northland is strategically positioned to compete in this global transition and further grow its global portfolio and market share.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Northland's deep expertise in renewables development combined with its established offshore wind capabilities and portfolio pipeline in Europe and Asia positions us to capture an outsized share of the renewable energy transition opportunities going forward,\" said Mike Crawley, Northland's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Offshore wind is a focal point of our strategy with over 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of gross offshore wind operating capacity and an additional 4 to 5 GW of gross capacity of identified projects under development, we are now a top ten global offshore wind owner and developer. Our growth aspirations are much larger than this and we have amassed a total pipeline of approximately 12 GW of gross offshore wind capacity globally. Pursuing offshore wind projects provide us the opportunity to deploy significant capital to generate attractive returns on assets underpinned by long-term, government backed revenue contracts. We are very excited to embark on the next growth chapter at Northland where we expect to execute on our development projects adding significant incremental operating capacity, furthering the global shift to a carbon free world.\"</p><p>Pauline Alimchandani, Northland's Chief Financial Officer, said \"Northland continues to position itself for future growth and expects its strategy will continue to generate growing shareholder value over the coming years. The next growth inflection point for Northland offers the opportunity to deploy at least $15 to $20 billion of gross capital investment into new renewable projects over the next five years, anchored by identified offshore wind projects that are currently in active development. These projects have the potential to more than double our adjusted EBITDA<sup>1</sup>from current levels, once commercially operational. In addition, we are targeting new opportunities in onshore renewables, utilities and transmission as well as establishing a position in renewable fuels and energy storage. Our allocation to utilities and transmission is targeted to account for approximately 10 to 15% of our adjusted EBITDA over time. This should enable Northland to maintain solid and diversified cash flows thereby supporting a strong balance sheet and credit rating to fund expenditures related to our core focus of securing and developing offshore wind development assets.\"</p><p>1. This press release makes reference to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and adjusted Free Cash Flow. Please see Non-IFRS disclosures at the end of the release for additional information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STRATEGIC UPDATE</emphasis></p><p>For over 34 years, Northland has created shareholder value by leveraging its expertise and early mover advantage to develop and operate high-quality, sustainable projects supported by long-term revenue contracts that deliver predictable cash flows. While energy markets continue to change and the emphasis shifts through sector cycles, Northland's core capabilities remain unchanged:</p><p>Opportunity identification and project origination;Commercial acquisition negotiation, project financing and equity funding;Project development and construction; andOperations &amp; asset management.</p><p>Northland has established a global presence across eight offices in four continents and has over 1,000 employees. This presence in multiple regions has resulted in developing local expertise and strategic partnerships that facilitate securing early stage development opportunities encompassing a range of clean technologies in target markets. This strategy has created both geographic and technological diversification across Northland's operating and development portfolio. Northland remains focused on meeting the growing global need for renewable energy primarily through developing and operating generation projects but also through enabling transmission and distribution infrastructure to support electrification.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Offshore\u00a0Wind</emphasis></p><p>Offshore wind is the largest segment of Northland's business and is expected to account for over 60% of its 2020 adjusted EBITDA. Through the development, construction and operation of its first three offshore wind projects in Europe over the past six years, Northland has developed engineering, project design, procurement and construction expertise in offshore wind that it expects to leverage to execute on new early-stage offshore wind projects globally. The Company considers its offshore wind resources to be a key asset not only in developing new projects but also in securing new partnerships, such as the recently announced 1,200 megawatt (MW) Baltic Power project located off the coast of Poland in the Baltic Sea, to be developed with PKN ORLEN.</p><p>One of the Company's strategies is to augment its existing pipeline of offshore opportunities by securing interests in early stage projects in key target markets in Asia and Europe, through greenfield development, and by seeking long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy entities to generate strong returns and stable cash flows.</p><p>In Asia, several markets have demonstrated strong sovereign support for de-carbonization through renewables development. Northland will leverage its capabilities in offshore wind development and existing presence to increase its position and footprint in Asia.\u00a0Current development activities are focused on advancing the 1,044 MW Hai Long, the 600 MW Chiba and the 1,000 MW Dado Ocean projects in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, respectively. In addition, Northland is pursuing feasibility-stage development in the markets above and is considering additional market entry.</p><p>Beyond its Identified Development Projects<sup>2</sup>, Northland has built a robust pipeline of opportunities in offshore wind with the potential to add an incremental 12 GW of gross capacity. Successful execution of these projects will deliver significant incremental contracted cash flows starting in the latter half of this decade and is expected to further bolster Northland's long-term business sustainability, extending into the 2040s and 2050s.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Onshore Renewable Power</emphasis></p><p>While Northland expects significant growth will come from its core focus on offshore wind development, the cash flows from these projects are expected in the latter half of the decade. To complement its offshore wind development, Northland expects to advance shorter-term development and explore acquisition opportunities in the onshore renewable segment that can achieve commercial operations within the next few years. Northland's focus is on markets in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, and Eastern and Southern Europe. Additional markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America are also under consideration. Current advanced development and under-construction projects encompass the 300 MW onshore wind projects in New York State, the 130 MW La Lucha solar project in Mexico and the 16 MW Helios solar project originating from EBSA in Colombia that will soon commence construction.</p><p>2. Identified Development Projects include: Hai Long, Dado Ocean, Chiba, Baltic Power, Nordsee Two/Three, and New York Wind</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Utilities and Transmission</emphasis></p><p>Expansion of renewable power will necessitate expansion of transmission and distribution networks in many countries. EBSA and similar utility infrastructure assets have demonstrated accretive returns and immediate cash flow for Northland in Latin America. Utilities offer perpetual and stable cashflows and can also be a platform for further investment and growth in their markets. Utilities are also considered as key enablers of the renewable energy transition in developing markets such as Latin America. As such, part of Northland's long-term strategic positioning includes incremental investment in electricity distribution and transmission infrastructure, primarily in Latin America which are complementary to Northland's development strategy and its existing portfolio.</p><p>In addition to EBSA, which serves as a platform to develop renewable power projects in Colombia, growth in Northland's utility segment is expected to be supported by further investments and acquisitions in Latin America with strong rate base growth. The utilities segment is expected to account for approximately 10 to 15% of Northland's adjusted EBITDA over the long term, growing from 7% currently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Renewable Fuels</emphasis></p><p>With positive momentum behind renewable power, policy makers, regulators and corporations are now turning their focus to reducing and eventually eliminating carbon in fuels.\u00a0As a result, renewable natural gas and hydrogen appear to be positioned for tremendous growth in the years to come and offer attractive returns to early movers who can manage the inherent risks in an emerging sector, similar to what Northland achieved through its investment in and ownership of offshore wind.\u00a0In 2020, Northland created a dedicated team that is focused on establishing an early mover position in new growth asset classes. There are also potential synergies between Northland's renewable assets and hydrogen production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG and SUSTAINABILITY</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Our Mission is to Develop a Carbon Free World\"</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability is integral to Northland's business and its ability to safely and reliably deliver the energy people need while delivering long-term economic value to its shareholders. Northland has been committed to delivering renewable and cleaner energy projects, health and safety and having a lasting, positive impact on its communities for 34 years. Northland is focused on advancing its Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives by integrating ESG into everyday activities, while enhancing its reporting on material ESG issues for stakeholders. These activities align with Northland's mission of helping develop a carbon-free world. ESG has always been prominent at Northland and the Company is formally launching targets as part of its 2021 Sustainability report and will be committed to the following objectives:</p><p>Supporting carbon reduction targets of the countries in which the Company operates by building significant green energy / renewable projects;Adding at least 4 to 5 GW of gross new renewable energy capacity to its portfolio by 2030;Committing to reducing Company carbon intensity levels by 65% by 2030 from 2019 levels;Continued commitment to diversity and inclusion (including 30% female representation at each of the Board and Executive Management levels);Continued emphasis on Corporate Governance best practices;Continuing to uphold the highest standards of Health &amp; Safety (Zero life-changing incidents);Continuing to serve as a positive and contributing community partner; andBeing a leader in ESG, through alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, reporting in line with SASB in 2021 and a commitment to report inline with TCFD by 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Efficient Natural Gas</emphasis></p><p>Northland's efficient natural gas assets have played a role in the de-carbonization of the Canadian energy grid, helping achieve the country's objectives of diversifying its energy mix away from coal. In addition, these assets have been a staple of Northland's business, providing a stable source of revenue and cash flow. Going forward and for the foreseeable future, however, Northland believes that by far its best opportunities to support global de-carbonization initiatives and generate positive financial returns for its shareholders will come from further development and growth in renewables. Through the execution of its offshore wind strategy, the relative financial contribution from the efficient natural gas assets to the overall corporate results is expected to continually decline. In the meantime, the free cash flow that is generated from the efficient natural gas assets supports the funding of development capital required for offshore wind. As such, Northland will take a measured approach to any decisions regarding its efficient natural gas assets with consideration to the impacts on cash flow and Northland's broader strategic objectives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL STRATEGY</emphasis></p><p>Northland's financial position continues to be excellent, with approximately\u00a0$0.6 billion\u00a0of total available liquidity, and an investment grade balance sheet that has no material maturities over the next five years and over 95% of total debt being non-recourse to Northland.</p><p>In addition to historical sources of funding utilized by Northland, the Company is pursuing additional options to expand its funding sources. These additional sources are intended to extend financial flexibility and continue to preserve the Company's strong investment grade balance sheet while supporting the capital requirements for its growth. These sources are expected to encompass green financing instruments, partial sell-down of ownership interests in development assets and other tools.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asset Sell-downs</emphasis></p><p>Northland intends to consider a selective sell-down strategy of partial interests of certain of its development projects once they have achieved financial close to allow the Company to: (i) manage jurisdictional exposures, (ii) crystalize some development profit prior to construction as a result of the de-risking of the project; (iii) enhance its free cash flow and liquidity position; and (iv) increase project returns, amongst other considerations. Northland will assess each opportunity individually and intends to remain a long-term owner in the renewable projects it develops globally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green Financings</emphasis></p><p>Effective today, Northland is launching a Green Financing Framework, available on the Company's website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.northlandpower.com/sustainability/\">northlandpower.com/sustainability/</url>), that focuses on greening and optimizing its balance sheet to secure green corporate and project financings starting in 2021. The financings will be required to meet internal eligibility criteria that align with the Green Bond Principles (GBP), Green Loan Principles (GLP), and EU Taxonomy.\u00a0The framework has received an independent second-party opinion from Sustainalytics\u00ae which confirms the framework is credible, impactful and aligns with the core components of the GBP and GLP.\u00a0Green capital issuances will afford Northland a number of benefits including allowing the Company to capitalize on strong investor demand for renewable power investments, diversifying funding sources, and optimizing liquidity (through green corporate bond instruments), all of which should ultimately decrease the Company's cost of funds and allow for better matching of tenors and/or currencies to its asset base.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other Tools</emphasis></p><p>Northland will also aim to enhance its corporate liquidity through DRIP participation and asset level financing optimizations, including re-financings of existing assets. All of these financial tools should ensure that Northland maintains a solid balance sheet to fund development and execution of its growth plans over the long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adjusted EBITDA</emphasis></p><p>For fiscal 2021, management expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain consistent relative to 2020 guidance levels, primarily due to the following factors (all amounts approximate):</p><p>Higher contribution from German offshore wind facilities as a result of anticipated fewer periods of negative market prices and un-compensated curtailments ($30 million);Higher contributions from Gemini primarily as a result of higher assumed 2021 wholesale market price ($10 million); andContribution from the La Lucha solar project in Mexico ($10 million), with the project expected to begin producing power in March 2021, with commercial operations expected to follow soon after.</p><p>Factors offsetting the increase in 2021 adjusted EBITDA include:</p><p>Lower anticipated contribution from efficient natural gas facilities primarily due to a scheduled extended maintenance outage at the North Battleford facility in Saskatchewan ($15 million decrease); andHigher expected growth expenditures relating to activities intended to advance Northland's identified projects including New York Wind, Baltic Power, Chiba and Dado Ocean and Nordsee Two projects ($35 million), as well as higher G&amp;A and other costs to support this growth ($25 million).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Cash Flow</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, management expects Free Cash Flow to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.50 per share. This level of Free Cash Flow per share is expected to be lower than the revised 2020 guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per share primarily due to the following factors (all amounts approximate):</p><p>Higher contribution from German offshore wind facilities as a result of fewer periods of negative market prices and un-compensated curtailments net of higher interest, taxes and other items ($15 million);Higher contribution from Gemini primarily as a result of higher assumed market prices net of higher debt repayments and other items ($5 million); andContribution from La Lucha ($5 million) and from EBSA ($10 million), including proceeds from anticipated upward financing of the EBSA Facility that is expected to occur annually based on growth in EBSA's rate base.</p><p>Factors more than offsetting the aforementioned increases include:</p><p>Lower anticipated contribution from the efficient natural gas facilities, amounts as noted above; andHigher project development and corporate costs to support growth, amounts, as noted above, which is the primary driver for the decrease in Free Cash Flow.</p><p>To achieve its growth objectives, Northland will deploy increasing amounts of early-stage investment capital (development expenditures) to advance its projects. As in 2020, with the regional development offices fully functional and certain growth opportunities secured, such as New York Wind and Baltic Power, Northland expects to incur higher development expenditures and growth investment in 2021. Early-stage development investments will reduce near-term free cash flow and short-term liquidity until the projects achieve commercial operations but should deliver long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow.</p><p>As such, the 2021 Free Cash Flow guidance range reflects increasing development expenses in pursuit of the Company's continued execution of its global growth strategy. These expenditures relate to the development and advancement of Baltic Power, New York Wind, Chiba Energy in Japan, Dado Ocean in South Korea and other offshore wind projects. The 2021 development expenses are expected to be approximately $100 million or $0.50 of 2021 Free Cash Flow per share, which is included in the aforementioned variance explanations.</p><p>In addition to development expenditures, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures of $100 million in 2021 to advance Hai Long and other advanced-stage projects. Capital expenditures are largely expected to be funded through cash on hand and through Northland's corporate credit facilities and do not impact Free Cash Flow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Free Cash Flow Excluding Growth Expenditures)</emphasis></p><p>Commencing with the fourth quarter 2020 results, Northland intends to disclose a new supplementary non-IFRS free cash flow per share measure, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which will exclude growth expenditures as management deems them to be investment related. These growth expenditures are incurred for the purposes of generating future cash flow. Adjusting for growth expenditures in relation to 2021 cash flow guidance would result in Northland's Adjusted Free Cash Flow for 2021 to be in the range of $1.80 to $2.00 per share and in management's view, allow for a better representation of cash flow generated from the business before investment-related decisions. Management believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a meaningful measure of Northland's ability to generate cash flow, after on-going obligations, to re-invest in growth and fund dividend payments. For comparison, the 2020 Adjusted Free Cash Flow supplementary guidance range would have been $1.95 to $2.15 per share relative to the revised Free Cash Flow per share guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per share as disclosed in the third quarter of 2020.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iroquois Falls Update</emphasis></p><p>Northland's 120 MW Iroquois Falls natural gas facility achieved commercial operation in 1997 and has contributed significantly to the Company's financial performance through a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the government of Ontario. The PPA is set to expire at the end of 2021 and given the current forecasted Ontario market capacity needs, Northland anticipates participating in the Ontario market through Capacity Auctions as a generation resource, offering capacity for both the summer and winter commitment periods. In addition, Management intends to seek other offtake opportunities.</p><p>Currently, Iroquois Falls contributes approximately $75 million annually in adjusted EBITDA and this contribution is expected to materially decline starting in 2022 contributing less than $10 million in adjusted EBITDA annually.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LONG-TERM OUTLOOK AND GROWTH IN ADJUSTED EBITDA</emphasis></p><p>Northland is at an inflection point given the accelerating global trend towards de-carbonization and electrification, and its extensive portfolio of offshore wind development. The Company has advanced and secured the rights to a number of offshore projects, which if successful will increase Northland's installed gross capacity by at least 4 to 5 GW and require approximately $15 to $20 billion ($10 to $14 net) of total gross capital investment over the next five years. These projects, once operational by the latter half of the decade, are expected to more than double the Company's adjusted EBITDA, after taking into account the Company's ownership share.

With an acceptance rate exceeding 97%, the Group supports its customers in all its regions through its various retail banks (three quarters of SGL applications are handled by the Regional Banks<sup>2</sup>). The Group's total net exposure to SGLs stands at (EURO)3.1\u00a0billion in France (LCL, Regional\u00a0Banks and CACIB<sup>3</sup>), with only a small proportion of SGLs currently classified as Stage 3 (2.0%<sup>4</sup>at end\u00a0March 2021). For the past two quarters there has been a slowdown in SGL growth in France (+2.5% in SGLs outstanding versus 15 January 2021). In Italy on the other hand, where CA Italia has granted (EURO)2.8\u00a0billion in SGLs to 40,000 customers, the pace remains brisk (+16.7% versus December 2020).</p><p>At the same time, the Group continues to support the economy by implementing<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">payment holidays</emphasis>on loans, notably for corporate, SME and small business customers, whose activities have been impacted by the economic consequences of the pandemic. After a high of 552,000 payment holidays granted, for (EURO)4.2\u00a0billion in maturities extended in June 2020, as at 9 April 2021, a total of 93,000 payment holidays were still active at the Regional\u00a0Banks and LCL, representing approximately (EURO)0.7\u00a0billion in deferred maturities (of which 68% for SME and small business and corporate customers and 32% for households, with 87% at the Regional\u00a0Banks and 13% at LCL<sup>5</sup>). This corresponds to total remaining capital due of (EURO)10.1\u00a0billion in France. In Italy, 42,000 payment holidays are still active, accounting for less than (EURO)0.5\u00a0billion in deferred maturities<sup>6</sup>. Less than 2%<sup>7</sup>of Regional Banks and LCL moratoria are within stage 3. Payments have resumed on more than 98% of expired payment holidays of Regional Bank and LCL customers<sup>8</sup>. The situation is similar at CACF, where payments have resumed on 98% of Retail and Corporate customers' payment holidays.</p><p>Fully committed to a fair transition, i.e. one that promotes social cohesion, the Group continues to deploy social inclusion measures and take steps to protect vulnerable customers. It is supported in this effort by special mechanisms set up by each of the business lines: \"Points Passerelle\" at the Regional Banks, \"LCL Parenth\u00e8se\", and \"Customer Support Agencies\" at CACF. Thus, a total of 11,000 vulnerable customers have received support through the Points Passerelle, for example, with 2,300 personal microcredit granted in 2020. CAA has supported 170 local projects as part of its inclusion programme, taking its contribution to almost (EURO)2.5\u00a0million in 2020. Lastly, the Grameen Foundation, which is active in 39 countries and supports 75 microfinance institutions and 12 social impact businesses, had outstandings of (EURO)81.2\u00a0million in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Group is determined to</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">boost the recovery, in a context of economic upturn and renewed</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">international competition</emphasis></p><p>The Group is actively contributing to the economic recovery, most notably through its pledge to distribute Pr\u00eats Participatifs Relance (Recovery Participating Loans) to customers in all regions. These loans, which are distributed by banks, including those in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole networks, are equivalent to quasi-equity capital and will help promote job creation and investment by allowing companies to finance their expansion as they come out of the pandemic. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has embarked on a major review of its customer base to identify companies with potential that would be eligible for a Recovery Participating Loan. According to initial estimates, almost 45,000 SME and mid-cap customers of the Regional Banks and 8,500 customers of LCL are eligible. They are currently being contacted proactively by their corporate account managers. Webinars and an information campaign are also being conducted to raise awareness. The Recovery Participating Loans are part of a range of solutions that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole has been offering its customers since the onset of the pandemic. In addition to the moratoria and state-guaranteed loans granted since March 2020, the Group is further supporting the recovery by leveraging its complementary areas of expertise.</p><p>Amundi, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, IDIA Capital Investissement and the regional capital investment companies of the 39 Regional\u00a0Banks are particularly involved in these capital injections. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is providing (EURO)2.25\u00a0billion in financing for the Recovery Participating Loans in an initial (EURO)11-billion round of financing, while Amundi is involved in managing the vehicle that will carry these loans. The general mechanism set up by the French government is expected to raise (EURO)20\u00a0billion from French and international institutional investors ((EURO)14\u00a0billion for the state-supported equity loans, known by the French acronym \"PPSE\", and (EURO)6\u00a0billion for state-supported subordinated debt, known by the acronym \"OSSE\").</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's strong momentum also attests to how committed its employees are to supporting the economic recovery.</emphasis>The payments business is up significantly (number of mobile payment contracts at the Regional Banks: +54% in Q1-2021). Outstandings other than SGLs rose sharply (+4.7%, of which +5.0% for the Regional Banks and +3.4% for LCL), while the Regional Banks have continued to increase their market share in home loans (+0.33 percentage points Dec/Dec) and corporate loans (+0.37 percentage point Dec/Dec).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Group is</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">fulfilling its commitments</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to societal</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">transformation</emphasis></p><p>As part of the human and societal pillars of the Group Project, the Group supports the societal transitions that its customers have requested and are experiencing. For example, the Group has gone from CSR to general impact management. In June 2019 it came out with an innovative climate strategy featuring strong governance, the full integration of energy transition issues in customer relationships, and a gradual reallocation of financing and investment portfolios.</p><p>Internally, the Group relies on what is recognised as an ambitious Human Resources policy. The Group is the the number one employer in France,<sup>9</sup>and 30% of its new hires in 2020 are under the age of 30. The Group has taken steps to increase the number of women in its executive management, and in 2020 the percentage of women on an executive committee at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Group entity decision-making bodies was respectively 25% and 24%<sup>10</sup>. With more than half of employees working abroad, making the talent pools more international is a major challenge for the Group. The succession plans for 2022 include a target of 20% foreign candidates, a criterion that has also been incorporated into the indicators we use to guide our Human-centric Project.</p><p>The Group's innovative climate strategy depends first and foremost on a dedicated governance structure made up of three umbrella committees: a Group societal project committee, which oversees the implementation of the Group's societal commitments and ensures they are consistent with its ESG strategy, a scientific committee composed of 12 independent experts renowned in their field, and an operational committee, which monitors climate strategy. The two latter committees support the work of the Group societal project committee.</p><p>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole places utmost importance on transparency. In 2019, the Group pledged to report regularly on the exposure of its financing and investment portfolios to thermal coal, and outsourced the certification of its climate strategy implementation to an independent third party. This year, for the first time, the mix of energy-related financing and investment assets managed by Amundi, LCL, CAA and CACIB was provided in the 2020 Universal Registration Document<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole also broke new ground in 2020 by setting up a non-financial reporting platform to cover the Group's entire reporting scope. The only one of its kind, the platform collects external and internal non-financial data to calculate the main societal impact indexes for all Group entities. It also generates a unique climate transition rating for listed companies using public data.</p><p>The Group has fully integrated the climate transition into its customer relationships, and from the first quarter has used the climate transition rating to measure and support the transformation efforts of 8,000 listed companies at CACIB and Amundi. The tool will next be adapted for the Group's SMEs and mid-caps. New investment solutions have also been introduced for customers, such as LCL's range of climate impact investing products (\"LCL Placements Impact Climat\") and Amundi's green energy fund, which is the first climate transition fund eligible for life insurance policies investing directly in green infrastructure. Amundi's assets under management linked to climate transition and green growth initiatives increased by 80% in 2020 to (EURO)22\u00a0billion. At the start of the year, Amundi launched the first \"fair transition\" fixed income fund.</p><p>Lastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's climate strategy involves reallocating financing and investment portfolios for the benefit of climate transition. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is now France's number one private financier and institutional investor in renewable energy.<sup>12</sup>As noted in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. 2020 Universal Registration Document, renewable energy financing loans for large corporates increased by +11% in 2020. Asset under management invested in renewable energy were also up for the year (+22%). CAA invested (EURO)1.4\u00a0billion in renewable energy. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is the first bank which committed to exit from thermal coal by 2040 (and exit coal in the European Union and OCDE by 2030). Large corporates financing loans and assets under management dedicated to coal fell by -28% and -34% respectively in 2020. The Group continues to support SMEs in less favoured areas as well as the public health sector, and helps maintain social ties through a reference framework set up for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. social bonds. Moreover, in 2020, CACIB arranged (EURO)12.2\u00a0billion in social bonds (10% market share).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Group activity</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Despite ongoing restrictions during the quarter, the Group's business rose sharply thanks to the soundness and efficiency of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">its</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Universal Customer-focused Banking model.

The Asset gathering and Large customers business lines posted strong revenue growth of +18.6% (+(EURO)249\u00a0million) and +11.9% (+(EURO)177\u00a0million) respectively, due not only to brisk business but also the recovery in the markets. In French retail banking, the Regional\u00a0Banks recorded a sharp rise in revenues of +9.9%, or +(EURO)320\u00a0million, from first quarter 2020, mainly due to the impact of market revaluations on securities portfolios, while LCL recorded a more modest increase of +1.9% in revenues this quarter. Specialised financial services showed resilience during the quarter, with underlying revenues falling by just -0.5%: revenues for CACF fell by -3.1% in first quarter 2021 but held steady on a like-for-like basis (+0.1%<sup>21</sup>) due to the stability of consolidated outstandings over the past year, despite a return to robust production levels in first quarter 2021; CAL&amp;F posted strong revenue growth of +10.0%, having benefited from an excellent level of leasing activity in Poland and France. CA Italia recorded a sharp rise in revenues this quarter (+9.8%), thanks to a high level of fee and commission income from managed savings and insurance. Conversely, International retail banking, excluding Italy, posted a decline in revenues of -11.5% (-(EURO)29\u00a0million) due to the cut in reference interest rates in Egypt, Poland and Ukraine in the second quarter of 2020.

In Asset gathering, expenses rose by +2.1% (+(EURO)16\u00a0million), largely as a result of the scope effect related to the integration of Sabadell\u00a0AM and the establishment of Amundi\u00a0BOC and Fund\u00a0Channel (+(EURO)12\u00a0million).</p><p>Overall, the Group posted a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">positive jaws effect of +8.0 percentage points</emphasis>and a decline in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF</emphasis>of -4.8\u00a0percentage\u00a0points, taking it to 60.6% in first\u00a0quarter\u00a02021.

Of the factors comprising this change, only the provisioning for proven risks (stage 3) was up between fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021. It rose by +11%. The decrease in the cost of risk was particularly marked this quarter for the Regional Banks (divided by 1.9 compared to first quarter 2021 and divided by 2.7 compared to fourth quarter 2020), financing activities (-38.2% compared to first quarter 2020 and -30.0% compared to fourth quarter 2020) and CA Consumer Finance (-30.4% compared to first quarter 2020 and -11.0% compared to fourth quarter 2020).

Loan loss reserves amounted to (EURO)19.7\u00a0billion at end\u00a0March 2021, of which 35% was for performing loans (Stages 1 and 2). Loan loss reserves increased by +(EURO)0.1\u00a0billion compared to end\u00a0December 2020. Starting in first quarter 2020, the context and uncertainties related to the global economic conditions were taken into account and the expected effect of public measures were incorporated to anticipate future risks. Provisioning levels were established to reflect the sharp deterioration in the environment, taking into account<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">several weighted economic scenarios</emphasis>and applying flat-rate adjustments for the retail banking portfolios and corporates portfolios and specific additions for some target sectors, namely tourism, automotive, aerospace, retail textile, and energy. Several weighted economic scenarios were used to define provisioning for performing loans. These are unchanged from those presented in the 2020 URD, and include a more favourable scenario (French GDP at +7.1% in 2021 and +2.7% in 2022) and a less favourable scenario (French GDP at +3.0% in 2021 and +4.8% in 2022).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The cost of credit risk relative to outstandings</emphasis><sup>23</sup><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">over a rolling four-quarter period was 33\u00a0basis points.</emphasis>It stood at 22 basis points on a quarterly annualised basis<sup>24</sup>.

Non-controlling interests rose by +18.4%, mainly due to a change in Insurance in the recognition methods used for subordinated debt (RT1) coupons, with no impact on net earnings per share.

In first quarter 2021, the cost of risk on Stages 1 &amp; 2 totalled (EURO)57\u00a0million.

Within the Asset gathering business line, operating expenses excluding SRF increased by +2.1%, due to higher expenses in asset management because of a scope effect (Sabadell\u00a0AM, creation of Amundi\u00a0BOC\u00a0WM and Fund\u00a0Channel, (EURO)12\u00a0million impact) and a rise in variable compensation, offset by a marked drop in the Insurance sub-division, due to lower tax, and a decrease for Wealth management. In the Large customers business line, operating expenses excluding SRF were +3.3% higher compared to first quarter 2020, coming from a rise in provisions for variable compensation given the good level of activity, and a scope effect for Institutional financial services. The Specialised financial services business line recorded a -4.9% drop in expenses compared to first quarter 2020 (-0.8% excluding CA Consumer Finance NL), with a cost/income ratio excluding SRF of 52.0%, marking a 2.4 percentage point improvement on the year earlier period. Operating expenses excluding SRF were down -1.7% for Retail banking, with very good cost/income ratios excluding SRF for LCL and International retail banking, at 63.4% and 59.9%, respectively.</p><p>The IFRIC\u00a021 impact was (EURO)680\u00a0million, and included expenses of (EURO)510\u00a0million for the SRF<sup>44</sup>for the 2021 year, representing an increase of +41.5% (or +(EURO)150\u00a0million) compared to first quarter 2020 and +16% for the year in 2021 vs. 2020<sup>45</sup>. The higher SRF expense mainly relates to the Large customers (+64.4% or +(EURO)128\u00a0million, compared to first quarter 2020) and Retail banking (+56.9% or +(EURO)29\u00a0million, compared to first quarter 2020) business lines. Note that the refund of an overpayment over financial years 2016-2020 was accounted for under specific items in the first quarter 2020. Taking account of these adjustments, the increase in the SRF works out at 26% between 2020 and 2021 (from (EURO)406\u00a0million to (EURO)510\u00a0million).</p><p>Underlying<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">gross operating income</emphasis>was thus very strong in first quarter 2021. It was up by +14.0% at (EURO)1,805\u00a0million, despite the +41.5% increase in the SRF, thanks to growth in revenues (+7.2%, or +(EURO)370\u00a0million, compared to first quarter 2020), and good control of expenses excluding the SRF (-0.0%, or -(EURO)1\u00a0million). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. once again demonstrated its excellent agility at the operating level this quarter, with a cost/income ratio (excluding the SRF) of 58.0%, a +4.2\u00a0percentage point improvement from first quarter 2020. There was a positive jaws effect of 7.2\u00a0percentage points in the quarter. By business, gross operating income was higher compared to first quarter 2020 in the Asset gathering business line (+45.5%), French and International Retail Banking (+5.6%), Large customers (+5.6%), and Specialised financial services (+3.7%). Therefore,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">underlying gross operating income</emphasis>excluding the SRF was up by +19.1% compared to first quarter 2020.</p><p>As at 31 March 2021, risk indicators confirmed<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the high quality of Cr\u00e9dit\u00a0Agricole\u00a0S.A.'s assets and risk coverage level</emphasis>. The diversified loan book is mainly geared towards home loans (27% of gross outstandings) and corporates (45% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. gross outstandings). The non-performing loan ratio was still low at 3.2% (stable compared to 31 December 2020), while the coverage ratio<sup>46</sup>was high at 72%, up +0.6 percentage points in the quarter. Loan loss reserves amounted to (EURO)9.7\u00a0billion for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., a +(EURO)0.1\u00a0billion increase from 31 December 2020. Of these loan loss reserves, 28% were for performing loan provisioning. Provisioning levels this quarter were based on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">several weighted economic scenarios</emphasis>, unchanged from the scenarios presented in the 2020 URD - with, for GDP in France, a more favourable scenario (+7.1% in 2021 and +2.7% in 2022), and a less favourable scenario (+3.0% in 2021 and +4.8% in 2022)<sup>47</sup>, and included flat-rate adjustments for retail banking portfolios and for corporates and specific additions for some target sectors such as aerospace, hotels, tourism, restaurants.</p><p>The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cost of risk</emphasis>dropped significantly (-38.2%/-(EURO)237\u00a0million compared to first quarter 2020, to -(EURO)384\u00a0million versus -(EURO)621\u00a0million in first quarter 2020 and -(EURO)500\u00a0million in fourth quarter 2020). 56% of the decline in the cost of risk compared to the year earlier period is explained by less provisioning of performing outstandings (Stages 1 and 2). The -(EURO)384\u00a0million expense in first quarter 2021 consisted of performing loan provisioning (Stages 1 &amp; 2) for -(EURO)90\u00a0million (versus an allocation of -(EURO)223\u00a0million in first quarter 2020 and an allocation of -(EURO)193\u00a0million in fourth\u00a0quarter\u00a02020) and provisioning for proven risks (Stage\u00a03) amounting to -(EURO)283\u00a0million\u00a0(versus -(EURO)382\u00a0million in first quarter 2020 and -(EURO)291\u00a0million in fourth quarter\u00a02020). In first quarter 2021, the cost of risk relative to outstandings over a rolling four-quarter period<sup>48</sup>was 56\u00a0basis points, and was 37\u00a0basis points\u00a0on an annualised quarterly basis<sup>49</sup>. The decrease in the cost of risk was especially pronounced for financing activities and for CA Consumer Finance, and more moderate for LCL and CA Italia. Accordingly, LCL posted a cost of risk at -(EURO)83\u00a0million (-17.9% compared to first quarter 2020 and a moderate decrease of -7.5% since fourth quarter 2020), with a stabilisation of its ratio cost of risk relative to outstandings48 at 27 basis points in first quarter 2021 (23\u00a0basis\u00a0points on an annualised quarterly basis49); CA Italia recorded a cost of risk of -(EURO)71\u00a0million in first quarter 2021 (down -13.8% from first quarter 2020 and -36.8% compared to fourth quarter 2020), with a cost of risk/outstandings48 of 89 basis points in first quarter 2021 (60\u00a0basis\u00a0points on an annualised quarterly basis49); CA Consumer Finance's cost of risk decreased by -30.4% compared to first quarter 2021 to -(EURO)114\u00a0million, -11.0% lower than fourth quarter 2020, with the cost of risk relative to outstandings48 at 167 basis points for first quarter 2021 (and 133\u00a0basis\u00a0points on a quarterly annualised basis49). Lastly, for financing activities, the cost of risk for the quarter stood at -(EURO)85\u00a0million, versus an allocation of -(EURO)137\u00a0million in first quarter 2020, and -(EURO)121\u00a0million in fourth quarter 2020, i.e. down -38.2% and -30.0%, respectively.

Insurance revenues also benefited over one month from the unwinding of an additional 15% of the Switch mechanism carried out on 1 March 2021. Underlying expenses were down -5.7% in first quarter 2021 compared to the year-earlier period. This change breaks down into a +3.1% rise in expenses for the businesses relating to investments to develop the activity, and a drop in the C3S corporate social contribution applied to the activity in 2020. Underlying gross operating income was therefore recorded up +48.5%, at (EURO)391\u00a0million in first quarter 2021. The underlying cost/income ratio in first quarter 2021 stood at 37.4%, an improvement of -11.1\u00a0percentage\u00a0points compared to first quarter 2020.

Net management fee and commission income increased by +5.1% and performance fee income reached a record level of (EURO)111\u00a0million. In addition, the first quarter 2021 benefited from a positive scope effect (Sabadell AM and Fund Channel for +(EURO)17\u00a0million in revenues). Underlying expenses excluding SRF came to (EURO)379\u00a0million, a 13.2% increase, which can be explained by the scope effect of Sabadell, Fund Channel and the creation of Amundi Bank of China WM of (EURO)12\u00a0million, as well as the rise in variable compensation linked to the growth in gross operating income. Underlying gross operating income was up a strong +44.4% and the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF stood at an excellent level of 50.3%, down 6 percentage points compared to first quarter 2020. The contribution of equity-accounted entities, notably including the contribution of Amundi's joint ventures in Asia, was +28.3% higher than in first quarter 2020, and came in at (EURO)18\u00a0million despite a negative scope impact due to the change to full consolidation of Fund Channel and reached (EURO)20\u00a0million.

The fully loaded ratio is 12.5%. The CET1 ratio benefited this quarter from the effect of the stated result, generating a positive impact of +31 basis points. The distribution of dividends and AT1 coupons contributed to the decrease in CET1 by -17 basis points (of which -14 basis points related to the dividend reserve based on a 50% pay-out policy, (EURO)0.16 at end\u00a0March 2021). Risk weighted assets had a downward impact on CET1 of -20 basis points<sup>68</sup>, and the methodology and regulatory effects impacted the CET1 by -12 basis points (of which -11 basis points related to the TRIM - targeted review of internal models). This ratio includes a negative impact of -4 basis points on the \"M&amp;A, OCIE and other\" item linked in particular to the effect of OCI reserves (-9 basis points in connection with the increase of rates over the period). The stock of OCI reserves reached 38 basis points at 31 March 2021 (vs. 48 basis points at 31 December 2020). Lastly, the dismantling of a further 15% of the SWITCH mechanism impacts the ratio by -20 basis points. Finally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. had a substantial buffer of 4.8\u00a0percentage points between the level of its CET1 ratio and the 7.9% SREP requirement, compared with 5.2 percentage points at 31 December 2020.

Risk weighted assets in Retail banking also increased (+(EURO)0.4\u00a0billion excluding foreign exchange impact). The equity-accounted value of insurance had a downward impact of -(EURO)1.2\u00a0billion on the risk weighted assets in connection with the effect of the increase in rates of OCI reserves. The \"Methodology &amp; regulatory effects &amp; M&amp;A\" item had an upward impact on risk weighted assets amounting to +(EURO)2.4\u00a0billion, the increase is mainly related to the targeted review of internal models (TRIM: +(EURO)2.9\u00a0billion). Finally, the unwinding of an additional 15% of the SWITCH mechanism impacted RWA for an amount of +(EURO)5.1\u00a0billion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liquidity and Funding</emphasis></p><p>Liquidity is measured at Cr\u00e9dit\u00a0Agricole\u00a0Group level.</p><p>In order to provide simple, relevant and auditable information on the Group's liquidity position, the banking cash balance sheet's stable resources surplus is calculated quarterly.</p><p>The banking cash balance sheet is derived from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's IFRS financial statements. It is based on the definition of a mapping table between the Group's IFRS financial statements and the sections of the cash balance sheet as they appear in the next table and whose definition is commonly accepted in the marketplace. It relates to the banking scope, with insurance activities being managed in accordance with their own specific prudential constraints.</p><p>Further to the breakdown of the IFRS financial statements in the sections of the cash balance sheet, netting calculations are carried out. They relate to certain assets and liabilities that have a symmetrical impact in terms of liquidity risk. Deferred taxes, fair value impacts, collective impairments, short-selling transactions and other assets and liabilities were netted for a total of (EURO)62\u00a0billion at end\u00a0March 2021. Similarly, (EURO)120\u00a0billion in repos/reverse repos were eliminated insofar as these outstandings reflect the activity of the securities desk carrying out securities borrowing and lending operations that offset each other. Other nettings calculated in order to build the cash balance sheet - for an amount totalling (EURO)159\u00a0billion at end-March 2021 - relate to derivatives, margin calls, adjustment/settlement/liaison accounts and to non-liquid securities held by Corporate and Investment banking and are included in the \"Customer-related trading assets\" section.</p><p>Note that deposits centralised with Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations are not netted in order to build the cash balance sheet; the amount of centralised deposits ((EURO)67\u00a0billion\u00a0at end\u00a0March 2021) is booked to assets under \"Customer-related trading assets\" and to liabilities under \"Customer-related funds\".</p><p>In a final stage, other restatements reassign outstandings that accounting standards allocate to one section, when they are economically related to another. As such, senior issues placed through the banking networks as well as financing by the European Investment Bank, the Caisse\u00a0des\u00a0D\u00e9p\u00f4ts\u00a0et\u00a0Consignations and other refinancing transactions of the same type backed by customer loans, which accounting standards would classify as \"Medium long-term market funds\", are reclassified as \"Customer-related funds\".</p><p>Note that for Central Bank refinancing transactions, outstandings related to the T-LTRO (Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations) are included in \"Long-term market funds\". Indeed, the T-LTRO 3 operations do not allow for early redemption at the ECB's discretion; given their contractual maturity, they are deemed equivalent to long term secured refinancing, identical in liquidity risk terms to a secured issue.</p><p>Medium/long-term repos are also included in \"Long term market funds\".</p><p>Finally, the CIB's counterparties that are banks with which we have a commercial relationship are considered as customers in the construction of the cash balance sheet.</p><p>Standing at (EURO)1,549\u00a0billion at 31 March 2021, the Group's banking cash balance sheet shows a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">surplus of stable funding resources over stable application of funds of (EURO)279\u00a0billion</emphasis>, up (EURO)14\u00a0billion compared to end\u00a0December 2020 and up (EURO)147\u00a0billion compared to end\u00a0March 2020.</p><p>In line with initiatives already undertaken during the past quarters in connection with the COVID-19 crisis, the Group once again took part, in March 2021, in the T-LTRO 3 medium-to-long-term refinancing transactions of the European Central Bank for (EURO)19\u00a0billion<sup>69</sup>, helping to raise its level of stable resources. Total T-LTRO 3 outstandings for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group amounts to (EURO)152\u00a0billion<sup>70</sup>at 31 March 2021. Note that the subsidy applicable to the refinancing rate for these operations is accrued over the drawdown period and that the additional subsidy for the period June 2020 to June 2021 is accrued over one year, as the Group already meets the lending trigger.</p><p>In addition, the Group recorded a net increase in customer activity during the quarter. Funds collected increased by (EURO)17\u00a0billion, while loans and trading assets to customers increased by (EURO)22\u00a0billion.</p><p>The surplus of 279\u00a0billion\u00a0euros, known as \"stable resources position\", allows the Group to cover the LCR deficit generated by long term assets and stable liabilities (customer, tangible and intangible assets, long-term funds, own funds).

President Karl-Heinz Lambertz described the report as an \"emergency call to all levels of government\" to work together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report by the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), whose key findings were released by the UN on 6 May, reflects conclusions of scientists from around the globe derived from 15,000 academic studies. The report is frank and stark in its warnings. It states that biodiversity is declining at a rate unprecedented in human history, species are dying out at an ever faster pace, and humankind is \"eroding the very foundations of economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.\" </p><p>President Lambertz (BE/PES) said: \"Nature gives us life - and we are destroying it. Over the past half-century we have met the challenge of feeding a fast-growing global population with great success, but at great cost to the natural world. We need urgently to find a way to feed the world and ensure sustainable development, while restoring biodiversity. This crisis needs a shared response from all levels of government, including cities and regions. Together with tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity should move to the top of the EU's agenda. It is not too late to secure a biodiverse carbon-free world, but it needs concerted efforts and investment that delivers locally.\"</p><p>Roby Biwer (LU/PES), 1st Vice-Chair of the CoR's ENVE Commission and its rapporteur on biodiversity, said: \"Biodiversity should be considered the foundation for our health and well-being. It underpins the functioning of the ecosystems on which we depend; and because it constitutes the environment in which we live, we have to protect biodiversity, learning to live in harmony with our ecosystems.\" </p><p>Mr Biwer underlined that European voters understand the deep connection between biodiversity and climate action, citing a survey by Eurobarometer published on 6 May that found that \"two-thirds of Europeans totally agree that looking after nature is essential in tackling climate change.\"</p><p>The CoR is involved in the development of the post-2020 global and European policy framework for biodiversity. Recommendations adopted by the CoR in October 2018 insist - as does the IPBES report - on the need for Europe's cities and regions to become sustainable entities that conserve nature, restore biodiversity, maintain and enhance ecosystem services while meeting the critical needs of their populations. The CoR called for the development of an ambitious, time-bound, science-driven post-2020 EU Strategy on Biodiversity to save the diversity and abundance of life on Earth.

The own-initiative opinion focuses on domestic water management, i.e. water quality, the shortage of fresh water and flood defences. Rapporteur Cees Loggen (NL/ALDE) is member of the Executive Council of the province of North-Holland. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Committee of the Regions strongly believes that water management is a capital-intensive policy area in which major investments must be made. To support innovation, local leaders recommend an EU water innovation action agenda to encourage Member States and local governments to facilitate water innovation projects and to reduce administrative burdens to facilitate access to EU funds. </p><p>Cees Loggen (NL/ALDE) , rapporteur of the adopted opinion on \" Effective water management system: an approach to innovative solutions \", stated: \"As climate change affects water management, consistency and coherence is necessary between these two policy areas. Climate change can, for example, lead to more intensive rainfall, floods and contamination of drinking water. Good water management is therefore as important as the threats of climate change on the environment.\" He also pointed out that \"In the longer term, the challenge will be to successfully meet the desired water quality objectives and deal with the impact of rising sea levels and the scarcity of fresh water.\" Over the last 15 years, floods have led to at least 25 billion euros worth of insured damage. In 2014 alone, the estimated damage amounted to almost 5 billion euros. According to EC projections, the total annual damage is to be five times greater in 2050.\"We must accept that there are considerable uncertainties in predicting climate change and its impact on water management. The challenge lies in making sensible decisions that do justice to what we wish to preserve now, but that also provide sufficient scope for tackling uncertain future challenges in order to manage the source of life\" added Loggen. </p><p>The European Committee of the Regions calls on the European Commission (EC) to shift towards adaptive policy-making within the area of water policy, as part of the upcoming review of the Drinking Water Directive, of the Water Framework Directive and the possible review of the Urban Waste Water Directive. The EC should consult local and regional authorities to ensure any future proposals are in the best interests of regions and cities, supporting their competencies rather than reducing them. </p><p>While we acknowledge the very ambitious Urban Water Agenda 2030 set up by the Leeuwarden Cities and Water Conference in February 2016 and we certainly encourage cities across Europe to sign up to it, local governments must remain free to manage water policies and decide for themselves whether or not to follow the agenda's recommendations\", added Cees Loggen. </p><p>The CoR encourages Member States and local and regional governments to include in their water policies the concepts of \"green infrastructure\" and \"natural water retention measures\" (NWRM), as an alternative to traditional grey structural measures. The European Committee of the Region also supports a reduction of water scarcity and a further increase in water efficiency by prioritising water demand management and water efficiency in irrigation, buildings and in the energy sector. Local and regional leaders are calling for further support of water metering across all sectors and users, as well as encouraging infrastructure investment to address water loss through leakages. Over-extraction should also be tackled through revision of permits. </p><p>The water sector has a great economic value for the EU: the European water sector consists of 9 000 active small and medium-sized enterprises which provide 600 000 jobs in utilities alone, according to European Commission. </p><p>Notes to editors: <br/>Click here for more information on the European Innovation Partnership on Water. </p><p>Click here for more information on the Urban Water Agenda 2030. </p><p>Contacts: <br/>Diandra Vanigioli <br/>Tel. +32 (0)2 282 22 99 <br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:diandra.vanigioli@cor.europa.eu\">diandra.vanigioli@cor.europa.eu</email></p><p>David Crous <br/>Tel. +32 (0)470 881 037 <br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.crous@cor.europa.eu\">david.crous@cor.europa.eu</email></p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": ["The EC should consult local and regional authorities to ensure any future proposals are in the best interests of regions and cities, supporting their competencies rather than reducing them.

Drawing on case studies of Paris, Chicago, Kitakyushu and Stockholm, the report identifies green policies that can respond to urban growth priorities and suggests how to implement and finance them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than half the people in the world live in or near cities today. By the middle of the century, urban areas will be home to over two-thirds of the global population and a large share of economic activity.</p><p>\"Cities must be an integral part of international efforts to make our economies more sustainable, with local and national policymakers working together to reduce urban environmental impact, stimulate growth and improve well-being for their residents\" said OECD Deputy Secretary General Yves Leterme. \"The potential synergies between the environment and the economy in cities are obvious.  For example, reducing congestion and pollution makes a city more efficient and more attractive to firms and highly skilled workers.\"</p><p>The OECD's city-level case studies provide urban leaders with new insights on how environmental policies can contribute to different types of growth.</p><p>- Job creation: the right urban sustainability policies can include retrofitting the existing building stock for improved energy efficiency.  For example, the Chicago Tri-State metro-region has built a regional specialty in green building design and retrofitting. In 2010 it gave 45 000 people green jobs, 36% of which were in the green building sector.</p><p>- Attracting firms and workers: efficient transport systems, in particular, good public transport networks, help cities to lure investors.  The private sector in the Paris/Ile-de-France region has long recognised this, and firms that benefit from proximity to the transportation system contribute to its financing.</p><p>- Innovation and entrepreneurship: cities can foster the growth of the green technology sector by creating green regional clusters that build on existing industries, services, research and innovation. Kitakyushu has built an impressive recycling cluster, the Eco-Town, which recycles hundreds of tons of industrial waste every day, while producing energy for residential and commercial neighbourhoods.</p><p>- Increasing the value of urban land: redevelopment, infill, and eco-districts can enhance land values while increasing density and reducing residents' environmental impact.  Following the success of its Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad eco-district, Stockholm is now working with the private sector to develop the Stockholm Royal Seaport eco-district. Buildings there will use less than the energy of others in Stockholm and the new district will have an advanced smart grid and district heating.</p><p>There is an urgent need to find better ways to \"green\" urban finance and to mobilise private finance for green infrastructure. Introducing green incentives into municipal revenue streams would be a big step towards a more sustainable growth path. Property taxes could help prevent sprawl by eliminating the preferential tax treatment of single-family homes that exists in many places. Congestion charges and parking fees can help reduce traffic and pollution, while fees for water and waste services should be more responsive to actual resources used. For example, the City of Stockholm is greening its income with revenues from the congestion charges system. Implemented in 2006, this system has led to lower CO2 emission and traffic congestion and is also becoming a substantial source of income. National governments also have an important role to play in setting the pricing signals and standards that will provide coherence, attractive environment for green financing.</p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": ["Following the success of its Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad eco-district, Stockholm is now working with the private sector to develop the Stockholm Royal Seaport eco-district.

Zoellick </nameText></person>said the institution hoped to provide about $100 million to save the wild tiger by supporting wildlife habitat protection and stopping the illegal trade in tiger body parts. The World Bank is working with tiger range countries to prepare one regional project for South Asia worth around $100 million and another in Southeast Asia that could both be presented for consideration in 2011 to its executive board. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking to leaders at the First International Tiger Forum in St. Petersburg, Zoellick committed the World Bank to supporting the 13 tiger range countries in their struggle to crack down on the criminals whose poaching and trafficking had decimated the number of wild tigers to about 3,200. Signaling a shift In policy, <person><nameText>Zoellick said the World Bank </nameText></person>would from now on emphasize \"smart green\" infrastructure development and would not finance infrastructure in core tiger areas. </p><p>\"First, the World Bank is working with Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, and we hope India, to finance a South Asia regional Wildlife project of approximately $100 million. Our cooperating partners include WWF, IUCN, TRAFFIC, IFAW, WCS, and others,\" Zoellick told the gathering. \"Second, we will work on a similar project with tiger range countries in Southeast Asia, as well as with CITES, Interpol, UNODC, WCO, and, most importantly regional institutions, such as ASEAN-Wildlife Enforcement Network to stop the illegal trade and trafficking in tiger body parts. This could include additional finance,\" he added.   </p><p>Held in the year of the tiger, this first ever gathering of tiger range countries committed to the Global Tiger Recovery Program that aims to double the number of wild tigers to 7,000 by 2022, the next year of the tiger. The proposed $100 million from the International Development Association, the World Bank's fund for the poorest, would be an almost one-third down payment on the $350 million that the Global Tiger Recovery Program is estimated to cost. The balance will be sought from governments and other International Financial Institutions. </p><p>The meeting in St. Petersburg was hosted by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin with the strong support of  Zoellick and attended by the prime ministers of Bangladesh, China, Lao PDR, and Nepal as well as by ministers from the other tiger range countries, conservation and law enforcement groups, and celebrities from the film and fashion world.   </p><p>The Global Tiger Initiative was launched by the World Bank and civil society partners in 2008. The key difference to past attempts is that the tiger range countries are in charge of efforts to save the wild tiger and the coalition draws on the best from science, conservation, non-governmental organizations, law enforcement, and others. </p><p>Subject to approval by the World Bank's board of executive directors, the $100 million would be disbursed as grants or no to low interest loans to support regional approaches to conserving wildlife, with a particular emphasis on saving the tiger, seen as a so-called \"umbrella species\" whose well-being reflects the wider well-being of biodiversity. The money for the South Asia regional project would pay to train border officials, improve the management of protected areas, and help governments strengthen laws and institutions. </p><p>Turning a page in the Bank's approach to development and biodiversity, <person><nameText>Zoellick said the World Bank </nameText></person>would not only maintain ecosystems but also enhance them through its infrastructure investments. </p><p>\"The World Bank will not finance any infrastructure projects that impact core tiger breeding areas -- areas that the tiger range countries plan to make inviolate,\" he said. \"Bricks and mortar should not bury biodiversity.  Critical ecosystems should not be paved over for short-term economic gains,\" he added. </p><p>Zoellick noted that the World Bank was working with Nepal, Malaysia, WWF and other interested parties to develop the Wildlife Premium Market Initiative to complement the UN's program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, known as REDD+.  The Wildlife Premium Market Initiative would give a value to the wildlife in forests and make payments to local communities to protect it, including the wild tiger. </p><p>More generally, the Bank was working with governments to \"green\" their national accounts so their balance sheets reflected the value of forests and wildlife, particularly for local communities. This natural wealth accounting, announced in October by Zoellick at the Nagoya biodiversity conference, could help countries assess the value of tiger landscapes, for example as eco-tourism destinations. </p><p>\"Time is short. With only about 3,200 tigers left in the wild, we have little margin for error. This summit is highlighting the last chance for this incredible animal,\" said Zoellick.</p>", "publisher": "NEWS Press (English)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "EU leaders should

the sights. It's the sounds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lying awake at night inside a mosquito net at the Tambopata Research Center in the Peruvian Amazon, you hear a symphony playing in the rain forest outside. It sounds like one of those dissonant pieces of modern music: a cacophony of birds, red howler monkeys, wild pigs, frogs, macaws and insects making bizarre clicks, snorts, croaks, chirps, wails and whistles. Occasionally, this symphony gets punctuated by the shrill, desperate scream of a human, who has just encountered a spider in her toilet.</p><p>This Amazon rain forest in southeastern Peru is a largely uninhabited wilderness that is home to some of the planet's most endangered wildlife, and one of the world's largest macaw clay licks a cliff of red clay, where blue, red and gold macaws flock for a dirt breakfast every morning.</p><p>Look down in the rain forest and you might see a hunting wasp stinging a caterpillar and depositing its eggs inside. Or, look up in the verdant canopy and you see the hanging nest of Oro Pendula weaver birds. You will notice, though, that the Oro Pendula have located their nest on a branch right next to a large white wasp's nest. Why? So if any predators try to attack the birds they will also rile the wasps an ingenious natural security system.</p><p>But today it's all endangered by what Tim Killeen, a senior biologist at Conservation International, identifies as three converging forces: rising commodity prices driven by rapid growth in China, plans by leaders in South America to integrate their infrastructure and highways to create a continental economy which will spark human migration into areas that are important for biodiversity and some new climate models that predict that global warming could make the Amazon so hot and dry that within a century it could mutate from a rain forest into a savannah.</p><p>If all of these trends converge, Killeen argues, it will create a ''perfect storm of environmental destruction that will degrade one of the last great tropical wilderness areas.''</p><p>The danger signs abound: Sailing here up the Rio Tambopata on our riverboat, we saw gold miners using motorized barges and mercury to dredge and sift and destroy riverbanks in search of gold. With gold prices soaring, the incentives to dredge the Tambopata are enormous. Some of the miners clear forests for camps and hunt rare animals for food.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Interoceanic Highway, running from the Atlantic coast of Brazil to the Pacific coast of Peru, appears to be heading for completion. More roads lead to more agriculture, logging, mining and oil and gas extraction, which converts more forests to cropland, which releases more climate-changing greenhouse gases.</p><p>''The Peruvian government has good policies, but it doesn't have the means to enforce them, and there is huge corruption,'' explained Diego Shoobridge, director of ParksWatch Peru. The road from Brazil through Peru already exists, ''but now they are going to pave it,'' he added. ''Once it is paved, all kinds of vehicles will come with Andean people, and they don't know the forests.''</p><p>But protests by do-gooders will not stop these forces. It requires a grand strategy.</p><p>''We need to put in place a green infrastructure a system of parks, territories controlled by indigenous communities, land-use regulations, carbon credits for forest protection and green businesses, like eco-tourism that will create a powerful green economic counterweight to the global economic forces driving deforestation,'' argued Glenn Prickett, a senior vice president at Conservation International and one of my traveling companions. (My wife is on the Conservation International board.)</p><p>Indeed, just as the Oro Pendula learned to leverage the wasps' nest to naturally preserve their home, environmentalists have to leverage the riches of the rain forest to naturally preserve the rain forest. That means creating ways for the locals to thrive off it while also protecting it. But that's hard. It is easy to clear-cut a forest for roads or an oil well. It's hard to develop shade-grown coffee or eco-tourism or a Brazil nut factory or a palm tree oil business. But without profitable eco-friendly business alternatives to counter the eco-hostile ones the economic predators of this rain forest will eventually have their day.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["But protests by do-gooders will not stop these forces.

What I've been thinking about actually is this: What book will our kids write about us? ''The Greediest Generation?'' ''The Complacent Generation?'' Or maybe: ''The Subprime Generation: How My Parents Bailed Themselves Out for Their Excesses by Charging It All on My Visa Card.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our kids should be so much more radical than they are today. I understand why they aren't. They're so worried about just getting a job or paying next semester's tuition. But we must not take their quietism as license to do whatever we want with this bailout cash.</p><p>They are going to have to pay this money back. And therefore, we have an incredibly weighty obligation to make sure that we not only spend every stimulus dollar wisely but also with an eye to creating new technologies.</p><p>We not only need to bail out industries of the past but to build up industries of the future - to offer the kind of big thinking and risk-taking that transforms enormous challenges into world-changing opportunities. That is what made the Greatest Generation great. This money can't just go to patch up our jalopies.</p><p>''Remember, this money will not be neutral,'' said Andy Karsner, a former U.S. assistant secretary of energy. ''We are talking about directing an unprecedented volume of cash at our housing, energy, transportation and infrastructure industries. This cash will either fortify the incumbent players and calcify the energy status quo, or it will facilitate the economic transformation we seek. The stimulus will either be white blood cells that will heal us or malignant cells that will continue to sap our strength.''</p><p>Let's get specific. When it comes to Detroit, my views are clear: I think we should be talking about ''bail,'' not ''bailouts,'' regarding the people running the Big Three car companies and the lawmakers who mindlessly protected them for so long. Still, I do not want to see jobs destroyed. But if taxpayers are going to give Detroit money, we must not entrust the spending to people who have run their businesses into the ground.</p><p>You want my tax dollars? Then I want to see the precise production plans and timetables for the hybridization of all your cars and trucks within 36 months. I want every bailed-out car company to move to hybrid electric drive trains, because nothing would both improve mileage and emissions more - and also stimulate a whole new 21st-century, job-creating industry: batteries.</p><p>Big batteries that can store electricity for transportation and wind and solar generation are the indispensable enablers of the Energy Internet of the future. Any Detroit bailout has to serve that goal.</p><p>A major electrification of drive trains in U.S.-made vehicles ''would induce explosive growth and investment in a domestic battery business,'' said Karsner. Europe, Japan and China are already dominating this industry. It's the key to clean-tech - and ultimately our national competitiveness. We can't allow ourselves to be battery importers in the 21st century the way we were oil importers in the 20th.</p><p>The same applies to Barack Obama's plans for a green stimulus in energy efficiency and infrastructure. It makes no sense to spend money on green infrastructure - or a bailout of Detroit aimed at stimulating production of more fuel-efficient cars - if it is not combined with a tax on carbon that would actually change consumer buying behavior.</p><p>Many people will tell Obama that taxing carbon or gasoline now is a ''nonstarter.'' Wrong. It is the only starter. It is the game-changer.</p><p>If you want to know where postponing it has gotten us, visit Detroit.</p><p>No carbon tax or increased gasoline tax meant that every time the price of gasoline went down to $1 or $2 a gallon, consumers went back to buying gas guzzlers. And Detroit just fed their addictions - so it never committed to a real energy-efficiency retooling of its fleet.</p><p>RIP.</p><p>If Obama is going to oversee a successful infrastructure stimulus, then it has to include not only a tax on carbon - make it revenue-neutral and rebate it all by reducing payroll taxes - but also new standards that gradually require utilities and home builders in states that receive money to build dramatically more energy-efficient power plants, commercial buildings and homes. This, too, would create whole new industries.</p><p>Let us not mince words: The Obama presidency will be shaped in many ways by how it spends this stimulus. I am sure he will articulate the right goals. But if the means - the price signals, conditions and standards - that he imposes on his stimulus are not as creative, bold and tough as his goals, it will all be for naught.</p><p>In sum, our kids will remember the Obama stimulus as either the burden of their lifetime or the investment of their lifetime. Let's hope it's the latter. I like that book title much better.</p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["We can't allow ourselves to be battery importers in the 21st century the way we were oil importers in the 20th.

As a knowledge partner for the Forum, Accenture has participated in shaping the Alliance from its inception and is supporting its practical work to deliver green investment. Following last year's report, Financing green growth in a resource-constrained world, this year's ground breaking Green Investment Report: The ways and means to unlock private finance for green growth aims to inform and inspire policy-makers and public and private finance providers to close the gap in delivering inclusive, sustainable growth.</p><p><br/><br/>Foreword<br/><br/>Shaping a global economy fit for the 21st century is our greatest challenge. Such an economy in 2050 will satisfy the needs of more than 9 billion people, who will rightly demand equal opportunities for development. Delivering such inclusive development in a sustainable way, however, requires that we remain within the boundaries of what our planet can safely deliver. Economic growth and sustainability are inter-dependent, you cannot have one without the other, and greening investment is the pre-requisite to realizing both goals.<br/><br/>Dramatic upgrades in technology, skills, policies and business models, along with an aligned public consciousness, are needed for the transition to a green growth pathway. Infrastructure investment required for sectors such as agriculture, transport, power and water under current growth projections stands at about US$ 5 trillion per year to 2020. This 'business-as-usual' investment will not lead to a stable future, however, unless it achieves environmental and sustainability goals. This development needs to be greened by re-evaluating investment priorities, building capacity, investment-grade policies and improving governance, among other activities. Additional investment needed to meet the climate challenge-for clean energy infrastructure, sustainable transport, energy efficiency and forestry-is about US$ 0.7 trillion per year.<br/><br/>Private financiers see these massive investment requirements as an opportunity. Today, we see major growth in clean energy investment, with financial flows worldwide approaching those in carbonintensive energy sources. Further, developing countries are proving an increasingly important source of capital. Since 2007, clean energy investment originating from outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) grew at 27% per year compared with 10% per year from OECD countries, albeit from a far lower<br/>base.<br/><br/>Yet today, despite signs of increasing private finance into clean energy and other green investments, there remains a considerable shortfall in investment. Closing this gap is our collective task and one that we cannot afford to fail.<br/><br/>Public finance, linked to smart, enabling policies, has a critical role to play. Given the scarcity of public funds, governments' contributions to closing the gap will depend on their effectiveness in mobilizing private investment. Experience demonstrates this is possible when supported by targeted financing mechanisms and institutional arrangements that blend private and public interests, expertise and resources to reduce risk and address bottlenecks preventing private investment.<br/><br/>The Green Growth Action Alliance was created to accelerate this agenda at the 2012 G20 Summit in Los Cabos, Mexico. The Alliance's vision, one that I share and actively promote as its founding chair, is to drive greater investment in green growth by unlocking potential sources of finance. Collaboration between business, governments, civil society and international organizations in overcoming barriers to and securing the benefits of green growth is the DNA of the Alliance's approach.<br/><br/>The Green Investment Report is the first report of the Alliance. It aims to inform and inspire policy-makers and public and private finance providers to close the gap in delivering inclusive, sustainable growth. It is the first time that a number of important institutions have joined to deliver a powerful message about the scale of the green investment gap that must be filled, and to spell out the ways and means to address the gap in green infrastructure investment. I appreciate this collective effort and would like to thank, in particular, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the Climate Policy Initiative, the Global Green Growth Institute, the International Energy Agency, the OECD, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Bank Group and the World Resources Institute for providing data, analysis, case studies and other support that enabled us to produce this report. I would also like to thank and congratulate the World Economic Forum for coordinating the whole effort and producing this report.<br/><br/>The Green Investment Report is one of many ways in which the Alliance is advancing green growth. Its members are collaborating on initiatives that aim to prove the efficacy of financing green growth, from energy efficiency to renewable energy and climate-smart agriculture. It is, as the name states, an alliance for action. I invite G20 governments, public finance institutions, investors and policy-makers to read this report and join us in leading the way to making a difference.<br/><br/>Felipe Calder\u00f3n,<br/>Chair, Green Growth Action Alliance<br/><br/>Continue reading...<br/><br/>Download the report (PDF 40 pages):<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Scaling-Green-Growth.pdf\">www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Scaling-Green-Growth.pdf</url></p><p>Financial Year Magazine</p>", "publisher": "Finyear.com", "instances": ["The Green Investment Report is the first report of the Alliance.
