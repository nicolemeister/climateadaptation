Henry Musa Kpaka, the agriculture minister, says the president is racing to boost yields and feed 8.4 million people after decades of civil war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nourished by seven major rivers and abundant inland valley swampland, Sierra Leone has ideal conditions to produce enough rice, a staple food, yet it continues to import substantial amounts. 'In his second term, President [Julius Maada] Bio really wanted to be very deliberate and determined,' Henry Musa Kpaka, the country's agriculture and food security minister, tells The Africa Report from his office in Freetown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bio backs Feed Salone, a national programme focused on enhancing agricultural productivity to ensure food security. Launched in 2023, the initiative has increased yields by investing in farmers through seeds and essential inputs. 'It's crucial we rely less on imports for our main staple - rice. Achieving food \u00adsovereignty is a clear goal set by the president,' says Kpaka.</p><p>Growing local and reducing imports</p><p>Introducing modern technology to smallholder farmers has improved productivity. Kpaka, an economist by training, emphasises boosting staple crop production, particularly rice, to strengthen Sierra Leone's economy.</p><p>'It's understandable to import items we don't produce, but we must urgently reduce imports of items we can grow ourselves. Importing weakens our currency and purchasing power,' he says. The country's GDP nosedived during the Covid-19 pandemic, while inflation skyrocketed.</p><p>Imports of other key foods such as eggs, onions and chicken have also declined, reflecting the programme's broader economic benefits. 'Feed Salone boosts the economy by preventing foreign reserves from being spent on imported food,' says Kpaka.</p><p>Changing attitudes to farming is also vital. Since the civil war ended in 2002, Sierra Leone has struggled to regain pre-war agricultural yields. The conflict destroyed perceptions of farming as a profitable business.</p><p>'Before the war, people with oil palm, cocoa or kola nut plantations proudly sent their children to university with earnings from agriculture. Post-war recovery created dependence, with people accustomed to receiving aid.'</p><p>Boosting crop production</p><p>Creating food processing infrastructure, especially for rice, is central to the plan. Many smallholder farmers either consume their rice or store it as seed, limiting its visibility in markets.</p><p>'People often ask where our rice is. Sierra Leone's annual demand is about 1.2 million metric tonnes, and we import about 350,000 tonnes,' says Kpaka. 'Around 65% of our rice consumption is locally produced.'</p><p>Feed Salone's investment in farming inputs has increased local rice availability, driving prices down. According to the UN's latest World Food Programme (WFP) quarterly report, rice prices have declined nationwide. Kpaka plans to expand rice processing, packaging and marketing in major towns like Freetown, Kenema, Koidu and Makeni, increasing awareness of local produce.</p><p>The initiative is also enhancing school feeding programmes. While the WFP historically imported 90% of the food served to schoolchildren, Kpaka notes that 40% now comes from local sources, aiming for 50% by 2026 and full local sourcing by 2030.</p><p>Cassava production is another growth area. Sierra Leone has achieved higher yields by using improved varieties. Traditionally processed into garri (flour) or fufu (dough), cassava production is set to expand with $40m support from the Islamic Development Bank, enabling the manufacture of cassava flour, starch and chips locally.</p><p>'It's essential we process cassava visibly for consumers to recognise it as Sierra Leonean produce,' says Kpaka. 'We want locals fully involved in these agricultural value chains.'</p><p>Key agricultural initiatives</p><p>While cassava predominantly serves domestic markets, certified organic cocoa remains an export commodity. Sierra Leone exported nearly 20 million metric tonnes of cocoa over the past two years. Kpaka highlights recent expansion efforts, planting 3,000 hectares of new cocoa varieties last year and aiming for another 2,000 hectares this year.</p><p>The agriculture ministry has partnered with the European Union on a pound 35m ($40.28m) project supporting sustainable food and agricultural development. The EU is directly funding production activities, notably focusing on tackling infant malnutrition.</p><p>Oil palm cultivation is another key initiative. Sierra Leone, a net exporter of vegetable oil, has two companies converting raw oil palm into processed oil, ending the need to import. 'Oil palm is a high-value cash crop for us,' he says.</p><p>Kpaka's office will soon release updated agricultural growth figures, expecting results exceeding previous years. 'It's not just about crop production; it's about transforming lives economically through agriculture, the backbone of Sierra Leone's economy,' Kpaka tells The Africa Report.</p><p>Feed Salone's goals</p><p> Boost agricultural productivity: Significantly increase the output of key crops and livestock to fuel inclusive economic growth and raise the sector's contribution to GDP.</p><p> Achieve food self-sufficiency: Reduce dependence on food imports, particularly of staple crops like rice, onions and poultry, and ensure that the country can feed itself sustainably.</p><p> Create jobs and empower communities: Generate employment opportunities, especially for women and youth, by modernising agriculture and supporting agribusinesses.</p><p> Reduce hunger and malnutrition: Alleviate food insecurity and improve nutrition by increasing the availability and accessibility of nutritious, locally produced food.</p><p> Increase export earnings: Develop value chains for export-oriented crops such as cashew and cocoa to bring in foreign exchange and boost farmers' incomes.</p><p> Build resilient food systems: Strengthen climate resilience and sustainability in agriculture through climate-smart practices, mechanisation and improved infrastructure.</p><p> Promote private sector participation: Encourage private investment and facilitate access to finance for agribusinesses and smallholder farmers.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": ["Reduce hunger and malnutrition: Alleviate food insecurity and improve nutrition by increasing the availability and accessibility of nutritious, locally produced food.

Without prejudice to its efforts to restrict incarceration as a measure of last resort, UNODC aims to equip prison systems with concrete strategies on climate disruption preparedness and mitigation.  </p><p>The vision is to do this in ways that enhance the prospects of \"green' prisons that make greater use of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient management practices while, at the same time, supporting the rehabilitation and social reintegration of prisoners. </p><p>In Sri Lanka's case, prisons were encouraged to grow crops as part of the government's strategy to ensure consistent food supplies and to mitigate the fear of food insecurity. </p><p>To support this policy, UNODC, in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), worked with the Department of Prisons in 2022 to establish model farms in two prisons: the Mahara Maximum Security Prison and the Pallansena Youth Correctional Centre.  </p><p>The program's main objective was to promote the physical and mental well-being of prisoners and provide participants with skills that would be useful outside the prison walls.

Becoming more energy efficient and circular - i.e. more sustainable and resource efficient - is not an obstacle for increased competitiveness. Rather, it's the foundation for it.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>As the cost of living rises, access to decent, affordable, healthy housing is slipping further out of reach for many Europeans. Those already facing social and economic hardship - for instance in areas with high unemployment rates - are disproportionally hit, but the crisis hits many more than just the poorest and is becoming an important, societal issue to tackle.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>So, it is great to see the Ursula von der Leyen Commission do just that by appointing a Commissioner responsible for both energy and housing - Dan J\u00f8rgensen who, among other things is charged with presenting the first-ever European Affordable Housing Plan. He is also, amongst many other tasks, responsible for the recently adopted action plan for affordable energy to help bring down energy cost for households and business and for\u202fcompleting the\u202fEnergy Union\u202fand supporting the implementation of the\u202fclimate and energy framework for 2030 whilst reducing the EU's dependencies on Russian gas\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>This is important, because none of these issues can be treated in isolation. Buildings are responsible for 40% of the EU's energy consumption and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions. This means that there will be no real transition without putting buildings at the heart of the action. And there's a lot to tackle!\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>If we look specifically at housing, we find that Europe's housing stock is ageing, inefficient, and inadequate for current and future needs. At the same time, only about 1% of our building stock is renovated annually, a far cry from the 3 per cent annually we would need to be on track for 2030 targets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>We know from research from BPIE for VELUX that one in four Europeans live in buildings where the indoor air quality falls below national standards. And low-income households are even more likely to be stuck in energy inefficient homes that generate higher bills and worse health outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>That also means that a meaningful and forward-looking housing policy must address affordability but also efficiency, sustainability and health - equally and simultaneously. The path to a fairer, more resilient and more competitive Europe runs through the front door of every home.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>How do we go about that then? At VELUX, we'd like to offer three guiding principles:\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 1. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduce a holistic approach to housing, anchored around people</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/>It is time to put people first. Housing is a multi-faceted topic directly touching upon people's living conditions, health, affordability, well-being, energy efficiency, energy poverty, sustainability, urban planning, construction, workforce and much more. All these must be taken into consideration when designing a future housing framework.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Incentivise innovative ways to create living spaces in new and existing buildings</emphasis>\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>To accommodate projected demographic changes, includig further urbanisation and changing numbers of young and elderly people and single-person households, we need to ensure more adaptable housing, better use of existing buildings but also improved and new infrastructure. This could be through incentivizing adaptable design solutions or encouraging an increase in the number of dwellings on existing plots, such as through attic conversions.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Foster collaboration and joint action</emphasis>\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>Achieving affordable and sustainable housing requires more coordinated efforts and joint actions across sectors - both at EU and national level - to help identify barriers, scale up solutions and improve the quality and affordability of our living conditions. Fostering public-private partnerships at national level, such as the Danish Government's Climate Partnerships, could be a way to increase affordable and sustainable housing in existing building stock.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Affordability and Sustainability Are Allies</emphasis>\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>A holistic approach to housing, and indeed buildings in general, ensures affordability in the long run. When homes are energy efficient, residents spend less on bills, permanently. When they are healthy, people increase their quality of life, are less ill and more productive. These co-benefits must be embraced, not sidelined, in policy debates.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>Housing should be an essential infrastructure, invested in accordingly. Every euro spent on quality renovation can yield returns on health, energy savings, job creation, climate resilience and increased competitiveness.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Time to Act Is Now</emphasis>\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>The solutions exist, and the evidence on their benefits is clear. Now they must be applied and adapted to the local member state context.\u00a0 The EU's role is to provide\u00a0 strong political impetus to prioritise housing that is affordable, sustainable, and healthy by creating an overall, European approach and framework to depart from.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>This is also simply sound, European business. The construction and building materials industry employs some 25 million people, accounting for around 11% of Europe's GDP and generating over 1.6 billion investments across the single market.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/>The future of Europe is being built - brick by brick. Let's make sure it serves both people, our economy, and the planet and is not only built to last, but also to sustain whatever comes our way in the future.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Fleming Voetmann, Vice President of Sustainability and External Relations.</emphasis><br/></p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["At the same time, I truly believe that increasing Europe's global competitiveness hinges on our ability to (continue to) lead the green transition.

And that warming, according to a recent paper produced by the NATO Defense College in Rome, can have a powerful effect on how sound, the primary means of detecting submarines, behaves underwater.       </p><p>It could make large areas of the oceans impenetrable to submarine hunters.       </p><p>\"We observed, in most areas that we looked at, a reduction in the range of detection,\" said Mauro Gilli, a researcher who studies military technology. His team modeled the way sound waves moved through the depths from 1970 to 1999. And they compared it with the way current climate modeling predicts they will move between 2070 and 2099. There were significant differences.       </p><p>The researchers found that in the North Atlantic, where Russian submarines play cat and mouse with NATO forces, the distances at which they can be heard will shrink significantly. This could be by almost half in the Bay of Biscay, off the coasts of France and Spain. There were similar dynamics in play in the western Pacific, where Chinese and American submarines operate and where detection ranges could shrink by up to 20 percent.       </p><p>The underlying science has been well understood since before World War II, when scientists discovered that sound, which travels faster through warmer water, tends to bend toward cooler layers, where it moves more slowly.       </p><p>This means that as the surface of the water is warmed by climate change, sound will begin moving more sharply downward toward cooler layers of water. This will make it harder for sonar operators listening for submarines at a distance to hear noises generated by their targets.       </p><p>According to Dr. Gilli, who has worked at ETH Zurich and is taking up a new research position at the Hertie School in Berlin, this effect could have important strategic implications. He said countries like Russia and China could take advantage of these environmental shifts to deploy submarines in parts of the oceans where the changes are more pronounced, such as the North Atlantic.       </p><p>Dr. Gilli noted that other methods of detecting submarines, like tracking the tiny disturbances in Earth's magnetic field that occur when the submarines move through the water, are effective only at shorter distances.       </p><p>\"If it becomes even more difficult to detect them,\" he said, \"then the result is that things become harder for navies that are on the defensive.\"       </p><p>There could be consequences in terms of nuclear deterrence.       </p><p>The United States, Russia, China and other nuclear-armed states base their defenses on the idea that ballistic missile submarines are hard to find and destroy. If climate change makes it even easier for them to hide, then the threat they represent, and thus their deterrence value, may be seen as more credible.       </p><p>But some experts caution against overstating the effects caused by climate change. Tom Stefanick, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, notes that submarine operators must grapple with so many other environmental factors, from shipping noises to crackling Arctic ice, that it is not practical to focus only on climate change when making strategic predictions.       </p><p>\"The amount of variability is so great that a long-term trend of the sort they are talking about would be washed out,\" Dr. Stefanick said.       </p><p>The most important finding of the study may simply be a confirmation that submarine fleets will be forced to grapple with greater uncertainty in the future as climate change accelerates.       </p><p>Dr. Gilli and his colleagues found that ocean changes would vary substantially in different areas and were more pronounced at northern latitudes. In the shallows of the Sea of Japan, detection of North Korean submarines could actually become easier.       </p><p>\"This creates an unpredictability that will now be something that commanders will have to contend with,\" said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, who added that changing currents and weather will also present challenges. \"You will have to do much more frequent measurements to make sure your models are up-to-date.\"       </p><p>The U.S. Navy has gradually become more attuned to the risks that climate change poses to its operations.

Citing data from the Global Commission on Adaptation, he emphasized that for every dollar invested in adaptation, up to $10 is returned, making it one of the smartest economic decisions governments and businesses can make.</p><p>The Netherlands, he pointed out, serves as a model of adaptation success, having transformed itself from a \"sub-Ocean\" nation into one of the most resilient economies in the world. \"If you want to see what adaptation looks like, come to the Netherlands-we turned water into land and survival into prosperity.\"</p><p>A Call to Reimagine Global GovernanceIn his closing remarks, Professor Verkooijen called for a fundamental reimagining of global governance, financial systems, and development strategies to ensure resilience is embedded in all aspects of policymaking and investment.</p><p>\"Let me offer you today three key suggestions for re-imagining our world order.

While there is broad conceptual support for AFS, their adoption is limited due to economic concerns, legal contradictions, and mistrust in farmers' capacities.<br/><br/><br/>In Germany, AFS are often seen as economically nonviable and incompatible with modern agriculture, whereas Switzerland and France show stronger cultural and economic valuation of trees and hedgerows, offering alternative pathways for scaling up.<br/><br/><br/>The study uses the 3I framework (institutions, interests, and ideas) to analyse the political dynamics affecting AFS adoption.

By 2050, the sector could generate (EURO)220 billion annually, create 670,000 jobs, and position Europe as a leader in the green economy.<br/><br/><br/>However, the lack of research, funding gaps, and limited policy support, threaten the large-scale deployment of this solution. Despite being a global research leader, the EU's financial support for CDR has been insufficient and fragmented, with only (EURO)657 million allocated between 2020 and 2023.<br/><br/><br/>Current funding mechanisms fail to distinguish CDR from carbon capture and storage (CCS), limiting opportunities for targeted innovation. To bridge the funding gap, the EU must invest (EURO)2.88 to (EURO)5.85 billion over the next 15-20 years to accelerate technical development and ensure deployment readiness.<br/><br/><br/>A clear roadmap is essential for addressing research and financial gaps.

The event, hosted at the GCA's Rotterdam Headquarters, called on governments, industries and civil society to redouble efforts to build \"resilient economies\" as the growth engine for the 21<sup>st</sup>century.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ambassadors and senior diplomatic representatives from 50 nations gathered in a show of support and unity for the adaptation and resilience agenda. Delegates committed to spurring sustainable growth, fostering new industries, driving innovation, and unlocking private finance to ease mounting pressures on development aid and public climate finance. The global market for climate adaptation solutions-such as advanced weather analytics, parametric insurance, and water-efficient infrastructure- is projected to be worth USD 2 trillion annually by 2026.</p><p>Welcoming the attendees, Professor Patrick V. Verkooijen, President &amp; CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, lauded the diplomatic community for recognizing that adaptation is not merely a defensive measure but an essential component of global economic strategy: \"We are already in the 'Resilience Endgame'. We must prepare today for the 1.5-degree world. The devastating global impacts we see today need not define the society of tomorrow. The escape plan is to double down on adaptation and capture its incredible economic dividends.\" He added that \"the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, our flagship initiative, the largest adaptation program in the world, has shown us that growth and building resilience are intrinsically linked. But we can do so much more - together. Adaptation is about future-proofing our economies, protecting critical infrastructure, safeguarding food supplies, and ensuring that new opportunities can thrive in changing conditions. By rallying together, we multiply the impact of innovative investments and encourage the 'resilience dividend'-the powerful, compounding benefits that flow from forward-thinking action.\"</p><p>Delivering remarks, Professor Jan Peter Balkenende, Former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Minister of State, and Executive Board Member of the GCA, emphasized that genuine progress on climate resilience will unlock broad-based dividends: \"What happens in the most vulnerable countries does not stay there. Climate change amplifies food insecurity, migration, and conflict. In fragile states, environmental stress can become a security threat. Europe and the world must take this seriously. Investing in resilience is not only right - it is wise.\" He added that \"This is why we need true global cooperation, based on shared interest and shared responsibility.\"</p><p>Reflecting on adaptation efforts in Africa and beyond, H.E. Halima Mucheke, Ambassador of the Republic of Kenya in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, spoke about the significance of GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi: \"Kenya is proud to host the GCA's new headquarters in Nairobi which will intensify support for adaptation programs across Africa, leading these programs North-South. Around the world, resilient infrastructure is the hot new investment class. Climate adaptation is a framework for protecting infrastructure, securing food systems and creating new business and job opportunities. And it is being aided by a thriving market in climate solutions.\" He added that \"The continent's leading initiative in this area - the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP) - has already channelled more than $15bn to strengthen essential systems against climate shocks. These funds are helping to secure the adaptability and livelihoods of nearly 60 million vulnerable people in 40 countries. We need to keep scaling this up, working as a global community, North-South, South-South, South-North-all together.\"</p><p>Following the opening remarks delegates also heard from the lead architect and founder of Powerhouse Company, Nanne de Ru, about how GCA's European headquarters at the Floating Office Rotterdam is an award-winning sustainable building recognized worldwide as a model for climate-resilient infrastructure.The reception forms part of GCA's broader advocacy strategy to advance climate adaptation solutions worldwide-focusing on protecting infrastructure, securing food systems, catalysing economic growth, and fostering global collaboration. By bringing together high-level diplomats, GCA reinforced its role as a leading international organisation in developing and implementing adaptation strategies that bolster economies against intensifying climate shocks.</p><p>Participating Countries and RepresentativesA wide cross-section of the diplomatic community participated in the reception:</p><p>Afghanistan: H.E.

Another helped repair water-treatment plants in the strategic port city of Basra, Iraq, where dry taps had caused violent anti-government protests. U.S.A.I.D.'s oldest program, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, ran a forecasting system that allowed aid workers in places like war-torn South Sudan to prepare for catastrophic floods last year.       </p><p>The fate of these programs remains uncertain. The Trump administration has essentially sought to shutter the agency. A federal court has issued a temporary restraining order. On the ground, much of the work has stopped.       </p><p>\"They were buying down future risk,\" said Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security and a former U.S. intelligence official. \"Invest a little today so we don't have to spend a lot in the future when things metastasize.\"       </p><p>The German government this week released a report calling climate change \"the greatest security threat of our day and age,\" echoing a U.S. intelligence report from 2021, which described climate hazards as \"threat multipliers.\"       </p><p>Some U.S.A.I.D. funding supported mediation programs to prevent local clashes over land or water. For instance, as the rains become erratic in the Sahel region of Africa, bordering the Sahara, clashes between farmers and cattle herders become more frequent.       </p><p>Other U.S.A.I.D. funds supported job training to give young people alternatives to being recruited by terrorist organizations. One such program in Kenya offered motorcycle-repair training. Other programs funded research into crop seeds that could withstand disease and drought, including new varieties of coffee for the global market. Another promoted biodiversity in the Colombia, still recovering from decades of war.       </p><p>Dozens of U.S.A.I.D. projects have been officially terminated, according to court records. The website of the famine early warning network has gone dark.       </p><p>Climate change adds to the pressures facing vulnerable countries. The burning of fossil fuels has raised the average global temperature since the start of the industrial age, and it has supersized extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and storm surges worsened by rising seas. This has, in turn, intensified water shortages, hampered food production and led to increased competition for resources.       </p><p>The U.S. National Intelligence Council concluded in 2021 that \"climate change will increasingly exacerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopolitical tensions mount about how to respond.\"       </p><p>The report identified specific flash points, including cross-border water tensions, and said some countries could experience instability, including from straining food and energy systems. It identified nearly a dozen particularly vulnerable countries, including Niger, Chad and Ethiopia. \"Building resilience in these countries and regions would probably be especially helpful in mitigating future risks to U.S. interests,\" it said.       </p><p>That was increasingly the goal of several U.S.A.I.D. projects - to help people cope with climate shocks.       </p><p>In Kenya, amid six cycles between 2022 and 2024 of rains that failed to arrive on time, U.S.A.I.D. projects helped local farmer cooperatives get fast-growing seeds that could grow with little water: amaranth, beans, green gram. The orders to stop this work, aid workers said, would be felt immediately.       </p><p>\"People will be measurably less able to cope with climate shocks,\" said one aid-agency staff member who asked not to be identified out of concern over retaliation against the aid group. \"In some cases, people will die of hunger.\"       </p><p>When a drought was forecast in Ethiopia, U.S.A.I.D. projects helped vaccinate animals and encouraged pastoralist communities to sell their animals while they were still healthy. Several agricultural researchers in American universities received U.S.A.I.D. money to develop more nutritious, higher-yielding seeds that could better withstand heat and unpredictable rains.       </p><p>Water programs were a big part of U.S.A.I.D.'s climate-resilience portfolio.

Specifically, global climate finance flows to the sector must increase by a factor of 40.

This disparity is particularly alarming given the sector's significant contribution to and mitigation of climate change.<br/></p><p><br/>To bridge this funding gap, the international community must significantly scale up climate finance for the agrifood sector.

Dr. Chiavari delivered an eye-opening keynote on the economic costs of climate change. He illustrated the dramatic growth of global GDP since the industrial revolution, juxtaposing this with the environmental toll of fossil fuel consumption and rising CO2 emissions. Chiavari highlighted the critical importance of the social cost of carbon in shaping effective policies.</p><p>Central to his message was the concept of the social cost of carbon, which quantifies the broader societal costs of emissions. \"Carbon taxation is not just an environmental necessity but also an economic one,\" he asserted. Dr. Chiavari explained how such measures could create the economic incentives needed to steer both corporations and individuals toward sustainable choices. \"Well, think again yourself,\" Chiavari added. \"Turning on the radiator, your benefit is the same as before-having a warmer room. But now your cost is much higher than before.\"</p><p>Expanding on this point, Dr. Chiavari emphasised that carbon taxation is designed to target carbon emissions rather than energy consumption itself. \"Carbon taxation taxes carbon, it doesn't tax energy,\" he explained. \"So it creates huge incentives for the private sector, for people, for you, for us, for me, to move from fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy. It's not just about reducing energy or output; it creates huge incentives to switch towards alternative energy sources.\"</p><p>Building on this foundation, the panel discussion delved deeper into the practicalities of aligning economic growth with climate resilience, moderated by Dr. Banu Demir Pakel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bridging Policy, Finance, and Action Through a Panel of Perspectives</emphasis>The panel discussion explored the complex interplay between economic growth and climate resilience. Each panellist brought distinct expertise to the conversation, offering fresh perspectives on how global systems can adapt to these twin imperatives.</p><p>Dr. Chiavari emphasised the global nature of addressing climate change, highlighting that emissions transcend borders and require a coordinated international response. He discussed the risks of carbon leakage, where stringent climate policies in one country could lead to emissions being displaced to regions with weaker regulations, ultimately undermining global progress. To mitigate this, Chiavari advocated for policies that foster international collaboration and innovation, ensuring that transitions to sustainable practices are both equitable and comprehensive.</p><p>Dr. Ranger highlighted the economic opportunities that can emerge from climate action, stating, \"This is not just about costs, it's about opportunities.\" Articulating the potential to create jobs and stimulate economic growth while addressing climate risks, Dr. Ranger also stressed the importance of reshaping public narratives. She underscored that effective climate action can foster innovation and progress without imposing a significant financial burden. She also advocates for redirecting fossil fuel and other environmentally damaging subsidies, which globally amount to up to $7 trillion annually, towards green investments, such as renewable energy.</p><p>Leveraging his extensive experience in financial markets, Barrett emphasised the importance of aligning market incentives with sustainability goals. He shared a frank assessment of the sector's challenges in embracing sustainability, underscoring the profit-driven nature of financial institutions: \"The financial market is driven by the need to make money-whether that's for its shareholders or investors.\" Barrett highlighted the critical need for governments to create enforceable regulatory frameworks, noting that this alignment is essential to channel the sector's influence towards meaningful climate action.</p><p>On the topic of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks, Barrett expressed concern over their current implementation, noting, \"ESG has become a tick-box exercise.\" He called for stronger policies that ensure accountability and deliver measurable impact, rather than simply meeting superficial compliance standards.</p><p>During a discussion on climate \"clubs\", Barrett highlighted the risks of fragmented global efforts. He cautioned, \"For these initiatives to succeed, they need to include all major players. Otherwise, the emissions reductions achieved in some regions could be offset by increased emissions elsewhere.\" This, he warned, could undermine the collective progress necessary to address climate challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What Practical Steps Should Governments, Businesses, and Individuals Take to Build a Sustainable Economic Future That Feels Attainable and Secure for Everyone?</emphasis></p><p>Separately, the moderator and panellists were interviewed to expand on this crucial question, providing diverse perspectives on the collaborative roles of governments, businesses, and individuals in addressing climate challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Role of Governments: Policies and Planning</emphasis>Dr. Demir Pakel emphasised the importance of education and awareness in addressing climate change, particularly the role of governments in driving change. \"The government's role is to start with increasing awareness,\" she explained, stressing the need for early education about the consequences of climate change. She highlighted the need for policies that not only incentivise the private sector but also guide consumer behaviour, noting, \"It's a complex network where governments hold the primary responsibility for planning and guiding action at every level.\"</p><p>\"The private sector needs incentives to be able to take action because they will definitely look shorter-term compared to the government. Therefore, their behaviour needs to be changed, and the government has another role: implementing policies to change the behaviour of both the private sector and consumers,\" she added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Market Incentives and Carbon Taxation</emphasis>Dr. Chiavari reinforced the need for government-led interventions, particularly through carbon taxation, as a means to correct market failures. He explained that by incorporating the societal cost of emissions into energy prices, governments can encourage more responsible consumption and investment decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changing the Narrative: A Positive Transition</emphasis>Dr. Ranger reflected on the current challenges in climate action, echoing that a significant part of the problem lies in awareness. \"At the moment, something is going wrong, and I think a lot of that is about the awareness side,\" she noted. \"Governments play a role, but the government fundamentally does what the public will vote for. And a lack of awareness of the immediate benefits of a green energy transition-for energy security and public health-is a key problem at the moment.\"</p><p>Ranger criticised that the narrative surrounding climate change has failed in recent years by framing it as a costly and burdensome challenge. \"Particularly the narrative is this is going to cost a lot of money to deal with. I don't agree with that view and it is not supported by the evidence. You know, we have to make hard decisions, but what we know is that right now the way we are approaching this is making it harder-specifically, a lack of certainty from government on its policies stalls investment and increases the costs. All the evidence shows that if we get the right policies in place and set a clear path for investors, a just transition is both the lowest cost and more beneficial pathway,\" she said.</p><p>Pointing to fossil fuel subsidies, she highlighted how their redirection could catalyse a positive transition. \"Globally, we pump so much money into fossil fuel subsidies-estimates range from five to seven trillion dollars a year. If you stopped that and put it into clean technologies, we would have solved the problem.\"</p><p>To address this, Ranger called for a shift in public discourse to emphasise the economic opportunities inherent in climate action. She stressed the role of academics and experts in reshaping the narrative, saying, \"We need to make sure people understand this is a positive transition. Through good government policy, the impact on individuals will not be significant and would actually boost job growth and innovation.\"</p><p>Ranger concluded by urging governments to take the lead in changing this narrative, saying, \"What I'd really like to see is governments getting behind this and saying, 'Look, this is what's going to happen. It's going to benefit you. Here is the pathway. This is what both investors and the public need.'\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Role of Businesses and Individuals: Accountability and Innovation</emphasis>Barrett provided a candid perspective on the role of businesses and individuals in climate action. He highlighted the financial sector's profit-driven nature, cautioning that it would not lead sustainability efforts without clear regulatory frameworks. \"Financial markets will not do it on their own. They need to be incentivised to act,\" he stated. \"Once the financial sector is pointed in a direction and gets enthusiastic about a topic, it can accomplish incredible things, but it requires clear policy and incentives to get there.\"</p><p>Barrett also reflected on the role of individuals as voters and consumers, stressing that their choices can significantly influence policy and corporate behaviour. \"Policy needs to be much better at educating the voter about what it wants and how it should expect that to come about,\" he remarked. By prioritising sustainable practices and holding policymakers accountable, individuals can drive systemic change.</p><p>While critical of superficial measures such as \"tick-box\" ESG frameworks, Barrett maintained an optimistic outlook on the potential of finance. \"Finance can be incredibly innovative,\" he noted. \"It can move mountains and solve real problems, but it needs the right incentives and honest conversations about what's at stake.\" He called for a shift from short-term political cycles to forward-looking strategies, urging all stakeholders to embrace the long-term effort required to address the climate crisis effectively.</p><p>To watch the full session of WERD's \"Macroeconomics and Climate\" episode, including the keynote and panel discussion, please visit<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zgk2x9RfHYRyPMxEbH9bnqKK24kHLapekul6itD1i7OX_F1MejOJGl45RSHmPaIYNr_XxcEMguLvl2EyYBUeUh3av_5rYssRlo28mSWqD0JcDgEYfoZg8rv6gBNZrYSBZCoWmfrEgxqCZI63MQOmzX8RL8bh9FQj9pr7Rw2lyVgQrIDWhWXKsTFM9nJaw4HQh-5I4LujK5rJDc-EB0F8Xik4u-Zjvq6daANI1fpnyKtDk_IpPh7q5Twu3QRke5EJnpUTtgLzAeYcqOD9G-V0mjwQ0FJslf-boSB2kTM10Q_kyu9x19ttgCL-DujLK8HY4uI_wZgcW3LGOd0vq3pyIBhat0M66aBf36n-uK_XHyDX16SeqrTrn3UwLJ5CFcaiEM5A-iSdxG__ERBTGTBSxY8BbZmr8VVHQ5fwu-ig6YTx6pJhijPenUk1yyzHaKCxiQMs7irg3mdTrgl9nuP5oFwZHdM86UzX3u9o4uGREbwi7mpUEOrHZfzg6Qy2Ss6nBr-ZAiwJd92FEt7M1RYxV5-WLiHgH2XEIdXUqvVBGw0GnSmoA9i7IC654_lbR0Beok648v8USvg9Vxxbz6mOiVnAatAKXdPqPNZygI_BPWOe6V9GHHx7TMhkw2-0rYj0\">https://youtu.be/MD5vaMjQdkc.</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About EBC Financial Group</emphasis>Founded in the esteemed financial district of London, EBC Financial Group (EBC) is renowned for its comprehensive suite of services that includes financial brokerage, asset management, and comprehensive investment solutions.

They include programs that provide medicine, shelter and clean water in dire conditions and often make the difference between life and death.       </p><p>Uncertain of whether they can pay salaries or get any future funding, groups around the world said they are starting to lay off employees or furlough them. In the United States alone, tens of thousands of employees, many of whom live in the Washington area and rely on contract work with U.S. agencies, could lose their jobs. Some have already been laid off.       </p><p>Leaders of aid groups say they have never seen such an expansive and damaging directive, even during periods of aid reassessment by earlier administrations. Many of them are scrambling to contact lawmakers and other U.S. officials to get urgent messages to Mr. Rubio. They said some programs will be hard to restart after a temporary shutdown, and many could disappear.       </p><p>The State Department said the move was aimed at ensuring that all foreign aid programs \"are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\" On Tuesday, as the outcry from aid groups grew, Mr. Rubio issued a memo saying \"life-saving humanitarian assistance\" - including the provision of medicine, medical services, food and shelter - could continue temporarily, and that groups could apply for other waivers. None of that can include abortions, transgender surgeries or diversity work, he wrote.       </p><p>The crisis had deepened on Monday evening, when Jason Gray, the acting head of the United States Agency for International Development, put about 60 top officials on paid leave. He wrote in an email that those officials had taken actions \"designed to circumvent the president's executive orders.\" On Tuesday, office workers removed photographs of leaders from the walls. Hundreds of contractors have also been fired or put on leave.       </p><p>Mr. Rubio said in a cable to U.S. missions abroad that the halt would last at least through a 90-day assessment period. But U.S. officials have already told some aid groups that certain programs, including ones that promote diversity, women's reproductive rights and climate resilience, will be permanently cut.       </p><p>U.S. agencies will need to break contracts during the halt, and they will likely need to pay fees. Among the U.S.A.I.D. employees put on paid leave are three lawyers, including the lead ethics lawyer, according to one person briefed on the situation.       </p><p>The executive order halting foreign aid was the president's first major foreign policy action, and many aid groups are only now understanding its broad scope. Foreign assistance money generally supports humanitarian, development and security programs, and it makes up less than 1 percent of the government budget.       </p><p>Two Democratic members of the House, Gregory Meeks of New York and Lois Frankel of Florida, sent Mr. Rubio a letter on Saturday saying that lives were being \"placed at risk\" because of the aid halt. \"Congress has appropriated and cleared these funds for use, and it is our constitutional duty to make sure these funds are spent as directed,\" they wrote.       </p><p>The stop order applies to most military and security assistance programs, including in Ukraine, Taiwan and Jordan. Much of that aid is disbursed by the State Department. Military aid to Israel and Egypt is exempted, as is emergency food assistance.       </p><p>Mr. Trump's decision to halt foreign aid could cause long-term damage to U.S. strategic interests, critics of the action say. Policymakers from both parties have long regarded foreign aid as a potent form of American power, a way to increase  U.S. influence overseas using a tiny budget compared with military spending. Many development programs support democracy, education and civil rights efforts.       </p><p>In recent years, China has tried to win more global influence with development projects, and it could gain ground as the United States retreats.       </p><p>\"This 90-day stop-work is a gift to our enemies and competitors - with effects that go beyond the immediate harms to people,\" said Dr. Atul Gawande, the assistant administrator for global health at U.S.A.I.D. in the Biden administration.       </p><p>\"It trashes our alliances with scores of countries built over half a century, trashes our world-leading expertise and capacity and threatens our security,\" he said.       </p><p>Dr. Gawande noted that U.S.A.I.D. has the largest footprint abroad after the military, employing hundreds of thousands of contractors, who will now be dismissed or put on leave.       </p><p>Some former officials say a goal of the action could be to dismantle U.S.A.I.D. and move its work to the State Department - while keeping the total aid amount paltry. The Trump appointee at the State Department overseeing foreign aid is Pete Marocco, a divisive figure  in the first Trump administration who worked at the Pentagon, State Department and U.S.A.I.D. At the aid agency, employees filed a 13-page dissent memo, accusing him of mismanagement. Senior State Department officials can exercise authority over U.S.A.I.D., though the agency usually operates autonomously.       </p><p>Some of U.S.A.I.D.'s critical work is listed on its website. One document says that during the civil war in Sudan, a United Nations agency relied on U.S. government support to screen about 5.1 million children age 5 and under for malnutrition, and it provided about 288,000 children with lifesaving treatment last year between January and October.       </p><p>Smaller groups will struggle to survive. China Labor Watch, a New York-based group with overseas offices that aims to end forced labor and trafficking of Chinese workers, is shutting down programs that rely on $900,000 of annual aid from the State Department, said Li Qiang, the organization's founder. Seven staff employees will be placed on unpaid leave and could depart for good, Mr. Li said, adding that employees who lose their work visas might have to return to China, where they could be scrutinized by security officers.       </p><p>Groups worldwide that have relied on U.S. funding are now \"victims of this disruption, leading to distrust in the U.S. government,\" he said.       </p><p>He continued: \"This will further isolate the U.S. internationally. Damaging national credibility and alienating allies for short-term gains will have lasting repercussions.\"       </p><p>The clampdown also cripples the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, the celebrated program started by President George W. Bush that is credited with saving more than 25 million lives. A shutdown of the program would likely cost millions of lives in the coming years, health experts said. The program's work involves more than 250,000 health workers in 54 countries.       </p><p>\"When the funding stops before the epidemic is under control, you erode the investments you've made in the past,\" said Dr. Linda-Gail Bekker, who heads the Desmond Tutu H.I.V. Center at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.       </p><p>Simultaneously, Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization has prompted that group to tighten its belt, curtailing travel and limiting operations on the ground.       </p><p>On Sunday night, employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to immediately stop communicating with W.H.O. staff. and other international partners.       </p><p>The blackout means American officials are likely to lose access to information about human outbreaks, including of mpox, polio and the emerging mosquito-borne disease Oropouche, and animal diseases, like swine flu, that could devastate the nation's agricultural industry, Dr. Gawande said.       </p><p>U.S.A.I.D. has helped to contain 11 serious outbreaks of Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers in the last four years. One such disease, Marburg, is smoldering even now in Tanzania, with 15 confirmed cases and eight probable cases. Ten people have died.       </p><p>\"This is a disease with no test, no treatment and no vaccine that's been approved,\" Dr. Gawande said.       </p><p>On Monday, Trump administration officials instructed organizations abroad to stop distributing H.I.V. medications that were purchased with U.S. aid money, even if the drugs are already in clinics.       </p><p>Separately, officials worldwide were told that PEPFAR's data systems would be shut down on Monday evening and that they should \"prioritize copying key documents and data,\" according to an email viewed by The New York Times. The system was maintained by a contractor forced to stop work because of the aid freeze.       </p><p>About 90 percent of Dr. Bekker's work in South Africa is funded by PEPFAR and the National Institutes of Health. Her team has helped to test H.I.V. medications and preventive drugs, and vaccines for Covid and human papillomavirus, or HPV, all of which are used in the United States.       </p><p>Shutting down PEPFAR, which accounts for 20 percent of South Africa's H.I.V. budget, would add more than a half million new H.I.V. infections and more than 600,000 related deaths in the country over the next decade, Dr. Bekker and her colleagues have estimated. The effect is likely to be far worse in poorer countries, like Mozambique, where PEPFAR funds the bulk of H.I.V. programs.       </p><p>Abruptly halting treatment can endanger patients' lives, but it can also increase spread of the virus and lead to resistance to the available drugs.       </p><p>The Trump administration's actions will cause long-lasting harm, including to Americans, said Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap.       </p><p>\"If you're trying to achieve a review of all foreign assistance, including PEPFAR, you can do that without attacking the programs through stopping them,\" Ms. Russell said.       </p><p>\"It's extraordinarily dangerous and perhaps deadly to do it this way,\" she said, \"but it's also wasteful and inefficient.\" </p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["But U.

As we approach another round of climate negotiations (COP27 in Egypt), India and the European Union will continue to negotiate longstanding issues of finance and technology. But there is also an opportunity now for both parties to find common ground and define common purpose on climate resilience.</p><p>It is evident that the Earth is warming at an alarming pace with consequences for all regions. Globally, August 2022 was Earth\u2019s sixth warmest in 143 years. For Europe and North America, this was the warmest August on record; fourth warmest for Asia.</p><p>India has already experienced extremes this year, including the hottest summer since 1901 and the warmest March on record. The Indian Meteorological Department issued heatwave warnings for at least five states. World Weather Attribution estimates that the probability of such an event in 2022 has risen by a factor of around thirty thanks to climate change. From long dry spells, India also witnessed one of the wettest Octobers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mean temperature over land across Europe has risen by 1.94\u00b0C to 2.01\u00b0C from the pre-industrial period, according to the European Environmental Agency. In 2022, nearly all countries and more than 60 per cent of the European continent were impacted by varying degrees of drought, when such conditions were not expected before 2050. Studies estimate that the UK is now 10 times more likely to reach 40\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era. Temperatures also exceeded 40\u00b0C in France, 45\u00b0C in Spain and 46\u00b0C in Portugal, with Belgium witnessing its warmest August since measurements began in 1833. More than 660,000 hectares of forests have burned since January.</p><p>The climate crisis is not only about heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. Those are the direct impacts. The wider challenges emerge on four counts, namely human security, food security, infrastructure impacts, and macroeconomic pressures. It is also important to recognise efforts being made to build resilience.</p><p>First, extreme weather continues to have fatal consequences, impacting lives and livelihoods. But India has managed to use early warning systems to save lives. While the Super Cyclone in Odisha in 1999 cost about 10000 lives, Super Cyclone Amphan in 2020 (of similar intensity) resulted in fewer than 100 deaths in India. This year, more than 1.3 million people were evacuated from Assam, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh due to a sporadic and intensive monsoon season. This is a huge administrative effort but is certainly not costless.</p><p>Drought conditions in Punjab, UP, Bihar and Jharkhand severely impacted cropland and killed livestock. Furthermore, extreme heat conditions this summer destroyed 10-15 per cent of wheat crops in north India. Although India is food surplus and a food exporter, agricultural shocks increase food price inflation hitting the poor the hardest and creates policy dilemmas over continuing exports. In France, the corn harvest reduced by almost 18.5 per cent compared to 2021 and wheat yield was also significantly lower, due to the driest July. France is currently Europe\u2019s third-largest wheat exporter after Russia and Ukraine, so reductions in output threaten food security elsewhere.</p><p>Governments can no longer claim extreme events as unforeseeable and must adopt national and sub-national climate action plans. Nineteen states in India have developed state heat-action plans, with more on the way. Maharashtra plans to modify market hours, provide public shelters, sprinkle mist in public places, and keep ice bags at public health centres. Ahmedabad city\u2019s heat action plan includes best practices on warning systems and heat adaptation. Karnataka state\u2019s plan includes warnings about when to break from all outdoor work. In July 2022 Tamil Nadu launched district-level climate change missions across its 38 districts.</p><p>In the last three years, India has incurred damages worth USD 7.2 billion \u2014 equivalent to nearly a third of the infrastructure budget for roads and highways \u2014 due to extreme weather events like floods. The real cost is likely to be higher since this figure reflects data from only 70 per cent of states. India aims to invest USD 1.5 trillion in infrastructure (at par with China and Japan) this decade. It is working on plans to develop cyclone-resilient power distribution and transmission infrastructure in its cyclone-affected eastern and western states to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity and support emergency services. Heavily climate-impacted states such as Odisha have already taken measures to minimise Low Tension Network damages through preventive maintenance and precautionary steps.</p><p>Repeated and rising climate shocks also increase the fiscal burden. Odisha on the coast, for instance, has allocated USD 131 million to its environment and climate department this fiscal year, but has had to set aside a larger amount (USD 505 million) for disaster management and flood control. Such distortion in fiscal burden takes resources away from other sustainable infrastructure investments. By one estimate, even before the Paris Agreement, central and state governments in India were already spending about USD 92 billion on various programmes linked to climate adaptation. As climate risks rise, governments will have to find resources to handle immediate shocks as well as invest in long-term resilience.</p><p>With both India and the EU having battled historic climate extremes this year, here are four ways to build climate resilience together.</p><p>First, cooperate on people-centric early warning systems. Hyperlocal risk assessments would help local administrations to understand the exposure of specific geographies to climate extremes and also forecast hazards. Early warning systems, based on credible sources of public communication, would then be needed to empower people to act when disasters strike, including forming groups of first responders. Early warning is also a tool to improve administrative preparedness and could help mitigate infrastructure and economic losses.</p><p>Secondly, regulatory authorities in Europe and India can collaborate to build a robust system of climate risk disclosures for businesses and financial institutions. Several major economies are making regulatory changes for firms announcing net zero. Disclosure requirements in the EU, India (but also China, Japan, the UK and proposed in the US) could benefit from less fragmentation and more coherence. A dialogue is needed among major economies on the issue of net zero regulation, but also with a view to having standardised metrics for assessing exposure to climate risks.</p><p>Thirdly, the EU should actively engage as a member of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which India has promoted. CDRI\u2019s scope includes risk and resilience assessments, technical standards for resilient infrastructure, and sectoral focus on power, airports and telecoms. For every dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure, six dollars can be saved. The International Labour Organization also estimates that each million dollars invested in climate- and disaster-resilient infrastructure can create more than 650 jobs. Resilient infrastructure can reduce the extent of loss and damage, enhance adaptative capacity, and facilitate faster economic recovery.</p><p>Fourthly, to manage the macroeconomic shocks induced by climate change, the EU and India along with other major economies should promote a Global Resilience Reserve Fund. Capitalised via Special Drawing Rights, such a fund could serve as a cushion against the shocks that extreme climate events impose on vulnerable economies. India\u2019s G20 presidency offers an opportunity to begin work on creating such a buffer for macroeconomic stability.</p><p>Climate change is the second greatest challenge facing humanity. The greatest challenge is a lack of empathy, a lack of understanding of the conditions of fellow humans in another geography. 2022 has reminded us of the common dangers we face yet shown how even the most vulnerable are fighting back. Once it ignites a sense of empathy, Europe can find common cause with India\u2019s responses. Together, both economic powers can pave a path of collective resilience on which others can follow.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Into this milieu comes the continuing challenges posed by climate change.

Early diplomatic roots</p><p>Botchwey's diplomatic experience began during the administration of former president John Kufuor, serving as deputy minister for foreign affairs in 2006. She later held deputy roles in information, trade and industry. Her work helped streamline consular services and introduced digital solutions for more efficient passport and consular operations.</p><p>Ghana: 400% hike in passport fee sparks outcry amid rising living costs</p><p>2. A historic and unusual swearing-in</p><p>Botchwey was ceremoniously sworn into office as Ghana's foreign minister while on an official visit to Ethiopia in 2017. The event took place at Ghana's embassy in Addis Ababa during the 28th African Union Summit, a unique setting that highlighted her dedication to duty. She is the only Ghanaian minister sworn into office on external soil.</p><p>3. A seasoned diplomat and politician</p><p>The new Commonwealth head has spent decades working across various high-profile roles that span international diplomacy and national governance. She has had a cordial relationship with President Nana Akufo-Addo since early 2000. Botchwey learned under his tutelage when he served as Kufuor's second foreign minister in 2003.</p><p>As Akufo-Addo's deputy, she got a substantial role when Akufo-Addo became president, serving as one of his longest-serving ministers since 2017. She has shied away from getting involved too much in domestic politics, but is known as a pro-Mahamudu Bawumia (the flagbearer of the ruling NPP) supporter.</p><p>Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia on edge as Africa fraught with default risks</p><p>4. The Oslo controversy\u00a0</p><p>Botchwey's tenure as foreign minister saw its share of controversies, particularly surrounding an attempted acquisition of a chancery building for Ghana in Oslo, Norway. The proposed purchase drew allegations from the opposition regarding an inflated valuation and concerns over transparency.</p><p>The issue quickly became a talking point, prompting Botchwey to clarify the government's position and defend the deal, emphasising efforts towards due diligence and cost management. The Oslo episode remains a notable chapter in her career, showcasing both the challenges and scrutiny faced in her public service.</p><p>Why not speak to populists about self interest? Norway's development minister wants to try</p><p>5. A near-brawl in parliament\u00a0</p><p>Botchwey's political journey is marked by moments of fierce dedication, none more memorable than her near-brawl in Ghana's parliament in December 2018. After an intense session, Botchwey engaged in a heated exchange with opposition members at the Speaker's lobby, furious over bringing the Oslo issue to the plenary on her blind side. MPs had to intervene to calm tempers when she confronted opposition lawmaker Sam George who was filming the heated exchanges with his phone.</p><p>6. Pioneering leadership in West Africa</p><p>As chair of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers from 2020 to 2022, Botchwey led crucial responses to political instability in the region. Overseeing diplomatic engagements with military-led regimes in countries like Guinea and Burkina Faso, she worked to negotiate transitions back to democracy. Her tenure saw reforms in ECOWAS, including budget optimisation and policy updates to address regional security threats, especially in the Sahel.</p><p>Has ECOWAS put the eco single currency back on track?</p><p>7. A four-term parliamentarian</p><p>Representing two of Ghana's largest constituencies, Weija and later Anyaa-Sowutuom, Botchwey served 16 years in parliament, particularly advocating for local development and youth empowerment. She held positions on committees related to foreign affairs, defence, communications and gender, making her a well-rounded legislator with a balanced focus on national and international priorities.</p><p>8. A voice for Africa at the United Nations</p><p>During Ghana's two-year term on the UN Security Council in 2023, Botchwey was instrumental in pushing through Resolution 27/19, allowing UN funding for AU-led peace operations. 'What we achieved during that period was very important. This resolution ensured for the first time UN funding for Africa-led peacekeeping support operations,' she said in an earlier interview. 'Also, under my leadership, Ghana teamed up with Norway to have the UN pass a resolution at the security council to criminalise piracy and armed robbery at sea.'</p><p>Somali pirates resurface, disrupting maritime routes</p><p>9. Visionary for 'The Year of Return'</p><p>Botchwey played a significant role in Ghana's 'Year of Return' campaign in 2019, an initiative commemorating 400 years since the transatlantic slave trade. This movement attracted international interest and investment, strengthening Ghana's cultural and economic ties with the African diaspora, especially in the Americas, and was critical in reestablishing Ghana as a symbolic home for descendants of African slaves.</p><p>Documenting Ghana's 'Year of Return' in a genre-defying novel</p><p>10. A life beyond politics</p><p>Outside of her official duties, Botchwey, a staunch Anglican, is a mother of two and has a background in marketing and communications, owning and running a firm before entering politics. Her academic credentials include an Executive MBA from the University of Ghana Business School, an LLB and a Master's in Public Communication, equipping her with a strong foundation in governance and law.</p><p>Her professional versatility and personal dedication make her a multifaceted leader ready to take on the Commonwealth's diverse challenges.</p>", "publisher": "The Africa Report", "instances": ["A lot of work lies ahead.

The constraints weighing on the continent's policy options have never been more visible. Traditional funding models are becoming obsolete, caught in the intersection of climate and development imperatives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is becoming clear that the distinction between climate financing and development financing no longer makes sense. This artificial separation, deeply rooted in the practices of international financial institutions and development agencies, obscures the true nature of the challenges African countries face.</p><p>The reality is simple: it is now impossible to plan development without integrating climate considerations, just as it is unthinkable to consider climate strategies without addressing fundamental development needs, such as infrastructure, poverty reduction and job creation. Yet the legacy of separate funding perpetuates a fragmented approach that fails to allocate resources according to real needs.</p><p>This disconnect has serious consequences for Africa, where limited access to liquidity and capital markets has always constrained countries' ability to invest independently in climate resilience and sustainable development.</p><p>The missing link in sustainable development</p><p>The real obstacle for Africa is not a lack of ambition, commitment or even planning capacity, but rather insufficient access to liquidity. Unlike more prosperous regions, African countries have never benefitted from robust capital markets capable of supporting large-scale, long-term investments. Instead, they have relied on external borrowing at prohibitive rates, concessional financing and development aid.</p><p>In the context of climate financing, this dependency has only deepened inequalities. Africa, which accounts for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, bears a disproportionate burden of climate impacts while struggling to access the liquidity needed to meet both its development goals and climate ambitions.</p><p>International financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have proposed reforms, but these are far too timid and do not address the root of the problem.</p><p>The discourse surrounding the 'leverage' of private financing and hybrid financing - where public funds are used to attract private investments - is presented as a miracle solution for developing countries, but this model is fundamentally flawed. It creates the illusion that adequate funds are available while merely redistributing existing resources. In doing so, it forces African governments to absorb investment risks without actually generating new liquidity.</p><p>These financing methods compel African countries to choose projects that appeal to private investors, at the expense of those truly necessary for structural transformation.</p><p>The illusion of the carbon market</p><p>The carbon market is touted as a solution for African countries. In theory, it is meant to allow African nations to sell carbon credits generated by forest preservation or emission reductions to developed countries or companies looking to offset their emissions. But the reality is far more complex.</p><p>These markets remain fragmented, lack transparency and are dominated by interests that do not serve Africa's development. The rules, certification processes and standards of these markets are dictated by developed countries, leaving African nations little control over the value of their credits.</p><p>The burden of emission reduction is placed on the countries that have historically suffered the most from climate change while contributing the least to it. This structure only exacerbates inequalities and limits the potential of carbon markets as a true sustainable development tool for Africa.</p><p>Africa is also encouraged to raise its ambitions within the framework of its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, with the implicit promise that these efforts can be monetised through carbon credit sales. Yet, this remains an illusion. The fragmented nature of carbon markets and the control exercised by opaque intermediaries mean that African countries risk multiplying their commitments without reaping real financial benefits. These markets could therefore become yet another means of exploiting African resources without delivering substantial gains to populations.</p><p>Reinforcing dependency</p><p>New fiscal mechanisms and regulatory requirements introduced by developed countries, such as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and stricter forest protection conditions, pose additional obstacles to the continent's development. These measures impose higher standards on producers, forcing them to bear the compliance costs while consumers in developed countries are exempt from the obligation to subsidise these transformations. This is a classic case of misplaced responsibility: African producers, already facing low prices for their products, must now shoulder the cost of adapting to regulations they did not create.</p><p>The result is a scenario where African countries find themselves trapped. Forced to adopt standards and practices that serve the interests of developed countries without the necessary financial support or market access, they become locked into even greater economic asymmetries. This situation, far from being a means to combat climate change, reinforces dependency and undermines development objectives.</p><p>Another glaring example of the limited choices imposed on Africa is the discourse around energy. While energy security is presented as a pragmatic choice for wealthy nations, access to energy is relegated to a long-term challenge for African countries, which are expected to accommodate this patiently.</p><p>The reality is that Africa's vast natural gas reserves could play a crucial role in funding its transition to clean energy. But African countries are discouraged from exploiting these resources on the grounds that it would increase their carbon footprint, even as developed countries continue to exploit their own without restraint. This double standard clearly illustrates the injustices that characterise the global architecture of climate financing.</p><p>Towards an inclusive financial architecture</p><p>The solution lies in creating a financial architecture that recognises the interdependence of development and climate, giving African countries access to the liquidity needed to drive their own transformation. It is about moving beyond false divides to embrace a holistic approach that tackles the root causes of limited political choices in Africa.</p><p>COP29 presents an opportunity to challenge the status quo and advocate for a more equitable system that allows African nations to define their own development paths.

These are models we are studying closely,' she says.</p><p>Catching up with Singapore or Rotterdam will not be an easy feat: It took Singapore more than five decades to assume the status of an urban city model, but Sackey says Accra has to 'start from somewhere'.</p><p>Waste management</p><p>Arguably, the most pressing issue facing the metropolis is waste management. Accra generates nearly 900,000 metric tonnes of solid waste annually and approximately 2,200 metric tonnes of waste per day, but only about 20% of this is recycled and the rest is dumped at landfill sites.</p><p>At these sites, there is open burning of waste, which affects public health. Scientists have also found that the landfills contribute an average of 44% of methane emissions, ultimately contributing to global warming.</p><p>As part of its global commitment to significantly reducing greenhouse gases, Sackey says the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) is actively promoting source separation of solid waste to make recycling easier. The initiative encourages households and businesses to separate organic waste from dry, recyclable materials.</p><p>'The source separation programme is designed to help us process organic waste into compost, and recycle the dry materials through upcycling. It's a win-win for the environment and green job creation in Accra,' she says.</p><p>Accra is one of over 100 cities around the world collaborating under a C40 Cities initiative that is facilitating collaborations among city mayors to confront the global climate crisis. Leveraging this platform, Sackey recently launched an Informal Waste Corporation Cooperative in Accra to integrate informal waste pickers into the city's waste management system. This is to assist in the collection, transportation and processing of recyclable materials from public spaces.</p><p>Additionally, through the Covenant of Mayors in Sub-Saharan Africa (CoM SSA) and the World Bank's City Climate Finance Gap Fund, the city is exploring the possibility of constructing a compost processing facility and a 400-ton capacity anaerobic digestion plant that will convert organic waste into compressed natural gas for use as energy in domestic cooking and industries.</p><p>'We are working with our partners to secure funding for these and other projects which will not only manage waste efficiently but also contribute to energy sustainability,' Sackey says. 'A lot of these projects, including technical supports from C40 Cities, are with the goal of creating green jobs in Accra and supporting the city's broader sustainability goals.'</p><p>Public transport</p><p>Another focus of Mayor Sackey is public transportation. Besides open burning of waste that pollutes the air, aged commercial vehicles known locally as 'trotro' - which dominate public transport operations within the Accra metropolis - contribute greatly to air pollution.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes 28,000 deaths in Ghana each year, and costs the country $2.5bn in economic loss. Sackey says she and her team are finding ways to improve urban mobility while addressing the climate risks posed by the current transport infrastructure.</p><p>Past government-backed efforts failed to popularise mass transit buses, such as the Metro mass bus transit system and the 'Aayalolo' bus rapid transit system, which sought to discourage the use of private vehicles and reduce congestion within the central business district.</p><p>'We are conducting climate risk assessments to identify the potential impacts on transportation infrastructure and to develop strategies for more resilient urban mobility,' Sackey says, betting on support from the World Bank and the C40 Cities Finance Facility to develop transportation infrastructure.</p><p>Accra's flooding crisis</p><p>The Accra metropolis is low-lying and water runoffs flow downward to it from other municipalities, wreaking havoc in flood-prone areas, including Dansoman and Chorkor, during the heavy rainfall season.</p><p>'The AMA has developed a comprehensive drainage map and an early warning system for flood-prone communities.Education and sensitisation is also key, to keep the drainages free from waste, and free the waterways,' says Sackey.</p><p>In 2017, President Akufo-Addo vowed to make Accra the cleanest city in Africa, but seven years down the line, it remains a pipe dream.</p><p>However, Sackey says: 'I am promoting cleanliness and environmental responsibility... I initiated the street sweepers program to ensure that our city is kept clean on a daily basis, but it is more than just that.

As heat and flooding scorched and scoured the Midwest, a steel railroad bridge connecting Iowa with South Dakota collapsed under surging waters. In Lewiston, Maine, a bridge closed after the pavement buckled from fluctuating temperatures.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's bridges, a quarter of which were built before 1960, were already in need of repair. But now, extreme heat and increased flooding linked to climate change are accelerating the disintegration of the nation's bridges, engineers say, essentially causing them to age prematurely.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result is a quiet but growing threat to the safe movement of people and goods around the country, and another example of how climate change is reshaping daily life in ways Americans may not realize.       </p><p>\"We have a bridge crisis that is specifically tied to extreme weather events,\" said Paul Chinowsky, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder who researches the effects of climate change on infrastructure. \"These are not things that would happen under normal climate circumstances. These are not things that we've ever seen at this rate.\"       </p><p>Bridges designed and built decades ago with materials not intended to withstand sharp temperature swings are now rapidly swelling and contracting, leaving them weakened.       </p><p>\"It's getting so hot that the pieces that hold the concrete and steel, those bridges can literally fall apart like Tinkertoys,\" Dr. Chinowsky said.       </p><p>As temperatures reached the hottest in recorded history this year, much of the nation's infrastructure, from highways to runways, has suffered. But bridges face particular risks.       </p><p>\"With bridges, you're working with infrastructure that may have been planned, designed and built decades ago,\" Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, said in an interview. \"It's one of the forms of infrastructure that takes the longest to update or refresh. And yet we're seeing those vulnerabilities everywhere across the country.\"       </p><p>A study in the journal PLOS ONE found that extreme temperatures resulting from climate change could cause one in four steel bridges in the United States to collapse by 2050. By 2040, failures caused by extreme heat could require widespread bridge repairs and closures, the researchers found.       </p><p>Another study found that exposure to new levels of extreme heat is causing the pavement on American bridges to buckle. Meanwhile, heavy precipitation linked to climate change is increasing the phenomenon of \"bridge scour,\" the erosion of soil sediment around bridge foundations that is the leading cause of bridge failure in the United States, studies show.       </p><p>Troubled bridges are already starting to affect supply chains and the cost of goods. In 2022, a 30-foot section of bridge on the California-Arizona border of Interstate 10, along a major trucking route from Phoenix to the port of Los Angeles, was swept away during record rainfall. That washout followed a 2015 collapse of another Interstate 10 span, the Tex Wash Bridge, during what was described at the time as a 1,000-year flood. Each closure added an estimated $2.5 million per day to trucking costs because of delays and additional fuel, according to the American Transportation Research Institute. Such bridge closures are projected to increase significantly across the country over the coming decade, engineers said.       </p><p>\"With a lot of these bridge closures, trucks have to reroute far more than normal. It adds anywhere from 15 to 100 miles per trip, when a trucking trip typically costs about $91 per hour,\" said Dan Murray, senior vice president of the American Transportation Research Institute. \"And it becomes very inflationary. We're buying the same goods and the unexpected costs get passed on to consumers.\"       </p><p>Bill Minor, 50, a Walmart truck driver who delivers groceries, clothing and electronics from a terminal in Beaver Dam, Wis., to stores in the surrounding region, said he crosses the Lake Butte des Morts Bridge in Oshkosh as many as a dozen times a day. When it closed for a day in June after heat caused a joint in the approach to the bridge to expand, Mr. Minor said that the added detour and traffic meant that he made fewer deliveries and used more fuel.       </p><p>\"The bridge is on an interstate but the detour is country highways, so you're driving through little towns going 25 miles an hour,\" he said.       </p><p>The Biden administration has sought to address the problem. The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law allotted $110 billion for repair and construction of roads, bridges and other major transportation projects. The law included a pioneering program, PROTECT, that provides $7.3 billion divided among states to make facilities and highways more resilient to extreme weather. Another $1.4 billion in competitive grants is also available.       </p><p>In Vermont, where heavy rainfall and heat have combined to damage an estimated 100 bridges over the past two years, the state is rebuilding them higher and wider, with deeper foundations and sturdier materials. And waterways below bridges are being made deeper and wider to be able to absorb more water.       </p><p>But that all takes money and time. It is costing Vermont 30 to 40 percent more to build a more flood resistant bridge, said Jeremy Reed, chief engineer at the state transportation agency.       </p><p>Scientists, engineers and government agencies are only now beginning to develop standards for how to build climate resilient bridges, said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. \"We're learning from the events that are being thrown at us, and trying to change and build for what climate change throws next, but it's a moving target,\" he said.       </p><p>In 2018, Colorado became one of the first states to consider the effects of climate change as it planned its roads and bridges. After a 2013 flood damaged roughly 500 miles of road and 50 bridges in the state, requiring more than $700 million in emergency repairs, the state transportation commission required climate resilience in bridge and road construction.       </p><p>The state asked Hussam Mahmoud, a civil engineer and professor at Colorado State University, to examine increased deterioration and stress in the joints of the state's steel bridges. \"What we saw was drastic,\" Dr. Mahmoud said.       </p><p>For decades, bridge surfaces have been zippered together with fork-teethed expansion joints, embedded into steel and pavement to accommodate normal swelling and contraction with heat and cold.       </p><p>But because of extreme spikes in heat linked to climate change, the joints were swelling more, and more frequently, said Dr. Mahmoud. The problem worsened as overheated joints expanded tightly around the highway debris that typically collects between them. \"Once this happens, the bridge can become permanently damaged,\" he said. \"The steel deforms and twists, the deck cracks, and moisture goes through it and it causes corrosion.\"       </p><p>Swollen joints cause other problems. Steel bridges are designed to gently bend to accommodate heavy loads, but clogged joints keep beams stiff, failing to spread out the load from large trucks.       </p><p>\"That means the beams in the bridge are carrying much more weight than they were designed for,\" Dr. Mahmoud said.       </p><p>Age is usually one of the best predictors of bridge fragility. Engineers generally prioritize bridges for repair and replacement once they are past 50 years old.       </p><p>So Dr. Mahmoud was surprised to find that some Colorado bridges in the worst shape included an 18-year-old bridge over Riverside Canal in Morgan County, a 29-year-old bridge on County Road 501 through Pueblo County, and a 10-year-old bridge on County Road 17 over the Otero Canal in Otero County.       </p><p>All of these bridges were deemed in \"good\" or \"satisfactory\" condition by the Federal Highway Administration's National Bridge Inventory based on inspections between 2020 and 2022.       </p><p>Colorado transportation officials say that, while they now take such research into account as they prioritize what bridges to repair, the state doesn't have the funding for all those improvements. Under the infrastructure law, the state receives $45 million a year in federal funds for bridge repair and is getting $98 million a year from the PROTECT program to help make all of its infrastructure more climate resilient, both through 2026.       </p><p>State officials estimate that Colorado probably needs more than five times as much annually. \"Realistically, we know that's not going to happen,\" said William Johnson, who leads climate resilience programs for the Colorado Department of Transportation. \"We can't replace everything tomorrow to be more resilient, but we are building climate change into the process.\"       </p><p>Dr. Mahmoud expanded his research across the country, using details from the National Bridge Inventory to model the impact of climate change on the beams, decks and girders of 80,000 steel bridges. He found the bridges most at risk were in the Northern Rockies and Plains, the upper Midwest, the Ohio Valley and the South. He also found that smaller bridges, with smaller beams, were more vulnerable to damage, since they are already made to accommodate lighter loads.       </p><p>The bridges in Dr. Mahmoud's database include 1,357 steel bridges in Oklahoma and 575 bridges in North Dakota, among them a 25-year-old bridge over the North Branch Goose River in Traill County, N.D., a 16-year-old bridge on a county highway through Grand Forks County, N.D., and an 11-year-old bridge on E0220 road in Grant County, Okla.</p><p>\"These bridges in these states were designed according to code,\" said Dr. Mahmoud. But because of the unplanned damage induced by climate change, he said, \"we will see the beams on these bridges twisting, concrete coming off, and bridges closing.\"       </p><p>Jason Thorenson, the North Dakota state bridge engineer, said he did not agree that the North Dakota bridges cited by Dr. Mahmoud are at risk. The state receives about $45 million a year from the PROTECT program, he said, \"but I wouldn't say we use that money to address any sort of climate change, because I can't say we're really seeing that.\"       </p><p>Tim Gatz, deputy director of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, said cold as well as heat can stress roads and bridges. \"We have always had a very wide range of weather conditions,\" he said. \"Sometimes extreme cold and sometimes extreme heat.\"       </p><p>Studies show that climate change has caused more rapid shifts between extreme heat and cold, said Royce Floyd, a professor of engineering at the University of Oklahoma. Those seesawing temperatures can cause pavement to squeeze from both sides onto a span, forcing the road and steel to buckle or crack, or even pushing steel beams out of alignment, Dr. Floyd found.       </p><p>That's what happened to at least three major bridges in Oklahoma in recent years, he said. The bridges have since been repaired - without taking into account studies that show the current and future impacts of climate change. But failing to make them hardier means that the buckling could return, Dr. Floyd said.       </p><p>\"If you don't plan for climate change then you're going to end up with the same problems again,\" he said. </p>", "publisher": "The New York Times - International Edition", "instances": ["\"We're learning from the events that are being thrown at us, and trying to change and build for what climate change throws next, but it's a moving target,\" he said.

Over 60% of the population resides in low-lying coastal areas, heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture, increasing the risk to infrastructure and livelihoods. The impacts of climate change have intensified these challenges, leading to significant losses and damages.</p><p>\u201cMuch can be done to reduce the loss of human life and greater harm. Advance notice helps us to do this, to protect ourselves,\u201d the president told the ceremony. Flanked by ministers and senior United Nations and donor government representatives, he applauded the work of WMO and Mozambiques\u2019s National Meteorological and Hydrological Service.</p><p>\u201cMozambique has made great strides towards Early Warnings for All and has a proven track record in saving lives. For instance, Tropical Cyclone Idai in March 2019 led to 603 deaths and cost US$ 3 billion. Record-breaking Tropical Cyclone Freddy in early 2023 claimed 183 lives and US$ 176 million in economic losses,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.</p><p>\u201cTogether, we can build a future where Mozambique is not only prepared for hazardous event but resilient against them.

But when one of the four units broke down in June, the water supply could not meet the demand, leaving some homes and vacation rentals with dry taps for 10 days.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It was a disaster,\" recalled Roula Katselou, 50, a resident of Exambela, one of the largest villages on the island. \"We could not shower, cook or clean. We had to carry buckets of water from our neighbors who had cisterns and buy bottled water to wash the children.\"       </p><p>Nikos Galatas, 37, was renting out his parents' vacation home to an Italian couple when the water was cut, and after reserves in his water tank ran out, the couple moved to another part of the island.       </p><p>\"I lost a lot of money because they had booked the house for 12 days,\" Mr. Galatas said. \"And it was very stressful to find a suitable alternative when so many of the accommodations were booked up.\"       </p><p>Even after the malfunctioning desalination unit was fixed, water cuts persisted as visitor numbers soared, reaching nearly 40,000 arrivals in August alone.       </p><p>Water scarcity is becoming the next battleground in overtourism, as residents in places like Barcelona, Spain; Casablanca, Morocco; Mexico City; and Sicily, grapple with the impacts of climate change and compete with tourists to get their share of the dwindling supply. Fearful of deterring visitors, governments dependent on tourism dollars are reluctant to impose restrictions on hotels and restaurants. In Sicily, for example, the local authorities have admitted to prioritizing water supply to hotels, and earlier this year in Barcelona, only residents, not tourists, faced water restrictions.       </p><p>Now Greece is facing the same dilemma as authorities scramble to enact measures to prevent future disruptions.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'We have reached our limit'</emphasis></p><p>The situation is particularly alarming on the Greek islands, many of which do not have the infrastructure to absorb tens of thousands of tourists. This year, Greece is on track to receive 35 million visitors, a 7 percent increase from 2023, according to the National Bank of Greece. Some islands are feeling the crush. From June and August this year, Sifnos, for example, received more than 100,000 tourists, up from 67,000 in 2014.       </p><p>Sifnos, along with islands like Crete, Kefalonia, Leros and Serifos, declared a state of emergency this summer after wells and reservoirs dried up, leaving residents dependent on desalination units, which are expensive to obtain and run. Some residents of Sifnos became so concerned that they hoarded water from the municipal network by filling up cisterns designed to collect rain.       </p><p>\"We have reached our limit,\" said Manolis Foutoulakis, the deputy mayor in charge of water supply in Sifnos. \"During the tourism peak in August, I was watching the water levels go down and down and signing the cross, praying that we would get by.\"       </p><p>Mr. Foutoulakis said the island would not have enough water if there is another drought next summer and tourist numbers surge. He has requested another desalination unit from the government, but it could take up to two years to receive it.       </p><p>\"We welcome tourists, but if we have no water, we will have no choice but to send them away,\" Mr. Foutoulakis said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New measures</emphasis></p><p>In Greece, where tourism accounts for about a fifth of the country's economy, discontent is building on oversaturated islands like Santorini and Mykonos, with protests calling for curbs on tourism, particularly cruise ships, which disgorge hundreds, often thousands, of visitors at once.       </p><p>This month, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece announced new measures to tackle overtourism, including a 20 euro (about $22) tax for cruise ship passengers visiting Santorini and Mykonos in the summer, and an increase to a new \"climate resilience fee\" to rebuild infrastructure damaged by climate change. The government is expected to announce further restrictions to cap the number of cruise ship arrivals in those destinations.       </p><p>But overcrowding is only a part of the problem, local officials say. One of the biggest challenges the islands have faced since the pandemic is the development of hotels and vacation villas, which strain water supplies with their gardens and swimming pools. Maria Nadali, the mayor of Sifnos, said many properties overconsume water, but in the absence of a centralized water management plan, the island was tackling the issue alone and did not have the resources to regulate consumption.       </p><p>\"The new constructions are required to have water tanks,\" Ms. Nadali said, but \"some of them put a door and window on the tanks and make them into tourist rooms to rent.\" She added, \"It is a big problem because the municipality then has to supply water to these properties outside of the residential zones.\"       </p><p>Elissavet Feloni, an adjunct lecturer at the department of Surveying and Geoinformatics Engineering at the University of West Attica, in Aigaleo, Greece, said many new hotels have expansive lawns and gardens that are not suitable for dry islands. \"We should promote gray water recycling to reuse water for irrigation and generally nonpotable purposes,\" she said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lots of heat, little rain: 'An explosive cocktail'</emphasis></p><p>The summer of 2024 was the hottest in Greece's recorded history, according to the National Observatory of Athens. This year, after a warm winter with limited precipitation, temperatures started to soar as early as March.       </p><p>\"The amount of water that one consumes is highly dependent on the temperature in the country,\" said Dimitrios Emmanouloudis, the UNESCO chair on conservation and ecotourism of riparian and deltaic ecosystems. \"You need less water when it's 82 degrees than when it's 104. Then add the increase in demand brought by tourists. It's an explosive cocktail that brought the situation to a head.\"       </p><p>Beyond the islands, the reservoirs that supply water to Athens have been hit hard by climate change, with Lake Mornos, the largest reservoir, at its lowest level in 16 years, exposing the ruins of the village of Kallio, which was submerged in 1980. The capital's water reserves are currently at 656,653 million cubic meters, down from 1.1 billion cubic meters in September 2022, according to the Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company.       </p><p>Dry conditions and high winds also created perfect conditions for wildfires, with numerous blazes across the country - including one that reached the suburbs of Athens - adding further pressure on the water supply.       </p><p>In late June, on the small island of Serifos, which is adjacent to Sifnos, a large wildfire destroyed houses and severely damaged the water infrastructure. \"We consumed a significant amount of water in order to put out the fire,\" said Konstantinos Revinthis, the mayor of Serifos, who declared a state of emergency for four consecutive months because of the water shortages. The island is conducting research on replacing its water infrastructure, which, Mr. Revinthis said, is antiquated.       </p><p>Preparing for prolonged shortages, the Greek government announced measures last week to tackle the issue, including drilling for groundwater, desalination and repairing water networks. Theodoros Skylakakis, the environment and energy minister, warned that limits to consumption may be introduced, but until then, regardless of availability, people should use water sparingly.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A matter of greed?</emphasis></p><p>While island governments printed pamphlets and urged hotels and other accommodations to brief tourists about water consumption - encouraging them to take quick showers and use bowls of water for washing up instead of letting the water run - many visitors remained unaware of the issue.       </p><p>Tristan Keller, 43, a lawyer from Miami who was recently on vacation with his girlfriend on Serifos, said the water pressure in their Airbnb had been low, but they didn't realize there was a shortage. \"It's amazing that a place surrounded by so much water doesn't have enough,\" he said.       </p><p>When the desalination unit on Sifnos broke down in June, Yorgos Vassalos, 63, the owner of a local market, recalled how tourists who came to buy bottled water were shocked that there was no solution to the water cuts.       </p><p>\"Even when the water came back, it was on and off and it was brown and reddish in color, which concerned the tourists,\" Mr. Vassalos said. \"They bought big bottles of water so that they could wash themselves.\"       </p><p>Flora Manou, an islander, warned that Sifnos was taking in more tourists than it could handle and putting pressure on natural resources.       </p><p>\"Tourists are very welcome, but some people are becoming greedy, turning every part of the island into a hotel,\" she said. \"If it continues at this rate, then we, too, will be banging our heads against the wall like Mykonos or Santorini.\"              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow New York Times Travel </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">on </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

In the last five years the EU has identified climate change as the major challenge of our time, embarking on its energy transition journey and aiming at leading the way globally. Despite the pandemic and the Russian aggression of Ukraine, the legislative process has progressed and the bloc's green ambitions have increased - as evidenced by the additional resources that have been invested in the decarbonization and electrification process and by the upward revision of targets.</p><p>Internally, the Green Deal implied an <url normalizedValue=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal/fit-55-delivering-proposals_en\">impressive set</url> of regulations to be reviewed, new tools and policies, as the outcoming Commission identified the expansion of RES and the strengthening of power grids as key pillars for action. The work is still in progress though. Indeed, the new executive should accelerate the process by further accelerating the decarbonization of power generation, to both boost climate action and achieve greater energy independence; by expanding, modernizing, digitalizing and strengthening the power grid infrastructure thanks also to electricity market design reform and a funding system earmarked for climate resilience efforts; \u00a0by unlocking the potential of electrification of residential and public buildings, road transport and industry; as well as \u00a0by enabling consumers to play a key role as protagonists of the energy systems.</p><p>Externally, the EGD was recognized as having a significant influence in a globalized and connected world, impacting hydrocarbon-producing countries and global trade patterns (which should increasingly consider the carbon component of its products) - think of the impact of the CBAM or of the EUDR. Industrial competitiveness, and the related opportunities and challenges, also come into sharp focus in 2023, with several new proposals to better connect it to the Green Deal.</p><p>If there was one lesson to be learnt from these past five years is that the political and policy-driven nature of this revolution needs to set up manageable implications for all, everywhere. The EU indeed cannot separate its EGD from its foreign policy as its consequences will reverberate well <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/external-dimension-green-deal-between-cooperation-and-competition\">beyond its borders</url>. This also means the EU cannot decarbonize itself while others don't - otherwise risking internal backlash as well as isolation at the international level.</p><p>The new Commission, therefore, will need to remain committed to global dialogue on a multilateral and on a plurilateral basis, in particular with the US and China. Despite the obvious relevance of the relations among the three superpowers, key would be the promotion of a stronger integration of global energy and climate needs into a more comprehensive global governance architecture, as the current fragmented one does not embrace the complexities of the transition. Bilateral and mini-lateral relations should also play a stronger role, e.g., through climate clubs, which could boost the energy transition through a positive competition among economies.</p><p>To be safely put in place, the energy transition needs to consider its effects on the most vulnerable and fragile inside and outside borders. On the latter aspect, the EU and the other superpowers must increase their financial support to encourage the transformation of those countries being the most exposed to climate change despite being poorly equipped to respond, listening to their demands and concerns. The EU can also lead the global decarbonisation benefitting from an important dimension of its power that has remained unaffected by previous crises: its ability to regulate global markets - a valid ally to scale up sustainable investment in the EU and implement the EGD.</p><p>The key pieces of legislation put forward at the end of von der Leyen's first term however signals a focus on industrial competitiveness - crucial for sustainable societal and economic well-being in Europe - is coming and much of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-mulls-industrial-twin-for-green-deal-as-election-pressure-bites/\">upcoming debate</url> revolves around the attempt to strengthen European strategic autonomy and maintain industrial competitiveness. In parallel, a complex\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">trade-off\u00a0has </emphasis>emerged for Europe on how to balance decarbonization, strategic autonomy in green supply chains, and fiscal discipline, something the new Commission should deal with. A much more informed debate should take place over how to secure on time and in a cost-effective way our climate targets. This should be pursued by avoiding conflictual confrontation with superpowers (i.e., the US and China) while moving fast in those key sectors where Europe can be competitive internationally (solar, grids, batteries, heat pumps), with benefits both in terms of energy transition and socio-economic performances.</p><p>This exercise needs to be supported by the key priority to create sustainable global supply chains, showcasing commitment to collaborative international relations and mutual progress in the sustainable energy sector, but avoiding subjugation to global players. Higher environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and non-price criteria are essential elements to be promoted by the Commission vis-\u00e0-vis third countries as to guarantee Europe, its companies, and its products to be competitive in the transition race.</p><p>Strategic autonomy concerns apply also to critical raw materials, a key component for the EU attempt to develop a strong local green industry. In this context, international dialogue and superpowers' engagement become fundamental for establishing cooperative and transparency frameworks, universal standards and global markets mechanisms, keeping in mind that critical raw materials are subject cycles that need to be understood and managed accordingly.</p><p>Last, but not least, the incoming European Commission should focus on scientific and technological cooperation, education, and skilling efforts both as a factor to strengthen industrial capacity internally, but also to support advancements globally (specifically in partner countries). Only by reinforcing the European technological edge and securing its workers' skills the EU and its private sector can effectively aspire to play a pivotal role in the implementation of the energy transition on a global scale.</p><p>There is therefore an incredibly complex set of actions for the incoming European Commission. There are all the premises to put this ambitious yet vital approach in place.\u00a0 A coherent and just framework is needed, to the benefit of European citizens and companies, as well as a way stronger climate mainstreaming into EU's foreign policy ecosystem in order to consolidate the global role of the EU in this strategic domain.</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Internally, the Green Deal implied an impressive set of regulations to be reviewed, new tools and policies, as the outcoming Commission identified the expansion of RES and the strengthening of power grids as key pillars for action.

According to the latest report of the National Sugar Development Council, our share in the cane plantation is 72%. Despite lack of infrastructure, port congestion and insufficient forex to import agricultural equipment, Dangote has achieved significant growth in the sugar plantations.</p><p>Are local manufacturers able to rely on Nigeria-grown sugar or must they import?</p><p>Nigeria is importing 90% of the sugar requirement. The homegrown sugar is still less than 10%. However, with the aggressive implementation of the Backward Integration Programme, Dangote will be able to reduce its dependence on imports soon.</p><p>How has climate change affected businesses that depend on inputs from the agriculture sector in Nigeria?What kind of interventions can be made at the field level to protect yields from climate-related damage?</p><p>Climate has a vital role to play in the sugar business. An increase in temperature reduces soil moisture, increases evaporation rates, reduces labour productivity, triggers flooding, droughts, land degradation, landslides, increase in wind intensity, and untimely rains affect productivity and increase the risk in farming. Nigeria needs to enhance climate resilience to save the present and protect the future. To protect from climate variations, we need to develop catchment areas, improve water efficiency, prevent soil erosion, mechanisation etc. Dangote has taken various initiatives in this regard.</p><p>We have also installed a weather monitoring station to predict the weather forecast, and a satellite monitoring station to prepare in advance for any major change in the weather.

While the Climate Alliance today includes all 98 Danish municipalities, it started as a pilot project with only 20 available places.</p><p>However, there was a strong interest from the outset, receiving 33 applications in the first round. Within six months of initiating the DK2020 project, Bournonville's colleagues told him they should make the project available to every municipality.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Partnering with local government</emphasis></p><p>\"My initial response was, okay let's see how we can do this. But I don't think we can do it alone,\" Bournonville said. Within a few months, they were able to announce a partnership with Local Government Denmark (KL) which took on the task of communicating with the municipalities and explaining the hows and whys of the benefits of the project.</p><p>Chief Consultant at KL, Julie Leth, told Euractiv: \"The main purpose of this Climate Alliance partnership is to support municipalities moving from plan to action.\"</p><p>Leth added she believes their participation also 'legitimised' the project for a lot of the municipalities. From a tangible perspective, it also meant the project was boosted by hundreds of man-hours and a new budget of about (EURO)6 million.</p><p>This support includes tailored guidance, showcasing best practices, knowledge sharing, and monitoring the impact of the climate action plans to ensure their implementation and follow-up. The resulting documentation is used in dialogues with the government at a national level to hopefully eliminate barriers that they may encounter.</p><p>Each municipality has a climate coordinator who in turn is linked to a regional hub, for knowledge to be shared nationwide and to enable capacity building.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Four year reviews</emphasis></p><p>They also want to build a tool that allows for plans to be revised owing to a C40 requirement for plans to be reviewed every four years. While the overarching goal is for Climate Alliance municipalities to reach their 2030 and 2050 climate targets, there are also several subgoals such as retention and developing plans that reduce any administrative burdens while keeping them meaningful.</p><p>Liaising with different municipalities which are widely different and face different challenges has its hurdles, but Leth explained that there is a general agreement among the municipalities that climate action is very important, so they rely on DK2020 to take their case to the national government. However, the Danish government also stands to benefit from hardworking municipalities.</p><p>Leth referred to a recently published report from the Danish Climate Council that shows the national government is unlikely to reach its own climate targets by 2030 but the climate action plans of the municipalities will exceed them.</p><p>\"Across Europe, local and regional governments mobilise 58% of public climate significant expenditures\u00a0- more than their central governments. Moreover, they hold sole or shared responsibilities for 68.3% of all dimensions covered in Member States' National Energy and Climate Plans, such as renovations of schools and hospitals or the planning for wind and solar parks,\" Climate, Sustainable Finance Officer for the CEMR, Marlon Hilden, told Euractiv.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taking ownership of decisions</emphasis></p><p>Hilden also explained that local expertise enables communities to feel greater ownership over decisions being implemented in their territories.</p><p>Bournonville thinks Denmark on the whole is in an advantageous situation with significant public support for climate action, particularly in the bigger cities, \"On the other hand in rural parts of Denmark, most of these municipalities have been working with renewable energy in depth for decades,\" he said.</p><p>For projects like the Climate Alliance to have an even bigger impact, other stakeholders in other countries have to be inspired to take action. However, they won't be left to fend for themselves. CEMR's Marlon Hilden said part of their work involves facilitating knowledge sharing.</p><p>\"CEMR offers members like Local Government Denmark\u00a0(KL)\u00a0and their initiatives a wide opportunity to share best practices to build up local and regional expertise in climate and energy policies and their implementation,\" said Hilden. They recently organised a <url normalizedValue=\"https://platforma-dev.eu/watch-our-training-on-climate-adaptation-and-mitigation-for-locally-elected-representatives/\">climate academy</url> together, organised debates at the European Week of Regions and Cities, and also published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ccre.org/img/uploads/piecesjointe/filename/NECP_Report_CEMR_2023.pdf\">studies</url>.</p><p>Bournonville doesn't hide that those looking for a quick fix are better off looking elsewhere, explaining that Denmark's democratic and political tradition means active involvement of all citizens - which is inclusive and impactful but takes time.</p><p>\"We really want to export this model and we love to work together with other countries in Europe and across the world. We've shown in Denmark that it's possible to do and we can certainly be copied elsewhere. We'd love to play a role in that,\" said Bournonville.</p><p>[By Christoph Schwaiger I Edited by Brian Maguire |\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url>\u00a0]</p>", "publisher": "EurActiv.com", "instances": ["Denmark's DK2020 climate collective initiative brought together all Danish municipalities, now it prospers as the Climate Alliance.

The ecological and social transition will accelerate the potential for innovation, growth and employment, by activating the decisive lever of sustainable public procurement - following the example of the advances contained in the recent French Climate &amp; Resilience and Green Industry laws. In France and in the world and for the economy as a whole, extra-financial criteria, whether social or environmental, must be more systematically evaluated in public procurement so that, in a qualitative approach, the value of a product or service is not reduced to price alone. By renewing this study to measure our socioeconomic footprint, we are reiterating our commitment to transparency and further demonstrating our contribution to the development of services for cities and transport partners that benefit citizens and stakeholders everywhere we operate.

Left unabated, climate change will continue to have adverse impacts on African economies and societies, and hamper growth prospects and wellbeing.</p><p>According to the 6th IPCC Assessment, Africans are disproportionately employed in climate-exposed sectors: 55-62% of the sub-Saharan workforce is employed in agriculture and 95% of cropland is rain-fed.</p><p>In rural Africa, climate hazards pose heightened risks to low-income and female-headed households, with UN Women projecting a worst-case scenario of 158 million more women and girls pushed into poverty by mid-century in low-income countries. These statistics are grim. Protecting these people and promoting their prosperity would require a stronger voice and stronger partnerships.</p><p>That is why Ghana, in its role as the chair of the V20 Group of the world's most climate-vulnerable nations, raised a clarion call in Dubai for urgent financial and technical support to adapt to climate change while advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>The appeal comes in light of staggering figures. Since 2000, V20 countries have incurred $525bn in costs due to multiple impacts of climate change. It is even more distressing that about 98% of the nearly 1.5bn people residing in these countries are bereft of financial protections.</p><p>We cannot triumph from this adversity in a vacuum.

Leveraging existing digital payment infrastructure and collaborating with financial institutions, the government reduced inefficiencies, minimised physical contact, and played a vital role in the broader containment effort.</p><p>The government of Ghana's dedication to advancing a digital economy has been matched by significant investment in digital infrastructure. With Ghana pioneering an integrated interoperability system, through the Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems (GhIPSS), interoperable mobile money transactions surged to $138m, totalling over $2bn in 2022.</p><p>A digital ID system, the New Payments Systems Act, the Consumer Recourse Mechanism directive, also continues to play a vital role in promoting responsible digital financial inclusion in Ghana.</p><p>The Ghana.gov platform equally underscores the government's commitment to providing a comprehensive one-stop shop for digitally paying for all public services; thus improving predictability and accountability over public resources for mitigating climate challenges.</p><p>Together, these infrastructures have laid the foundation for resilient social-protection systems and enhanced anticipatory action in the context of climate related transfers, particularly for women who often disproportionately bear the burden of climate change.</p><p>Call to action</p><p>Recognising their value and potential, and whilst at COP28, Ghana, the Vulnerable Twenty (V20) Group, the Philippines, Ethiopia together with the UN-based Better Than Cash Alliance, the World Food Programme (WFP) and Mercy Corps, launched a bold call to action.</p><p>The call urges faster up-take by governments, international organisations, and the private sector, to expand digital payments and digital public infrastructure for a more climate-resilient future for all.</p><p>It is a secure and sure way to close the digital divide by increasing access and connectivity to reduce climate-vulnerability, and put women, youth, indigenous peoples, and communities in fragile and climate-vulnerable areas at the centre of adaptation planning.</p><p>Investing in digital payment infrastructure and extending essential digital services to regions most affected by climate change, holds a better and bolder promise for responding to extreme weather and transforming despair into hope for millions of Africans.</p><p>Financial innovations by the private sector need to be spurred on with public funds. Adoption efforts by households need to be more affordable to inspire up-take. Yet, the squeeze on public finances across the continent is palpable.</p><p>Over 60% of low-income countries are in, or at high risk of, debt distress, while access to capital markets is constrained with prohibitive cost of borrowing. This leaves little room to fund these and other critical investments in support of climate action.</p><p>The world needs to deploy all the tools to protect our planet and people.

Holistic landscape restoration has more than just ecological benefits - by bringing people together to restore their landscape, it can build social cohesion and capital among and between communities, as well as serving as the backbone of thriving local and regional economies. By producing benefits for multiple sectors and stakeholder groups, holistic landscape restoration can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future in line with the EU Green Deal's vision.</p><p>Through Landscape Finance, policymakers could catalyse transformative change via holistic landscape restoration, making lasting impact on Europe's landscapes.\u00a0Here are some recommendations for how EU policymakers can integrate a Landscape Finance approach into their work:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. LANDSCAPES AND LANDSCAPE PARTNERSHIPS NEED TO BE RECOGNISED IN POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE AND TO MEET MULTIPLE TARGETS\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should allocate resources to support landscape partnerships that drive holistic landscape restoration</emphasis>. Public funds in the form of unrestricted and flexible grant funding should be made available to support multi- stakeholder landscape partnership and governance processes to catalyse restoration. This is the most catalytic of all funding opportunities within holistic landscape restoration as the partnership develops the vision and plan for the landscape, providing governance and driving long- term restoration.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implement incentives that are aligned to nature</emphasis>. It is critical to redirect or eliminate environmentally harmful incentives, such as subsidies, on behalf of activities that restore ecosystems and enhance ecosystem services. Accelerating the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and applying the reform with integrity will be instrumental in aligning nature and agricultural biodiversity objectives and finance. By aligning policies to reward benefits appropriately and financially penalise harms, governments can encourage nature-positive actions and discourage harmful ones.\u00a0</p><p>Holistic landscape restoration can serve as an enabling platform to streamline implementation of national plans targeting the same landscape. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National and regional development plans (including National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans) of EU member states should recognise landscapes and landscape partnerships</emphasis>, facilitating vertical and horizontal policy coherence and integration of national spatial planning and budgeting across sectors. This should be done to best suit the policy and fiscal systems of each country. However, regardless of each country's level of decentralised decision-making, landscapes can be leveraged to implement adaptation, nature restoration and drought plans, among other policies.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop harmonised accounting and reporting frameworks for landscapes </emphasis>that enable the private sector (companies and investors) to report against emerging sustainable finance regulations such as the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. PUBLIC FINANCE CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL, CATALYTIC ROLE IN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All guidance documentation for the Nature Restoration Law developed by the European Commission should explicitly recognise the value of landscapes in tackling multiple goals and be translated in national restoration plans</emphasis>. By fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among government agencies, NGOs, businesses and local communities at landscape level, diverse interests can be aligned, and resources pooled, to implement strategies that tackle multiple challenges in a cost-efficient and effective way.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should produce a guidance document on how to incorporate landscape restoration into national restoration plans</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop a mechanism with the mandate to provide earmarked funding for landscapes</emphasis>. Within the current multiannual financing framework (MFF), Directorates-General that will benefit from restoration (CLIMA, ENV, AGRI, EMPL, REGIO, SANTE, etc.) should earmark portions of their budgets for landscape restoration.

African countries now have options and often prefer the lack of domestic political conditionality inherent in China's engagement.</p><p>One way to increase the attractiveness of Western engagement, which requires a tacit commitment to democratic values, is to coordinate and combine efforts between the US and its partners in the European Union (EU) and the G7. Doing so offers African nations a bigger payoff and leverages the unique specialties of each country to promote sustainable development and democratic practices. In short, it is much harder for African nations to turn down engagement with the US and the EU when they work together rather than at cross-purposes.</p><p>This form of joint engagement is currently occurring with the Lobito Corridor project in Angola and is critical to securing and de-risking supply chains.

Not only can an efficient building help Europe achieve the twin goals of energy sovereignty and climate neutrality, it can also help protect people from overheating.</p><p>Heat related illnesses are a growing concern in today's increasingly hot world. Children, older people and those with medical conditions are especially vulnerable to overheating. When you take into consideration Europe's ageing population, more people will be at risk in the future. In fact, according to some estimates, extreme heat will impact 300 million Europeans annually by 2100 and kill 90,000 people a year.</p><p>But make no mistake, the risk of overheating is by no means limited to being outside - it's an inside hazard too. Europeans spend as much as 90% of their time indoors. If these spaces aren't thermally comfortable, occupants could suffer.\u00a0</p><p>The problem is that the building and construction sector has been largely focused on keeping people warm - and rightly so as Europe currently experiences more than 200,000 deaths every winter. However, with climate change and the record-breaking temperatures and extreme heatwaves that come with it, it's now just as important to keep people cool in summer too.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Holistic Approach for Year-Round Resilience\u00a0</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The good news is that buildings can help protect people from both winter and summer extremes. The key to providing such year-round climate resilience is to take a holistic approach to building design.\u00a0</p><p>A holistic approach incorporates a range of factors. For example, it might include optimising glazing and shading or incorporating vegetation through living roofs and walls so solar heat gain is balanced throughout the seasons. One could also consider a home's orientation in relation to wind and peak sunlight.</p><p>Ventilation and airtightness are additional factors to consider. Carefully managed ventilation within an appropriately airtight building will allow for greater control over the internal temperature.\u00a0</p><p>Beyond the building's design, a holistic approach will look to manage internal heat sources as well.

But really, it's better to think of insulation as a thermos: when it's cold outside it keeps the inside warm, but when it's hot outside it does the opposite and keeps the inside cool.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Insulation creates a year-round stable indoor environment by preventing unwanted heat transfer. In the winter, this means slowing heat loss from interior spaces. In the summer, it means reducing the amount of warm air coming in. In addition to keeping heat from coming in through the exterior walls, insulation can also help prevent the hot, humid air of an attic from seeping through the ceiling and into the home's living space.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Optimising HVAC Use\u00a0</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>While passive cooling solutions (opening windows, insulating pipes, using energy efficient appliances, etc.) can significantly reduce the risk of overheating in much of northern and central Europe, in the Mediterranean Region it's a different story entirely. Here, summer temperatures have been brutal - with places like Sicily seeing scorching daytime temperatures of 48\u00b0C and higher. And there's no respite at night, with tropical nighttime temperatures of 20\u00b0C or more now being the norm.\u00a0</p><p>In the face of such round-the-clock heat, even the most holistically designed building will need some mechanical help. Luckily, when properly installed as part of a holistic building design, quality insulation creates the stable internal environment needed to optimise the use of heating, air-conditioning and ventilation (HVAC) systems like heat pumps.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Contrary to what their name suggests, heat pumps can also be used to cool a home. When that home is properly insulated, the heat pump doesn't have to work as hard to maintain a comfortably cool climate. This in turn reduces both energy use and costs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Let's Make Insulation Do More</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>As Europe's climate continues to change on both ends of the seasonal spectrum, it is now critical that we take the necessary steps to fully leverage the year-round benefits of a climate resilient building. To do so, we must ensure that the buildings being built or renovated today are future-proofed against the climate of tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>As a first step, policymakers must work to ramp up building renovation rates, with a particular focus on improving such critical passive building envelope elements as thermal insulation, along with airtightness, windows and shades. This will keep buildings not only warm during the winter, but also cool in the summer. It will also ensure that, if an active cooling system like a heat pump is installed, its design and use will be fully optimised.\u00a0</p><p>When used in combination with holistic building designs, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">insulation can do more</emphasis> than just keep us warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

As widely expected, the EU executive recommended a 90% emissions reduction goal, corresponding to the lower end of the 90-95% target range advocated by the EU's Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.</p><p>This is expected to lower the EU's dependence on fossil fuels by 80% and unleash low carbon energy solutions such as renewables, nuclear, energy efficiency, storage, CCS, CCU, carbon removals, geothermal and hydro, the EU executive said. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eu-kicks-off-debate-on-2040-climate-goal-on-way-to-net-zero-emissions/\">Fred Simon has the story</url>.</p><p>One of the key aspects in the 2040 climate target debate is the place reserved for carbon removals to address residual emissions from industry and agriculture. According to the Commission proposal, carbon removals should reach up to 400 MtCO2 by 2040 to offset those emissions. But environmental groups fear this will undermine the EU's efforts to reduce emissions in the first place. As a result, the EU's actual emissions reduction target for 2040 would be -82%, not -90%, they say.</p><p>The Commission also got cold feet when it comes to tackling emissions from the agriculture sector amid farmers' protests over the bloc's green policies. Under pressure from the street and the European Parliament, the Commission finally dropped plans to cut agriculture emissions by at least 30% in the next 25 years. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/eu-commission-backtracks-on-agricultural-emissions-cuts/\">Maria Simon Arboleas reports</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industrial phase</emphasis>.

And policy experts say it's unclear whether, and how quickly, federal bureaucracy can level the playing field.       </p><p>\"These tensions have to be squarely faced,\" said Xavier de Souza Briggs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who volunteered on Mr. Biden's transition team. The White House \"is trying to transform some of these deep structures of government that have needed attention for a long, long time,\" he said.       </p><p>Some local governments have tried to distribute money for climate resilience in a more equitable manner. But the political backlash can be fierce.       </p><p>After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston in 2017, voters approved a $2.5 billion bond to fund more than 500 flood-control projects around the county. Officials decided to prioritize those projects based in part on the \"social vulnerability\" of the communities they protected - an index that includes the percentage of residents who are minorities.       </p><p>Residents in wealthier neighborhoods, along with their elected representatives, complained the policy would push their communities to the back of the line.       </p><p>The new climate provisions in the infrastructure bill inject billions of dollars into competitive grant programs. These are pots of money that towns, cities and counties can access only by submitting applications, which federal agencies then rank, with funds going to applicants with the highest scores.       </p><p>That system is designed to ensure that funding goes to the most worthwhile projects.       </p><p>But it also hinges on something outside the control of the federal government: The ability of local officials to use sophisticated tools and resources to write successful applications. The result is a process that has widened the gap between rich communities and their less affluent counterparts, experts say.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'What good is it?'</emphasis></p><p>The disparity begins even before the application process begins. That's because local governments must be aware of the grant programs in the first place, which means having dedicated staff to track those programs. Then they need to design proposals that will score highly, and correctly complete the reams of required paperwork.       </p><p>Even if they are awarded a grant, communities are required to pay a share of the project - often 25 percent, which is unaffordable for many struggling towns and counties.       </p><p>Governments that can clear those obstacles face a final hurdle: Demonstrating that the value of the property that would be protected is greater than the cost of the project. That rule often excludes communities of color and rural areas, where property values are usually lower than in white communities.       </p><p>\"We have counties and municipalities that do not have the institutional capacity to participate in this alphabet list of programs that the federal government has created for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation,\" said Jesse Keenan, a professor at Tulane University who focuses on how governments try to cope with global warming.       </p><p>During a virtual meeting in October, advocates challenged senior White House officials to explain how they would fulfill their promises of racial equity, given the history of federal grant programs.       </p><p>\"It's one thing to have an idea of how to build back better,\" said Beverly Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice. \"But if the people who need it the most can't afford it, what good is it?\"       </p><p>Yoca Arditi-Rocha is executive director of the CLEO Institute, a nonprofit group in Florida that promotes climate change education, advocacy and resilience, especially for low-income communities.       </p><p>\"The price tag to adapt to the significant climate risk our communities are facing is truly enormous,\" she said. \"To build back better, the federal government cannot leave behind communities like my own.\"       </p><p>Officials conceded the challenge, and said they were looking for ways to address it, without giving specifics. \"We're very aware that this is an issue that needs work,\" said Candace Vahlsing, associate director for climate at the White House Office of Management and Budget.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'If this grant doesn't qualify, then I'm not sure what would'</emphasis></p><p>The consequences of the current approach were on display this past summer, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency named the first round of likely winners under a new climate-resilience grant program, funding projects to address future risks from flooding, wildfires and other hazards.       </p><p>The Biden administration has touted the program, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, as a model that should be expanded. The infrastructure bill provides billions more to the program.       </p><p>But most of the first round winners were wealthy, predominantly white areas in a handful of coastal states, federal data show.       </p><p>More than half the money went to California, New Jersey and Washington State. The largest single recipient was a $68 million flood-control project in Menlo Park, Calif., where the median household income is more than $160,000, the typical home costs more than $2 million and only one in five residents are Black or Hispanic. The project is in line to get $50 million from FEMA.       </p><p>By contrast, FEMA rejected applications from places like Smithland, Ky., a town of just 240 people where the Cumberland and Ohio Rivers meet, halfway between St. Louis and Nashville. The town sought $1.4 million to build a levee along the riverbank, which has crested at flood levels three times in the past 10 years.       </p><p>\"That's a lot of money for us,\" said Garrett Gruber, the top elected official in Livingston County, which includes Smithland.       </p><p>But he said the cost for the barrier, though large compared with the value of the houses it would protect, would be less expensive than erecting temporary barriers every time the river crests.       </p><p>\"If this grant doesn't qualify, then I'm not sure what would,\" Mr. Gruber added. \"It's almost as if you would rather me just evacuate the city.\"       </p><p>The rules that governed the first round of BRIC awards were set under the Trump administration. A senior official in the Biden administration, who spoke on condition that he not be identified by name, noted that the rules for the next round of awards have been changed, giving extra points for applications that cite benefits for disadvantaged communities.       </p><p>That's part of the Biden administration's \"Justice 40\" initiative, which calls for disadvantaged communities to receive the \"overall benefits\" of 40 percent of climate dollars, as defined and calculated by each federal agency. The initiative does not require a specific portion of climate funding be spent in underserved communities.       </p><p>Republican lawmakers who oversee federal disaster funding declined to discuss the Biden administration's new approach. Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, declined to comment through a spokesman. A spokeswoman for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, the top Republican on the Senate subcommittee responsible for infrastructure, didn't respond to a request for comment.       </p><p>The new rules for the FEMA program define disadvantaged communities broadly, to reflect one or more of 15 suggested criteria.

Revenue and earnings grew strongly and reached new all-time highs. Free cash flow was exceptional and significantly exceeded expectations.</p><p>Almost all of the Group's businesses, both in France and abroad, saw very positive momentum throughout the year. The only exception was the property development business, which is dealing with a severe conjunctural downturn in its sector.</p><p>In Concessions, traffic levels at VINCI Autoroutes continued to rise, with light vehicles the main growth driver despite fuel prices remaining high. At VINCI Airports, passenger numbers continued to recover and moved back at the end of the year slightly above pre-pandemic levels overall. While some airports have not yet reached their 2019 levels, other have achieved record-high traffic. Combined with good cost control, these growth trajectories allowed the Concessions business to increase its operating income substantially, offsetting the impact of higher interest rates.</p><p>The Energy business was again buoyed by powerful underlying trends - the energy transition and the digital revolution - and saw strong revenue growth. It accounted for almost 40% of the Group's total revenue and both VINCI Energies and Cobra IS increased their margins. The Energy business also generated record free cash flow despite its investments in green power generation. At the end of 2023, the total capacity of renewable energy projects in operation or under construction was over 2 GW, in line with targets.</p><p>VINCI Construction also saw very strong business levels, driven by works on major mobility infrastructure projects, structures intended to provide greater climate resilience, and energy renovation. The business line continued to improve its operating margin and its free cash flow was outstanding.</p><p>Order intake for the Energy and Construction businesses remained high, without wavering from the longstanding selective approach in place withing the Group. The order book renewal rate was therefore satisfactory, offering the Group forward visibility and serenity.</p><p>In terms of new developments, the main deals completed in 2023 concerned VINCI Energies, which made acquisitions in Europe and North America, VINCI Highways, which added a motorway concession in Brazil to its portfolio, and VINCI\u00a0Airports, whose network now includes Cabo Verde's seven airports. In addition, VINCI Airports was rewarded for its good management of six airports in the Dominican Republic over the last eight years with a 30-year extension of its concession until 2060.</p><p>With a solid presence in highly buoyant markets, particularly in the energy sector - in which it operates across the whole value chain through its three major businesses - the Group is moving ahead with confidence and enthusiasm. The environmental transition, energy efficiency, the digital revolution and sustainable mobility are major challenges that are generating considerable demand, which represent opportunities for the Group's companies.</p><p>In this context, the Group can rely on its efficient, decentralised organisation to continue its development while keeping its focus on all-round performance, which encompasses both financial and non-financial elements.</p><p>VINCI's Board of Directors, chaired by Xavier Huillard, met on 7 February 2024 to finalise the 2023 financial statements<sup>4</sup>, which will be submitted for approval at the Shareholders' General Meeting on 9 April 2024.</p><p>The Board approved the payment of a (EURO)4.50 dividend with respect to 2023, payable entirely in cash.</p><p>I.\u00a0\u00a0Record-high revenue, earnings and free cash flow</p><p>VINCI's 2023 financial statements show strong growth in revenue and earnings compared with 2022. All\u00a0business lines achieved a substantial increase in operating income, which reached new all-time highs, along with exceptional free cash flow.</p><p>Consolidated revenue rose by 11.6% to (EURO)68.8 billion (organic growth of 9.9%, a 2.5% positive impact from changes in the consolidation scope and a 0.9% negative impact from exchange rate movements). This trend confirms the good momentum in the Group's businesses, both in France and abroad.</p><p>In France (43% of the total), revenue was (EURO)29.6 billion, up 6% on both an actual and like-for-like basis.Outside France (57% of the total), revenue came to (EURO)39.2 billion, up 16% on an actual basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis. Changes in scope mainly concern the integration of OMA<sup>5</sup>in Mexico by VINCI Airports, along with recent acquisitions made by VINCI Energies, including most of Kontron\u00a0AG's IT services business in Central Europe (late 2022) and Otera AS in Norway (early 2023). Exchange rate movements had a slightly negative impact on revenue, because the euro rose against several currencies including the US dollar and sterling.</p><p>Concessions revenue totalled (EURO)10.9 billion, up 19% on an actual basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis compared with 2022, and broke down as follows:</p><p>VINCI Autoroutes: (EURO)6.3 billion (up 5%).VINCI Airports: (EURO)3.9 billion (up 47% actual and up 24% like-for-like). Compared with 2019 - the pre-pandemic baseline year - revenue was up 12% at constant scope.Other concessions: VINCI Highways<sup>6</sup>: (EURO)0.4 billion (up 7%).VINCI Stadium: (EURO)0.3 billion, a very sharp increase that includes the impact of the 2023\u00a0Rugby\u00a0World Cup, which took place in France.</p><p>Revenue at VINCI Energies totalled (EURO)19.3 billion, up 15% on an actual basis and 11% on a like-for-like basis compared with 2022. Business momentum remained strong in the fourth quarter, with revenue up 13% on an actual basis and 8% on a like-for-like basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. VINCI Energies' companies in France and abroad are benefiting from their positions in the highly buoyant energy efficiency and digital transformation markets, thanks to their wide-ranging expertise, their effective combination of global reach and local presence, and their decentralised management. All four of VINCI Energies' business lines (infrastructure, industry, building solutions and ICT<sup>7</sup>) achieved double-digit growth. Recent acquisitions<sup>8</sup>generated around (EURO)860 million of additional revenue in 2023.</p><p>In France (42% of the total), revenue was (EURO)8.2 billion, up 11% on an actual basis and 10% on a like-for-like basis. Outside France (58% of the total), revenue was (EURO)11.2 billion, up 19% on an actual basis and 11% on a like-for-like basis. Business growth remained very strong in most regions where VINCI Energies operates.</p><p>Revenue at Cobra IS totalled (EURO)6.5 billion, up 18% on both an actual and like-for-like basis compared with 2022, and growth accelerated significantly in the fourth quarter (up 28% relative to the fourth quarter of 2022). Revenue growth was driven by most of Cobra IS's geographies, in both flow business (63% of its revenue) and major EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) projects (37%).</p><p>In Spain (44% of the total), revenue rose by 16% to (EURO)2.9 billion, and came mainly from recurring flow business. Outside Spain (56% of the total, of which 33% in Latin America), revenue totalled (EURO)3.6 billion, up 19% on an actual basis and 20% on a like-for-like basis.</p><p>Revenue at VINCI Construction totalled (EURO)31.5 billion, up 8% on an actual basis and 9% on a like-for-like basis compared with 2022.</p><p>In France (43% of the total), revenue was (EURO)13.7 billion (up 5%). Business levels remained robust in civil engineering structures and roadworks. In the building segment, revenue was driven by the rehabilitation of existing buildings and by the construction of public buildings, particularly in the hospital sector. These opportunities offset the decline in new projects in both residential and non-residential segments.Outside France (57% of the total), revenue amounted to (EURO)17.8 billion, up 10% on an actual basis and 12% on a like-for-like basis. This reflects progress with several large civil engineering contracts in Europe, North America and Australia/New Zealand, along with solid business levels in companies of Speciality Networks and Proximity Networks.</p><p>VINCI Immobilier suffered from a sharp decline in property transactions in France against a background of high interest rates, and its revenue fell 19% to (EURO)1.2 billion.</p><p>Ebitda amounted to (EURO)12.0 billion (17.4% of revenue) as opposed to the 2022 figure of (EURO)10.2\u00a0billion (16.6% of revenue), a 17% increase. Half of this rise is attributable to VINCI Airports, consequence of the recovery in airport passenger numbers, the increase in revenue per passenger, the firm grip on expenses and the integration of OMA.</p><p>Operating income from ordinary activities (Ebit) grew 22.5% to (EURO)8.4 billion ((EURO)6.8 billion in 2022). It included:</p><p>(EURO)5.4 billion from the Concessions business, comprising (EURO)3.4 billion from VINCI Autoroutes and (EURO)1.9 billion from VINCI Airports ((EURO)1.0 billion in 2022);\u00a0almost (EURO)1.9 billion from the Energy business (VINCI Energies:\u00a0(EURO)1.4 billion, margin up to 7.0% as opposed to 6.8% in 2022; Cobra IS:\u00a0(EURO)0.5 billion, equal to 7.5% of revenue as opposed to 7.4% in 2022);(EURO)1.3 billion from VINCI Construction, margin up to 4.0% (3.8% in 2022), a level not seen since 2011.</p><p>Consolidated net income attributable to owners of the parent was (EURO)4.7 billion and earnings per share<sup>9</sup>amounted to (EURO)8.18 ((EURO)4.3 billion and (EURO)7.47<sup>9</sup>respectively in 2022).</p><p>Free cash flow hit a record (EURO)6.6 billion ((EURO)5.4 billion in 2022), much higher than the levels expected at the start of 2023.That increase was driven firstly by Ebitda growth and a very sharp improvement in the working capital requirement, due in particular to high levels of cash inflows from customers at the end of the year. It also resulted from the postponement of some investments, particularly in new renewable energy projects that started later in the year than anticipated.While the contributions from VINCI Autoroutes ((EURO)2.7 billion) and VINCI Airports ((EURO)1.0 billion) were slightly down compared with 2022, particularly as a result of their higher financial costs, VINCI Energies ((EURO)1.4 billion) and VINCI\u00a0Construction ((EURO)1.2 billion) achieved outstanding performance, with cash conversion ratios of well over 100%. Free cash flow at Cobra IS was close to zero despite a high level of investment relating notably to the construction of new renewable energy projects.</p><p>After taking into account the financial investments made during the period, the dividends payments and the impact of share buy-back programmes, consolidated net financial debt at 31\u00a0December\u00a02023 was (EURO)16.1\u00a0billion, a decrease of (EURO)2.4 billion year on year.</p><p>II.\u00a0\u00a0Broadly positive operational performance</p><p>At VINCI Autoroutes, traffic levels remained resilient throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, they were up 1.3% year on year, including a 1.7% increase for light vehicles, and stable in December despite a negative calendar effect<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>Over the year as a whole, traffic was up 1.3% compared with 2022. Light vehicle traffic was up 1.7% despite ongoing high fuel prices. Heavy vehicle traffic fell by 1.3%, partly due to negative calendar effects<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>VINCI Airports passenger numbers continued to rise throughout 2023. In the fourth quarter, they slightly exceeded their pre-pandemic level (up 0.6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019).</p><p>Overall, the network's airports handled 267 million passengers in 2023<sup>12</sup>, 26% more than in 2022 and only 4% less than the 2019 figure. Airports in Portugal, Serbia (Belgrade) and Central America (Mexico, Dominican Republic and Costa Rica) achieved passenger numbers well in excess of their 2019 levels. In Japan, where the recovery took longer to get under way, passenger numbers rebounded sharply in the last few months of the year, particularly on international routes, and are gradually moving back to their 2019 levels.</p><p>Order intake in the Energy and Construction businesses totalled (EURO)61.9 billion in 2023, a 11% year on year increase. Order intake in the Energy business was particularly strong, and hit a new record of (EURO)20.9 billion at VINCI Energies (up 17% relative to 2022, including an 8% increase in the fourth quarter). Order intake at Cobra IS was exceptional ((EURO)10.3 billion, up 29% compared with 2022, including growth of 18% in the fourth quarter), driven by some major contracts relating to green power generation, transformation and transmission<sup>13</sup>. Order intake also rose at VINCI Construction (up 3% year on year to (EURO)30.6 billion) as a result of solid flow business. Their fell in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period is due to a high base for comparison (several large contracts were won in late 2022<sup>14</sup>), while order intake from small- and medium-sized contracts remained very strong.</p><p>Overall, the order book amounted to (EURO)61.4 billion at 31 December 2023. This represents a 7% increase relative to 31 December 2022 and equals almost 13 months of average business activity for the business lines concerned. International business made up 67% of the order book, as opposed to 69% at 31\u00a0December\u00a02022.</p><p>VINCI Immobilier saw 4,214 housing units reserved, down 30% compared with the 2022 figure of 6,059 as a result of the aforementioned conjunctural difficulties in the French residential property sector. However, the decline in reservations was limited at the end of the year by bulk sales of residential units to social housing providers. However, the serviced residences business (Ovelia, Student Factory and Bikube) continued to grow, with 45 residences in operation (37 at the end of 2022) and around 20 under construction.</p><p>III.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solid financial position</p><p>At 31 December 2023, VINCI had managed net cash of (EURO)13.2 billion.</p><p>In addition, VINCI SA has a confirmed, unused credit facility that was renewed in January 2024. Because of the increase in its available cash position in the last few years, the Group has reduced the amount of that facility from (EURO)8.0 billion to (EURO)6.5 billion. Its term has also been extended until January 2029, with two options to extend it further by one year each.</p><p>At 31 December 2023, the Group's gross long-term financial debt, before taking into account net cash, totalled (EURO)29.3 billion.

It also includes restructuring charges included in non-recurring operating items.</p><p>Concession subsidiaries' revenue derived from works carried out by non-Group companies: this indicator relates to construction work done by concession companies as programme manager on behalf of concession grantors. Consideration for that work is recognised as an intangible asset or financial asset depending on the accounting model applied to the concession contract, in accordance with IFRIC 12 \"Service Concession Arrangements\". It excludes work done by the VINCI Energies, Cobra IS and VINCI Construction business lines.</p><p>Cost of net financial debt: the cost of net financial debt comprises all financial income and expense relating to net financial debt as defined below. It therefore includes interest expense and income from interest rate derivatives allocated to gross debt, along with financial income from investments and cash equivalents. The reconciliation between this indicator and the income statement is detailed in the notes to the Group's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>Ebitda margin, Ebit margin and recurring operating margin: ratios of Ebitda, Ebit, or recurring operating income to revenue excluding concession subsidiaries' revenue derived from works carried out by non-Group companies.</p><p>Free cash flow: free cash flow is made up of operating cash flow and growth investments in concessions and PPPs.</p><p>Like-for-like revenue growth: this indicator measures the change in revenue at constant scope and exchange rates.</p><p>Constant scope: the scope effect is neutralised as follows: For revenue in year Y, revenue from companies that joined the Group in year Y is deducted.For revenue in year Y\u22121, the full-year revenue of companies that joined the Group in year Y\u22121 is included, and revenue from companies that left the Group in years Y\u22121 and Y is excluded.</p><p>Constant exchange rates: the currency effect is neutralised by applying exchange rates in year Y to foreign currency revenue in year Y\u22121.</p><p>Net financial surplus/debt: this corresponds to the difference between financial assets and financial debt. If the assets outweigh the liabilities, the balance represents a net financial surplus, and if the liabilities outweigh the assets, the balance represents net financial debt. Financial debt includes bonds and other borrowings and debt owed to financial institutions (including derivatives and other liabilities relating to hedging instruments). Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and assets relating to derivative instruments.</p><p>Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets relating to leased items under non-current assets, along with a liability corresponding to the present value of lease payments still to be made. That liability is not included in net financial surplus/debt as defined by the Group, and is presented directly on the balance sheet.</p><p>Non-recurring operating items: non-recurring income and expense mainly includes goodwill impairment losses, restructuring charges and income and expense relating to changes in scope (capital gains or losses on disposals of securities and the impact of changes in control).</p><p>Operating cash flow: operating cash flow is a measurement of cash flows generated by the Group's ordinary activities. It is made up of Ebitda, the change in operating working capital requirement and current provisions, interest paid, income taxes paid, dividends received from companies accounted for under the equity method, operating investments net of disposals and repayments of lease liabilities and the associated financial expense. Operating cash flow does not include growth investments in concessions and public-private partnerships (PPPs).</p><p>Operating income: this indicator is included in the income statement. Operating income is calculated by taking recurring operating income and adding non-recurring income and expense (see above).</p><p>Operating income from ordinary activities (Ebit): this indicator is included in the income statement.</p><p>Ebit measures the operational performance of fully consolidated Group subsidiaries. It excludes share-based payment expense (IFRS 2), other recurring operating items (including the share of the income or loss of companies accounted for under the equity method) and non-recurring operating items.</p><p>Order book:</p><p>At VINCI Energies, Cobra IS and VINCI Construction, the order book represents the volume of business yet to be carried out on projects where the contract is in force (in particular after service orders have been obtained or after conditions precedent have been met) and financed.At VINCI Immobilier, the order book corresponds to the revenue, recognised on a progress-towards-completion basis, that is yet to be generated on a given date with respect to property sales confirmed by a notarised deed or with respect to property development contracts on which the works order has been given by the project owner.</p><p>Order intake:</p><p>At VINCI Energies, Cobra IS and VINCI Construction, a new order is recorded when the contract has been not only signed but is also in force (for example, after the service order has been obtained or after conditions precedent have been met) and when the project's financing is in place. The amount recorded in order intake corresponds to the contractual revenue.For VINCI Immobilier, order intake corresponds to the value of properties sold off-plan or sold after completion in accordance with a notarised deed, or revenue from property development contracts where the works order has been given by the project owner.</p><p>For joint property developments:</p><p>If VINCI Immobilier has sole control over the development company, it is fully consolidated. In that case, 100% of the contract value is included in order intake.If the development company is jointly controlled, it is accounted for under the equity method and its order intake is not included in the total.</p><p>Public-private partnerships - concessions and partnership contracts: public-private partnerships are forms of long-term public sector contracts through which a public authority calls upon a private sector partner to design, build, finance, operate and maintain a facility or item of public infrastructure and/or manage a service. \u00a0In France, a distinction is drawn between concessions (for works or services) and partnership contracts.Outside France, there are categories of public contracts - known by a variety of names - with characteristics similar to those of the French concession and partnership contracts.In a concession, the concession holder receives a toll (or other form of remuneration) directly from users of the infrastructure or service, on terms defined in the contract with the public sector authority that granted the concession. The concession holder therefore bears \"traffic level risk\" related to the use of the infrastructure.In a partnership contract, the private partner is paid by the public authority, the amount being tied to performance targets, regardless of the infrastructure's level of usage. The private partner therefore bears no traffic level risk.</p><p>Recurring operating income: this indicator is included in the income statement. Recurring operating income is intended to present the Group's operational performance excluding the impact of non-recurring transactions and events during the period. It is obtained by taking operating income from ordinary activities (Ebit) and adding the IFRS 2 expense associated with share-based payments (Group savings plans and performance share plans), the Group's share of the income or losses of subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method, and other recurring operating income and expense. The latter category includes recurring income and expense relating to companies accounted for under the equity method and to non-consolidated companies (financial income from shareholder loans and advances granted by the Group to some of its subsidiaries, dividends received from non-consolidated companies, etc.).</p><p>VINCI Airports' passenger numbers: this is the number of passengers who have travelled on commercial flights from or to a VINCI Airports airport during a given period, and is a relevant indicator for estimating an airport's revenue from both aviation and non-aviation activities.</p><p>VINCI Autoroutes' traffic levels: this is the number of kilometres travelled by light and heavy vehicles on the motorway network managed by VINCI Autoroutes during a given period.</p><p>1 Excluding concession subsidiaries' revenue derived from works carried out by non-Group companies (see glossary).2 Period-end.3 Figures at 100% including passenger numbers at all airports managed by VINCI Airports over the period as a whole.4 The consolidated financial statements have been audited and the Statutory Auditors' report is in the process of being published.5 Purchase of a 29.99% stake completed in December 2022, fully consolidated in VINCI's financial statements.6 Motorways managed outside France and electronic toll collection activities.7 Information Communication Technologies.8 34 acquisitions were completed in 2023 and 31 in 2022.9 After taking account of dilutive instruments.10 The school holidays at the end of the year started one week later than in December 2022.11 Two fewer business days in 2023 than in 2022.12 Figures at 100% including passenger numbers at all managed airports over the full period.13 However, this order intake figure does not include two of the three offshore windfarm energy converter platforms to be designed, built and installed in the North Sea for TenneT (contract announced in April 2023).14 Including a contract to build a significant section of the new metro line in Toronto, Canada.<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup>Excluding the positive non-recurring impact of (EURO)167 million related to the restructuring of the debt used to acquire London Gatwick airport, recognised in the first half of 2023, the average cost of gross debt in 2023 would have been 4.6%.16 Figures at 100% including passenger numbers at all managed airports over the full period.17 Ebit / revenue.18 As announced during the Capital Markets Day dedicated to Cobra IS on 12 December 2023.19 Raios do Parnaiba and Mundo\u00a0Novo in Brazil, with combined capacity of 0.6\u00a0GW, along with around 12 further projects in Spain with combined capacity of 0.8 GW.20 Wholly-owned.21 40%-owned.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This press release is an official information document of the VINCI Group.</p><p>INVESTOR RELATIONSGr\u00e9goire THIBAULTTel: +33 (0)1 57 98 63 84<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DXNjFwDlOYRH3T6NlS1nbxTalgbaBWluZe5SnI-D2yAjakXMUZyRicKiUQhTdGaBeVlr0SYYgeJ3TshM-9QVS0NP6SKbniCvAhz_a-Tli3i-jaTOLPGSfWWK7URgjz1r\">gregoire.thibault@vinci.com</url></p><p>Boris VALETTel: +33 (0)1 57 98 62 84<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RqkDnuGeaImOoTgwu3K4AGb1JTL38aOMpF5Rfx0RmmFbYLoiSIFj-XASz0vqc1-RyN8Z7KBuOgo0SLFqarTmjy7Nt1bLZdNBbgjLhOnVRms=\">boris.valet@vinci.com</url></p><p>PRESS CONTACTVINCI Press DepartmentTel: +33 (0)1 57 98 62 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:88media.relations@vinci.com\">88media.relations@vinci.com</email></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/5b255786-36ec-439a-b31d-af760d335b0d\">CP VINCI FY 2023 EN</url></p>", "publisher": "GlobeNewswire - English", "instances": ["The Energy business also generated record free cash flow despite its investments in green power generation.
