Housing and the Legion, was a hot box. The 61-year-old lived on the tenth floor, in a small, east-facing studio where the morning sun would stream in through a wall of windows - only one of which could be opened. She had no air conditioner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was June 2021 and the heat dome settling over the normally temperate lower mainland would soon break temperature records and make headlines. The provincial coroner would later find extreme heat contributed to hundreds of deaths. Ninety per cent of the victims were, like McKinlay, 60 years and older. Most also had a chronic health condition and lived alone in old, poorly insulated housing without air conditioning. McKinlay ticked all the boxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We knew the heat dome was pretty nasty,\" said Jeanne Hansen, McKinlay's sister. \"We were checking in. That day, she said she'd gone out for her walk, that she was OK, that everything was fine.\"</p><p>McKinlay hadn't told her sister that her fan - the only thing keeping her cool - was broken.</p><p>The deadly temperatures in June 2021 spurred B.C. to the forefront of Canada's fight against extreme heat. The province developed an early warning system that sent alerts to cell phones. It said it would spend $30 million on a new program to give 28,000 air conditioners to medically vulnerable and low-income people by 2026. It updated the provincial building code to require cooling in at least one room in new buildings, among other measures.</p><p>But four years after the pledges were made, many remain vulnerable. The free air conditioner program struggled to find its footing, and then de-prioritized the low-income people who need it the most. The cooling centres have often sat empty, according to one 2025 study. The B.C. Building Code update doesn't include buildings constructed before March 2024, which are more likely to be rentals or subsidized housing.</p><p>Municipalities put forward a motion to push for a provincial maximum indoor temperature law that would include older buildings, but the motion failed.</p><p>Tenants, advocates and frustrated lawmakers are concerned the province is not moving fast enough to protect seniors from the next life-threatening heat wave.</p><p>The stakes are high: Without more safeguards to protect people from high temperatures, by 2030 the heat could kill an average of more than 1,300 people, hospitalize 6,000, and cost at least $100 million in hospital expenses every year in B.C. alone, according to a report by the Canadian Climate Institute.</p><p>\"B.C. has had to play catch-up incredibly fast - they've had to go from zero to 100 in a couple of years,\" says Ryan Ness, one of the authors of the report. \"They've got some things in place - especially in terms of how to respond in terms of emergencies, but in terms of adapting and preventing things from getting to a crisis point, there's still a lot that needs to be done.\"</p><p>At the Legion Manor, which houses seniors and veterans, a reporter who visited last summer found the province's push for greater protection appeared to fall short of what residents need. While the Manor had turned the top-floor rec room into a cooling room, it was empty on the hot afternoon the reporter visited. The Manor had acquired heat-blocking rubber curtains, but in early August 2024 the drapes sat in a pile in a storage room. Misters had been installed in the building's concrete courtyard, but they were turned off. On the ninth floor, a resident waited for an air conditioner he had applied for weeks before.</p><p>Just one floor up and down the hall is where, in June 2021, McKinlay sweltered.</p><p>Heat is the 'silent killer'</p><p>That summer, it seemed everybody underestimated the heat. They were focused on the fires. As Canada warms twice as fast as the global average thanks in part to fossil fuel pollution, wildfires are becoming more frequent and ferocious. They decimate forests, spark mass evacuations and cost a fortune in damages. The entire town of Lytton, B.C., burned to the ground.</p><p>But the fires are nowhere near as lethal. A provincial coroner's report revealed that McKinlay and at least 618 other people had been killed by extreme temperatures during the 2021 heat dome. Of the 618 people who died, two-thirds were 70 or older; more than half lived alone.</p><p>\"We often refer to heat as the silent killer for that reason, but it's becoming less and less silent in Canada,\" said Sarah Henderson, a senior environmental health scientist at B.C.'s Centre for Disease Control. \"For people in public health, everyone knows that heat is the biggest risk.\"</p><p>Heat sensitivity is influenced by age more than by any other risk factor. When we age, our bodies become less efficient at regulating body temperature and staying hydrated. Older adults are also more likely to be on medications that impede the body's temperature regulation. When it's hot, older people are more susceptible to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or heart attacks or other cardiovascular issues. Heat can also reduce cognitive function, causing delirium or confusion.</p><p>Those with arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, or other chronic health conditions; as well as those who are socially isolated, who live alone; and lower-income people are all more vulnerable to heat-related deaths.</p><p>McKinlay was 61. She lived alone on a fixed income. She had schizophrenia and was taking antipsychotic medications, which can make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature.</p><p>Her two sisters checked up on her by phone, as they often did. Neighbours and the building managers had been trying to look out for one another, too. On June 29, a day after temperatures soared to 42 C, a neighbour repeatedly knocked on McKinlay's door but got no response. When the police came, they found McKinlay in her chair, wearing her sweatshirt and jeans. McKinlay had died overnight, the coroner later said, from \"effects of heat.\" She had put on extra layers when she started to feel shivery, a common symptom of hyperthermia.</p><p>Housing in materially deprived neighbourhoods like the New Westminster community McKinlay lived in is more likely to be older, poorly insulated and of a lower quality, which means the living space heats up faster and stays hot for longer than in better insulated homes. Ninety-eight per cent of the heat dome deaths happened indoors.</p><p>Air conditioning program had cold start</p><p>In temperate B.C., where average monthly temperatures fluctuate between zero and 20 C year-round, households have had the lowest rate of air conditioning in the country, with only three in 10 residents having access to cooling, according to a 2023 study.</p><p>In June 2023 - two years after the heat dome - the province and BC Hydro invested $10 million to launch a free air conditioner program. After the first year, the program installed just over 7,000 units, not yet enough to meet demand. Then the province put $20 million more into the program, bringing the total investment to $30 million. B.C.'s Ministry of Health said more than 27,500 air conditioning units had been distributed. A 2024 BC Hydro survey found that access to cooling in B.C. homes had increased to five in 10 residents - though it's hard to pinpoint whether that rise is due to the air conditioner program or people buying more air conditioners as it gets hotter.</p><p>The application process for the air conditioner program was inaccessible for some. When the program launched, applications were only available online, which meant that people with low computer literacy - older adults among them - struggled to access the form. An applicant also needed a BC Hydro account, but renters in social housing don't have one.</p><p>Just one resident in the Legion Manor applied for an air conditioner the summer the program launched, according to Sharon Ennis, the building manager. She started making the air conditioner applications a priority. Once paper applications were allowed, she lent a hand to tenants who wanted to apply. Ten residents had applied by the end of last summer.</p><p>Don Brookes, who on a hot afternoon in August 2024 showed a reporter his small apartment where it felt even hotter, said he had applied a few weeks before and was waiting to see if he had been approved. The average wait time for an air conditioner, said BC Hydro, is four weeks from application to installation. But in the summer of 2024, Ennis said at the time, residents at the Legion manor waited 8 to 12 weeks or longer.</p><p>\"It gets really hot in my apartment in the summer,\" Brookes said. \"When it heats up, I'll usually go downstairs, and I sit in the cool, shaded corner of the patio.\"</p><p>The 65-year-old lives one floor below where McKinlay died.</p><p>A year later, Brookes says he still hasn't received an air conditioner and that he has not heard from BC Hydro about if and why his application was rejected. BC Hydro said it couldn't offer particulars on Brookes' case, but said, in general, that delayed installation most commonly occurs \"when we have incomplete applications, or if customers are not readily available for installation.\"</p><p>There were other hoops for applicants to jump through: The application required either a recommendation letter from the regional health authority or proof that an applicant's income didn't exceed a certain threshold. Obtaining proof of income was challenging for those who were previously unhoused or had never set up an account with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p><p>Renters needed to provide a signed consent form from their landlord, though landlords could refuse to allow air conditioner installation.</p><p>Nadine Nakagawa, New Westminster councillor and a renter, said her tenancy agreement prohibited air conditioners. She suspected it had something to do with the esthetics of the building. \"Even if I took one of those free air conditioners, I'm not allowed to have it,\" Nakagawa said. Judith Peuvergne, a representative of Arpeg Group, the developer that owns and manages Nakagawa's building, said while window-mounted air conditioning units are prohibited due to \"both design and safety concerns due to the current window configuration,\" portable interior air conditioning units are permitted. Building management also keeps a dozen portable AC units that it offers for a $100 refundable deposit, Peuvergne added.</p><p>Nakagawa has heard similar concerns from her constituents. \"I hear a lot from people saying that doesn't work for me, for any number of reasons - mostly because landlords will not allow it, or it doesn't work with their housing situation.\"</p><p>The air conditioning program distributed more than 27,500 units but the $30 million has been exhausted. There are 660,000 rental households in the province, and seniors make up 20 per cent of total renters.</p><p>Disability and housing advocate Gabrielle Peters, who suffered a heat stroke during the heat dome, said there shouldn't be a cap on the number of air conditioners the province will supply for people in need. \"It shouldn't be based on a Black Friday sale logic,\" she said, where there's a limited supply and only \"the first 500 people through the door get an air conditioner,\" she said. BC Hydro said it's never had to turn away customers due to a limited number of AC units being available.</p><p>In September 2024, BC Hydro and the province narrowed the eligibility requirements, shutting the program down to applications on an income basis. Now, only people who are getting home care through provincial programs can access free air conditioners with a referral from their health authority. This means that low-income people, and people whose health issues don't meet the threshold for home care - like some with chronic illnesses - can't access the program.</p><p>BC Hydro told the Star it has among the lowest electricity rates in North America and pointed to programs like its rebates - including $50 off eligible portable air conditioners and $30 off air purifiers - as well as free energy assessments and energy saving kits. It said it has funding to renew the air conditioner program and will continue to make units available to medically vulnerable customers through health care authority referrals, until March 2028.</p><p>This year at the Legion Manor, nobody has applied for an air conditioner because of the change in policy, building manager Ennis said. The building bought a \"loaner\" air conditioner, free for residents to borrow, and now has extra fans, too, she added.</p><p>Critics say a program designed to help the vulnerable should not throw up barriers to them. This May, advocates in B.C. called on BC Hydro to cut the red tape around the air conditioner program and make it more accessible to low-income people.</p><p>Cooling centres hard to access for those who need them most</p><p>Cooling centres are a cornerstone of B.C.'s extreme heat strategy. In 2024, more than 60 communities, including First Nations, opened cooling centres, according to B.C.'s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness. Since 2022, the province has put $689,000 towards cooling centres in 190 local governments and First Nations. Experts emphasized that their effectiveness has been limited and least accessible for the people who really need them.</p><p>When it's the middle of a heat wave and someone is mobility-challenged, without a car, low-income and vulnerable to high temperatures, it's tough to get to a cooling centre. In municipalities in Metro Vancouver, unpredictable bus schedules, inaccessible stops and buses, and long travel times with multiple transfers can make it even tougher, said Liv Yoon, a researcher with the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Yoon conducted a study on the usefulness of cooling centres and found the barriers often outweighed the benefits for older adults.</p><p>Locals Yoon talked to were unsure where the cooling centres were, when they were open, or even what they were. Many of the 60 metro Vancouver residents Yoon interviewed \"thought we meant shelters, that are only meant for unhoused people.\" \"There is a lack of clarity about what these are, especially if you're a senior and you're not digitally plugged in,\" she said.</p><p>\"Cooling centres are kind of moot. People just want to be comfortable where they live,\" said Yoon.</p><p>On a hot weekday morning in early August 2024, volunteers served coffee, smoothies and pastries in the lobby of Veterans' Manor in Vancouver's downtown east side. The volunteers worked with Whole Way House, a non-profit that runs community programming across the city.</p><p>Resident Robert Busch sipped a cup of coffee and chatted with his neighbours. Busch, 70, has lived in an apartment in a low-income B.C. Housing building for veterans and older men at risk of homelessness, since 2017. He's had five heart attacks in as many years, and suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, as well as lung disease, which makes it hard for him to breathe. Busch is on end-of-life care, but he's able to stay at home with the support of his doctors and support workers.</p><p>\"I have a tough time dealing with the heat, and my room is like an oven,\" he said. \"I'm so sick I can barely do anything. I'm stuck in my room because I usually don't have the energy to get down here, and I can't breathe at all. It's terrible.\"</p><p>Whole Way House has turned the building's lobby into a cooling centre, where it hosts these coffee hours three mornings a week as a way to draw residents out of their overheated rooms. Later that same morning, Robert Busch attended a workshop with a CRA representative, organized by the non-profit, to help residents who hadn't filed their taxes in a while get their proof of income in order to apply for an air conditioner. (Last summer, when the Star visited Whole Way House, the program eligibility criteria had not yet changed.)</p><p>\"I like it here, it's like its own little community,\" Busch said of Veterans' Manor. By summer 2025, Busch had received his free air conditioner from BC Hydro. </p><p>A study by the National Institute on Ageing found that four in 10 adults age 50 and over in Canada are socially isolated. The isolation makes heat waves deadlier. Older people who live alone and don't have regular contact with others are more vulnerable to high temperatures. During the 2021 heat dome, more than half of those who died had lived alone, and were found during a wellness check by family or friends, a health-care support worker, or police.</p><p>Drawing older residents out of their rooms and ushering them into social interactions is one of the best ways to protect them from the heat.</p><p>\"Having that person who calls you or emails you to say how are you doing today is really key to making sure that people are OK,\" says Jennifer Baumbusch, a gerontological researcher at UBC and nurse practitioner. \"Because (heat) sneaks up on you.\"</p><p>The Legion Manor, where McKinlay lived, now hosts biweekly barbecues in the top floor cooling room. The building also launched a pilot community care program where care aides conduct daily checks on residents. \"So that nobody slips through the cracks, and for making sure we don't lose anyone to the heat,\" Ennis said.</p><p>Wellness checks from landlords or health-care workers are a good start, but Jenny Konkin, president and co-founder of Whole Way House, has found that to build community, people \"want an opportunity to contribute.\"</p><p>\"So, whether that's volunteering to help make coffee or set up the tables or doing an art program or learning something new, it helps us as humans, I think, to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves,\" she said.</p><p>Push for bylaws on max indoor temperature</p><p>Social connections alone aren't enough to safeguard against the heat. McKinlay knew many in her community, but those connections could not protect her from her unsafe apartment.</p><p>After the heat dome, B.C. changed its building code to require new buildings have one cool space under 26 degrees. The regulation doesn't apply to apartments and residences that have already been built, like McKinlay's former apartment in the Legion Manor.</p><p>There has been a growing push by tenants' rights and environmental advocacy groups for maximum indoor temperature bylaws in existing buildings. These laws would cap indoor temperatures at 26 C in at least one room in each residence during heat events, just as municipalities have minimum indoor temperature laws regulating how cold a residence can get in the winter.</p><p>Some B.C. municipalities are now trying to write their own new rules so that a maximum indoor temperature law applies to all types of buildings.</p><p>New Westminster councillors Nakagawa and Tasha Henderson are pushing for legislation that ensures each unit has at least one cool room, not including the bathroom. The council is now examining how to implement the potential bylaw. In May 2025, it passed a law that would ban buildings in the city from prohibiting air conditioners. In fall 2024, Port Moody, another city in the metro Vancouver area, amended its standards of building bylaw to require that landlords can't prohibit air conditioners, and that they must be kept in good working order.</p><p>A representative from the B.C. Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said the province is working to develop requirements for existing buildings by 2030.</p><p>A Pembina Institute study found that retrofitting low income residences experiencing energy poverty across Canada could cost $2.8 billion annually from 2025 to 2050 in public investment, raising questions about how it will be funded and whether most landlords will absorb the cost.</p><p>'Like opening an oven door'</p><p>Nearly four years after Hansen and Armstrong lost their sister to the heat, Hansen struggles as she revisits that summer. \"I have a lot of guilt associated with Tracey's death. It's my biggest regret,\" she said.</p><p>As soon as she and her sister entered McKinlay's apartment the day after she died, \"It was like opening an oven door. ... Had I known, we would've picked her up and taken her somewhere safe,\" Hansen said.</p><p>Hansen wanted to do something to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat but struggled a bit to figure out how.</p><p>She doubted whether giving everyone an air conditioner would be effective. \"More than likely a lot of the elderly wouldn't use it, because they would be afraid of running their electricity bill up, and many of them have to choose between food and medication,\" she said.</p><p>In the weeks after McKinlay's death, the sisters launched Tracey's Legacy and collected 80 fans for McKinlay's neighbours. No other solutions seemed feasible, simple and low-cost.</p><p>On the day they donated the fans, residents came out to say thank you and share stories about her.</p><p>\"(I) blame myself,\" Hansen said. \"I didn't physically go and check on her.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025080276246904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD9-NH03-RRPF-60D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Housing and the Legion, was a hot box. The 61-year-old lived on the tenth floor, in a small, east-facing studio where the morning sun would stream in through a wall of windows - only one of which could be opened. She had no air conditioner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was June 2021 and the heat dome settling over the normally temperate lower mainland would soon break temperature records and make headlines. The provincial coroner would later find extreme heat contributed to hundreds of deaths. Ninety per cent of the victims were, like McKinlay, 60 years and older. Most also had a chronic health condition and lived alone in old, poorly insulated housing without air conditioning. McKinlay ticked all the boxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We knew the heat dome was pretty nasty,\" said Jeanne Hansen, McKinlay's sister. \"We were checking in. That day, she said she'd gone out for her walk, that she was OK, that everything was fine.\"</p><p>McKinlay hadn't told her sister that her fan - the only thing keeping her cool - was broken.</p><p>The deadly temperatures in June 2021 spurred B.C. to the forefront of Canada's fight against extreme heat. The province developed an early warning system that sent alerts to cell phones. It said it would spend $30 million on a new program to give 28,000 air conditioners to medically vulnerable and low-income people by 2026. It updated the provincial building code to require cooling in at least one room in new buildings, among other measures.</p><p>But four years after the pledges were made, many remain vulnerable. The free air conditioner program struggled to find its footing, and then de-prioritized the low-income people who need it the most. The cooling centres have often sat empty, according to one 2025 study. The B.C. Building Code update doesn't include buildings constructed before March 2024, which are more likely to be rentals or subsidized housing.</p><p>Municipalities put forward a motion to push for a provincial maximum indoor temperature law that would include older buildings, but the motion failed.</p><p>Tenants, advocates and frustrated lawmakers are concerned the province is not moving fast enough to protect seniors from the next life-threatening heat wave.</p><p>The stakes are high: Without more safeguards to protect people from high temperatures, by 2030 the heat could kill an average of more than 1,300 people, hospitalize 6,000, and cost at least $100 million in hospital expenses every year in B.C. alone, according to a report by the Canadian Climate Institute.</p><p>\"B.C. has had to play catch-up incredibly fast - they've had to go from zero to 100 in a couple of years,\" says Ryan Ness, one of the authors of the report. \"They've got some things in place - especially in terms of how to respond in terms of emergencies, but in terms of adapting and preventing things from getting to a crisis point, there's still a lot that needs to be done.\"</p><p>At the Legion Manor, which houses seniors and veterans, a reporter who visited last summer found the province's push for greater protection appeared to fall short of what residents need. While the Manor had turned the top-floor rec room into a cooling room, it was empty on the hot afternoon the reporter visited. The Manor had acquired heat-blocking rubber curtains, but in early August 2024 the drapes sat in a pile in a storage room. Misters had been installed in the building's concrete courtyard, but they were turned off. On the ninth floor, a resident waited for an air conditioner he had applied for weeks before.</p><p>Just one floor up and down the hall is where, in June 2021, McKinlay sweltered.</p><p>Heat is the 'silent killer'</p><p>That summer, it seemed everybody underestimated the heat. They were focused on the fires. As Canada warms twice as fast as the global average thanks in part to fossil fuel pollution, wildfires are becoming more frequent and ferocious. They decimate forests, spark mass evacuations and cost a fortune in damages. The entire town of Lytton, B.C., burned to the ground.</p><p>But the fires are nowhere near as lethal. A provincial coroner's report revealed that McKinlay and at least 618 other people had been killed by extreme temperatures during the 2021 heat dome. Of the 618 people who died, two-thirds were 70 or older; more than half lived alone.</p><p>\"We often refer to heat as the silent killer for that reason, but it's becoming less and less silent in Canada,\" said Sarah Henderson, a senior environmental health scientist at B.C.'s Centre for Disease Control. \"For people in public health, everyone knows that heat is the biggest risk.\"</p><p>Heat sensitivity is influenced by age more than by any other risk factor. When we age, our bodies become less efficient at regulating body temperature and staying hydrated. Older adults are also more likely to be on medications that impede the body's temperature regulation. When it's hot, older people are more susceptible to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or heart attacks or other cardiovascular issues. Heat can also reduce cognitive function, causing delirium or confusion.</p><p>Those with arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, or other chronic health conditions; as well as those who are socially isolated, who live alone; and lower-income people are all more vulnerable to heat-related deaths.</p><p>McKinlay was 61. She lived alone on a fixed income. She had schizophrenia and was taking antipsychotic medications, which can make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature.</p><p>Her two sisters checked up on her by phone, as they often did. Neighbours and the building managers had been trying to look out for one another, too. On June 29, a day after temperatures soared to 42 C, a neighbour repeatedly knocked on McKinlay's door but got no response. When the police came, they found McKinlay in her chair, wearing her sweatshirt and jeans. McKinlay had died overnight, the coroner later said, from \"effects of heat.\" She had put on extra layers when she started to feel shivery, a common symptom of hyperthermia.</p><p>Housing in materially deprived neighbourhoods like the New Westminster community McKinlay lived in is more likely to be older, poorly insulated and of a lower quality, which means the living space heats up faster and stays hot for longer than in better insulated homes. Ninety-eight per cent of the heat dome deaths happened indoors.</p><p>Air conditioning program had cold start</p><p>In temperate B.C., where average monthly temperatures fluctuate between zero and 20 C year-round, households have had the lowest rate of air conditioning in the country, with only three in 10 residents having access to cooling, according to a 2023 study.</p><p>In June 2023 - two years after the heat dome - the province and BC Hydro invested $10 million to launch a free air conditioner program. After the first year, the program installed just over 7,000 units, not yet enough to meet demand. Then the province put $20 million more into the program, bringing the total investment to $30 million. B.C.'s Ministry of Health said more than 27,500 air conditioning units had been distributed. A 2024 BC Hydro survey found that access to cooling in B.C. homes had increased to five in 10 residents - though it's hard to pinpoint whether that rise is due to the air conditioner program or people buying more air conditioners as it gets hotter.</p><p>The application process for the air conditioner program was inaccessible for some. When the program launched, applications were only available online, which meant that people with low computer literacy - older adults among them - struggled to access the form. An applicant also needed a BC Hydro account, but renters in social housing don't have one.</p><p>Just one resident in the Legion Manor applied for an air conditioner the summer the program launched, according to Sharon Ennis, the building manager. She started making the air conditioner applications a priority. Once paper applications were allowed, she lent a hand to tenants who wanted to apply. Ten residents had applied by the end of last summer.</p><p>Don Brookes, who on a hot afternoon in August 2024 showed a reporter his small apartment where it felt even hotter, said he had applied a few weeks before and was waiting to see if he had been approved. The average wait time for an air conditioner, said BC Hydro, is four weeks from application to installation. But in the summer of 2024, Ennis said at the time, residents at the Legion manor waited 8 to 12 weeks or longer.</p><p>\"It gets really hot in my apartment in the summer,\" Brookes said. \"When it heats up, I'll usually go downstairs, and I sit in the cool, shaded corner of the patio.\"</p><p>The 65-year-old lives one floor below where McKinlay died.</p><p>A year later, Brookes says he still hasn't received an air conditioner and that he has not heard from BC Hydro about if and why his application was rejected. BC Hydro said it couldn't offer particulars on Brookes' case, but said, in general, that delayed installation most commonly occurs \"when we have incomplete applications, or if customers are not readily available for installation.\"</p><p>There were other hoops for applicants to jump through: The application required either a recommendation letter from the regional health authority or proof that an applicant's income didn't exceed a certain threshold. Obtaining proof of income was challenging for those who were previously unhoused or had never set up an account with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p><p>Renters needed to provide a signed consent form from their landlord, though landlords could refuse to allow air conditioner installation.</p><p>Nadine Nakagawa, New Westminster councillor and a renter, said her tenancy agreement prohibited air conditioners. She suspected it had something to do with the esthetics of the building. \"Even if I took one of those free air conditioners, I'm not allowed to have it,\" Nakagawa said. Judith Peuvergne, a representative of Arpeg Group, the developer that owns and manages Nakagawa's building, said while window-mounted air conditioning units are prohibited due to \"both design and safety concerns due to the current window configuration,\" portable interior air conditioning units are permitted. Building management also keeps a dozen portable AC units that it offers for a $100 refundable deposit, Peuvergne added.</p><p>Nakagawa has heard similar concerns from her constituents. \"I hear a lot from people saying that doesn't work for me, for any number of reasons - mostly because landlords will not allow it, or it doesn't work with their housing situation.\"</p><p>The air conditioning program distributed more than 27,500 units but the $30 million has been exhausted. There are 660,000 rental households in the province, and seniors make up 20 per cent of total renters.</p><p>Disability and housing advocate Gabrielle Peters, who suffered a heat stroke during the heat dome, said there shouldn't be a cap on the number of air conditioners the province will supply for people in need. \"It shouldn't be based on a Black Friday sale logic,\" she said, where there's a limited supply and only \"the first 500 people through the door get an air conditioner,\" she said. BC Hydro said it's never had to turn away customers due to a limited number of AC units being available.</p><p>In September 2024, BC Hydro and the province narrowed the eligibility requirements, shutting the program down to applications on an income basis. Now, only people who are getting home care through provincial programs can access free air conditioners with a referral from their health authority. This means that low-income people, and people whose health issues don't meet the threshold for home care - like some with chronic illnesses - can't access the program.</p><p>BC Hydro told the Star it has among the lowest electricity rates in North America and pointed to programs like its rebates - including $50 off eligible portable air conditioners and $30 off air purifiers - as well as free energy assessments and energy saving kits. It said it has funding to renew the air conditioner program and will continue to make units available to medically vulnerable customers through health care authority referrals, until March 2028.</p><p>This year at the Legion Manor, nobody has applied for an air conditioner because of the change in policy, building manager Ennis said. The building bought a \"loaner\" air conditioner, free for residents to borrow, and now has extra fans, too, she added.</p><p>Critics say a program designed to help the vulnerable should not throw up barriers to them. This May, advocates in B.C. called on BC Hydro to cut the red tape around the air conditioner program and make it more accessible to low-income people.</p><p>Cooling centres hard to access for those who need them most</p><p>Cooling centres are a cornerstone of B.C.'s extreme heat strategy. In 2024, more than 60 communities, including First Nations, opened cooling centres, according to B.C.'s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness. Since 2022, the province has put $689,000 towards cooling centres in 190 local governments and First Nations. Experts emphasized that their effectiveness has been limited and least accessible for the people who really need them.</p><p>When it's the middle of a heat wave and someone is mobility-challenged, without a car, low-income and vulnerable to high temperatures, it's tough to get to a cooling centre. In municipalities in Metro Vancouver, unpredictable bus schedules, inaccessible stops and buses, and long travel times with multiple transfers can make it even tougher, said Liv Yoon, a researcher with the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Yoon conducted a study on the usefulness of cooling centres and found the barriers often outweighed the benefits for older adults.</p><p>Locals Yoon talked to were unsure where the cooling centres were, when they were open, or even what they were. Many of the 60 metro Vancouver residents Yoon interviewed \"thought we meant shelters, that are only meant for unhoused people.\" \"There is a lack of clarity about what these are, especially if you're a senior and you're not digitally plugged in,\" she said.</p><p>\"Cooling centres are kind of moot. People just want to be comfortable where they live,\" said Yoon.</p><p>On a hot weekday morning in early August 2024, volunteers served coffee, smoothies and pastries in the lobby of Veterans' Manor in Vancouver's downtown east side. The volunteers worked with Whole Way House, a non-profit that runs community programming across the city.</p><p>Resident Robert Busch sipped a cup of coffee and chatted with his neighbours. Busch, 70, has lived in an apartment in a low-income B.C. Housing building for veterans and older men at risk of homelessness, since 2017. He's had five heart attacks in as many years, and suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, as well as lung disease, which makes it hard for him to breathe. Busch is on end-of-life care, but he's able to stay at home with the support of his doctors and support workers.</p><p>\"I have a tough time dealing with the heat, and my room is like an oven,\" he said. \"I'm so sick I can barely do anything. I'm stuck in my room because I usually don't have the energy to get down here, and I can't breathe at all. It's terrible.\"</p><p>Whole Way House has turned the building's lobby into a cooling centre, where it hosts these coffee hours three mornings a week as a way to draw residents out of their overheated rooms. Later that same morning, Robert Busch attended a workshop with a CRA representative, organized by the non-profit, to help residents who hadn't filed their taxes in a while get their proof of income in order to apply for an air conditioner. (Last summer, when the Star visited Whole Way House, the program eligibility criteria had not yet changed.)</p><p>\"I like it here, it's like its own little community,\" Busch said of Veterans' Manor. By summer 2025, Busch had received his free air conditioner from BC Hydro. </p><p>A study by the National Institute on Ageing found that four in 10 adults age 50 and over in Canada are socially isolated. The isolation makes heat waves deadlier. Older people who live alone and don't have regular contact with others are more vulnerable to high temperatures. During the 2021 heat dome, more than half of those who died had lived alone, and were found during a wellness check by family or friends, a health-care support worker, or police.</p><p>Drawing older residents out of their rooms and ushering them into social interactions is one of the best ways to protect them from the heat.</p><p>\"Having that person who calls you or emails you to say how are you doing today is really key to making sure that people are OK,\" says Jennifer Baumbusch, a gerontological researcher at UBC and nurse practitioner. \"Because (heat) sneaks up on you.\"</p><p>The Legion Manor, where McKinlay lived, now hosts biweekly barbecues in the top floor cooling room. The building also launched a pilot community care program where care aides conduct daily checks on residents. \"So that nobody slips through the cracks, and for making sure we don't lose anyone to the heat,\" Ennis said.</p><p>Wellness checks from landlords or health-care workers are a good start, but Jenny Konkin, president and co-founder of Whole Way House, has found that to build community, people \"want an opportunity to contribute.\"</p><p>\"So, whether that's volunteering to help make coffee or set up the tables or doing an art program or learning something new, it helps us as humans, I think, to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves,\" she said.</p><p>Push for bylaws on max indoor temperature</p><p>Social connections alone aren't enough to safeguard against the heat. McKinlay knew many in her community, but those connections could not protect her from her unsafe apartment.</p><p>After the heat dome, B.C. changed its building code to require new buildings have one cool space under 26 degrees. The regulation doesn't apply to apartments and residences that have already been built, like McKinlay's former apartment in the Legion Manor.</p><p>There has been a growing push by tenants' rights and environmental advocacy groups for maximum indoor temperature bylaws in existing buildings. These laws would cap indoor temperatures at 26 C in at least one room in each residence during heat events, just as municipalities have minimum indoor temperature laws regulating how cold a residence can get in the winter.</p><p>Some B.C. municipalities are now trying to write their own new rules so that a maximum indoor temperature law applies to all types of buildings.</p><p>New Westminster councillors Nakagawa and Tasha Henderson are pushing for legislation that ensures each unit has at least one cool room, not including the bathroom. The council is now examining how to implement the potential bylaw. In May 2025, it passed a law that would ban buildings in the city from prohibiting air conditioners. In fall 2024, Port Moody, another city in the metro Vancouver area, amended its standards of building bylaw to require that landlords can't prohibit air conditioners, and that they must be kept in good working order.</p><p>A representative from the B.C. Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said the province is working to develop requirements for existing buildings by 2030.</p><p>A Pembina Institute study found that retrofitting low income residences experiencing energy poverty across Canada could cost $2.8 billion annually from 2025 to 2050 in public investment, raising questions about how it will be funded and whether most landlords will absorb the cost.</p><p>'Like opening an oven door'</p><p>Nearly four years after Hansen and Armstrong lost their sister to the heat, Hansen struggles as she revisits that summer. \"I have a lot of guilt associated with Tracey's death. It's my biggest regret,\" she said.</p><p>As soon as she and her sister entered McKinlay's apartment the day after she died, \"It was like opening an oven door. ... Had I known, we would've picked her up and taken her somewhere safe,\" Hansen said.</p><p>Hansen wanted to do something to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat but struggled a bit to figure out how.</p><p>She doubted whether giving everyone an air conditioner would be effective. \"More than likely a lot of the elderly wouldn't use it, because they would be afraid of running their electricity bill up, and many of them have to choose between food and medication,\" she said.</p><p>In the weeks after McKinlay's death, the sisters launched Tracey's Legacy and collected 80 fans for McKinlay's neighbours. No other solutions seemed feasible, simple and low-cost.</p><p>On the day they donated the fans, residents came out to say thank you and share stories about her.</p><p>\"(I) blame myself,\" Hansen said. \"I didn't physically go and check on her.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2025080276246676</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD9-NH03-RRPF-60D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

Tracey McKinlay insisted she was fine before saying goodbye to her sister and hanging up the phone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The temperature hadn't fallen below 20 C in three days, and McKinlay's apartment at the Legion Manor, a subsidized building for seniors operated by B.C. Housing and the Legion, was a hot box. The 61-year-old lived on the 10th floor, in a small, east-facing studio where the morning sun would stream in through a wall of windows - only one of which could be opened. She had no air conditioner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was June 2021 and the heat dome settling over the normally temperate lower mainland would soon break temperature records and make headlines. The provincial coroner would later find extreme heat contributed to hundreds of deaths. Ninety per cent of the victims were, like McKinlay, 60 years and older. Most also had a chronic health condition and lived alone in old, poorly insulated housing without air conditioning. McKinlay ticked all the boxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We knew the heat dome was pretty nasty,\" said Jeanne Hansen, McKinlay's sister. \"We were checking in. That day, she said she'd gone out for her walk, that she was OK, that everything was fine.\"</p><p>McKinlay hadn't told her sister that her fan - the only thing keeping her cool - was broken.</p><p>The deadly temperatures in June 2021 spurred B.C. to the forefront of Canada's fight against extreme heat. The province developed an early warning system that sent alerts to cell phones. It said it would spend $30 million on a new program to give 28,000 air conditioners to medically vulnerable and low-income people by 2026. It updated the provincial building code to require cooling in at least one room in new buildings, among other measures.</p><p>But four years after the pledges were made, many remain vulnerable. The free air conditioner program struggled to find its footing, and then de-prioritized the low-income people who need it the most. The cooling centres have often sat empty, according to one 2025 study. The B.C. Building Code update doesn't include buildings constructed before March 2024, which are more likely to be rentals or subsidized housing.</p><p>Municipalities put forward a motion to push for a provincial maximum indoor temperature law that would include older buildings, but the motion failed.</p><p>Tenants, advocates and frustrated lawmakers are concerned the province is not moving fast enough to protect seniors from the next life-threatening heat wave.</p><p>The stakes are high: Without more safeguards to protect people from high temperatures, by 2030 the heat could kill an average of more than 1,300 people, hospitalize 6,000, and cost at least $100 million in hospital expenses every year in B.C. alone, according to a report by the Canadian Climate Institute.</p><p>\"B.C. has had to play catch-up incredibly fast - they've had to go from zero to 100 in a couple of years,\" says Ryan Ness, one of the authors of the report. \"They've got some things in place - especially in terms of how to respond in terms of emergencies, but in terms of adapting and preventing things from getting to a crisis point, there's still a lot that needs to be done.\"</p><p>At the Legion Manor, which houses seniors and veterans, a reporter who visited last summer found the province's push for greater protection appeared to fall short of what residents need. While the Manor had turned the top-floor rec room into a cooling room, it was empty on the hot afternoon the reporter visited. The Manor had acquired heat-blocking rubber curtains, but in early August 2024 the drapes sat in a pile in a storage room. Misters had been installed in the building's concrete courtyard, but they were turned off. On the ninth floor, a resident waited for an air conditioner he had applied for weeks before.</p><p>Just one floor up and down the hall is where, in June 2021, McKinlay sweltered.</p><p>Heat is the 'silent killer'</p><p>That summer, it seemed everybody underestimated the heat. They were focused on the fires. As Canada warms twice as fast as the global average thanks to fossil fuel pollution, wildfires are becoming more frequent and ferocious. They decimate forests, spark mass evacuations and cost a fortune in damages. The entire town of Lytton, B.C., burned to the ground.</p><p>But the fires are nowhere near as lethal. A provincial coroner's report revealed that McKinlay and at least 618 other people had been killed by extreme temperatures during the 2021 heat dome. Of the 618 people who died, two-thirds were 70 or older; more than half lived alone.</p><p>\"We often refer to heat as the silent killer for that reason, but it's becoming less and less silent in Canada,\" said Sarah Henderson, a senior environmental health scientist at B.C.'s Centre for Disease Control. \"For people in public health, everyone knows that heat is the biggest risk.\"</p><p>Heat sensitivity is influenced by age more than by any other risk factor. When we age, our bodies become less efficient at regulating body temperature and staying hydrated. Older adults are also more likely to be on medications that impede the body's temperature regulation. When it's hot, older people are more susceptible to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, heart attacks or other cardiovascular issues. Heat can also reduce cognitive function, causing delirium or confusion.</p><p>Those with arthritis, depression, high blood pressure or other chronic health conditions; as well as those who are socially isolated, who live alone; and lower-income people are all more vulnerable to heat-related deaths.</p><p>McKinlay was 61. She lived alone on a fixed income. She had schizophrenia and was taking antipsychotic medications, which can make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature.</p><p>Her two sisters checked up on her by phone, as they often did. Neighbours and the building managers had been trying to look out for one another, too. On June 29, a day after temperatures soared to 42 C, a neighbour repeatedly knocked on McKinlay's door but got no response. When the police came, they found McKinlay in her chair, wearing her sweatshirt and jeans. McKinlay had died overnight, the coroner later said, from \"effects of heat.\" She had put on extra layers when she started to feel shivery, a common symptom of hyperthermia.</p><p>Housing in materially deprived neighbourhoods like the New Westminster community McKinlay lived in is more likely to be older, poorly insulated and of a lower quality, which means the living space heats up faster and stays hot for longer than in better insulated homes. Ninety-eight per cent of the heat dome deaths happened indoors.</p><p>Air conditioning program </p><p>had cold start</p><p>In temperate B.C., where average monthly temperatures fluctuate between zero and 20 C year-round, households have had the lowest rate of air conditioning in the country, with only three in 10 residents having access to cooling, according to a 2023 study.</p><p>In June 2023 - two years after the heat dome - the province and BC Hydro invested $10 million to launch a free air conditioner program. After the first year, the program installed just over 7,000 units, not yet enough to meet demand. Then the province put $20 million more into the program, bringing the total investment to $30 million. B.C.'s Ministry of Health said more than 27,500 air conditioning units had been distributed. A 2024 BC Hydro survey found that access to cooling in B.C. homes had increased to five in 10 residents - though it's hard to pinpoint whether that rise is due to the air conditioner program or people buying more air conditioners as it gets hotter.</p><p>The application process for the air conditioner program was inaccessible for some. When the program launched, applications were only available online, which meant that people with low computer literacy - older adults among them - struggled to access the form. An applicant also needed a BC Hydro account, but renters in social housing don't have one.</p><p>Just one resident in the Legion Manor applied for an air conditioner the summer the program launched, according to Sharon Ennis, the building manager. She started making the air conditioner applications a priority. Once paper applications were allowed, she lent a hand to tenants who wanted to apply. Ten residents had applied by the end of last summer.</p><p>Don Brookes, who on a hot afternoon in August 2024 showed a reporter his small apartment where it felt even hotter, said he had applied a few weeks before and was waiting to see if he had been approved. The average wait time for an air conditioner, said BC Hydro, is four weeks from application to installation. But in the summer of 2024, Ennis said at the time, residents at the Legion manor waited eight to 12 weeks or longer.</p><p>\"It gets really hot in my apartment in the summer,\" Brookes said. \"When it heats up, I'll usually go downstairs, and I sit in the cool, shaded corner of the patio.\"</p><p>The 65-year-old lives one floor below where McKinlay died.</p><p>A year later, Brookes says he still hasn't received an air conditioner and that he has not heard from BC Hydro about if and why his application was rejected. BC Hydro said it couldn't offer particulars on Brookes' case, but said, in general, that delayed installation most commonly occurs \"when we have incomplete applications, or if customers are not readily available for installation.\"</p><p>There were other hoops for applicants to jump through: The application required either a recommendation letter from the regional health authority or proof that an applicant's income didn't exceed a certain threshold. Obtaining proof of income was challenging for those who were previously unhoused or had never set up an account with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p><p>Renters needed to provide a signed consent form from their landlord, though landlords could refuse to allow air conditioner installation.</p><p>Nadine Nakagawa, New Westminster councillor and a renter, said her tenancy agreement prohibited air conditioners. She suspected it had something to do with the esthetics of the building. \"Even if I took one of those free air conditioners, I'm not allowed to have it,\" Nakagawa said. Judith Peuvergne, a representative of Arpeg Group, the developer that owns and manages Nakagawa's building, said while window-mounted air conditioning units are prohibited due to \"both design and safety concerns due to the current window configuration,\" portable interior air conditioning units are permitted. Building management also keeps a dozen portable AC units that it offers for a $100 refundable deposit, Peuvergne added.</p><p>Nakagawa has heard similar concerns from her constituents. \"I hear a lot from people saying that doesn't work for me, for any number of reasons - mostly because landlords will not allow it, or it doesn't work with their housing situation.\"</p><p>The air conditioning program distributed more than 27,500 units but the $30 million has been exhausted. There are 660,000 rental households in the province, and seniors make up 20 per cent of total renters.</p><p>Disability and housing advocate Gabrielle Peters, who suffered a heat stroke during the heat dome, said there shouldn't be a cap on the number of air conditioners the province will supply for people in need. \"It shouldn't be based on a Black Friday sale logic,\" she said, where there's a limited supply and only \"the first 500 people through the door get an air conditioner.\" BC Hydro said it's never had to turn away customers due to a limited number of AC units being available.</p><p>In September 2024, BC Hydro and the province narrowed the eligibility requirements, shutting the program down to applications on an income basis. Now, only people who are getting home care through provincial programs can access free air conditioners with a referral from their health authority. This means that low-income people, and people whose health issues don't meet the threshold for home care - like some with chronic illnesses - can't access the program.</p><p>BC Hydro told the Star it has among the lowest electricity rates in North America and pointed to programs like its rebates - including $50 off eligible portable air conditioners and $30 off air purifiers - as well as free energy assessments and energy saving kits. It said it has funding to renew the air conditioner program and will continue to make units available to medically vulnerable customers through health care authority referrals, until March 2028.</p><p>This year at the Legion Manor, nobody has applied for an air conditioner because of the change in policy, building manager Ennis said. The building bought a \"loaner\" air conditioner, free for residents to borrow, and now has extra fans, too, she added.</p><p>Critics say a program designed to help the vulnerable should not throw up barriers to them. This May, advocates in B.C. called on BC Hydro to cut the red tape around the air conditioner program and make it more accessible to low-income people.</p><p>Cooling centres hard to access </p><p>Cooling centres are a cornerstone of B.C.'s extreme heat strategy. In 2024, more than 60 communities, including First Nations, opened cooling centres, according to B.C.'s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness. Since 2022, the province has put $689,000 towards cooling centres in 190 local governments and First Nations. Experts emphasized that their effectiveness has been limited and least accessible for the people who really need them.</p><p>When it's the middle of a heat wave and someone is mobility-challenged, without a car, low-income and vulnerable to high temperatures, it's tough to get to a cooling centre.</p><p> In municipalities in Metro Vancouver, unpredictable bus schedules, inaccessible stops and buses, and long travel times with multiple transfers can make it even tougher, said Liv Yoon, a researcher with the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Yoon conducted a study on the usefulness of cooling centres and found the barriers often outweighed the benefits for older adults.</p><p>Locals Yoon talked to were unsure where the cooling centres were, when they were open, or even what they were. Many of the 60 metro Vancouver residents Yoon interviewed \"thought we meant shelters, that are only meant for unhoused people.\" </p><p>\"There is a lack of clarity about what these are, especially if you're a senior and you're not digitally plugged in,\" she said.</p><p>\"Cooling centres are kind of moot. People just want to be comfortable where they live.\"</p><p>On a hot weekday morning in early August 2024, volunteers served coffee, smoothies and pastries in the lobby of Veterans' Manor in Vancouver's downtown east side. The volunteers worked with Whole Way House, a non-profit that runs community programming across the city.</p><p>Resident Robert Busch sipped a cup of coffee and chatted with his neighbours. Busch, 70, has lived in an apartment in a low-income B.C. Housing building for veterans and older men at risk of homelessness, since 2017. He's had five heart attacks in as many years, and suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, as well as lung disease, which makes it hard for him to breathe. Busch is on end-of-life care, but he's able to stay at home with the support of his doctors and support workers.</p><p>\"I have a tough time dealing with the heat, and my room is like an oven,\" he said. \"I'm so sick I can barely do anything. I'm stuck in my room because I usually don't have the energy to get down here, and I can't breathe at all. It's terrible.\"</p><p>Whole Way House has turned the building's lobby into a cooling centre, where it hosts these coffee hours three mornings a week as a way to draw residents out of their overheated rooms. Later that same morning, Robert Busch attended a workshop with a CRA representative, organized by the non-profit, to help residents who hadn't filed their taxes in a while get their proof of income in order to apply for an air conditioner. (Last summer, when the Star visited Whole Way House, the program eligibility criteria had not yet changed.)</p><p>\"I like it here, it's like its own little community,\" Busch said of Veterans' Manor. By summer 2025, Busch had received his free air conditioner from BC Hydro. </p><p>A study by the National Institute on Ageing found that four in 10 adults age 50 and over in Canada are socially isolated. The isolation makes heat waves deadlier. Older people who live alone and don't have regular contact with others are more vulnerable to high temperatures. </p><p>During the 2021 heat dome, more than half of those who died had lived alone, and were found during a wellness check by family or friends, a health-care support worker, or police.</p><p>Drawing older residents out of their rooms and ushering them into social interactions is one of the best ways to protect them from the heat.</p><p>\"Having that person who calls you or emails you to say how are you doing today is really key to making sure that people are OK,\" says Jennifer Baumbusch, a gerontological researcher at UBC and nurse practitioner. \"Because (heat) sneaks up on you.\"</p><p>The Legion Manor, where McKinlay lived, now hosts biweekly barbecues in the top floor cooling room. The building also launched a pilot community care program where care aides conduct daily checks on residents. \"So that nobody slips through the cracks, and for making sure we don't lose anyone to the heat,\" Ennis said.</p><p>Wellness checks from landlords or health-care workers are a good start, but Jenny Konkin, president and co-founder of Whole Way House, has found that to build community, people \"want an opportunity to contribute.\"</p><p>\"So, whether that's volunteering to help make coffee or set up the tables or doing an art program or learning something new, it helps us as humans, I think, to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves,\" she said.</p><p>Push for bylaws </p><p>on max indoor temperature</p><p>Social connections alone aren't enough to safeguard against the heat. McKinlay knew many in her community, but those connections could not protect her from her unsafe apartment.</p><p>After the heat dome, B.C. changed its building code to require new buildings have one cool space under 26 degrees. </p><p>The regulation doesn't apply to apartments and residences that have already been built, like McKinlay's former apartment in the Legion Manor.</p><p>There has been a growing push by tenants' rights and environmental advocacy groups for maximum indoor temperature bylaws in existing buildings. These laws would cap indoor temperatures at 26 C in at least one room in each residence during heat events, just as municipalities have minimum indoor temperature laws regulating how cold a residence can get in the winter.</p><p>Some B.C. municipalities are now trying to write their own new rules so that a maximum indoor temperature law applies to all types of buildings.</p><p>New Westminster councillors Nakagawa and Tasha Henderson are pushing for legislation that ensures each unit has at least one cool room, not including the bathroom. The council is now examining how to implement the potential bylaw. In May 2025, it passed a law that would ban buildings in the city from prohibiting air conditioners. In fall 2024, Port Moody, another city in the metro Vancouver area, amended its standards of building bylaw to require that landlords can't prohibit air conditioners, and that they must be kept in good working order.</p><p>A representative from the B.C. Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said the province is working to develop requirements for existing buildings by 2030.</p><p>A Pembina Institute study found that retrofitting low income residences experiencing energy poverty across Canada could cost $2.8 billion annually from 2025 to 2050 in public investment, raising questions about how it will be funded and whether most landlords will absorb the cost.</p><p>'Like opening an oven door'</p><p>Nearly four years after Hansen and Armstrong lost their sister to the heat, Hansen struggles as she revisits that summer. \"I have a lot of guilt associated with Tracey's death. It's my biggest regret,\" she said.</p><p>As soon as she and her sister entered McKinlay's apartment the day after she died, \"It was like opening an oven door ... Had I known, we would've picked her up and taken her somewhere safe,\" Hansen said.</p><p>Hansen wanted to do something to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat but struggled a bit to figure out how.</p><p>She doubted whether giving everyone an air conditioner would be effective. \"More than likely a lot of the elderly wouldn't use it, because they would be afraid of running their electricity bill up, and many of them have to choose between food and medication,\" she said.</p><p>In the weeks after McKinlay's death, the sisters launched Tracey's Legacy and collected 80 fans for McKinlay's neighbours. No other solutions seemed feasible, simple and low-cost.</p><p>On the day they donated the fans, residents came out to say thank you and share stories about her.</p><p>\"(I) blame myself,\" Hansen said. \"I didn't physically go and check on her.\"</p><p>This article is part of an ongoing Toronto Star series produced in collaboration with Toronto Metropolitan University and the National Institute on Ageing.

The court warned that failure to fulfill this obligation could lead to legal consequences, including financial compensation and other forms of restitution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cFailure of a state to take an appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses, or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies, may constitute an internationally wrongful act, which is attributable to that state,\u201d ICJ president Yuji Iwasawa said, reading out the court\u2019s decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today, the tables have turned. The world's highest court provided us with a powerful new tool to protect people from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis \u2014 and to deliver justice for the harm their emissions have already caused,\" former UN human rights chief Mary Robinson said.</p><p>\"This is even better than we could have expected...We have the ICJ explicitly saying that fossil fuel production, subsidies, all of this, could be breaches of international law. I thought that was so beyond what was possible. I\u2019m still in ecstasy with everything that just happened,\" Greenpeace International legal counsel Danilo Garrido told The Pointer. \u201cThis will open the door for new cases, and hopefully bring justice to those, who despite having contributed the least to climate change, are already suffering its most severe consequences. The message of the Court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licenses and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of international law. Polluters must stop emitting and must pay for the harms they have caused.\u201d</p><p>The ICJ took six years to come to this decision, and it all began with young people demanding climate justice.</p><p>In 2019, a group of 27 law students at the University of the South Pacific and members of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC), frustrated by global inaction, convinced the government of Vanuatu to bring a case before the ICJ to clarify states\u2019 legal obligations under international law in addressing climate change.</p><p>In March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing climate change as \u201can unprecedented challenge of civilizational proportions\u201d and requesting an ICJ advisory opinion.</p><p>The court received a record 91 written submissions, over 100 oral statements, and 65 responses to follow-up questions.</p><p>The world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters argued that their obligations were limited to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p><p>In its submission, Canada defended its ongoing fossil fuel production by citing the flexibility within the Paris Agreement, stating that it \u201cdoes not contain explicit commitments related to the restriction of fossil fuel production,\u201d leaving each country to decide which measures to take to meet climate goals.</p><p>The ICJ decisively rejected this narrow view, affirming that a broader range of treaties also apply, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Montreal Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.</p><p>The opinion clarifies that obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement are not just voluntary.</p><p>In Canada, young activists have already taken both federal and provincial governments to court, including the ongoing La Rose case against the federal government and the Mathur case against the Doug Ford government in Ontario for violating the rights of young people by failing to adequately address the threat of climate change.\u00a0</p><p>The ICJ ruling could strengthen their efforts.</p><p>\u201cIt's a historic decision that we believe reinforces what is really the gruelling consensus from judges around the world, that the climate crisis is a human rights crisis. Today's decision\u2026has made it clear that governments have a responsibility to protect human rights in the face of growing climate threats,\u201d Ecojustice lawyer Fraser Thomson, who is leading the Mathur case, said.</p><p>\u201cThe ICJ has affirmed what the science and communities and Indigenous people have been saying for years, that a safe and healthy climate is a precondition to all of our human rights.\u201d</p><p>Launched in 2019, the same year Pacific Island students began the campaign that led to the ICJ opinion, Mathur and La Rose cases both argue that inaction on climate change by the government violates Sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protect the rights to life, liberty, security of the person and equality.</p><p>The youth plaintiffs argue that climate change disproportionately harms young people. From worsening air quality to increased mental health burdens, they say they will suffer the most severe consequences of environmental degradation unless Canada and Ontario take urgent and meaningful action.</p><p>\u201cWhen they delivered the opinion this morning, I was honestly taken aback. I was on the edge of my seat,\u201d climate Activist Albert Lalonde, also one of the 15 plaintiffs in the La Rose case, told The Pointer on July 23.</p><p>\u201cAt first, it took a while to get a sense of where it was going, but I\u2019ve been left with this strange feeling of, \u2018This is actually great,\u2019 and I'm not used to having great news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe woke up in a world without a real legal framework to address climate change. Now we have one. That\u2019s a huge shift,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lalonde notes that there has been debate over the \u201clex specialis rule\u201d, where more specific laws override general ones, the court interpreted international law in a way that reflects complex planetary realities.</p><p>He described Canada\u2019s response as \u201cbizarre,\u201d aligning with a new form of climate denialism, not denying climate change exists, but pretending that decarbonized pipelines are feasible.</p><p>\u201cThis opinion should have serious implications for Canadian policy. If we believe in science and the rule of law, then we must accept the obligations and thresholds the ICJ laid out as a bottom line.\u201d</p><p>One of the most consequential shifts, he said, is legal: the ICJ found that state emissions, not just individual projects or pieces of legislation, can constitute internationally wrongful acts.</p><p>If a causal link can be established between a state\u2019s emissions and harm in another country, the emitting state could be held internationally liable, whether through compensation, restitution, or by halting the activity causing harm.</p><p>\u201cUsually, constitutional challenges focus on one law or decision. In La Rose, our argument is that Canada\u2019s entire pattern of actions and emissions constitutes wrongful conduct, violating our Charter rights to life, liberty, and security\u2026and now we have international legal backing for that framing,\u201d Lalonde said.</p><p>\u201cEnforcement remains a challenge, but establishing this norm is itself powerful,\u201d which will be key as La Rose moves toward an eight-week trial beginning on October 26, 2026.</p><p>ICJ advisory opinions may be nonbinding, but Thomson says Canadian courts have historically cited them as authoritative interpretations of international law.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJudges weighing climate cases here will likely pay close attention to this one,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Because Canadian courts often interpret international law through the lens of the Charter, Thomson believes the ICJ\u2019s interpretation could provide persuasive guidance, especially as climate litigation remains relatively new territory.</p><p>\u201cThe Supreme Court has previously cited ICJ rulings when interpreting the Charter. That could happen in the Mathur case this December, or in La Rose, or in any future case holding governments accountable for the climate crisis,\u201d he said.</p><p>Greenpeace International\u2019s legal counsel, Danilo Garrido, clarifies that \"even though the opinion itself isn\u2019t binding, the ICJ found that two core obligations, the duty to prevent significant environmental harm and the duty to cooperate, are customary international law. That means they apply to all states, whether or not they\u2019re part of specific treaties. In practice, that makes this a huge legal win.\"</p><p>At a time when not only the younger generation, but also the world\u2019s highest court is calling for stronger climate action, Doug Ford is taking the country\u2019s most populous province in the wrong direction.\u00a0</p><p>In 2017, Ontario\u2019s electricity grid was 96 percent emissions-free with four percent of the province\u2019s electricity coming from fossil fuels, largely due to the successful phase-out of coal and major investments in renewable energy.\u00a0</p><p>By 2024, that number quadrupled to 16 percent, an IESO report highlighted.</p><p>The result? Emissions rose.</p><p>According to Canada\u2019s national emissions inventory, Ontario emitted 157 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2022, a 5.7 percent increase from 2020.</p><p>           The Ford government has set a target of reducing GHG emissions to 144 megatonnes by 2030, but its track record coupled with its latest energy strategy for Ontario, suggests they may fall short of this goal, potentially exposing the province and the country to significant environmental, legal and financial risks following the ICJ decision.\u00a0</p><p>On June 12, the provincial government unveiled \u2018Energy for Generations\u2019, which it touts as \u201cOntario\u2019s first-ever integrated energy plan\u201d, a roadmap designed to meet future energy needs, support housing development, and power what it calls \u201cthe most competitive economy in the G7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the turn of the century, our great grandparents had the vision to build Ontario\u2019s hydroelectric dams, later our grandparents started the build-out of Ontario\u2019s nuclear fleet, and today, that responsibility falls on us to build for the future,\u201d Minister of Energy and Mines Stephen Lecce said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>A key part of the plan is the construction of four small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) at the Darlington Nuclear Station near Oshawa.\u00a0</p><p>The untested, first-of-their-kind BWRX-300 reactors, designed by American-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, will depend on enriched uranium imports from the United States and require a new transmission line stretching from the Pickering or Darlington nuclear plants to supply power to much of Southern Ontario, and are expected to take seven to ten years to build.\u00a0</p><p>And it won\u2019t come cheap.</p><p>The PC government claims the SMR project will cost $20.9 billion, but a new report from the Ontario Clean Air Alliance estimates a far more likely price tag of at least $27 billion.</p><p>\u201cWe are going in the wrong direction,\u201d Ontario Clean Air Alliance chair Jack Gibbons told The Pointer.</p><p>Toronto resident David Smith shared with The Pointer his written submission to the IESO, calling for a shift toward decentralized, community-based energy systems like solar panels, geothermal, microgrids and storage.</p><p>\u201cWhy not Ontario, when wind and solar are well understood, lower cost, cleaner, faster to install, healthier for the population, and what will ultimately be used to replace gas?,\u201d Smith wrote, flagging issues with conflict of interest, particularly with Enbridge running the province\u2019s energy efficiency programs while profiting from gas use.</p><p>Fossil gas is expected to generate a quarter of Ontario\u2019s electricity by 2030, up from just four percent in 2017 under former premier Kathleen Wynne, marking a dramatic shift under Ford\u2019s government that reverses progress made under previous premiers to phase out dirty energy.</p><p>Gibbons notes that instead of importing more high-cost nuclear power, the province should be building a third line to southern Ontario, including downtown Toronto, from a Lake Ontario offshore wind farm.</p><p>But offshore wind isn\u2019t even on the table.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, the Doug Ford government is hostile to renewables, especially offshore wind power, and it's very pro-nuclear power and gas power. And therefore, it doesn't want to develop Lake Ontario wind power, which we need to do to move Ontario to a renewable energy future,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cOffshore wind generation has not been considered as part of the IESO\u2019s regional planning process due to the province\u2019s moratorium on off-shore wind that has been in place since 2011,\u201d the province\u2019s electricity system operator, Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), confirmed in a statement shared with The Pointer.\u00a0</p><p>Gibbons warns nuclear energy comes with significant challenges: it\u2019s slow to deploy, extremely expensive and will drive up electricity bills. In contrast, investing in energy efficiency and renewables would lower costs.\u00a0</p><p>Nuclear also produces toxic radioactive waste that remains hazardous for up to a million years, placing a long-term burden on future generations.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think it makes any sense,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the Ford government is pursuing it because of the very powerful nuclear lobby in Ontario, and that\u2019s the real problem.\u201d</p><p>A 2021 report by the United NationsEconomic Commission for Europe (UNECE) states that international climate goals may not be met without nuclear in the mix.\u00a0</p><p>But like Smith, environmental advocates in Ontario warn of serious drawbacks, both technological and economic.</p><p>Environmental Defence programs director Keith Brooks told The Pointer the Ford government\u2019s pride in building the first small modular reactors (SMRs) in the G7 should raise red flags.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere are no operating SMRs anywhere in the world right now. That means major risk; projects may not be completed on time, they might underperform, and they\u2019re likely to cost far more than expected,\u201d Brooks noted.</p><p>\u201cOntario is doubling, tripling, even quadrupling down on nuclear,\u201d he said, despite a long history of projects coming in over budget and behind schedule. \u201cWe don\u2019t share the government\u2019s enthusiasm. Ontario\u2019s last round of nuclear builds led to billions in stranded debt and the dissolution of Ontario Hydro.\u201d</p><p>The government\u2019s plan assumes that by 2050, 75 percent of Ontario\u2019s electricity will come from nuclear, while the share of renewables like wind and solar is projected to shrink.</p><p>Tucked into Ford\u2019s latest energy blueprint is a spotlight on Brampton\u2019s Emerald Energy from Waste incinerator, where they are experimenting with a hydrogen electrolyzer powered by garbage to \u201cassess how clean hydrogen produced on-site could be used for heavy-duty vehicles or to provide grid services.\u201d</p><p>On paper, it sounds like a glimpse into a cleaner, tech-powered future, but it comes with important caveats.</p><p>First, the plan fails to mention that the company in question has plans to redevelop its incineration system in three phases, replacing the existing facility and building a new one on the same site to increase its capacity from 182,000 to up to 900,000 tonnes per year.</p><p>Second, hydrogen leaks easily and has a strong, often overlooked warming effect. Scientists, including those at the Environmental Defense Fund, warn that its near-term climate impact is much greater than previously understood, making leak prevention vital.</p><p>Currently, hydrogen is mainly used in fertilizer and oil refining. Government investments in hydrogen risk propping up fossil fuel\u2013derived \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen, which relies on natural gas and flawed carbon capture, potentially locking in polluting infrastructure under the guise of clean energy.</p><p>Only green hydrogen, made from water using renewable energy, offers real climate benefits, and even then, it\u2019s best suited for sectors with limited alternatives like steelmaking or long-haul flights. For cars and home heating, clean electricity is usually cheaper and better for the climate.</p><p>On July 22, the United Nations unveiled two new reports signalling that the global shift to renewable energy has crossed a \u201cpositive tipping point.\u201d Solar and wind are now so affordable and scalable that they\u2019re rapidly outpacing fossil fuels, and reshaping the global energy economy.</p><p>\u201cThe fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said during his speech unveiling the reports.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.\u201d</p><p>The data backs him up. In 2024, 74 percent of the growth in global electricity generation came from solar, wind, and other renewables, according to the UN\u2019s multi-agency report Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. Even more striking: 92.5 percent of all new electricity capacity added to the grid globally came from clean energy sources.</p><p>Under the Ford government, renewables are set to scale back from 35 percent to just 25 percent.</p><p>Such provincial decisions are often influenced by federal policy.</p><p>In December 2024, under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, the federal government weakened its own clean electricity regulations. Originally designed to achieve net-zero power grids by 2035, the final rules now allow fossil fuels to remain in electricity generation until as late as 2050. Former environment minister Steven Guilbeault framed the move as a necessary compromise to preserve grid reliability.</p><p>Canada\u2019s overarching climate targets, enshrined in the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, include a 40\u201345 percent emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2030, and net-zero by 2050.\u00a0</p><p>Clean electricity is a cornerstone of that transition.\u00a0</p><p>But with fossil gas now allowed to persist for decades, the urgency of decarbonizing other sectors like transport, buildings, and heavy industry is undermined.</p><p>Parallel to this, the oil and gas sector stands as the country\u2019s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 31 percent of the national total.\u00a0</p><p>In 2022 alone, the industry emitted 217 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, with the oil sands sub-sector responsible for over a third of that, 12 percent of Canada\u2019s total emissions.\u00a0</p><p>But the climate impact doesn\u2019t stop at Canada\u2019s borders.</p><p>The country exports most of its crude oil and nearly half of its fossil gas, and when these fuels are burned abroad, they release an estimated 939 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, 1.3 times more than Canada emits domestically.</p><p>Despite the outsized global footprint, the industry is still pushing ahead with plans to expand both extraction and exports, raising urgent questions about the future of Canada\u2019s climate leadership and its international responsibilities.</p><p>The ICJ ruling made it clear that countries must ensure their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) collectively meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit.</p><p>But the UNEP\u2019s 15th annual \u201cEmissions Gap\u201d report warns \u00a0Canada is currently not on track to meet its NDCs under existing policies.\u00a0</p><p>Albert Lalonde notes Canada has been failing these obligations both historically and presently, pointing out that aiming for net zero by the IPCC\u2019s global deadline is not leadership, \u201cit\u2019s the bare minimum.\u201d</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:anushka.yadav@thepointer.com\">anushka.yadav@thepointer.com</email></p><p>At a time when vital public information is needed by everyone, The Pointer has taken down our paywall on all stories to ensure every resident of Brampton, Mississauga and Niagara has access to the facts.

The University of Waterloo has an entire department, faculty and research labs dedicated to climate change research, which could potentially threaten the school's funding.</p><p>The university refused to comment on how much research is currently being funded by the U.S. government.</p><p>In a recent news release, CAUT said that projects wholly or partially funded by the U.S. government are at risk of being cancelled.</p><p>\"Our institutions and the federal government need to push back in the strongest possible way against this blatant attempt to interfere in academic research and trample upon academic freedom,\" CAUT executive director David Robinson stated in the release.</p><p>In a memo, the U.S. State Department directed the White House's Office of Management and Budget to re-evaluate all foreign development and assistance and decide whether to continue, modify or cease each program.</p><p>\"The agencies that disburse foreign assistance funds need to determine that such programs are in alignment with the president's America First policy and will make America safer, stronger and more prosperous,\" read the memo.</p><p>\"This necessarily requires the department and its interagency partners to identify the programs that provide life-saving assistance or otherwise support critical U.S. national security goals.\"</p><p>When asked if any University of Waterloo researchers received the survey, the school said to their knowledge, no professors had.</p><p>For CAUT, the questionnaire raises concerns over threats to academic freedom and the integrity and independence of academic research conducted in Canada.</p><p>The province is also investigating how this situation could impact researchers in Ontario and is gathering information on any investments from the U.S.</p><p>\"Our government is proud to invest in critical, homegrown research and is taking all necessary steps to ensure the security of our research institutions, our researchers, and their intellectual property,\" said Bianca Giacoboni, press secretary for the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities.</p><p>\"We will continue to work closely with the sector on this, and we encourage all researchers who may have received this questionnaire to reach out directly to their institutions with any questions and support for responding.\"</p><p>Whitaker added that researchers and schools are likely worried about speaking on the subject and putting a target on their backs.</p><p>\"When you get a questionnaire like that, the potential for it to be a bit of a chilling effect is obvious,\" said Whitaker.</p><p>\"I don't think we've ever seen this kind of political interference in Canada when it comes to research.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2025040174992460</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FG3-7M33-RRYG-50TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Bold Action. Daring Decisions, highlighting the work it is doing to expose and respond to the climate crisis and to restore balance. The report shines a spotlight on the practical, spiritual, and activist efforts of communities of faith across the country to create impact in their own neighbourhoods and beyond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2018, 546 communities of faith have engaged with the Faithful Footprintsprogram, delivered in partnership with Faith &amp; the Common Good, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5,303 metric tonnes CO2 in 168 United Church buildings   equivalent to annual energy use of 1,242 homes.The report also outlines efforts in three other areas: raising spirited voices, connecting with the Earth and responding to climate impacts with partners in the Global South.</p><p>\"The single most effective thing we can do as a denomination is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by getting off fossil fuels for heating and cooling our buildings,\" says The Right Rev. Dr. Carmen Lansdowne, Moderator of The United Church of Canada. \"But to be inspired to do that, we need to know that it's the highest return on investment. This report both imparts that knowledge and inspires us to do even better   because now, more than ever, we need daring climate justice.\"</p><p>\"It's good to take concrete steps towards [reducing our carbon footprint] because I think that a lot of people are feeling a kind of environmental despair,\" says Rev. Dave Holmes of the upgrades to St. Andrew's United Churchin Lacombe, AB. \"There is something going on in this church in a wider way   these are good initiatives, and there are good community connections on several levels now.\"</p><p>Other highlights from the report:</p><p>Transcona Memorial United Church (Winnipeg, MB) and other churches have adopted action plans to minimize their carbon footprint.St. George and St. Andrew United Church (Annapolis, N.S.) reduced its oil dependency by replacing two oil furnaces and an oil-fired water heater with three new heat pumps, a high-efficiency electric water heater, and 44 rooftop solar panels. The project reduced the church's total emissions by 13.8 percent, and energy costs by 34.4 percent;Halton Hills Climate Action, co-founded by a member of St. John's United Church of Georgetown and Glen Williams in Ontario, organized climate rallies and events, advocating at all levels of government.Siloam United Church in London, Ontario, supplies food from its sustainable urban farm, created in partnership with Urban Roots London, to its food cupboard and pop-up markets for families in need. In 2024, they received funding from the London Community Foundation to increase food security and provide urban agriculture jobs.On September 18, 2024, youth, Elders, and leaders of Grassy Narrows First Nation led the Grassy Narrows River Run in downtown Toronto, urging action to address ongoing effects of tonnes of poisonous mercury, dumped in the 1960s, in their community, lands, and waters. The United Church of Canada endorsed the march; more than 50 United Church ministers, members, and staff joined 8,000 allies in the march.</p><p>During Together for the Love of Creation Earth WeekApril 20-27, many of the communities across the country captured in this report will hold events to showcase their commitment to climate justice and to grow a movement to live with respect in creation.</p><p> BACKGROUND</p><p>The United Church of Canada was formed by an Act of Parliamentin 1925, through a union of Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and other Christian churches. It is one of the first ecumenical unions in the world to bring together major Christian denominations into one body. It is a church with a rich, progressive, and continuing history of welcoming all in the name of Christ. The national office is located in Toronto, the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and others.</p><p>The Moderator is the elected, presiding officer, spiritual leader, and public representative of the church. The Right Rev. Dr. Carmen Lansdowne, Kwisa'lakw, was elected as Moderator in July 2022. She is a member of the Heiltsuk First Nation. She was ordained in 2007 and has served the church locally, nationally, and with the World Council of Churches.</p><p>Based inKitchener, Ont.</p><p>SOURCE  United Church of Canada</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2025/04/c1944.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2025/04/c1944.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20250404C1944</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGR-J6M3-SF97-D15V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 4, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This letter, by UVic Environmental Law Club students, implores the Capital Regional District to endorse the Sue Big Oil Campaign.</p><p>Sue Big Oil, a class-action lawsuit by West Coast Environmental Law, aims to hold major oil companies accountable for worsening the climate crisis. These \u201cBig Oil\u201d companies, the largest emitters in British Columbia, must bear financial responsibility for the situation they\u2019ve perpetuated and profited from.</p><p>The climate crisis has damaged the province\u2019s infrastructure, causing significant financial burdens for local governments. The 2023 wildfire season cost the government $966 million, and the 2024 season is predicted to be more expensive. Local governments need $5.3 billion annually to address climate change, with the South Island particularly vulnerable.</p><p>Canadian law mandates corporations to mitigate the harms of their products. Similar to Big Tobacco, Big Oil spreads misinformation and opposes climate action. Joining the Sue Big Oil Campaign holds these corporations accountable and eases the strain on the public purse.</p><p>The Sue Big Oil campaign asks municipalities to pledge $1 per resident, totalling $439,950 for the entire CRD. This modest investment relative to existing climate costs and the CRD\u2019s 2024 budget of $724 million enables local governments to address climate justice concerns and signal opposition to Big Oil\u2019s irresponsible practices.</p><p>We applaud View Royal for supporting this cause and urge other CRD municipalities to join. Sue Big Oil is crucial for holding Big Oil accountable and securing funds to address climate change impacts.</p><p>UVic Environmental Law Club Saanich</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SOKENM-news20240314PSOA0004253359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SOKENM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJG-7KC1-F0HF-815J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"298\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

It highlights the systemic harms caused by current global standards that undervalue the lives of children of color, particularly in the Global South, and seeks binding accountability from corporations perpetuating environmental and social injustices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inequity by Design: Suffering and Injustice is Increasing Exponentially</p><p>It has been normalized that companies and other entities deliberately externalize ethical and legal costs of social and ecological harm as part of a business strategy and model - called \"permissible harm thresholds.\" Companies discount the value of others' lives, rights, or futures when they calculate that externalizing harm is more profitable than internalizing responsibility. This functions as a shadow discount rate - applied not to money, but to the moral and legal weight of harm.</p><p>Litigation risk, reputational damage, or regulatory capture are factored in as acceptable trade-offs. These choices are often guided by assessments of enforceability, public pressure, and regulatory weakness, not actual ethical standards. For example, a vertically integrated dairy conglomerate may not pay for the water pollution it causes, leaving costs to fall on public health systems and local governments. It may not price in the antibiotic resistance its practices accelerate, deferring costs onto future public health infrastructure, and uses subsidies that disadvantage small producers, harming fair market competition. These factors are treated as legal risk mitigation rather than moral failure, shaping business models as much as any Discounted Cash Flow projection.</p><p>A Deliberate, Systemic Moral Failure</p><p>Business models that include \"permissive harm,\" \"discount rates,\" and similar engineered adjustments constitute equity, reparations, and impact fraud. They conceal responsibility for climate and related crises, infant mortality, and the violation of children's fundamental rights - including the systemic devaluation of children of color and the harm done to their life chances and legal protections. Impacted rights can include democratic voting rights or the right to ensure governance derives from empowerment of constituents.</p><p>A New Standard of Legitimacy: Starting at Birth</p><p>The activists argue that the root of systemic injustice lies in what Carter Dillard, a leading FSM voice, terms the \"widely contested standard\" or \"equity fraud\" - a framework that justifies entitlements and government authority without first securing the birthrights of children. Rather than measuring justice from high levels of permissible harm that protect elite interests, FSM proposes an equity-based metric that starts from zero, evaluating the harm inflicted on the most vulnerable - particularly infants and nonhuman animals - from the moment they enter the world.</p><p>\"Legitimacy and equity start with fully measuring the harm,\" says Dillard. \"This is not charity or investment, but reparations. It's about telling the truth from the beginning - from birth.\"</p><p>Exposing Flaws in Power Structures</p><p>The interview highlights how unjust standards are embedded in laws, definitions of fraud, enforcement methods, and misleading cost-benefit analyses - all of which FSM argues are preempted by international law. As Dillard explains in his essay for CounterPunch, global systems often sidestep the real source of power - the act of constituting authority through relational equity at birth. This insight is not just philosophical; it is a practical blueprint for justice that challenges governments, academics, and philanthropists to shift from performative reforms to structural accountability.</p><p>If cost/benefit assessments do not start from zero, elevating infants and animals above the threshold of intergenerational justice, they risk engaging in performative work rather than meaningful change.</p><p>From Charity to Reparations: Empowering Through Birth</p><p>FSM's approach conditions all forms of authority and wealth on measurable empowerment of children at birth. This involves building systems where entitlements are derived not from exploitation, but from ensuring fertility delay, parental readiness, fair resource distribution, and geographic justice. This vision moves beyond traditional social justice models and calls for a transformative restructuring of how legitimacy is defined.</p><p>\"We're not just talking about improving a broken system,\" Dillard notes. \"We're talking about legitimizing the very foundations of society.\" The Fair Start Movement offers a proactive disclosure and compensation framework that places children's sovereignty at the center of national sovereignty.</p><p>Linking Animal Rights, Racial Justice, and Ecological Survival</p><p>FSM insists that true animal liberation and racial justice cannot exist independently. Most activists, they argue, unintentionally perpetuate injustice by working downstream - addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Using flawed standards undermines both animal and human rights and often benefits elites at the expense of those activists claim to protect.</p><p>\"Most animal rights activists didn't choose animals over racial justice,\" the FSM team explains. \"They were misled into serving neither.\" This critique urges advocates to align methods with moral goals, moving beyond token campaigns to build truly equitable systems.</p><p>Taking Action Against Corporate Abuse</p><p>FSM's commitment to action is exemplified in its call for accountability from corporations like Coca-Cola and Fairlife. In response to revelations of cruelty and exploitation, FSM demands that these companies provide transparency about their impacts - not only on animals but on future generations and the climate. As outlined in their public statement, FSM believes that exposing and correcting these abuses is central to building a just and legitimate society.</p><p>This direct advocacy challenges government, philanthropy, and corporate actors to adopt transparent, equitable, and future-focused practices.</p><p>Fair Start: A Tool for Measuring Real Impact</p><p>The Fair Start framework is a tool that allows governments, organizations, and individuals to recalibrate their impact based on whether they measurably empower children as they enter the world. This baseline of equity, FSM argues, is the only way to ensure we're building just systems rather than perpetuating harm under new names.</p><p>\"The act of telling the truth about our starting point - admitting the use of flawed standards - is what legitimates future relations,\" says Dillard. \"Without that, we're just rearranging power for our benefit.\"</p><p>Foundations Must Confront Their Role in Climate Injustice</p><p>FSM also critiques philanthropic foundations for enabling environmental harm under the guise of charity. Many uphold systems of inherited privilege while claiming to support justice and sustainability. By failing to acknowledge their contributions to ecological degradation and intergenerational inequity, they perpetuate climate injustice. Real equity requires redistributing not just wealth but power, beginning by prioritizing future generations and the planet over profit and legacy.</p><p>Foundations are called upon to reevaluate their legitimacy by asking: Are we empowering future generations or simply preserving our influence? Without a true fair start, FSM contends, no philanthropic effort can be sustainable.</p><p>Empowering Children Through Birthright Equity</p><p>FSM's insight into the intersection of climate justice and birthright equity emphasizes rethinking the global standard of freedom and its impact on vulnerable populations. They advocate for empowering individuals from birth, asserting that legitimacy of societal structures should stem from equitable treatment of all children, regardless of race or socio-economic status. The current economic model discounts future lives, perpetuating systemic inequities that benefit the wealthy few at the cost of marginalized groups.</p><p>Addressing these foundational disparities aims to foster a world where individual and political autonomy is recognized and protected from birth.</p><p>Rethinking Birthright Wealth and Systemic Exploitation</p><p>FSM points out that many today's environmental and social issues, including the climate crisis, can be traced back to disregard for the rights of infants and animals. The absence of a rights-based framework centered on birthrights has allowed unchecked exploitation of natural resources and human capital, deeply tied to birthright wealth and privilege.</p><p>FSM urges governments, activists, and philanthropists to adopt a more inclusive, rights-based approach to policy-making, ensuring every child is born with opportunities for self-determination and political empowerment.</p><p>The Fork in the Road: Legitimacy or Collapse</p><p>The conversation concludes with a call to action: one path preserves wealth created through flawed standards, further fueling climate breakdown and social instability; the other reorients that wealth to constitute just, legitimate nations. \"Children should be born as democratic ends, not economic means,\" FSM emphasizes.</p><p>Next Moves: Mobilizing Legal Action for Climate Justice</p><p>Filing a Landmark Petition with the African Commission<br/>Fair Start Movement activists are taking a bold step by filing a pivotal petition with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR). This legal action demands that the Commission address corporate fraud, enforce accurate climate reparations, and uphold environmental justice and intergenerational equity throughout Africa.</p><p>Connecting Corporate Accountability and Climate Reparations<br/>This petition complements a U.S. federal class action lawsuit against Fairlife, a Coca-Cola-owned dairy brand accused of false sustainability claims. The coalition highlights how deceptive standards allow corporations to evade liability for climate-related harms, disproportionately affecting children of color in the Global South.</p><p>Challenging the \"Permissible Harm\" Model<br/>The activists argue that the current global economic model of \"permissible harm\" is rooted in systemic inequities-particularly white supremacy and economic exploitation-that undervalue African lives and children worldwide. These flawed standards enable corporate greenwashing and perpetuate environmental and social injustice.</p><p>Calling for Binding Accountability and Child Equity Recognition<br/>The coalition urges the ACHPR to adopt binding accountability mechanisms and legally recognize child equity as a foundation for environmental dignity and survival. This framework prioritizes protecting African generations now and into the future.</p><p>Voices from the Movement: A Call for Justice<br/>\"We are the echoes of ancestors who dreamed of freedom despite enduring historic injustices,\" said Zahara Nabakooza, Fair Start Movement Children's Rights Lead. \"Equality isn't kindness-it's a debt long overdue, paid only when every Black soul walks this earth unafraid, unburdened, and fully seen.\"</p><p>To follow the full interview and explore more, visit the Fair Start Movement and listen to the full podcast on Spotify.</p><p>Media Contact:</p><p>Cecilia Castillero<br/>Senior Journalist<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.xraised.com\">www.xraised.com</url><br/>interviews@xraised.com </p><p>SOURCE: Xraised</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/coalition-files-landmark-petition-to-african-commission-demandin-1030650\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-490951210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVW-VF03-RSSF-D3PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Filing Services Canada Inc.

The federal government adopted a law formalizing it at the federal level, but Quebec adopted a statement in 2019 and hasn\u2019t done anything since.\u201d</p><p>It addressed several major issues, including the legal recognition of Indigenous rights in the province, the Chalk River nuclear waste disposal project, and the proposed forestry regime reform and its consequences for land dispossession.</p><p>The space provided a forum for First Nations leaders to highlight the case of Quebec, where, despite the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Act by the federal government in 2021, First Nations continue to face systemic obstacles to the recognition and exercise of their rights, especially when it comes to the provincial government.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty apparent at this time that Quebec is absolutely behind on recognizing the rights of First Nations,\u201d Verreault-Paul said.</p><p>The delegation included reps from Innu communities (Ekuanitshit, Essipit, Mashteuiatsh, Matimekush-Lac John, Pakua Shipi, Pessamit, Nutashkuan, Unamen Shipu and Uashat mak Mani-utenam), the Anishnabe communities of Lac-Simon and Kebaowek, and the Atikamekw community of Wemotaci.</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-7bbf947872a64c2fb9c729a58bdb2cb3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN6-FG13-RS3D-C14X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><timeReceived>08:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This letter, by UVic Environmental Law Club students, implores the Capital Regional District to endorse the Sue Big Oil Campaign.</p><p>Sue Big Oil, a class-action lawsuit by West Coast Environmental Law, aims to hold major oil companies accountable for worsening the climate crisis. These \"Big Oil\" companies, the largest emitters in British Columbia, must bear financial responsibility for the situation they've perpetuated and profited from.</p><p>The climate crisis has damaged the province's infrastructure, causing significant financial burdens for local governments. The 2023 wildfire season cost the government $966 million, and the 2024 season is predicted to be more expensive. Local governments need $5.3 billion annually to address climate change, with the South Island particularly vulnerable.</p><p>Canadian law mandates corporations to mitigate the harms of their products. Similar to Big Tobacco, Big Oil spreads misinformation and opposes climate action. Joining the Sue Big Oil Campaign holds these corporations accountable and eases the strain on the public purse.</p><p>The Sue Big Oil campaign asks municipalities to pledge $1 per resident, totalling $439,950 for the entire CRD. This modest investment relative to existing climate costs and the CRD's 2024 budget of $724 million enables local governments to address climate justice concerns and signal opposition to Big Oil's irresponsible practices.</p><p>We applaud View Royal for supporting this cause and urge other CRD municipalities to join. Sue Big Oil is crucial for holding Big Oil accountable and securing funds to address climate change impacts.</p><p>UVic Environmental Law Club</p><p>Saanich</p><p>Copyright 2024 Sooke News Mirror</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SOKENM-news20240309PSK4579952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SOKENM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BHG-J6P1-JD2C-J2J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"303\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

War in Ukraine As a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine that commenced in February 2022, the US, the EU, the UK, Switzerland and other countries have announced unprecedented levels of sanctions and other measures against Russia and certain Russian entities and nationals. We intend to comply with these requirements and will address their potential consequences. We do not have any Ukrainian or Russian crews, and our vessels currently do not sail in the Black Sea. While we conduct only limited operations in Russia, we will continue to monitor the situation to assess whether the conflict could have any impact on our operations or financial performance. Trade disruption in the Red Sea and conflicts in the Middle East Due to the attacks on merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea, there has been a disruption in the maritime trade and supply chains through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal. Since the beginning of this disruption, we have diverted our fleet from sailing in the Red Sea region. The conflicts in the Middle East represent additional geopolitical and economic risks that could increase the volatility of the global economy. While our vessels currently do not sail in the Red Sea, we will continue to monitor the situation to assess the potential impact on our operations.

Management Discussion of Second Quarter 2025 Results During the second quarter of 2025, we operated in a weaker charter market environment compared to the same period in 2024, with decreased revenues due to lower charter hires, decreased earnings from scrubber-fitted vessels and increased operating expenses. During the second quarter of 2025, we operated 46.75 vessels on average, earning an average TCE of $14,857 compared to 45.43 vessels earning an average TCE of $18,650 during the same period in 2024. The Company's net income for the second quarter of 2025 was $1.7 million, down from $27.6 million during the same period in 2024. The main factors driving the change in net income are as follows: Net revenues: Net revenues decreased by 16% to $65.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $78.5 million for the same period in 2024. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues from charter hires and decreased revenues earned by our scrubber-fitted vessels. Vessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses increased by 9% to $28.1 million for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $25.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was mainly due to the following factors: (i) higher costs for spare parts, stores, and provisions, which rose to $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, from $5.0 million for the same period in 2024 as a result of the increased average number of vessels operating during the second quarter of 2025 and the increased supplies during the second quarter of 2025 for completed and upcoming dry-dockings; (ii) increased crew wages and expenses which grew to $10.9 million for the second quarter of 2025, from $10.1 million for the same period in 2024, mainly due to the increased average number of vessels operating during the second quarter of 2025; and (iii) higher repair and maintenance expenses, which increased to $6.9 million from $7.1 million for the same period in 2024 as a result of the increased average number of vessels operating during the second quarter of 2025. The Company expenses dry-docking and pre-delivery costs as incurred, which vary from period to period. Excluding dry-docking costs and pre-delivery expenses of $4.3 million and $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively, vessel operating expenses increased by 13% to $23.8 million during the second quarter of 2025 from $21.1 million during the same period of 2024. Dry-docking expenses are related to the number of dry-dockings in each period while pre-delivery expenses are related to the number of newbuild deliveries and second-hand acquisitions in each period. Some shipping companies may defer and amortize dry-docking expenses, while many do not include dry-docking expenses within vessel operating expenses but present these separately. Depreciation: Depreciation expenses increased by $1.0 million or 7% to $15.1 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $14.1 million for the same period in 2024, due to the delivery of newbuild vessels in 2025 and 2024 and the sale of older vessels in 2024. Foreign currency gain/(loss): Foreign currency loss amounted to $6.9 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to a gain of $0.5 million for the same period in 2024, due to the unrealized loss on the valuation of the 100 million bond. Gain/(Loss) on derivatives: Gain on derivatives amounted to $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2024, due to unrealized gain on foreign currency agreements. Voyage expenses: Voyage expenses increased to $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2025, from $4.1 million for the same period in 2024 mainly due to increased bunker consumption costs for scrubber fitted vessels under charter agreements, which provide for variable consideration based on the bunker consumption. Gain on sale of assets: No vessels were sold during the second quarter of 2025. Gain on sale of assets for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to $6.6 million, as a result of a gain from the sale of the Maritsa and the Panayiota K. Interest expense: Interest expense increased to $7.8 million in the second quarter of 2025 from $7.6 million for the same period in 2024, as the net result of the increased weighted average loan outstanding of $549.8 million during the second quarter of 2025, compared to $499.9 million for the same period in 2024 and the decreased weighted average interest rate of 5.69% during the second quarter of 2025, compared to 6.43% for the same period in 2024, affected by the lower USD rates environment. Daily vessel operating expenses17: Daily vessel operating expenses, calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by the ownership days of the relevant period, increased by 6% to $6,607 for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $6,254 for the same period in 2024. Daily vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and predelivery expenses increased by 10% to $5,604 for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $5,089 for the same period in 2024. Daily general and administrative expenses17: Daily general and administrative expenses, which include management fees payable to our Managers and daily company administration expenses, increased by 13% to $1,809 for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $1,595 for the same period in 2024, due to the increase in the management fees payable to our Managers and the effect of the appreciation of the EUR versus the USD. 17 See table 4 //st Unaudited Interim Financial Information and Other Data SAFE BULKERS, INC.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. The Company believes that including these supplemental financial measures assists our management and investors in: (i) understanding and analyzing the results of our operating and business performance; (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives; and (iii) monitoring our financial and operational performance in assessing whether to continue investing in us. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted earnings per share are useful in evaluating the Companys operating performance from period to period because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financings, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income/(loss) generally further eliminates from EBITDA and Net Income/(loss) respectively the effects from impairment and loss on vessels held for sale, gain/(loss) on sale of assets, gain/(loss) on derivatives, early redelivery income/(cost), other operating expenses and gain/(loss) on foreign currency, items which may vary from year to year and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under US GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share are frequently used as measures of operating results and performance, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items. //st TABLE 4: FLEET DATA, AVERAGE DAILY INDICATORS RECONCILIATION</p><p>Three-Month Period Ended Six-Month Period Ended</p><p>June 30, June 30,</p><p>2024 2025 2024 2025 FLEET DATA Number of vessels at period end 45 47 45 47 Average age of fleet (in years) 9.99 10.26 9.99 10.26 Ownership days(1) 4,134 4,254 8,418 8,394 Available days(2) 3,991 4,133 8,221 8,236 Average number of vessels in the period(3) 45.43 46.75 46.25 46.38 AVERAGE DAILY RESULTS Time charter equivalent rate(4) $ 18,650 $ 14,857 $ 18,397 $ 14,756 Daily vessel operating expenses(5) $ 6,254 $ 6,607 $ 5,840 $ 6,192 Daily vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and pre-delivery expenses(6) $ 5,089 $ 5,604 $ 5,063 $ 5,575 Daily general and administrative expenses(7) $ 1,595 $ 1,809 $ 1,553 $ 1,710 TIME CHARTER EQUIVALENT RATE RECONCILIATION (In thousands of U.S. Dollars except for available days and Time charter equivalent rate) Revenues $ 81,947 $ 68,689 $ 166,922 $ 135,904 Less commissions (3,399) (2,944) (6,705) (5,811) Less voyage expenses (4,115) (4,342) (8,975) (8,561) Time charter equivalent revenue $ 74,433 $ 61,403 $ 151,242 $ 121,532 Available days(2) 3,991 4,133 8,221 8,236 Time charter equivalent rate(4) $ 18,650 $ 14,857 $ 18,397 $ 14,756 _____________ (1) Ownership days represent the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. (2) Available days represent the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession, net of off-hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which includes major repairs, dry-dockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. (3) Average number of vessels in the period is calculated by dividing ownership days in the period by the number of days in that period. (4) Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, represents our charter revenues less commissions and voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during such period. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on period time charters and spot time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts, while charter rates for vessels on period time charters and spot time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. We have only rarely employed our vessels on voyage charters and, as a result, generally our TCE rates approximate our time charter rates. (5) Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period. Vessel operating expenses include crewing, insurance, lubricants, spare parts, provisions, stores, repairs, maintenance including dry-docking, statutory and classification expenses and other miscellaneous items. (6) Daily vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and pre-delivery expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and pre-delivery expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period. Dry-docking expenses include costs of shipyard, paints and agent expenses and pre-delivery expenses include initially supplied spare parts, stores, provisions and other miscellaneous items provided to a newbuild acquisition prior to their operation. (7) Daily general and administrative expenses are calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period. Daily general and administrative expenses include daily management fees payable to our Managers and daily company administration expenses. //st Table 5: Detailed fleet and employment profile as ofJuly 18, 2025 Vessel Name Dwt Year Country of Charter Charter Commissions3 Charter Period4</p><p>Built1 Construction Type Rate2 CURRENT FLEET Panamax Zoe11 75,000 2013 Japan Period $ 13,000 5.00 % April 2025 February 2026 Koulitsa 2 78,100 2013 Japan Period $ 13,000 5.00 % May 2025 October 2025 Kypros Land11 77,100 2014 Japan Period13 $ 13,800 3.75 % August 2020 August 2022</p><p>BPI 82 5TC * 97% -

Resulting from last year\u2019s climate forum, it establishes 27 calls to action to respond to climate change in Eeyou Istchee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nation spoke with Olivier K\u00f6lmel, the Cree Nation Government\u2019s former climate change manager, just before leadership of the unit was transferred to Pernilla Talec.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe Cree Nation is living climate justice,\u201d asserted K\u00f6lmel. \u201cIt\u2019s about resilience, a declaration of Cree sovereignty. It\u2019s leadership and a pathway for others to follow. It solidifies that message understanding all communities are behind this.\u201d</p><p>As well, a Cree Regional Climate Change Advisory Committee will now guide leadership on adaptation and mitigation measures that enhance climate resilience, sustainable practices and collaboration with partners at all levels.\u00a0</p><p>In March, the committee held a first \u201cTraining-the-Trainer\u201d workshop on environmental emergency preparedness. Members from each community or regional entity looked at climate change adaptation considerations on both a regional and local level.</p><p>\u201cThose members have an official mandate to carry climate action forward,\u201d K\u00f6lmel said. \u201cPhase 2 will focus more on coastal realities with scenario building. Phase 3 will focus more on inland.\u201d</p><p>Sharing perspectives from diverse land users and experts in different fields will help develop innovative environmental stewardship, he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing Elders and land users to the table with community experts and public safety officers. The declaration is open for all across Eeyou Istchee to sign.\u201d</p><p>A year ago, 165 participants \u2013 including Cree representatives, federal and provincial governments and climate specialists \u2013 gathered at the Cree Regional Climate Forum in Ouje-Bougoumou over three days. With the previous summer\u2019s catastrophic forest fires fresh in everyone\u2019s minds, the urgency of action rather than reaction was clear.</p><p>It resulted in policy recommendations addressing carbon rights, conservation finance, energy infrastructure and Indigenous-led emergency response planning.\u00a0</p><p>As forests have significant capacity for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the Cree and other Indigenous nations are engaged in developing a federal offset protocol that creates incentives for conservation. Ongoing discussions with communities focus on how to advance land restoration.</p><p>\u201cBroadening the forest we maintain around shorelines and rivers would protect the banks, keep the waters fresh and biodiversity active,\u201d K\u00f6lmel said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to greatly expand those zones. It\u2019s progressive thinking but these discussions need to happen, considering the biodiversity decline and the different impacts we\u2019re seeing.\u201d</p><p>This re-evaluation of forestry practices is call-to-action 5 in the climate declaration, involving federal and provincial governments, and the James Bay Regional Administration. Each of the declaration\u2019s calls to action are accompanied by a checklist of impacted Cree and external stakeholders.</p><p>\u201cIn Eeyou Istchee, climate action is really cultural,\u201d K\u00f6lmel noted. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting land, the language and future generations. This declaration is much broader than just the communities.\u201d</p><p>The declaration emphasizes individual responsibility for greener lifestyles, facilitates youth involvement and recognizes that tallymen are valued rights holders. Cree-led initiatives commit to recycling infrastructure and wildlife and environmental monitoring.</p><p>As a legacy of former Grand Chief Mandy Gull-Masty, the climate change unit established in 2023 includes plans to implement Cree weather stations and a research hub. \u00a0</p><p>In 2024, the CNG launched a 10-Year Climate Action Plan, which it calls \u201ca comprehensive roadmap designed to meet decarbonization goals in line with the Paris Agreement and the latest global commitments.\u201d New Grand Chief Norman Wapachee shares these priorities and intends to introduce further land protections.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to come up with a draft declaration on the rights and responsibilities of Eeyou Istchee,\u201d said Wapachee. \u201cIt\u2019s giving our land a voice. I\u2019m trying to get that entrenched in the Cree constitution, so we place the land first before any development.\u201d</p><p>There are discussions about holding another climate forum guided by Elders who have observed the land\u2019s changes for decades.</p><p>\u201cThat spiritual relationship with the land has eroded,\u201d Wapachee suggested. \u201cWhen an Elder defines himself as Eenou, Eenou is life. And Istchee is the living land. We saw the land as a living entity. Once you draft a resolution, you can do a lot of work with that.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-15f313d1443c41aa81d02933b26caaeb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRJ-4FN3-RW5M-P282-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>12:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 5, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet migrant workers, particularly farm workers, face a hidden housing crisis that needs urgent attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of Canada's ability to produce food hinges on hiring migrant agricultural workers from countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica and elsewhere. Yet, housing for migrant agricultural workers in Canada is often overcrowded, dangerous and undignified. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid government inaction, our group of 29 researchers, clinicians and advocates with the Coalition for National Housing Standards for Migrant Agricultural Workers (CoNaMi), have developed a proposal for national housing standards. This work is backed by clinical experience, hundreds of interviews and surveys and migrant agricultural workers' own advocacy.</p><p>Inadequate housing</p><p>When two of us - Anelyse and Susana - interviewed 151 migrants in Ontario and British Columbia as part of our research, workers described conditions of isolation, crowding, inadequate ventilation, poor maintenance and proximity to hazards such as agrochemicals. </p><p>Both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers struggled to access health care, groceries and social services. In addition, their phone and internet access was often unreliable. </p><p>Some workers reported employer-imposed restrictions on leaving the property, and bans on visitors. These living conditions pose serious risks to workers.</p><p>Similarly to research led by the Centre for Climate Justice in British Columbia, we also encountered several workers who endured significant hardships as a result of extreme weather events. </p><p>Consistent with recent research in Nova Scotia, we found that a lack of meaningful union representation, precarious status and low wages created coercive conditions in which workers felt forced to accept poor living conditions. </p><p>Marginalization </p><p>and exploitation</p><p>As migrant workers typically live on the farms where they work, the lines between work and home can be blurred. This living arrangement often contributes to isolation and surveillance by employers. It may also enable harassment and abuse. </p><p>Furthermore, migrants are geographically separated from their families for months or years at a time. Research that Adam has conducted in Atlantic Canada and Ontario, Jill in Qu\u00e9bec and Susana in Ontario and British Columbia, outlines how poor housing conditions not only threaten workers' health and well-being, but also contribute to their marginalization and exploitation. </p><p>Workers often describe feeling demeaned and controlled, and they wonder why Canada, a country so willing to accept their labour, is so reluctant to accept their common humanity. </p><p>In 2024, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery has described Canada's temporary foreign worker program, accessed by migrant agricultural workers to come to Canada, as \"a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery,\" a statement echoed by international human rights watchdog Amnesty International.</p><p>Yet the federal government has failed to meaningfully improve housing conditions or establish clear, enforceable and mandatory standards. This inaction persists despite years of reviews, consultations and recommendations. </p><p>In fact, a study commissioned by the federal government to review the possibility of a national housing standard for migrant agricultural workers in 2018 called for greater consistency in housing quality assessments. </p><p>Academic experts have long called for a national housing standard, as well as proactive and unannounced housing inspections. Other professional and labour organizations have identified the need for greater interjurisdictional co-ordination and attention to issues of safety, pandemic preparedness, privacy and dignity. </p><p>Furthermore, safeguarding housing quality requires policy changes that provide meaningful status and adequate collective bargaining representation to migrant workers, as these conditions underlie their vulnerability in housing. </p><p>In the 2020 Auditor General of Canada report, the need for national minimum accommodation requirements for migrant agricultural workers was identified. However, housing remains a key concern for these workers who have not yet benefited from such proposed recommendations.</p><p>National housing standard</p><p>A national housing standard for migrant agricultural workers is a crucial step toward protecting their rights and mitigating their vulnerability. These standards must include:</p><p>Appropriate and enforced housing standards Ensure robust and proactive enforcement of housing standard. Living quarters must be well-constructed, safe and dignified.</p><p>Privacy, security, access and freedom Guarantee workers' rights to privacy, movement, access to health and social services and freedom from surveillance. Workers must have access to transportation and be able to enjoy rest, leisure and a social life. </p><p>Dignified living conditions Safeguard basic rights to comfort, storage and personal care by prescribing minimum standards and ratios for private bedrooms, common areas, laundry and cooking facilities. Workers should have private bedrooms and reliable internet access.</p><p>Health and safety in housing Protect workers from the spread of illness, extreme weather events and other hazards through proper air conditioning, ventilation and reduced occupancy ratios for bathrooms and kitchens.</p><p>Co-ordinated government leadership Prevent different jurisdictions passing the buck by mandating co-ordination, data-sharing and training among federal, provincial and municipal governments. For example, inspectors should be trauma-informed and armed with strategies to mitigate implicit bias and to anticipate barriers this group faces because of their precarious status. The federal government must lead with adequate funding and policy reform to address barriers that prevent workers from advocating for decent housing. </p><p>The evidence is clear. Canadian governments must raise the bar from the floor, and create national standards for migrant agricultural workers' housing.</p><p>C.

It\u2019s not newsworthy. It doesn\u2019t make headlines,\u201d Hartley said.</p><p>She began working on the book a year ago because of the armed conflicts that have been going on, especially in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.</p><p>She wanted to focus on hope and peace, which are lacking all over the world, she said. The book highlights the work that has gone unnoticed by what she calls peace builders, people who want to work with different communities, build relationships to bridge the gaps between people and solve the issues that are in the way of people being able to live in peace.</p><p>In the new book Hartley talks about the experiences of 100 peacebuilders from 50-plus countries who work in various organizations on the front lines along with journalists, actors, musicians, photographers, academics, and students.</p><p>One story is about a woman from England whose father was killed in an Irish Republican Army bombing. When the man who set the bomb was released from prison, she wanted to speak with him.</p><p>\u201cHe assumed that she would come to speak with him to blame him, but she didn\u2019t, she wanted to understand what would make a man think this was what he needed to do,\u201d Hartley explained.\u00a0</p><p>Now, they both travel around the world talking to people who are in similar situations and talk about how to build relationships with the people that they see as an aggressor, Hartley added.</p><p>The book also talks about the experiences of a CBC journalist who was abducted in Afghanistan and was held underground for 30 days, who now goes to conflict areas to make films and talk about trauma. It also touches on the story of a man in T\u00fcrkiye who opened a preschool to bring Turkish and Syrian children together.</p><p>Hartley has three goals for this book. The first one is for peace builders to connect and collaborate and work together. The second goal to have people recognize there\u2019s work being done around the world and the third one is inspiring people to maybe think about becoming peace builders themselves.</p><p>\u201cThis book is a rallying cry \u2014 an invitation to readers everywhere to step into the global peace movement. Whether you are an activist, a student, a leader, or simply someone seeking hope and direction in turbulent times, these voices will move you, challenge you, and ignite your own journey toward peace,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u00a0Peace building is fighting for people, fighting against poverty, fighting for livable wages, fighting for climate justice and fighting for social justice.</p><p>Profits from the sales will be donated to organizations are working for peace. \u201cSo, I think I\u2019m keeping with my beliefs,\u201d she said.\u201d</p><p>A book launch will be held on April 29 at the Beaconsfield Carriage House in Charlottetown at 7:00 pm. At the event PEI contributors will comprise a panel to spark broader conversation on the topic with those attending.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-126eb32a4efb4dc4b46675cf87ae4503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FKG-P043-RTD1-C551-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><timeReceived>09:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 16, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Over time, this led to the displacement and significant harms to the Indigenous population and their territory.</p><p>Victoria has long navigated a dual identity:as a colonial English city and as a progressive urban centre that champions ecological urbanism by integrating ecological principles into city planning, promoting social inclusivity and environmental sensitivity. Often referred to as the \u201cHawaii of Canada,\u201d our island community grapples with its distinct climate, history of Indigenous agro-ecological land management, and the legacies of colonialism without a sense of irony.</p><p>The draft official community plan update, titled Victoria 2050, has been released and will be discussed by city council. This draft serves as a design framework focused on climate justice, addressing the housing and climate crises by advocating for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and decreased car dependency. It proposes zoning for four-to six-storey buildings on residential lots, complete with public and semi-private gardens. The imagery presented draws heavily from Vancouver\u2019s condo developments, featuring interior courtyards and pedestrian pathways.</p><p>However, the proposal raises concerns regarding the compatibility of plantable space with existing policies, particularly the Urban Forest Management Plan and the Tree Protection Bylaw, which is based on different measures. The effectiveness of \u201clinear parks\u201d in providing adequate space for large tree species is also uncertain, especially given the access needs for residents and service vehicles.</p><p>Every resident, landowner, and member of the City of Victoria will be affected by the acceptance of this document. This is a critical moment for community input and review. The plan aims to transform the \u201cresidential fabric\u201d by unlocking buildable land across all 12 neighborhoods, and has the potential to benefit those same entities that historically contributed to the exploitation of Indigenous peoples and their territory \u2013 regardless of the justice it claims to bring.</p><p>Carolynne Rykhlo Victoria</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VICNWS-news20250313PSZA0004648110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VICNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB1-92R3-RRV5-X2RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438261</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Yet migrant workers, particularly farm workers, face a hidden housing crisis that needs urgent attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of Canada's ability to produce food hinges on hiring migrant agricultural workers from countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica and elsewhere. Yet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08445621231203086\">housing for migrant agricultural workers in Canada</url> is often overcrowded, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-022-01692-7\">dangerous</url> and undignified. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid government inaction, our group of <url normalizedValue=\"https://farmworkerhousing.ca/national-housing-standards/\">29 researchers, clinicians and advocates</url> with the Coalition for National Housing Standards for Migrant Agricultural Workers (CoNaMi), have developed a proposal for national housing standards. This work is backed by clinical experience, hundreds of interviews and surveys and migrant agricultural workers' own advocacy.</p><h>Inadequate housing</h><p>When two of us - Anelyse and Susana - interviewed 151 migrants in Ontario and British Columbia as part of our research, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117067\">workers described conditions</url> of isolation, crowding, inadequate ventilation, poor maintenance and close proximity to hazards such as agrochemicals. </p><p>Both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers struggled to access health care, groceries and social services. In addition, their phone and internet access was often unreliable. </p><p>Some workers reported employer-imposed restrictions on leaving the property, and bans on visitors. These living conditions pose <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/for-migrant-farm-workers-housing-is-not-just-a-determinant-of-health-but-a-determinant-of-death-186043\">serious risks to workers</url>.</p><p>Similarly to research led by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatejustice.ubc.ca/news/migrant-agricultural-workers-in-bc-face-compounding-crises-housing-and-climate/\">Centre for Climate Justice</url> in British Columbia, we also encountered several workers who endured significant hardships as a result of extreme weather events. </p><p>Consistent with <url normalizedValue=\"https://araisa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Falling_Short-TFWMARITIMES-NS-2024.pdf\">recent research</url> in Nova Scotia, we found that a lack of meaningful union representation, precarious status and low wages created coercive conditions in which workers felt forced to accept <url normalizedValue=\"https://farmworkerhousing.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Raising-the-Bar-Report.pdf\">poor living conditions</url>. </p><h>Marginalization and exploitation</h><p>As migrant workers typically <url normalizedValue=\"https://btlbooks.com/book/harvesting-freedom\">live on the farms where they work</url>, the lines between work and home can be blurred.

It may also enable <url normalizedValue=\"https://alternateroutes.ca/index.php/ar/article/view/22448\">harassment and abuse</url>. </p><p>Furthermore, migrants are geographically <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/21931674.2013.10820763\">separated from their families</url> for months or years at a time.

Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.</p><p>           House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.</p><p>Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee\u2019s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan \u201cends spending on Green New Deal-style waste\" and claws back money \"headed for green boondoggles'' such as grants for environmental and climate justice.</p><p>\u201cThe legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d Guthrie wrote.</p><p>The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.</p><p>The cuts fit with Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.</p><p>In Trump\u2019s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats\u2019 \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d</p><p>Groups decry the proposals</p><p>The GOP proposal \u201cguts investments that are cutting energy costs\" for families, \u201cpowering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,'' said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.</p><p>The Republican move to loosen pollution standards \u201cwould mean more smog in our streets,\u201d while cuts to environmental justice block grants \u201cwould force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,\" she added. \u201cRepublicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.\"</p><p>Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill \u201cgives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.\u201d Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.</p><p>Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.</p><p>\u201cAt a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America\u2019s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,\u201d he said.</p><p>The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called \u201cpremature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation\u201d in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group\u2019s president.</p><p>Climate programs targeted</p><p>The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.</p><p>The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department's multi-billion dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \u2014 commonly known as the \u201cgreen bank\u201d \u2014 and certain multistate and offshore wind development.</p><p>It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allow for an expedited permitting process \u2014 opposed by environmental groups \u2014 for natural gas drilling and increasing supply of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p><p>Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.</p><p>Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.</p><p>Under Trump, federal government agencies have bolstered fossil fuel investment, blocked renewable energy sources, rolled back landmark water and air regulations, cut support for electric vehicles and reconsidered scientific findings supporting climate action.</p><p>___</p><p>St. John reported from Detroit.</p><p>___</p><p>Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\">http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment</url>.</p><p>___</p><p>Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter.

This steadfast commitment was underscored by the conclusion of the Invest in African Energy forum held in Paris on May 15.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Throughout the forum, key stakeholders from across the continent and beyond convened to address the pressing energy challenges facing Africa. Taking place in Paris - the city where the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 - discussions centered on strategies to attract investment, promote sustainable energy development and drive economic growth while prioritizing environmental responsibility, African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector recognize the critical importance of addressing energy poverty, which continues to impede socio-economic progress in many African nations. By fostering an environment conducive to investment and innovation, we Africans aim to unlock the continent's vast energy potential and empower communities with access to reliable, affordable energy sources.</p><p>The Paris Declaration calls for fruitful discussions and collaborations, highlighting the shared commitment of African nations, global investors and industry leaders to drive sustainable energy development across the continent.</p><p>Moving forward, we remain dedicated to championing Africa's energy agenda, advocating for policies that balance economic growth with environmental stewardship, and empowering African nations to realize their energy potential while advancing climate goals.</p><p>We recognize Africa's sovereign right to develop its energy resources - which include north of 125 billion barrels of oil and 620 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - in a balanced and sustainable manner. Ramping up energy investment, deploying continuous finance and advancing energy projects represent Africa's core priorities, as 600 million Africans lack access to reliable power and 900 million Africans lack access to clean cooking fuels. Projects like the TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG development and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline seek to maximize Africa's resources for the benefit of local communities. In West Africa, developments such as Perenco's Cap Lopez LNG Terminal and associated LPG facility, the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline and the Eni-led Congo LNG project will catalyze long-term economic growth and energy resilience, with natural gas, LNG and LPG set to play a critical role in the continent's energy poverty reduction strategy. The Southern African region is only just starting to realize the full potential of its oil and gas resources, with recent discoveries made in Zimbabwe's Cabora Bassa Basin by Invictus Energy and Namibia's prolific Orange Basin by Shell, TotalEnergies and Galp. Namibia is also home to the development of sub-Saharan Africa's largest green hydrogen project led by Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, while Mauritania is pioneering green hydrogen through Chariot's Project Nour and CWP Global's AMAN Project, coupled with expanded gas development from the bp-operated Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project.</p><p>Despite Africa's unmet energy requirements, global energy lending has only tightened, as major European and other Western banks exit the fossil fuels industry in Africa, while financing fossil fuels in Western countries. These institutions have not been equitable when it comes to facilitating adequate energy and climate finance for African countries, where local populations are disproportionately affected by both climate risks and restrictions on fossil fuel development. Europe has made repeated calls for natural gas and green finance, yet there is a considerable blockage on energy finance for African countries. This chokehold continues to inhibit Africa's industrial growth and the establishment of critical gas-driven industries like power, petrochemicals, fertilizers and mining, keeping the continent at a developmental lag.</p><p>We Africans deplore the continuous polarization of the energy dialogue in Western countries and call on the demonization of African oil and gas to stop. We urge free market solutions to Africa, and not a continuous push for aid so that Africans pledge to leave their resources in the ground. More aid is not the answer. Investment is key. From Cape to Cairo, from Nairobi to Dakar, we stand united toward meeting our shared obligations to fight climate change, noting that wealthy nations need to decarbonize and Africa needs to industrialize.</p><p>It is the position of African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector that African countries must diversify available pools of capital and create financial instruments outside of traditional institutions - tapping into private equity and non-conventional bonds - to fund new exploration and energy initiatives. Moreover, African countries must put in place attractive regulatory and fiscal terms, thereby creating an enabling environment and removing all barriers to investment, such as incohesive regulation, excessive red tape or nationalistic policies. With competitive terms and incentives in place - followed by the integration of ESG principles and capacity building requirements - African energy projects will be able to compete effectively for global capital and work toward making energy poverty history across the continent.</p><p>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.</p><p>Download image: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo-opa.co\">https://apo-opa.co</url> /4bI9Yyk</p><p>SOURCE: African Energy Chamber</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/865501/africa-paris-declaration-on-energy-transition-climate-justice-and-energy-poverty\">press release</url> on accesswire.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-428437531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2R-V0C1-JDJN-61FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Filing Services Canada Inc.

The Village\u2019s population, as of the 2021 census, stands at 3,407. Council motioned to use up to $4,000 from the Spe\u013ak\u00famtn Community Forest Legacy Fund to cover that cost.</p><p>Sue Big Oil is a campaign to get municipalities to sign onto and file a class-action            lawsuit against the oil and gas industry for its role in knowingly fuelling climate change.</p><p>The campaign was launched by West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL) in 2022. That same year, journalist Geoff Dembicki published            The Petroleum Papers, which discussed how the American companies who founded Alberta\u2019s oil sands knew as early as 1959 that burning fossil fuels would lead to a warming climate, but worked to sow doubt about the existence of human-caused climate change. As recompense, WCEL and its partners are looking for those companies to cover the financial costs of climate change.</p><p>\u201cLike the tobacco industry, which was forced to pay tens of billions of dollars in compensation to victims and governments, fossil fuel companies should also be required to \u2018pay up\u2019 to protect communities from the harms that they\u2019ve knowingly caused,\u201d said WCEL staff lawyer Andrew Gage in a statement. \u201cClimate change is costing B.C. communities billions of dollars, and it\u2019s time that global polluters paid a fair share.\u201d</p><p>           The Sue Big Oil campaign was originally invited to Pemberton in 2024 by Nightingale. She noted at the time the Village\u2019s finances were already sufficiently constrained by infrastructure upgrades, service maintenance and the upcoming policing transition.          </p><p>\u201cNow, factor in climate change. As the severity of climate-related events increases, the strain on resources is only going to become more. One stark example is the millions of dollars required to upgrade our dikes to protect this community from more extreme flooding events,\u201d she told council.</p><p>Nightingale also cited damage to infrastructure and economic costs caused by wildfires, along with the cost of emissions-reduction strategies like new housing and transportation options, as being onerous for the Village.</p><p>\u201cSmall B.C. communities like Pemberton cannot afford the emergency and disaster management programs and massive upgrades to infrastructure that are increasingly needed because of climate change,\u201d said WCEL Climate Accountability Strategist Fiona Koza.</p><p>Pemberton follows Gibsons, View Royal, Slocan, Qualicum Beach, Squamish, Port Moody, Sechelt, Cumberland and Burnaby\u2014with some stipulations. Burnaby will participate as long as another municipality with a population of at least 150,000, like Abbotsford, Coquitlam, Kelowna, Richmond, Surrey or Vancouver, joins in. Port Moody\u2019s accession is contingent on another municipality acting as the lead plaintiff.</p><p>Sue Big Oil is looking to get between 10 and 20 municipalities and regional districts representing a total 10 per cent of the province\u2019s population. The tally currently sits at just over six per cent of B.C.'s population, including those municipalities with asterisks accompanying their participation.</p><p>Once that threshold has been reached, a legal team will be retained, one or more lead plaintiffs will be selected and local governments will be expected to develop a cooperation agreement with one another for the duration of the case.</p><p>The Squamish advocacy group My Sea to Sky (MSTS) emphasized this marks a step forward for the Village. They also nudged Pemberton\u2019s neighbouring municipalities.</p><p>\u201cBy signing on to the Sue Big Oil campaign, Pemberton is standing up for climate justice and protecting their residents from the rising costs of climate change,\u201d said Tracey Saxby, MSTS executive director, in a statement. \u201cWe encourage Whistler, West Vancouver and the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District to follow their lead.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-25e486a7684e443fbf6842b865949d6a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FKP-N5T3-RS69-N0K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><timeReceived>06:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 17, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

You ready to vote?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As much as people like to say younger Canadians don't care, the truth is they do - they just don't always vote. They sign petitions, keep up with current events online, and debate the policies they care about over group chats. When they stand up for something, they really stand up for it. Remember last year's university encampments in support of Palestine when young people mobilized and made headlines across the country?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While younger millennials (born between 1990 and 1996) and elder generation Z (born from 1997 to 2007) don't interact with politics how older millennials and generation X do, we need them to have a say in the direction of this country. Why? They will lead this country - some of them already are - and if they want to change the world, they need to vote upcoming federal election.</p><p>Mark April 28 on your calendars, folks.</p><p>Elections Canada's 2015 National Youth Survey found there are two major barriers that prevent young people (aged 18 to 35) from voting: motivation and access. Compared to older Canadians (aged 35 and older), youth are just less interested in Canadian politics, don't feel like their vote will make a difference, our government just doesn't care about what they think and that voting is a choice and not a duty.</p><p>In the 10 years that have passed since that survey, I don't think much has changed. In the last federal election in 2021, only 47 per cent of Canadians aged 18 to 24 voted, a drop from the 2019 turnout of 54 per cent. But we need the youth voice and vote to determine Canada's future.</p><p>\"What we know is that for decades, baby boomers have been the largest demographic ... Now we have statistical evidence that young people can decide the election, the outcome of the election and the future of this country,\" said Amanda Munday, executive director of New Majority, which is working to improve youth voter turnout in Canada to CTV News.</p><p>Voting allows us to shape the country into what we want - a Canada that reflects what is important to us: equity, climate justice, affordability and employment opportunity. In a democracy, every citizen's vote matters. Canada has a strong democracy, but strong democracies are built on the voices of all its citizens. When people don't participate, democracies falter.</p><p>According to Elections Canada, \"voting is habit forming. If a person votes in the first election after they turn 18, they will probably be a lifelong voter. On the other hand, those who do not vote in that first election are unlikely to pick up the habit later in life.\"</p><p>Who we choose to lead decides the priorities for the country, for good or for bad. While we won't agree with every politician, but we can choose the person - and the party - who's values align with yours and what you want for your future.</p><p>Ignorance, like apathy, is a problem for all voters. We all need to understand why we're casting our vote. What does the party you're voting stand for? Have you done any research? Lots of politicians show up when it's election time and have a lot to say in press conferences and rallies, but does what they say really matter to you? Often the world feels like it's spinning out of control.

You ready to vote?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As much as people like to say younger Canadians don't care, the truth is they do - they just don't always vote. They sign petitions, keep up with current events online, and debate the policies they care about over group chats. When they stand up for something, they really stand up for it. Remember last year's university encampments in support of Palestine when young people mobilized and made headlines across the country?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While younger millennials (born between 1990 and 1996) and elder generation-Z (born from 1997 to 2007) don't interact with politics how older millennials and generation-X do, we need them to have a say in the direction of this country. </p><p>Why? They will lead this country - some of them already are - and if they want to change the world, they need to vote upcoming federal election.</p><p>Mark April 28 on your calendars, folks.</p><p>Elections Canada's 2015 National Youth Survey found there are two major barriers that prevent young people (aged 18 to 35) from voting: motivation and access. Compared with older Canadians (aged 35 and older), youth are just less interested in Canadian politics, don't feel like their vote will make a difference, our government just doesn't care about what they think and that voting is a choice and not a duty.</p><p>In the 10 years that have passed since that survey, I don't think much has changed. In the last federal election in 2021, only 47 per cent of Canadians aged 18 to 24 voted, a drop from the 2019 turnout of 54 per cent. But we need the youth voice and vote to determine Canada's future.</p><p>\"What we know is that for decades, baby boomers have been the largest demographic ... Now we have statistical evidence that young people can decide the election, the outcome of the election and the future of this country,\" said Amanda Munday, executive director of New Majority, which is working to improve youth voter turnout in Canada to CTV News.</p><p>Voting allows us to shape the country into what we want - a Canada that reflects what is important to us: equity, climate justice, affordability and employment opportunity. In a democracy, every citizen's vote matters. Canada has a strong democracy, but strong democracies are built on the voices of all its citizens. When people don't participate, democracies falter.</p><p>According to Elections Canada, \"voting is habit forming. If a person votes in the first election after they turn 18, they will probably be a lifelong voter. On the other hand, those who do not vote in that first election are unlikely to pick up the habit later in life.\"</p><p>Who we choose to lead decides the priorities for the country, for good or for bad. While we won't agree with every politician, we can choose the person - and the party - who's values align with yours and what you want for your future.</p><p>Ignorance, like apathy, is a problem for all voters. We all need to understand why we're casting our vote. What does the party you're voting for stand for? Have you done any research? Lots of politicians show up when it's election time and have a lot to say in press conferences and rallies, but does what they say really matter to you? Often the world feels like it's spinning out of control. Our vote is a demand for stability or change.</p><p>The choices we make in the upcoming election will affect everything from how we respond to the housing crisis and climate change to how we invest in geopolitics, immigration and jobs for the next generation. And with millennials and gen-Z now representing the largest voting bloc, your collective voice could be the loudest one in the room - if everyone shows up.</p><p>See you at the ballot box.</p><p>Shellene Drakes-Tull is a Toronto-based storyteller, educator and the founder of Sweet Lime Communications.

During these meetings, May dedicates time to updating constituents on current bills she's working on followed by an extensive Q&amp;A session.</p><p>\"People come equipped with such interesting questions and they contact me between meetings,\" she noted.</p><p>As she gears up for the upcoming federal election on April 28, May is prioritizing top concerns voiced by her constituents: housing affordability and availability and health care access, particularly the shortage of family doctors.</p><p>\"These are not abstract issues for voters here, but I think a lot of that is now eclipsed by the question of what can we expect next from a White House that's erratic and unpredictable \u2013 not our ally and friend in the way they used to be.\"</p><p>When voters head to the polls, May hopes they will have one word in mind: \"Canada, because we are a sovereign nation. There's no question we're under threat, and pulling together could be the remaking of our economy.\"</p><p>She believes the country can overcome inter-provincial trade barriers and reshape its economy to be stronger, more self-reliant and create higher employment rates.</p><p>As Canada's longest-serving Green Party MP, the 70-year-old remains a leading voice on environmental policy and climate justice. She says her core beliefs have remained unchanged since she was 17.</p><p>\"I believe in democracy. I believe in the power of one. I believe that citizens mobilizing at the grassroots in any community can change a government decision \u2013 and now I know it to be true. And I've always believed in God.\"</p><p>May expresses excitement about using her extensive experience if re-elected.</p><p>\"When I got elected in 2011, I told the constituents here, I'll be able to hit the ground running.

A lack of practical alternatives is forcing many developing nations to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/for-developing-world-to-quit-coal-rich-countries-must-eliminate-oil-and-gas-faster-new-study-199649\">build refineries and coal mines while some developed countries are trying to get rid of them</url>. They need help to catch up, to avoid worsening the problems that wealthier neighbours have already inflicted on the planet. </p><p>Help could come in the form of climate finance and technology transfer. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries pledged US$100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate action in developing nations. The commitment was achieved <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/wealthy-countries-met-global-climate-finance-goal-two-years-late-oecd-says-2024-05-29/\">two years late in 2022</url>.</p><p>Building a truly healthy planet requires a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/global-crises-join-forces-world-must-adopt-forward-looking-approach\">forward-looking approach to climate action which looks past short-term solutions</url>. However, we must also recognize that while all states are responsible for addressing global environmental destruction, not all are equally responsible. </p><p>To achieve consensus on climate action, we must address underlying inequities. We must recognize that we can no longer deny poorer countries the right to have equal voices in setting the forward-looking plans which need to be made in the coming years. Put simply, we must reassert the value of fairness.</p><h>Going beyond current initiatives</h><p>Climate justice requires a commitment to the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, ensuring that the costs and benefits of climate action are shared fairly. In other words, climate justice must be integrated into all aspects of the global political economy, including development financing, technology transfer and international trade policies.</p><p>Existing initiatives such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/\">Green Climate Fund</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction\">climate adaptation and resilience initiatives</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/loss-and-damage/warsaw-international-mechanism\">UN's Loss and Damage Mechanism</url> under the Climate Change Framework Convention do provide important frameworks for climate justice. </p><p>However, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/loss-and-damage-is-not-enough-why-we-need-climate-reparations/\">these programs alone are not sufficient to address climate injustice</url>. We need to do much more, and that will take more buy-in and greater investment from the world's wealthier countries. </p><p>Global investments in climate justice must extend beyond existing frameworks. Our efforts should encompass reforms to international trade and global governance to ensure greater equity and fairer representation for all peoples.</p><h>Elightened self-interest</h><p>It doesn't take an expert in political science to predict that when asked to pay most countries will become mired in politics and inaction. In that case, the most practical, substantial motivation to act may lie in enlightened self-interest. </p><p>As experts had predicted, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/build-better-futures/climate-change-and-displacement\">weather catastrophes are directly and indirectly creating growing numbers of climate refugees</url>, driving more displaced people from the Global South to seek safety and prosperity in Europe and North America, straining resources, fueling xenophobia and driving politicians to close borders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: COP29: who pays for climate action in developing nations - and how much - becomes more urgent</emphasis></p><p>By helping countries in the Global South to address their climate-driven crises, developed countries would help people remain in their homes and instead of having to seek refuge in the Global North. That cynical calculus may finally be what drives the change necessary to address climate issues around the world.</p><p>At this point, the source of the motivation matters much less than motivation itself. Only quick, significant and inclusive action can help save what is not already doomed.</p><p>COP29 is set to be all about finance as discussions will largely focus on increasing funding to help lower-income countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted at the opening of COP29, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-11-12/secretary-generals-remarks-world-leaders-climate-action-summit-cop29-delivered\">climate finance is not charity, it's an investment in the collective well-being of all humanity</url>. </p><p>These deliberations offer a renewed opportunity to prioritize climate justice by reinforcing financing for mitigation and adaptation strategies rooted in equity and fairness.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bonny Ibhawoh receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

For travelers coming back to the city, it was a reminder of the need for potential rapid transit solutions that can reduce commuter times for drivers and transit riders.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The McKenzie corridor \u201cpinch\u201d that the CRD hopes to alleviate with infrastructure enhancements to the Colquitz bridges will certainly be pinching drivers hard at either end of the holiday. Anticipated heavy traffic won\u2019t be commuter-related but will highlight the urgency for innovative solutions to regional transportation challenges and the need to reduce road congestion. There\u2019s also the goal of meeting CleanBCs 25% greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets by 2030.  </p><p>Acknowledging the municipalities\u2019 objectives to reduce driving and increase walking, bicycling, and public transit trips exponentially, organizations such as Better Island Transit, and Climate Justice Victoria are among those asking decision-makers to do more, more quickly with their existing plans.  </p><p>Climate Justice Victoria (CJV) is a collective of local organizers and civil society organizations working for a cleaner environment and a Green New Deal on Lekwungen &amp; W\u0331S\u00c1NE\u0106 Territories. The group wants UVic to advocate for bus lanes on McKenzie to make transit more accessible to students, faculty, and the wider community. </p><p>Access to efficient rapid public transit service into Victoria depends on which community you\u2019re looking at. Between Victoria and Duncan, only four daily bus trips are scheduled and there are no off-peak or reverse commute trips. Weekend service is </p><p>minimal and the fare, at $10, is four times a local fare. Coming in from Sooke, transit riders can rely on 43 daily trips at $2.50 fares, serving over 20% of peak-period trips. </p><p>According to the Island Coastal Inter-Community Transportation Study, the transportation and infrastructure ministry is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to expand Island highways. The provincial and federal governments announced $249M in new public transit funding last year but offered no plan or funding to improve interregional bus transportation on the Island. </p><p>CVJ supports a dedicated bus lane along McKenzie Avenue into the UVic campus. \u201cWhen it comes down to allocating road space, in the past, transit riders got studies and cars got priority,\u201d the group says. </p><p>While it praises Saanich for its climate action policy, CJV is critical of the council\u2019s inertia, pointing to the Shelbourne Valley Action Plan that has been 15 years in the planning. It points to Victoria\u2019s Douglas Ave. transit lane ambitions that \u201chave been gathering dust for half a century.\u201d </p><p>Erick Dougherty, principal at Ecopath Planning, would like to see Saanich take Nike\u2019s advice and just do it.  \u201cWhy can't Saanich just be like, let's do it. Let's get it done!\u201d  </p><p>\u201cDuring the pandemic,\u201d he said, \u201cBerlin built more bus lanes in one year than it had in the previous decade.\u201d  </p><p>Taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic slowdown, The City of Berlin added 18.4 km of bus lanes and a further 2.2 km in 2022 and now 123km of dedicated bus lanes wind their way through the streets of the German capital. </p><p>Last year, The Martlet reported that Climate Justice Victoria, the University of Victoria Student Society (UVSS), and other student groups had already endorsed the BC Climate Emergency Campaign\u2019s open letter on transportation that called for reallocating \u201croad space from private automobiles to transit lanes, protected bike &amp; roll lanes, pedestrian priority spaces, and space for trees.\u201d </p><p>The endorsement gestures to on-campus infrastructure bus transit enhancements that are already two years old.  </p><p>In 2022, the federal and provincial governments and the Victoria Regional Transit Commission invested a combined $4.5M to enhance UVic\u2019s bus exchange, the start and terminus of 17K daily transit trips to campus. </p><p>CJV says there should be municipal transportation initiatives to complement that expenditure. It\u2019s calling on Saanich to paint 24/7 bus lanes on all four-lane and wider sections along McKenzie. The organization has also published an online petition to build bus lanes on McKenzie that it says would quicken the daily commute of thousands living in the West Shore and up-Isand. </p><p>Victoria rental costs have pushed UVic students to seek housing options far afield and in more remote locations. \u201cCertain bus routes feel inaccessible to students because some are living pretty far away from campus and feel that their only option right now is to drive,\u201d says CJV representative Mary Stuart, a UVic political ecology student. </p><p>UVic\u2019s Sustainability Action Plan goal of increasing transit, cycling, and carpooling to 70% of the modal split would help the CRD meet CleanBC\u2019s target of reducing traffic by 25% by 2030. To achieve that target, the university needs Saanich\u2019s support. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Dougherty, \u201cSaanich seems to suffer from a kind of cultural inertia when it comes to approving and implementing audacious transportation plans.\u201d  </p><p>\u201cJust painting those designated bus lanes on McKenzie feels like low-hanging fruit,\u201d Stuart says. \u201cSomething that seems to be already in the vague plans for Saanich but really just needs pushing to actually get that done so that we're not waiting two decades for those lines to get painted.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e1ee06e1d4c24187888549e1e776ed67</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BR3-P3P1-DY9S-T12X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><timeReceived>11:38 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 4, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Over time, this led to the displacement and significant harms to the Indigenous population and their territory.</p><p>Victoria has long navigated a dual identity: as a colonial English city and as a progressive urban centre that champions ecological urbanism by integrating ecological principles into city planning, promoting social inclusivity and environmental sensitivity. Often referred to as the \"Hawaii of Canada,\" our island community grapples with its distinct climate, history of Indigenous agro-ecological land management, and the legacies of colonialism without a sense of irony.</p><p>The draft official community plan update, titled Victoria 2050, has been released and will be discussed by city council. This draft serves as a design framework focused on climate justice, addressing the housing and climate crises by advocating for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and decreased car dependency. It proposes zoning for four- to six-storey buildings on residential lots, complete with public and semi-private gardens. The imagery presented draws heavily from Vancouver's condo developments, featuring interior courtyards and pedestrian pathways.</p><p>However, the proposal raises concerns regarding the compatibility of plantable space with existing policies, particularly the Urban Forest Management Plan and the Tree Protection Bylaw, which is based on different measures. The effectiveness of \"linear parks\" in providing adequate space for large tree species is also uncertain, especially given the access needs for residents and service vehicles.</p><p>Every resident, landowner, and member of the City of Victoria will be affected by the acceptance of this document. This is a critical moment for community input and review.

How well is CARE doing this in areas vulnerable to climate change?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 16, 2024 / CARE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Figure 1: CARE is making an impact in most highly climate vulnerable countries but there are opportunities to better integrate gender-resilience-climate.</p><p>Background</p><p>CARE empowers poor and marginalized people to take action on the climate crisis and to build knowledge for global change. We know that climate change affects poor and marginalized people the most. Extinction means that people who rely on biodiversity for survival can no longer produce food. Extreme weather events destroy the shelters and homes of people who don't have insurance or savings to rebuild. Women and girls face higher rates of sexual and economic abuse as their families face economic hardship.</p><p>CARE's recent study with the Southern African Resilience Academy (SARA) and partners showed that food and livelihood programs need to integrate gender transformative approaches, climate adaptation, and resilience building, as well as systems strengthening, to support inclusive and sustained growth in communities vulnerable to climate change, conflict, and poverty. So, 3 years into our CARE's Vision 2030 strategy, CARE examined how well we are integrating these factors - especially in geographic areas most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Triangulating data for research-inspired analysis</p><p>We triangulated data from the three sources below, and based our analysis on the research findings and context:</p><p>1. CARE impact data. CARE's Program Information and Impact Reporting System (PIIRS) records impact from every project implemented by CARE and/or partners, measured through indicators that correspond to SDGs and CARE's Vision 2030 strategy. We analyzed impact data on livelihood recovery in humanitarian emergencies, food security, and climate resilience and adaptive capacities.</p><p>2. CARE program quality (PQ) data. We assessed the percent of programs that met minimum CARE PQ standards for gender, resilience building, and climate adaptation.</p><p>3. Climate vulnerability scores from the University of Notre Dame's Global Adaption Initiative (ND-GAIN) Country Index. This tool ranks countries based on their climate vulnerability and readiness to implement climate adaption solutions.</p><p>For the countries that we have a presence in, we plotted each country's impact (from our identified relevant indicators) against the percent of projects that met the minimum PQ standards (for our identified relevant standards) in each country. This showed where our programming was impactful and tested our research finding that integration leads to higher impact. To go even deeper, we then looked at this relationship among the countries that have the highest ND-GAIN index climate vulnerability score, among countries that CARE has a presence in (Figure 1). We further used historical internal program data to examine these relationships and came to two major conclusions.</p><p>Our findings</p><p>Among countries that CARE works in, CARE is making an impact in some of the most highly climate vulnerable countries (Somalia, Chad, Niger, etc.) but there are opportunities to better integrate gender, resilience, and climate in these locations. Countries where we have higher integration and more reported impact tend to be countries like Ethiopia (not shown), Niger, Uganda, and Zimbabwe (not shown) where climate vulnerability capacity analyses (CVCA) have been applied for several years, where locally led adaptation approaches have been applied, and which have established and sustained institutional funding - in line with the conclusion from the SARA research that integration leads to impact and quality programming.</p><p>Some countries highly vulnerable to climate change report no impact (Sierra Leone, Burundi, Sudan, Tonga) but that does not mean we are not doing important work there. Impact is measured in the long-term and often after a project is completed, so while this finding shows areas to ramp up programming, which we know how to do from the research findings, it also flags places where we are already working and should be prepared to measure impact later on.</p><p>Action resulting from the combination of analysis and research insights</p><p>This analysis is a prime example of using triangulation of data from various sources in combination with research-based evidence to inform programming.</p><p>As an organization, CARE is continuing to leverage our existing technical capacity in climate justice programming in Asia and MENA - regions that face climate vulnerability.</p><p>As a research community, we should continue to openly share data and methods to allow for analysis such as these. Additionally, we should share evidence-based research like the SARA paper, to inspire analysis and programs. We can also continue to embed gender in our research by assessing how gender affects outcomes such as climate vulnerability and readiness, and being critical of sources that do not include gender in analysis.</p><p>As a global community, we can deepen our investment in gender transformative approaches and climate adaptation for systems transformation. This analysis highlights the positive relationship between integrating gender, resilience and climate and impact, and shows that community-led approaches and strong institutional funding make for a bigger impact. Using this data - donors, programs, and policy makers can expand efforts in gender-inclusive strategies and climate adaptation.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from CARE on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: CARE<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/care\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/care</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: CARE</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/902443/how-care-triangulated-global-climate-data-research-with-partners-and-program-data-to-work-towards-climate-justice\">press release</url> on accesswire.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-443416103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CRH-86F1-F11P-X40H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Filing Services Canada Inc.

Runaway climate change in the form of higher temperatures, extreme weather events and biodiversity loss. In this sense, reading <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laudato Si'</emphasis> - \"Praise be to you\" in Italian - is like reading an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/\">assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</url>.</p><p>Unlike the IPCC report, however, Francis didn't pull his punches. \"The Earth, our home,\" he wrote, \"is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.\"</p><h>Francis didn't hold back</h><p>A few months after the publication of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laudato Si'</emphasis>, the world gathered in Paris to draft a new climate treaty. It too is a remarkable document. However, if the authors of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf\">Paris Agreement</url> couldn't mention the economic roots of the climate crisis - they couldn't even use the term fossil fuels - the pope could and did.</p><p>Francis relentlessly called out our \"models of growth which have proved incapable of ensuring respect for the environment,\" our \"irrational confidence in progress and human abilities\" and our \"blind confidence in technical solutions.\" </p><p>He was critical of \"current models of production and consumption\" and our faith in \"the invisible forces of the market,\" as well as our \"misguided anthropocentrism\" and our \"throwaway culture.\" </p><p>Francis pointed a finger at obstructionism and denial. He worried about the rise of social media, which has led to disconnection from each other and from nature. And he was critical of \"the idea of infinite or unlimited growth.\"</p><p>Although terribly \"attractive to economists, financiers, and experts in technology,\" it's a fantasy based on the lie \"that there is an infinite supply of the Earth's goods.\" There isn't, and the planet is \"being squeezed dry beyond every limit.\"</p><p>Using ironic quotation marks, he even criticized \"green\" rhetoric, so fashionable in eco-capitalist circles.</p><p>It wasn't the first time Francis talked about a global economy that doesn't work. A few years earlier, in 2012, he caused a minor fit in some circles with the publication of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html\">Evangelli Gaudium</url>. Wealth moves up, not down, he argued, while the poor are excluded and grow in number. </p><p>The late American pundit Rush Limbaugh called it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/rush-limbaugh-doesnt-get-pope-francis\">\"pure Marxism.\"</url> Undeterred, Francis went further in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laudato Si'</emphasis> when he linked the climate crisis to an economy premised on constant consumption. </p><p>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Catholic convert and at the time a presidential aspirant, told him to stick to his knitting: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/17/jeb-bush-joins-republican-backlash-pope-climate-change\">\"I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope.\"</url></p><h>Laudato Si' and abortion</h><p>Of course, Francis had stuck to his knitting in one important way: on at least four separate occasions in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laudato Si'</emphasis>, he singled out abortion -  or, in his words, \"eliminating children\" - as part of the climate problem. He wrote: </p><p>\"Thinking that we enjoy absolute power over our own bodies turns, often subtly, into thinking that we enjoy absolute power over creation.\"</p><p>No, it doesn't. Moreover, empowering women through access to birth control and abortion care is part of the solution to poverty in both the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/opinion/why-access-to-abortion-is-key-to-ending-poverty\">Global South</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/26/1100587366/banning-abortion-roe-economic-consequences\">Global North</url>, something Francis cared deeply about, like his namesake St. Francis of Assisi.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Francis ? a pope who cared deeply for the poor and opened up the Catholic Church</emphasis></p><p>In 2023, Francis published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/20231004-laudate-deum.html\">Laudate Deum</url>, a short follow up to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laudato Si'</emphasis>. At the same time as he urged the world to act, he condemned those who blame climate change on the poor for having so many children and who \"attempt to resolve the problem by mutilating women in less developed countries.\" </p><p>According to one Catholic news and information site, this was an apparent reference <url normalizedValue=\"https://aleteia.org/2023/10/04/laudate-deum-popes-call-to-stop-climate-catastrophe\">\"to campaigns in favour of contraception and abortion regularly conducted by the West.\"</url></p><p>Centuries of pro-life absolutism in the Catholic Church meant that Francis couldn't make the connection between women's lack of bodily autonomy and poverty, and between reproductive justice and climate justice, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-does-gender-equality-have-do-climate-change\">and, in part, the idea that climate change disproportionately impacts women</url>.  </p><p>Still, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laudato Si'</emphasis> invites all of us to connect the dots between growth, consumption, poverty and climate breakdown.

Most of these countries are in what we once called the Third World and what we now call the Global South \u2014 Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><p>Today, the wealthiest 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population contributes 49 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, while the 50 per cent of the world\u2019s population living in developing nations is accountable for only 12 per cent. At the same time, the wealthiest country on Earth, the United States, has just elected a climate denier to the presidency. </p><p>The election of Donald Trump, a known climate skeptic, represents a significant setback for climate action. At the same time, a senior member of Azerbaijan\u2019s COP29 team has been filmed trying to use the conference to secure oil deals for the host country.</p><p>Extreme drought, flooding, unprecedented storms, sea-level rise and wildfire are hitting the Global South especially hard bringing renewed attention to the longstanding calls for just transition and climate justice.</p><p>While the United Nations climate conferences, known as Conferences of the Parties (COP) have made strides in international climate policy, their efforts to address climate justice remain contentious and widely considered inadequate. </p><p>I am a legal historian and scholar of human rights currently involved in an ongoing UN-led research project which seeks to identity the challenges and good practices necessary for developing processes and systems to address climate injustice. As part of that work, I am currently in Azerbaijan to discuss my preliminary findings with a range of stakeholders at COP29.</p><p>This year\u2019s COP29 represents a critical moment to centre climate justice at the heart of the global effort against climate change.</p><p>Climate (in)justice</p><p>The concept of climate justice is rooted in the knowledge that the impacts of climate change are unevenly distributed across the globe. It emphasizes the ethical responsibility of those who have reaped the most benefits from carbon-intensive development to reduce their emissions and assist those who are most affected by climate change.</p><p>We can\u2019t have conversations about our climate and environmental goals without including the parties who have suffered the most and stand to suffer more.</p><p>Many developing countries are just starting their own industrial revolutions. A lack of practical alternatives is forcing many developing nations to build refineries and coal mines while some developed countries are trying to get rid of them. They need help to catch up, to avoid worsening the problems that wealthier neighbours have already inflicted on the planet. </p><p>Help could come in the form of climate finance and technology transfer. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries pledged US$100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate action in developing nations. The commitment was achieved two years late in 2022.</p><p>Building a truly healthy planet requires a forward-looking approach to climate action which looks past short-term solutions. However, we must also recognize that while all states are responsible for addressing global environmental destruction, not all are equally responsible. </p><p>To achieve consensus on climate action, we must address underlying inequities. We must recognize that we can no longer deny poorer countries the right to have equal voices in setting the forward-looking plans which need to be made in the coming years. Put simply, we must reassert the value of fairness.</p><p>Going beyond current initiatives</p><p>Climate justice requires a commitment to the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, ensuring that the costs and benefits of climate action are shared fairly. In other words, climate justice must be integrated into all aspects of the global political economy, including development financing, technology transfer and international trade policies.</p><p>Existing initiatives such as the Green Climate Fund, climate adaptation and resilience initiatives and the UN\u2019s Loss and Damage Mechanism under the Climate Change Framework Convention do provide important frameworks for climate justice. </p><p>However, these programs alone are not sufficient to address climate injustice. We need to do much more, and that will take more buy-in and greater investment from the world\u2019s wealthier countries. </p><p>Global investments in climate justice must extend beyond existing frameworks. Our efforts should encompass reforms to international trade and global governance to ensure greater equity and fairer representation for all peoples.</p><p>Enlightened self-interest</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take an expert in political science to predict that when asked to pay most countries will become mired in politics and inaction. In that case, the most practical, substantial motivation to act may lie in enlightened self-interest. </p><p>As experts had predicted, weather catastrophes are directly and indirectly creating growing numbers of climate refugees, driving more displaced people from the Global South to seek safety and prosperity in Europe and North America, straining resources, fueling xenophobia and driving politicians to close borders.</p><p>By helping countries in the Global South to address their climate-driven crises, developed countries would help people remain in their homes and instead of having to seek refuge in the Global North. That cynical calculus may finally be what drives the change necessary to address climate issues around the world.</p><p>At this point, the source of the motivation matters much less than motivation itself. Only quick, significant and inclusive action can help save what is not already doomed.</p><p>COP29 is set to be all about finance as discussions will largely focus on increasing funding to help lower-income countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted at the opening of COP29, climate finance is not charity, it\u2019s an investment in the collective well-being of all humanity. </p><p>These deliberations offer a renewed opportunity to prioritize climate justice by reinforcing financing for mitigation and adaptation strategies rooted in equity and fairness.</p><p>___</p><p>Bonny Ibhawoh receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

CCL-Canada's national manager, Cathy Orlando, arranged the venue, and MPs from all political parties, CCLers and others participated.</p><p>Participants first stood in a circle holding a rope. Morin, Brown, and other helpers, such as teenage climate activist Sophia Mathur, wove other ropes within the circle to create a giant dreamcatcher. It sounds simple, but I found that, as the dreamcatcher took shape, it was a profoundly moving illustration of the interconnectedness of all things.</p><p>As I understood him, during the event, Will Morin said that we need to return to Indigenous knowledge to heal what is damaging the Earth.</p><p>My interpretation of this is that we need to return to equal sharing, which was and is a nearly universal practice among hunter-gatherers everywhere \u2013 and we are all descended from hunter-gatherers. When a group of hunters returned to the camp with a kill, someone (usually not one of the hunters) would divide up the meat so that everyone present got an equal share. It was a simple but elegant form of mutual aid, life insurance, and environmental protection because it minimized the waste of resources.</p><p>When Champlain first came to what is now Canada, he reported that the Montagnais, who lived a pure hunter-gatherer existence, occasionally starved to death. He tried to persuade them to take up agriculture. The Montagnais refused, saying, as I recall, that they had only \"pity and contempt\" for those who farmed.</p><p>Why did they feel that way? I suspect that at least part of it was because they knew that agriculture would mean the mechanism of equal sharing would break down.</p><p>Citizens Climate Lobby's main focus is carbon fee-and-dividend, which means charging a fee on fossil fuels, similar to a carbon tax, and then distributing the proceeds to everyone as equal dividends, similar to a universal basic income \u2013 and equal sharing.</p><p>Senior government officials have told members of CCL-Canada that we played an important role in bringing about Canada's carbon tax with rebate program. Unfortunately, the government only partially adopted carbon fee-and-dividend, and some members feel that the problems the carbon tax program now faces are a result.</p><p>Canada's carbon tax is not universal, meaning it is a patchwork quilt across the country. Only retail fossil fuels are taxed, while big industry has its own complicated and inefficient program, making the rebates smaller for everyone. Most importantly, until recently, the government hid the rebates so that most Canadians who got them did not know they were receiving them.</p><p>CCL-Canada's 2024 national conference will be held in Ottawa from June 1 to 4. Will Morin will be there again and plans to build an even bigger dreamcatcher. I sincerely hope that, while we are doing that, we can also fix the shortcomings in Canada's carbon tax with rebates program so that it benefits all Canadians and can lead to the global carbon fee-and-dividend that we need to control climate change.</p><p>Keith McNeill</p><p>Clearwater, B.C.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Clearwater Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLETME-news20240507PNT4600564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLETME2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C03-9VW1-F0HF-801F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438212</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

They hire local youth and essentially provide additional workforce to help get local climate projects done.</p><p>\u201cThe work we do is not make work projects,\u201d Gerum said. \u201cThese are actually real initiatives that need to happen to make places more resilient. But there\u2019s also the youth leadership development in aspect and the career skills development aspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s also so critical is that young folks coming together with other young folks to do the work,\u201d she added. \u201cknowing how eco-anxiety is impacting folks in that age group and that they are going to live a very different version of the climate crisis than we are currently. They\u2019re going to be more impacted \u2026 actually nurturing hope through action and work is something that we\u2019ve seen and I think research backs up as being one of the most effective strategies for that kind of youth mental health and well-being piece.\u201d</p><p>The program is modelled on previously-existing youth service programs like Katimavik and Canada World Youth. However, in the YCCBC model, they recognize that unemployment among young people in B.C. is quite high, and want to give local young people the chance to make a living wage while helping their own communities.</p><p>YCCBC and the City of Courtenay will asking local non-profits and organizations to submit proposals for work the youth will be able to do.</p><p>\u201cIn the next couple weeks, the City of Courtenay will invite local organizations interested in working with YCCBC to submit project proposals,\u201d city staff said in an email to the Record. \u201cYCCBC can provide support for projects that advance climate change mitigation and/or adaption within the Comox Valley.</p><p>\u201cThey are looking forward to working with a combination of volunteer organizations, registered non-profits, public organizations, social enterprises, and agricultural producers.YCCBC is interested in supporting a variety of projects to provide local young people with diverse experience in climate action work.\u201d</p><p>The employees will then work in various fields through the summer to get skills across the board that can be transferred to other jobs in the climate sector.</p><p>\u201cIt can be really hard to enter the green economy and the green sector,\u201d Gerum said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give folks kind of that avenue in that they can run with then after the program \u2026 with economic uncertainty happening in a very particular ways right now, giving folks the chance to make a living wage \u2026 feels really important.\u201d</p><p>The job postings for the program are currently open, and will be until April 6. The two leading coordinator positions will be closing next week (March 26). To apply, visit the YCCBC website. The program launches in May.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVRECO-news20250326PPXA0004669435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVRECO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDW-74D3-RTWR-Y29T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438259</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.
