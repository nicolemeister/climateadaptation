Agroforestry is the practice of growing trees in conjunction with food crops.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIn 45 years of working with the forest industry either as a leader or as a politician, I don\u2019t think I have seen a company come forward with such a brave attempt at progressive community work,\u201d said former MLA and cabinet minister Corky Evans at a Jan. 21 online meeting about the proposal.</p><p>The two-hectare project would be situated adjacent to and above the Great Northern Rail Trail near the Nelson cemetery.</p><p>It would comprise a small part of a much larger timber harvesting and wildfire mitigation program by Kalesnikoff and the Regional District of Central Kootenay, planned for the mountainside visible from Nelson.</p><p>The Selous in Bloom idea was originated by Gerald Cordeiro, a forest development manager at Kalesnikoff Lumber.</p><p>He says this experiment could improve on conventional methods of mitigating wildfire danger, which mostly involve thinning the forest and cleaning up the forest floor.</p><p>Cordeiro said that method has some drawbacks because it is not a natural ecological process. It can reduce soil fertility and make sparse standing trees vulnerable to windstorms. It can also reduce both biodiversity and long-term timber supply, and it is expensive because it has to be done every few years.</p><p>Multi-level, diverse, and fire resistant Agroforesty, he said, would create a multi-level, diverse, fire-resistant forest and garden that would also improve local food security and provide employment.</p><p>He said it could also promote reconciliation with Indigenous people through use of traditional ecological knowledge, and provide opportunities for education, research and collaboration.</p><p>Kalesnikoff would sacrifice some timber at the site.</p><p>\u201cWe can intentionally set these things up so that we can maintain some timber supply out of them,\u201d Cordeiro said, \u201cprobably on a smaller scale, and on a slower removal. But there is room for timber within these systems.\u201d</p><p>Evans praised the idea. \u201cIf you grow less trees per acre, you grow better trees, higher value trees, and this could set an example for the industry provincially,\u201d he said.</p><p>Evans, a resident of the Slocan Valley, was a B.C. cabinet minister in the late 1990s and early 2000s who headed, at different times, the ministries of agriculture, transportation and health.</p><p>Cordeiro said he would like to see a mix of native conifers and additional tree species including walnut, \u201cwith the lower part of the canopy that is made up of non-flammable, valuable species from an agricultural perspective.\u201d</p><p>Cordeiro says the company is looking for a non-profit organization that might want to take over the project.</p><p>A new kind of forest tenure? His vision is larger than two hectares, suggesting the province should set up a new kind of forest tenure that would encourage agroforestry.</p><p>\u201cMy vision is that this is a major tool that gets used throughout the urban interface in B.C. , and throughout the world... It\u2019s being done in some places.\u201d</p><p>He said agroforestry could address wildfire and food security threats simultaneously, but it would require changes to forest tenure legislation.</p><p>\u201c\u2026 you can\u2019t go around willy nilly on public lands starting to grow stuff. So I think we need to improve the legislative framework to expand this into Crown land.\u201d</p><p>Asked if agroforestry could replace clearcutting, Cordeiro said such a project would probably only happen in forests adjacent to communities.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to improve our practices, and partial cut where it\u2019s suitable to partially cut. We can\u2019t partial cut every single place we go.\u201d</p><p>Cordeiro admits the agroforestry idea is experimental.</p><p>Gregoire Lamoureux, a restoration ecologist and permaculture designer who runs Kootenay Permaculture, says the project is progressive and innovative.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate this pilot project, which will be starting small, and with careful observation and adaptive management, it can fine-tune the specific plants and spacing for the site and create a successful project that could be implemented in other regions of the province and possibly across Canada,\u201d Lamoureux told the Nelson Star.</p><p>Local forest consultant Herb Hammond is more skeptical. He calls it \u201cthe tail wagging the dog\u201d because it does not deal with the real problem of what he calls privatized public forests.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the government leadership here?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe proposal speaks to management of public forest land, but is made through a corporate timber extraction lens.\u201d</p><p>Nelson Coun. Keith Page told the Nelson Star the novelty of the project means it will have to overcome a lot of hurdles.</p><p>\u201cProjects of this kind are in many ways a very old way of thinking rediscovered for the problems of the 21st century,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an integrated multi-stakeholder co-benefit model that has tremendous potential to revolutionize how the Kootenays can take advantage of our interior rainforest climate and lead the province towards a sustainable resource management model.\u201d</p><p>Kalesnikoff Lumber is inviting public input into the proposal on its website.</p><p>The larger wildfire mitigation project on the visible mountain-side landscape south of Nelson, which includes logging, will begin later in the spring.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ROSNWS-news20210204PSFA0001591487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ROSNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6273-VD11-F0HF-849B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438271</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

This work shows that multiple types of conservation actions are usually beneficial and are needed to curb the loss of biodiversity.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">World Nature Conservation Day offers a moment to reflect on our role in fostering a deeper appreciation for our planet's biodiversity and supporting the stability of ecosystems. At Cisco, investing in resilient ecosystems is one of the three key priorities of The Plan for Possible, our next-generation environmental sustainability strategy. We invite you to learn more about the impactful work that some of our nonprofit partners are doing in this area. These remarkable organizations remind us that every action counts, and that collaboration is essential to enhance the health of our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reconnecting Northland</p><p>Reconnecting Northland, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Te Tai Tokerau (Northland, New Zealand), brings communities, agencies, and resources together to support thriving ecosystems and revitalize biodiversity on behalf of nature and future generations. In response to environmental degradation, community taiao (environment) groups are responding by taking action to protect biodiversity and improve ecosystem health by removing pest and weed species, planting native vegetation, installing fencing, wetland restoration and more. These groups often face significant challenges in acquiring the funding, expert advice, skills, administrative support, and other resources necessary to undertake complex restoration projects. Responses are also often disconnected, leaving well-intended agencies and local communities struggling to achieve desired outcomes.</p><p>Reconnecting Northland designed their central program: Te Kete Hononga (The Basket of Connections) to support and grow the capabilities of community and Indigenous groups as they work toward socio-ecological regeneration across the region with benefits for climate, freshwater, and biodiversity. The Cisco Foundation supports Reconnecting Northland's Te Kete program to build local capacity and agency for communities to create, deliver and measure their own ecological solutions. To do so, the program provides tools (monitoring, project management, and story mapping) and services (business development, leadership training, communications, and research) to communities across the region. Reconnecting Northland found the program led to increased collaboration between diverse community groups, agencies and iwi (Mori tribes); deeper government involvement and funding in community-led initiatives; increased knowledge exchanges; and the growth of more sustainable systems and practices at the community level.</p><p>Pettania Hohaia - a Te Kete Hononga Kairaranga (Community Weaver) for the Waimamaku area shared her powerful personal account: \"You supported us as katiaki (guardians) to become resilient and self-sustaining. And you've done it by allowing us to lead and make decisions.\"</p><p>NetHope's Climate Intersections Grant program</p><p>NetHope's Climate Intersections Grant program - part of NetHope (an NGO) and Cisco's joint Digital Breakthrough Initiative - aims to advance digital solutions for climate adaptation and resilience. NetHope member and Climate Intersections partner, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), is harnessing digital innovation to advance global conservation efforts.</p><p>WCS collaborates with Birdlife International and World Wildlife Fund in the Trillion Trees program, dedicated to protecting and restoring forests globally. Central to their efforts is FORMAPP, a sophisticated monitoring system developed by WCS's Conservation Technology team on behalf of the Trillion Trees partnership to track reforestation projects effectively by improving data management efficiency and making relevant resources more accessible. Comprising a smartphone app, database, and online portal, FORMAPP streamlines data collection, storage, and reporting, utilizing ConSoScis toolkit.</p><p>Thanks to the grant, Trillion Trees upgraded the data integration technology supporting FORMAPP and translated all materials-website, training resources, video tutorials, and forms-into French and Spanish. Field data remains the fundamental building block on which the climate and biodiversity benefits of restoration efforts can be measured.</p><p>Through strategic partnerships and technological innovation, WCS and its partners continue to empower communities and drive meaningful change in conservation efforts worldwide. The integration of digital solutions not only amplifies their impact but also strengthens resilience in the face of climate challenges, demonstrating the transformative potential of collaborative initiatives like the NetHope Climate Intersections Grant Program.</p><p>Farmers for Forests</p><p>A 2023 deforestation report indicated that India has the second highest rate of deforestation after losing 668,400 hectares of forest cover in the last 30 years. A more recent article indicates a significant decline in large farmland trees in India over the past decade. Climate change and deforestation are closely interlinked phenomena that have a bidirectional relationship where changes in one impact the other. Wildfires, disruption of water cycles, extreme weather events and changes to habitat are some of the outcomes of such imbalances.</p><p>The Cisco India Cash Grant program worked with Climatesense Pvt Limited (branded as Farmers for Forests), through an accelerator with Villgro. Farmers for Forests/F4F, is a nonprofit organization that is on a mission to combat the impact of climate change on environmental and human well-being by increasing India's natural and biodiverse forest and tree cover. By leveraging the immense advances in geospatial and drone technology, they are implementing and monitoring agroforestry projects. With the use of drones, satellite data, and modifying open source artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms the team quantifies carbon sequestered, biodiversity levels, and water savings of the forests and agroforestry plantations which helps to put an accurate price on the ecosystem services that are being provided.</p><p>The accelerator enabled the organization to develop a technology powered tree detection platform that identifies various parameter of trees such as species, count and tree height that helps in informed digital monitoring, reporting and verification process of carbon projects for the 2500+ acres of land under ecological restoration that they currently manage and more that will be added as they grow.</p><p>Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara</p><p>Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara (YKAN) is a nonprofit organization that works in 14 provinces across Indonesia to protect nature and preserve the biodiversity of a vast archipelago comprising 17,500 islands, stretching 5,000 km from east to west. This high marine biodiversity is reflected in Indonesia's fisheries. Fishing is an important part of the culture of Indonesia's coastal people, and market surveys show that Indonesia's fisheries include over 873 species of bony fish and over 137 species of sharks, rays, and chimeras. Unfortunately, many of these fisheries are over-exploited, while others lack any data on their status and life-history-some of the traded fishes are even new to science. With grant support from the Cisco Foundation, YKAN is leveraging the innovative software application called FishFace (Fish Facial Identification Technology) to help the government and fishing communities understand the status of fish stocks in the area and to design solutions to manage these fisheries for the benefit of people and nature.</p><p>Working in close partnership with Geeks Without Frontiers and PT Intelion, YKAN is designing a new approach to overcome this challenge. Initial trials have shown that a FishFace system, which utilizes AI, outperforms trained observers, achieving 99% accuracy. Coupled with software that automatically grabs a picture of a fish as the crew moves it through the field of vision of a digital camera, a FishFace system can revolutionize fisheries research and management in Indonesia with real-time data collection and can provide a more accurate dataset on the status of Indonesia's fish stocks and insights for local fishery regulations that will preserve nature and the biodiversity of the region.</p><p>Thank you to the organizations that shared their stories with us.

This work shows that multiple types of conservation actions are usually beneficial and are needed to curb the loss of biodiversity.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">World Nature Conservation Day offers a moment to reflect on our role in fostering a deeper appreciation for our planet's biodiversity and supporting the stability of ecosystems. At Cisco, investing in resilient ecosystems is one of the three key priorities of The Plan for Possible, our next-generation environmental sustainability strategy. We invite you to learn more about the impactful work that some of our nonprofit partners are doing in this area. These remarkable organizations remind us that every action counts, and that collaboration is essential to enhance the health of our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reconnecting Northland</p><p>Reconnecting Northland, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Te Tai Tokerau (Northland, New Zealand), brings communities, agencies, and resources together to support thriving ecosystems and revitalize biodiversity on behalf of nature and future generations. In response to environmental degradation, community taiao (environment) groups are responding by taking action to protect biodiversity and improve ecosystem health by removing pest and weed species, planting native vegetation, installing fencing, wetland restoration and more. These groups often face significant challenges in acquiring the funding, expert advice, skills, administrative support, and other resources necessary to undertake complex restoration projects. Responses are also often disconnected, leaving well-intended agencies and local communities struggling to achieve desired outcomes.</p><p>Reconnecting Northland designed their central program: Te Kete Hononga (The Basket of Connections) to support and grow the capabilities of community and Indigenous groups as they work toward socio-ecological regeneration across the region with benefits for climate, freshwater, and biodiversity. The Cisco Foundation supports Reconnecting Northland's Te Kete program to build local capacity and agency for communities to create, deliver and measure their own ecological solutions. To do so, the program provides tools (monitoring, project management, and story mapping) and services (business development, leadership training, communications, and research) to communities across the region. Reconnecting Northland found the program led to increased collaboration between diverse community groups, agencies and iwi (M\u0101ori tribes); deeper government involvement and funding in community-led initiatives; increased knowledge exchanges; and the growth of more sustainable systems and practices at the community level.</p><p>Pettania Hohaia - a Te Kete Hononga Kairaranga (Community Weaver) for the Waimamaku area shared her powerful personal account: \"You supported us as katiaki (guardians) to become resilient and self-sustaining. And you've done it by allowing us to lead and make decisions.\"</p><p>NetHope's Climate Intersections Grant program</p><p>NetHope's Climate Intersections Grant program - part of NetHope (an NGO) and Cisco's joint Digital Breakthrough Initiative - aims to advance digital solutions for climate adaptation and resilience. NetHope member and Climate Intersections partner, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), is harnessing digital innovation to advance global conservation efforts.</p><p>WCS collaborates with Birdlife International and World Wildlife Fund in the Trillion Trees program, dedicated to protecting and restoring forests globally. Central to their efforts is FORMAPP, a sophisticated monitoring system developed by WCS's Conservation Technology team on behalf of the Trillion Trees partnership to track reforestation projects effectively by improving data management efficiency and making relevant resources more accessible. Comprising a smartphone app, database, and online portal, FORMAPP streamlines data collection, storage, and reporting, utilizing ConSoSci's toolkit.</p><p>Thanks to the grant, Trillion Trees upgraded the data integration technology supporting FORMAPP and translated all materials-website, training resources, video tutorials, and forms-into French and Spanish. Field data remains the fundamental building block on which the climate and biodiversity benefits of restoration efforts can be measured.</p><p>Through strategic partnerships and technological innovation, WCS and its partners continue to empower communities and drive meaningful change in conservation efforts worldwide. The integration of digital solutions not only amplifies their impact but also strengthens resilience in the face of climate challenges, demonstrating the transformative potential of collaborative initiatives like the NetHope Climate Intersections Grant Program.</p><p>Farmers for Forests</p><p>A 2023 deforestation report indicated that India has the second highest rate of deforestation after losing 668,400 hectares of forest cover in the last 30 years. A more recent article indicates a significant decline in large farmland trees in India over the past decade. Climate change and deforestation are closely interlinked phenomena that have a bidirectional relationship where changes in one impact the other. Wildfires, disruption of water cycles, extreme weather events and changes to habitat are some of the outcomes of such imbalances.</p><p>The Cisco India Cash Grant program worked with Climatesense Pvt Limited (branded as Farmers for Forests), through an accelerator with Villgro. Farmers for Forests/F4F, is a nonprofit organization that is on a mission to combat the impact of climate change on environmental and human well-being by increasing India's natural and biodiverse forest and tree cover. By leveraging the immense advances in geospatial and drone technology, they are implementing and monitoring agroforestry projects. With the use of drones, satellite data, and modifying open source artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms the team quantifies carbon sequestered, biodiversity levels, and water savings of the forests and agroforestry plantations which helps to put an accurate price on the ecosystem services that are being provided.</p><p>The accelerator enabled the organization to develop a technology powered tree detection platform that identifies various parameter of trees such as species, count and tree height that helps in informed digital monitoring, reporting and verification process of carbon projects for the 2500+ acres of land under ecological restoration that they currently manage and more that will be added as they grow.</p><p>Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara</p><p>Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara (YKAN) is a nonprofit organization that works in 14 provinces across Indonesia to protect nature and preserve the biodiversity of a vast archipelago comprising 17,500 islands, stretching 5,000 km from east to west. This high marine biodiversity is reflected in Indonesia's fisheries. Fishing is an important part of the culture of Indonesia's coastal people, and market surveys show that Indonesia's fisheries include over 873 species of bony fish and over 137 species of sharks, rays, and chimeras. Unfortunately, many of these fisheries are over-exploited, while others lack any data on their status and life-history-some of the traded fishes are even new to science. With grant support from the Cisco Foundation, YKAN is leveraging the innovative software application called FishFace (Fish Facial Identification Technology) to help the government and fishing communities understand the status of fish stocks in the area and to design solutions to manage these fisheries for the benefit of people and nature.</p><p>Working in close partnership with Geeks Without Frontiers and PT Intelion, YKAN is designing a new approach to overcome this challenge. Initial trials have shown that a FishFace system, which utilizes AI, outperforms trained observers, achieving 99% accuracy. Coupled with software that automatically grabs a picture of a fish as the crew moves it through the field of vision of a digital camera, a FishFace system can revolutionize fisheries research and management in Indonesia with real-time data collection and can provide a more accurate dataset on the status of Indonesia's fish stocks and insights for local fishery regulations that will preserve nature and the biodiversity of the region.</p><p>Thank you to the organizations that shared their stories with us. As we continue to navigate the challenges of climate change, embracing innovative solutions and fostering global partnerships can help us protect our ecosystems and create a more sustainable future.</p><p>View original content here.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/896792/cisco-how-technology-is-being-used-to-help-support-environmental-conservation\">press release</url> on accesswire.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-441577053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CNB-X851-F11P-X0RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Filing Services Canada Inc.

Guided tours will run for 45 mins to an hour, and there will also be facility tours while the evaporator is running.</p><p>Admission to the event is by donation only, with all proceeds supporting local food banks through the Knights of Columbus.</p><p>Follow the event's Facebook page to register for the activities and more information at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/FallInLoveNG\">www.facebook.com/FallInLoveNG</url></p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210919TMKB2021091962265725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63N8-KPF1-F197-50FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

(\"Klimat X\" or the \"Company\") which carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets, is pleased to announce it has signed a binding agreement with the national government of Suriname to develop mangrove carbon credit and agroforestry projects. The Company has built a presence in Suriname and is actively conducting fieldwork to establish project size and feasibility. //st * The Agreement identifies 2 initial mangrove carbon credit projects in the Coronie and Commewijne Districts (the 'Projects') covering at least 3,000 ha, which will be led, structured, and managed by Klimat X (the \"Company\") while exploring for other project sites. * Since the signing of the Agreement in December 2022 , a team led by the Company team has conducted extensive due diligence and scoping to optimize and de-risk the projects. </p><p>* On April 24 , the Klimat X technical and field team, led by Dr. Steve Crooks from Silvestrum Climate Associates commenced fieldwork in Suriname to establish the technical foundations for measuring greenhouse gas emissions reductions. * Building on the previous expeditionary trips, the team is working to evaluate the potential immediate and long-term greenhouse gas benefits from mangrove conservation and restoration from the projects. * Degraded mangroves with impaired hydrology can be a significant source of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and the team will be directly measuring these emissions during the fieldwork. Interventions that restore the natural hydrology of the project sites can dramatically reduce methane emissions, generating significant volumes of carbon credits. * Klimat X is also in active discussions with two significant international organizations (and prospective partners), already active in-country, to assist with elements of both civil engineering and community work that are likely to be needed in the successful delivery of the projects. * Klimat X remains grateful to the Faculty of Technical Sciences at the University of Suriname for their continued insights and support for the Projects and hopes a relationship of mutual benefit will continue to strengthen with Company investment in capacity building.</p><p>CEO, Dr. James Tansey comments, \"Mangroves play a critical role in regulating climate change and in protecting coastlines from storms and sea level rise. This latest jurisdictional agreement builds on the model we have established in other countries including Mexico and Sierra Leone. We will be able to invest in the protection and restoration of these mangrove areas, reducing emissions of carbon and methane on an unprecedented scale. As recently announced, there is strong interest from buyers in these projects.\" Background</p><p>Klimat X, through its controlled subsidiary, Pomeroon Trading (Holdings) Limited ('PTHL'), has entered into a legally binding co-operation agreement (the 'Agreement') with the Government of the Republic of Suriname. The Agreement outlines details of the co-operation agreed between the parties with regard to the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation of mangroves in Suriname, including the qualification of these projects for voluntary carbon credits and the subsequent sale and marketing of those credits. The background to the agreement acknowledged the globally leading significance of the Republic of Suriname as one of only three net negative carbon emitters globally, and the commitment of its people and Government to protecting and restoring its considerable natural endowment. Suriname has approximately 100,000 ha of mangroves, which provide critical biodiversity habitat and protect the coastline from floods and sea level rise. Following the completion of the current period of fieldwork, the Company will provide estimates of the potential scale of the carbon credit production from these interventions. Klimat X will work directly with large buyers to fund the completion of the project through a pre-purchase or investment agreement. About Klimat X</p><p>Klimat X carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets. In contrast to streaming and royalty companies, Klimat X works upstream as a direct owner and operator of projects, addressing a key supply constraint the current market and the rapidly growing demand for carbon credits in global voluntary and regulated markets. The Corporation intends to achieve this by investing in the exploration, restoration and management of terrestrial and marine systems that can either be protected to enhance the sequestration of greenhouse gases or restored from a degraded status to fully productive ecosystems. Klimat X will draw on the experience of a senior executive team and board that provide access into key target jurisdictions through relationships in the mining and natural resources sectors, combined with decades of experience in carbon markets. Klimat X plans to deploy capital at risk under various arrangements (including cooperation, assignment and production sharing agreements) with large landowners and governments in various suitable jurisdictions around the world.

Elders and knowledge holders talk about perennial management all the time. It\u2019s no surprise these forest gardens continue to grow at archaeological village sites that haven\u2019t yet been too severely disrupted by settler-colonial land use.\u201d</p><p>What I find interesting is the recent revelation of the findings at the Kamloops residential school where the colonial attitude was to eliminate native languages and way of life instead of incorporating many of the more sustainable Indigenous practices.</p><p>Fortunately some information was recorded in studies like Nancy Turners ethnobotany books but this only captured a fraction of the knowledge that was available through the original oral traditions of the future generations which was seriously disrupted by the residential schools.</p><p>I am not suggesting that we have to practice agroforestry on all of the existing commercial forests but we need to seriously look at some of our practices.</p><p>For example, in a re-cent study, one year after glyphosate treatment, 26 per cent of raspberry and blueberry fruit samples taken from cut blocks in the research study would be \u201cdeemed unfit for human consumption\u201d if assessed by Canadian Food Inspection Agency standards. Glyphosate and AMPA (the metabolite derived from it) residues were detected in the fruits for at least one full year after spraying.</p><p>In addition, low levels of weed killer residue persisted in raspberry shoots, fireweed shoots, and willow shoots for at least six years and in fireweed roots for twelve years With the ongoing droughts in the south it might be prudent to consider growing more of our food in some adjacent forests or at least not destroy what we have.</p><p>Jim Hilton is a professional agrologist and forester who has lived and worked in the Cariboo Chilcotin for the past 40 years. Now retired, Hilton still volunteers his skills with local community forests organizations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WILLTA-news20210617PTDA0001946133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WILLTA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62Y5-3BY1-JD2C-J09V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Elders and knowledge holders talk about perennial manage-ment all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise these forest gardens continue to grow at archaeological village sites that haven\u2019t yet been too severely disrupted by settler-colonial land-use.\u201d</p><p>What I find interesting is the recent revelation of the findings at the Kamloops residential school where the colonial attitude was to eliminate native languages and way of life instead of incorporating many of the more sustainable indigenous practices.</p><p>Fortunately some information was recorded in studies like Nancy Turners ethno-botany books but this only captured a fraction of the knowledge that was available through the original oral traditions of the future generations which was seriously disrupted by the residential schools.</p><p>I am not suggesting that we have to practice agroforestry on all of the existing commercial forest but we need to seriously look at some of our practices.</p><p>For example, in a recent study, one year after glyphosate treatment, 26 per cent of raspberry and blueberry fruit samples taken from cut blocks in the research study would be \u201cdeemed unfit for human consumption\u201d if assessed by Canadian Food Inspection Agency standards. Glyphosate and AMPA (the metabolite derived from it) residues were detected in the fruits for at least one full year after spraying.</p><p>In addition, low levels of weed killer residue persisted in raspberry shoots, fireweed shoots, and willow shoots for at least six years and in fireweed roots for twelve years With the ongoing droughts in the south it might be prudent to consider growing more of our food in some adjacent forests or at least not destroy what we have.</p><p>Jim Hilton is a professional agrologist and forester who has lived and worked in the Cariboo Chilcotin for the past 40 years. Now retired, Hilton still volunteers his skills with local community forests organizations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20210616PSCA0001939622</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62XT-F791-JD2C-J0JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

You might already be familiar with the Association's springtime event, Maple Weekend.</p><p>Since Maple Weekend was cancelled for the past two years due to the pandemic, while the spring was a prime time for lockdowns, the hope is that the Fall in Love with Maple event can attract the same group of maple-lovers to rural sugarbushes throughout Ontario.</p><p>In Kemptville, staff and volunteers at the Agroforestry Centre hope the event will remind the community of the natural asset they have right in their back yard - walking trails that weave through 18 acres of diverse forest, where the sugarbush is nestled, producing roughly 1,000 liters of syrup annually.</p><p>The sugarbush has been there since the start of the Kemptville College in 1917. The Agroforestry Centre hosted many research projects and educational programs over the years. However, when the college closed in 2014 and the University of Guelph stopped maintaining the centre, the sugarbush was abandoned.</p><p>It was former campus forester, Peter Wensink, who revived the operation.</p><p>The Fall in Love with Maple event will honour Wensink, who passed away suddenly last July, as agroforestry staff dedicate the forest to him during the second day of the event on Sunday, Sept. 26.</p><p>\"When you went on a forestry tour with Peter, you'd never know what time you'd get back,\" said Frank Heerkens, OMSPA President and syrup producer at the Kemptville sugarbush. \"He was so good at teaching people that they were entranced the whole time - he could even keep the kids quiet!\"</p><p>Heerkens says Wensink's death was a great loss to the community and society as a whole.</p><p>\"If you spent any time with Peter and left without learning anything, you weren't listening,\" said Heerkens. \"He brought this place back to life.\"</p><p>Wensink ran the agroforestry centre from 2009 to 2014 and then brought Heerkens in to \"help get it rolling again\" in 2016, explained Karen Bedard, volunteer at the centre and co-organizer of the new event. Wensink's best friend, Jim Hendry, is the new campus forester.</p><p>\"Peter was a sweet man with a big heart,\" said Bedard.</p><p>The intent behind the new event is to showcase the maple production and bring people into the forest when its natural beauty is at its peak.</p><p>\"A lot of people don't even know that this place exists,\" said Bedard. \"I think this event will be great for the campus.\"</p><p>Attendees will be treated to a pancake breakfast served by the Knights of Columbus. There will also be live music with a number of local acts, guided forest tours, and local maple syrup for sale, in addition to other maple products.</p><p>\"But there's more than just the maple,\" said Heerkens. \"We have 18 acres here at the sugarbush, and 360 acres of forest.\"</p><p>The forest is very diverse, with groves of black walnut, butternut, oak, and several species of deciduous and coniferous trees. Guided tours will run for 45 mins to an hour, and there will also be facility tours while the evaporator is running.</p><p>Admission to the event is by donation only, with all proceeds supporting local food banks through the Knights of Columbus.</p><p>Follow the event's Facebook page to register for the activities and more information at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/FallInLoveNG\">www.facebook.com/FallInLoveNG</url></p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210914TMKB2021091462220269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M6-S351-F197-53YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

This time last year, it was around $1.49\u00a0US.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the market price of cheaper Robusta beans, favoured in Europe and by instant coffee makers, has more than doubled in the past 12 months.\u00a0</p><p>The price jumps come amid serious droughts in Brazil and Vietnam, two of the world's largest coffee producers. And with climate change driving up the frequency of these extreme weather events, industry insiders say the situation could result in a higher price for a cup of coffee in Canada down the line.\u00a0</p><p>The impact of climate change is \"becoming more and more obvious...\u00a0particularly in the countries of origin,\"\u00a0Robert Carter, president of the Coffee Association of Canada told CBC News.\u00a0</p><p>\"We've got other impacts such as pests and disease in regions like Colombia and Vietnam. So, you throw all of that together, tied in with supply chain disruptions, that's resulting in this price pressure we're experiencing on coffee.\"</p><p>Canadian roasters feeling the heat</p><p>Up to 5,500 pounds of coffee beans are roasted every day at Chronicle Coffee Roasters in Calgary\u00a0depending on the time of year, said\u00a0owner and founder Karl Ward. They roast for themselves and other brands, and work with independent cafes across Canada.\u00a0</p><p/><p>The market, he says, has always fluctuated.</p><p>\"But one thing as roasters we've never seen before is a fluctuation like we have now.\"</p><p/><p>In Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, farmers have been grappling for months with one of the worst droughts the region has seen in decades. Huge swathes of the country have received abnormally low levels of rainfall since May, including the state of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil, which contains many of the country's Arabica farms.</p><p>One farmer in Caconde, a town in one of Sao Paulo state's key growing regions, told the Associated Press <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-climate-change-drought-coffee-harvest-a6516a4b314e6ba7c11513c08afb6996\">earlier this month</url> that he expected to harvest 120 sacks of coffee beans this season, but only managed to get\u00a0100 because of the drought.\u00a0</p><p>The failure of crops in Vietnam this year due to drought\u00a0has also put more stress on Brazil. Vietnam is the largest producer of the less abundant\u00a0Robusta beans. Some\u00a0traditional Robusta buyers shifted to purchasing Arabica, the majority of which is produced in Brazil. For specialty coffee roasters who only use Arabica beans, like Ward, that's added additional pressure.\u00a0</p><p>Producers say big price hikes haven't hit consumers yet</p><p>For Canadian consumers, the retail price of an average bag of roasted\u00a0or\u00a0ground coffee has\u00a0risen nearly 25 per cent in the last four years, according to Statistics Canada. That's far less than price rises on commodity markets, but the spike seen this year\u00a0is expected to cause an\u00a0\"uptick in prices on coffee down the road\"\u00a0for average consumers, said Carter.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Ups and downs in the commodity price of coffee don't translate exactly to the price of a latte at your local coffee shop, since cafes have many other expenses factored into a single cup, such as labour costs.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ward predicts further price increases for consumers will take three to six months to come into effect and it's unclear how much they could rise.</p><p>But companies in the middle of the supply chain are worried.\u00a0</p><p>Coffee commodity prices are up roughly\u00a080 per cent, Ward said. \"It's not sustainable for us as coffee roasters, and it's not going to be sustainable for the consumer.\"</p><p>He expects market prices will drop closer to $2-$2.20 US later this year -\u00a0cautioning this stabilization is dependent on weather conditions in\u00a0coffee-producing regions next year.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Climate change increasing drought\u00a0frequency:\u00a0scientist\u00a0</p><p>In Brazil's coffee-producing regions, a drought of this magnitude should occur \"about once every 50 years,\" according to Nathan Moore, an associate professor at Michigan State University who studies climate modelling. But concerns for the for the coffee industry increased during previous droughts in 2014 and 2021.\u00a0</p><p>\"In this case, it looks like climate change and deforestation together are combining to increase the probability of severe drought to be more frequent,\" Moore\u00a0said.\u00a0</p><p/><p>When trees are removed, it disrupts an\u00a0ecosystem's moisture recycling, potentially leaving regions more vulnerable to drought, Moore explained.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Deforestation has long been a problem in Brazil, with rates <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/world/deforestation-in-brazil-s-amazon-surges-bolsonaro-readies-troops-idUSKBN22K2PG/\">surging to record levels</url> under former president Jair Bolsonaro.\u00a0President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took power in 2023, vowed to end deforestation in the Amazon, and the rate <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/brazil-fires-climate-crime-1.7307415\">recently decreased</url>, according to data from the nation's space agency. But it's still a pressing concern.</p><p>Climate change\u00a0may be only one of the drivers behind the high prices we're seeing right now,\u00a0but it's\u00a0the\u00a0biggest threat to the sustained health of the industry in the future, experts say. Moore pointed out that an increased frequency of droughts could see farmers experiencing more failed harvests than they're used to budgeting for, potentially leading some to leave the industry altogether.\u00a0</p><p>Maren Oelbermann, a soil scientist and professor\u00a0in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo, explained that climate change and extreme weather also puts stress on the crops themselves by shifting the growing conditions that they're used to, which can put coffee plants at greater risk\u00a0for disease.\u00a0</p><p/><p>Sustainable growing models, such as \"agroforestry\" models\u00a0which\u00a0integrate trees in with crops on the same plot of land, may be required in order to maintain crop production in a changing climate while keeping costs down, she said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Probably the way we're doing agriculture, whether that's in the tropics or whether that's here in the temperate zone, we probably need to take a pretty good look at how we're doing things, because it may need to change,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think it just requires a shift in the way we think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewsbusinesscoffeepricesclimate17336813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D2V-HT01-JCMC-W38N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Work began earlier this month to work with the local landscape and \u201cplant valuable food crops that strengthen local food security and are both drought and wildfire resistant,\u201d a press release on the project noted.  </p><p>This will result in the planting of a mix of native and non-native plants \u2014 such as salmonberries and walnut trees \u2014 among trees in the area thinned for fuel mitigation. </p><p>\u201cCreating a community asset capable of generating social, nutritional and economic value will provide incentives and resources to make the site more fire-resistant and reduce the need for future wildfire treatment,\u201d the press release read. </p><p>The idea was first brought to light two years ago when Gerald Cordeiro, forest development manager for Kalesnikoff, proposed a similar idea for the Selous Creek fuel treated area above Nelson. </p><p>He felt the potential contained in agroforestry was immense, and could help keep the balance of carbon in the Columbia Basin. </p><p>\u201cBy selecting our species carefully, reducing emissions from wildfires, and using excess biomass to enhance soil health and carbon storage, these kinds of sites can support our climate change mitigation efforts,\u201d he said in the release. \u201cWe believe this is a scalable model that can have a measurable positive impact on our communities.\u201d </p><p>The two hectares chosen for the project will receive plants installed by Wildsight\u2019s Youth Climate Corps, and the young people will be trained by several experts, including Slocan Valley permaculture veteran Gregoire Lamoureux. </p><p>Bannock in Bloom was developed through an agreement between Wildsight\u2019s Youth Climate Corps, Kalesnikoff Lumber Co.

Elders and knowledge holders talk about perennial management all the time. It's no surprise these forest gardens continue to grow at archaeological village sites that haven't yet been too severely disrupted by settler-colonial land use.\"</p><p>What I find interesting is the recent revelation of the findings at the Kamloops residential school where the colonial attitude was to eliminate native languages and way of life instead of incorporating many of the more sustainable Indigenous practices.</p><p>Fortunately some information was recorded in studies like Nancy Turners ethnobotany books but this only captured a fraction of the knowledge that was available through the original oral traditions of the future generations which was seriously disrupted by the residential schools.</p><p>READ MORE: More soil amendment science needed for degraded soils</p><p>I am not suggesting that we have to practice agroforestry on all of the existing commercial forests but we need to seriously look at some of our practices.</p><p>For example, in a recent study, one year after glyphosate treatment, 26 per cent of raspberry and blueberry fruit samples taken from cut blocks in the research study would be \"deemed unfit for human consumption\" if assessed by Canadian Food Inspection Agency standards. Glyphosate and AMPA (the metabolite derived from it) residues were detected in the fruits for at least one full year after spraying.</p><p>In addition, low levels of weed killer residue persisted in raspberry shoots, fireweed shoots, and willow shoots for at least six years and in fireweed roots for twelve years</p><p>With the ongoing droughts in the south it might be prudent to consider growing more of our food in some adjacent forests or at least not destroy what we have.</p><p>Jim Hilton is a professional agrologist and forester who has lived and worked in the Cariboo Chilcotin for the past 40 years.

Set against a backdrop of lush forests, pristine waters, and a remarkable community, this inaugural event brought together Sheshegwaning First Nation and New Grain Kitchen of Gore Bay, an innovative culinary enterprise, to showcase the rich bounty of the land and waters of Manitoulin Island. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The event was centered around one star ingredient: sushi-grade rainbow trout, farmed in the crystal-clear waters surrounding Sheshegwaning. New Grain\u2019s renowned restauranteur, Genevieve Sartor, made this trout the focus of her sophisticated catering events for the past year, including her restaurant\u2019s menu the previous year. Ms. Sartor, a passionate gastronome with a global perspective, declared this fish to be the best she had ever tasted in her worldwide travels. \u201cI\u2019ve tasted fish in some of the most exquisite places, but Sheshegwaning\u2019s rainbow trout is something truly special,\u201d she said, her voice full of admiration for the pristine environment that produces such exceptional quality. </p><p>The collaboration between New Grain, Odawa Island Farms, and the local Sheshegwaning community went far beyond a simple meal. It was an immersive experience designed to educate, inspire, and connect people to the land and its traditions. The day began with a boat tour to the offshore fish farm, where guests saw firsthand the trout swimming in the clear, cold waters. Mike Miske, project manager for Odawa Island Farms, served as the tour guide, sharing insights into the farm\u2019s sustainable practices. </p><p>\u201cOffshore farming works well here because the strong, varied lake currents provide excellent water conditions. The fish grow faster and healthier, with better meat quality,\u201d Mr. Miske explained, pointing to the waters surrounding the cages. \u201cBut those same currents can also be our biggest challenge, making it hard to access the cages in rough waters. Still, we\u2019ve partnered with Sheshegwaning to complete our business cycle. We have our own factories, we grow our own fingerlings, and now, thanks to this partnership, we can raise our own fish right here.\u201d </p><p>The farm operates with a deep respect for the environment, something that aligns perfectly with the values of the Anishinaabek people. Daily checks on oxygen and temperature levels ensure the health and well-being of the fish, and during winter, aeration tubes keep oxygen flowing even under a thick layer of ice. This careful balance of tradition and innovation was echoed throughout the event, which aimed to fuse sustainable Indigenous food practices with local food culture while advocating for food security. </p><p>As the boat tour ended, guests were led to the Land First Youth Initiative Food Forest, a project spearheaded by Kiara Genereux, a former sous chef under Joseph Shawana, a renowned Anishinaabe chef from Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory. Ms. Genereux\u2019s vision for the food forest was rooted in her deep connection to the land and her desire to educate the next generation on sustainable food systems. This forest represents the future, where community members rely on the land in a sustainable way, just like their ancestors did. </p><p>Ms. Genereux\u2019s passion for food and community shone through in her collaboration with Ms. Sartor, which began when she reached out to discuss the food forest project. The idea quickly evolved into the full-fledged event that unfolded that day, combining traditional Anishinaabek food practices with the culinary creativity of New Grain Kitchen. Together, they curated a multi-course meal that not only highlighted the local rainbow trout but also featured wild rice, foraged ingredients, and other traditional foods. </p><p>\u201cI wanted this event to be integrative, to demonstrate a real commitment to local food, but not just in the sense of supporting young, white farmers,\u201d Ms. Sartor explained. \u201cThis is about all of us, in every shape and form we come in, contributing to food security here on Manitoulin. It\u2019s about making sure everyone has a seat at the table.\u201d </p><p>For Ms. Sartor, this event wasn\u2019t just about food\u2014it was about creating a space where diverse voices could come together to share stories, knowledge, and meals. \u201cTruth and Reconciliation isn\u2019t just a day. It\u2019s a practice, something we have to do together, day after day. And one of the most powerful ways to foster that connection is by breaking bread and eating fish together.\u201d </p><p>The meal itself was a testament to the land\u2019s bounty and the cultural heritage of the Anishinaabek people. Ms. Sartor crafted each dish to reflect the local environment, using ingredients sourced from Manitoulin Island. \u201cEverything on this menu is a love letter\u2014to this place, to the people, to the land. The potatoes come from the Amish, the trout has been smoked here by Kiara and Curtis, and the wild rice sourdough with trout gravlax was inspired by the image of trout swimming among the wild rice fields,\u201d Ms. Sartor explained, her passion evident as she spoke. </p><p>As the guests took in the Sheshegwaning community hall, transformed by candlelight and a fine dining atmosphere, Leonard Genereux spoke to the Odawa peoples\u2019 history as traders.  </p><p>\u201cWe used to travel with medicines and natural foods, but we also carried medicines and materials for trade. We set up trade centers where people from different areas would gather. Our reach extended as far as the Ohio Valley and up to Winnipeg. We used water routes for trading, including exchanging buffalo with the Sioux for fish. Conflicts would arise when one side took too much, so we had to regulate ourselves. Sheshegwaning has always been dear to me. When I was a kid, I described it as \u2018free.\u2019 Here we aren\u2019t centred on money, we are focused on respect and natural law.\u201d </p><p>Each course was not only delicious but also deeply meaningful, reflecting the interconnectedness of the land, the food, and the people who prepared it. \u201cThis event isn\u2019t meant to be self-aggrandizing,\u201d Ms. Sartor said. \u201cI\u2019m here to be a conduit, to engage with my environment as much as I can and to facilitate certain things where I can. My hand is guided by what\u2019s available, by the land itself. There\u2019s a kind of poetry to that\u2014an ecosystemic relationship between the food we eat and the stories we tell.\u201d </p><p>As guests enjoyed the meal, they were also treated to a tour of Odawa Freshwater Gardens, where Mr. Genereux\u2019s (Ms. Genereux\u2019s father) spoke about the history of the land and the traditional agricultural practices of the Odawa people. \u201cWe\u2019re reintroducing practices and plants that sustained our ancestors for generations,\u201d Mr. Genereux said, walking through rows of apple trees, chokecherry bushes, pawpaw and raspberries. \u201cWhat they did in the past is sustaining us today. We\u2019re just learning as much as we can to carry it forward.\u201d </p><p>The conversation revolved around sustainable living, food preservation, and the importance of traditional knowledge passed down from Elders. Mr. Genereux shared stories of how his ancestors lived off the land, planting crops and medicinal plants with an understanding of the natural world that is often lost in modern farming practices. \u201cMy grandpa had four acres, and that would feed a family of 14 for a year. That\u2019s the kind of knowledge we need to reclaim\u2014how to live with the land, not just off of it.\u201d </p><p>The event also touched on the role of agroforestry and the potential for collaboration with institutions like the University of Toronto, where students might volunteer to learn from the rich traditions of the Sheshegwaning community. \u201cThis is about more than just growing food,\u201d Mr. Genereux said. \u201cIt\u2019s about growing relationships\u2014with each other, with the land, and with the future.\u201d </p><p>By the end of the day, it was clear that this event had accomplished much more than introducing people to the exquisite flavours of Manitoulin Island. It had sparked conversations about sustainability, food sovereignty, and the importance of Indigenous food systems in the broader dialogue around climate change and food security. </p><p>Ms. Sartor, reflecting on the day\u2019s success, spoke of her hopes for the future. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see this grow into something much bigger\u2014where we can truly put Manitoulin on the map as a culinary destination. We have the product, the knowledge and the passion to make it happen.\u201d </p><p>As the sun set over the waters of Sheshegwaning, the event left a lasting impression on all who attended. It was a celebration not only of food but of the deep cultural and environmental connections that sustain us all, a powerful reminder that the future of food lies in the wisdom of the past, and in the hands of those who are willing to carry it forward. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-375fd14fc7ba4b70b7f3ff0c5c48cae6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D8C-SJ01-DY9S-T08F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1481\"/><timeReceived>11:27 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 24, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Agroforestry is the practice of growing trees in conjunction with food crops.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIn 45 years of working with the forest industry either as a leader or as a politician, I don\u2019t think I have seen a company come forward with such a brave attempt at progressive community work,\u201d said former MLA and cabinet minister Corky Evans at a Jan. 21 online meeting about the proposal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two-hectare project would be situated adjacent to and above the Great Northern Rail Trail near the Nelson cemetery.</p><p>It would comprise a small part of a much larger timber harvesting and wildfire mitigation program planned for the mountainside visible from Nelson by Kalesnikoff and the Regional District of Central Kootenay.</p><p>The Selous in Bloom idea was originated by Gerald Cordeiro, a forest development manager at Kalesnikoff Lumber.</p><p>He says this experiment could improve on conven-tional methods of mitigating wildfire danger, which mostly involve thinning the forest and cleaning up the forest floor.</p><p>Cordeiro said that method has some drawbacks because it is not a natural ecological process. It can reduce soil fertility and make sparse standing trees vulnerable to windstorms. It can also reduce both biodiversity and longterm timber supply, and it is expensive because it has to be done every few years.</p><p>Multi-level, diverse, and fire resistant Agroforesty, he said, would create a multi-level, diverse, fire resistant forest and garden that would also improve local food security and provide employment.</p><p>He said it could also promote reconciliation with Indigenous people through use of traditional ecological knowledge, and provide opportunities for education, research and collaboration.</p><p>Kalesnikoff would sacrifice some timber at the site.</p><p>\u201cWe can intentionally set these things up so that we can maintain some timber supply out of them,\u201d Cordeiro said, \u201cprobably on a smaller scale, and on a slower removal. But there is room for timber within these systems. And so we would then try to focus a little bit more on value instead of volume.\u201d</p><p>Evans praised this idea.</p><p>\u201cIf you grow less trees per acre, you grow better trees, higher value trees, and this could set an example for the industry provincially,\u201d he said.</p><p>Evans, a resident of the Slocan Valley, was a B.C. cabinet minister in the late 1990s and early 2000s, who headed, at different times, the ministries of agriculture, transportation, and health.</p><p>Cordeiro said he would like to see a mix of native conifers and additional tree species including walnut, \u201cwith the lower part of the canopy that is made up of non-flammable, valuable species from an agricultural perspective.</p><p>Cordeiro says the company is looking for a non-profit organization that might want to take the project over and run it.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not a project that Kalesnikoff is looking to take on and run long term,\u201d he said. \u201cMy intention is to try and give it a real good shove in the right direction and get it into the hands of people who can run it long term day-to-day.\u201d</p><p>A new kind of forest tenure? But Cordeiro\u2019s vision is larger than two hectares. He thinks the province should set up a new kind of forest tenure that would encourage agroforestry.</p><p>\u201cMy vision is that this is a major tool that gets used throughout the urban interface in B.C. , and throughout the world, to be honest. It\u2019s being done in some places. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve invented this idea.\u201d</p><p>He said agroforestry could address wildfire and food security threats at once.</p><p>\u201cWe think we can tackle both and get some other great benefits. And I think that the provincial government should take a deep dive into figuring out how to do this so it becomes the norm in our urban interface areas.\u201d</p><p>This would require changes to forest tenure legislation.</p><p>\u201cSo far, local gov-ernment people that I\u2019ve spoken with support the idea. But you can\u2019t go around willy nilly on public lands starting to grow stuff. So I think we need to improve the legislative framework to expand this into Crown land.\u201d</p><p>Asked at the meeting if agroforestry could replace clearcutting, Cordeiro said such a project would probably only happen in forests adjacent to communities. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to improve our practices, and partial cut where it\u2019s suitable to partially cut. We can\u2019t partial cut every single place we go. So I can\u2019t say that there\u2019s not going to be clear cutting elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Cordeiro admits the agroforestry idea is experimental.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the be-all end-all, but I think we\u2019d be really remiss in not trying it. There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny on the forest industry, a lot of public interest at this time, and how do we push forward in new and innovative ways? I think this is one of them.\u201d</p><p>Gregoire Lamoureux, a restoration ecologist and permaculture designer who runs Kootenay Permaculture, says the project is progressive and innovative.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate this pilot project, which will be starting small, and with careful observation and adaptive management, it can fine-tune the specific plants and spacing for the site and create a successful project that could be implemented in other regions of the province and possibly across Canada,\u201d Lamoureux told the Nelson Star.</p><p>Local forest consultant Herb Hammond is more skeptical. He calls it \u201cthe tail wagging the dog\u201d because it does not deal with the real problem of what he calls privatized public forests.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the government leadership here?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe proposal speaks to management of public forest land, but is made through a corporate timber extraction lens. This problem will not be fixed until the management and control of public forests are returned to a public agency that is responsible for protection and restoration of the ecological integrity of forests.\u201d</p><p>Nelson city councillor Keith Page, who attended the Jan. 21 meeting, told the Nelson Star the novelty of the project means it will have to overcome a lot of hurdles, and would benefit from a trial and error approach.</p><p>\u201cProjects of this kind are in many ways a very old way of thinking rediscovered for the problems of the 21st century,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an integrated multi-stakeholder co-benefit model that has tremendous potential to revolutionize how the Kootenays can take advantage of our interior rainforest climate and lead the province towards a sustainable resource management model.\u201d</p><p>Kalesnikoff Lumber is inviting public input into the proposal on its website.</p><p>The larger wildfire mitigation project on the visible mountain-side landscape south of Nelson, which includes logging, will begin later in the spring.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELSON-news20210128PRAA0001573569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELSON2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61X5-2WK1-JD2C-J0TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

We saw the world changing, and we saw the new realization of many people around the globe, whose eyes were opened by events like COVID, that they were losing their freedoms and independence. We realized that complaining about mandates and lockdowns did nothing to solve the problem. So, we set out to create a solution; freedom and self-sustainability oriented communities, now known as Veritas Villages.</p><p>I've been blessed to have created several successful businesses in my lifetime and have learned there is a formula to doing so.

We saw the world changing, and we saw the new realization of many people around the globe, whose eyes were opened by events like COVID, that they were losing their freedoms and independence. We realized that complaining about mandates and lockdowns did nothing to solve the problem. So, we set out to create a solution; freedom and self-sustainability oriented communities, now known as Veritas Villages.</p><p>I've been blessed to have created several successful businesses in my lifetime and have learned there is a formula to doing so. The formula starts with a great concept that has a growing market that is hungry for it. Then you add world class people who can deliver that concept. This can only be done with people that are passionate about making the concept come to life and who are willing to go beyond the regular call of duty to make it happen.</p><p>Roughly one year ago, my son Spencer, co-founder with myself of the Autris Group of companies, and I met our now CFO, Don Morrison, and together we decided to allow our clients, and ultimately anyone that sees the value in our business model, to be a part of it.

Agroforestry is the practice of growing trees in conjunction with food crops.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In 45 years of working with the forest industry either as a leader or as a politician, I don't think I have seen a company come forward with such a brave attempt at progressive community work,\" said former MLA and cabinet minister Corky Evans at a Jan. 21 online meeting about the proposal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two-hectare project would be situated adjacent to and above the Great Northern Rail Trail near the Nelson cemetery.</p><p>It would comprise a small part of a much larger timber harvesting and wildfire mitigation program planned for the mountainside visible from Nelson by Kalesnikoff and the Regional District of Central Kootenay.</p><p>The Selous in Bloom idea was originated by Gerald Cordeiro, a forest development manager at Kalesnikoff Lumber.</p><p>He says this experiment could improve on conventional methods of mitigating wildfire danger, which mostly involve thinning the forest and cleaning up the forest floor.</p><p>Cordeiro said that method has some drawbacks because it is not a natural ecological process. It can reduce soil fertility and make sparse standing trees vulnerable to windstorms.

Elders and knowledge holders talk about perennial management all the time.\"</p><p>\"It's no surprise these forest gardens continue to grow at archaeological village sites that haven't yet been too severely disrupted by settler-colonial land-use.\"</p><p>What I find interesting is the recent revelation of the findings at the Kamloops residential school where the colonial attitude was to eliminate native languages and way of life instead of incorporating many of the more sustainable indigenous practices.</p><p>Fortunately some information was recorded in studies like Nancy Turners ethnobotany books but this only captured a fraction of the knowledge that was available through the original oral traditions of the future generations which was seriously disrupted by the residential schools.</p><p>READ MORE: More soil amendment science needed for degraded soils</p><p>I am not suggesting that we have to practice agroforestry on all of the existing commercial forest but we need to seriously look at some of our practices.</p><p>For example, in a recent study, one year after glyphosate treatment, 26 per cent of raspberry and blueberry fruit samples taken from cut blocks in the research study would be \"deemed unfit for human consumption\" if assessed by Canadian Food Inspection Agency standards. Glyphosate and AMPA (the metabolite derived from it) residues were detected in the fruits for at least one full year after spraying.</p><p>In addition, low levels of weed killer residue persisted in raspberry shoots, fireweed shoots, and willow shoots for at least six years and in fireweed roots for twelve years</p><p>With the ongoing droughts in the south it might be prudent to consider growing more of our food in some adjacent forests or at least not destroy what we have.</p><p>Jim Hilton is a professional agrologist and forester who has lived and worked in the Cariboo Chilcotin for the past 40 years.

But there is room for timber within these systems. And so we would then try to focus a little bit more on value instead of volume.\u201d</p><p>Evans praised this idea.</p><p>\u201cIf you grow less trees per acre, you grow better trees, higher value trees, and this could set an example for the industry provincially,\u201d he said.</p><p>Evans, a resident of the Slocan Valley, was a B.C. cabinet minister in the late 1990s and early 2000s, who headed, at different times, the ministries of agriculture, transportation, and health.</p><p>Cordeiro said he would like to see a mix of native conifers and additional tree species including walnut, \u201cwith the lower part of the canopy that is made up of non-flammable, valuable species from an agricultural perspective.</p><p>Cordeiro says the company is looking for a non-profit organization that might want to take the project over and run it.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not a project that Kalesnikoff is looking to take on and run long term,\u201d he said. \u201cMy intention is to try and give it a real good shove in the right direction and get it into the hands of people who can run it long term day-to-day.\u201d</p><p>A new kind of forest tenure?

Agroforestry is the practice of growing trees in conjunction with food crops.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In 45 years of working with the forest industry either as a leader or as a politician, I don't think I have seen a company come forward with such a brave attempt at progressive community work,\" said former MLA and cabinet minister Corky Evans at a Jan. 21 online meeting about the proposal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two-hectare project would be situated adjacent to and above the Great Northern Rail Trail near the Nelson cemetery.</p><p>It would comprise a small part of a much larger timber harvesting and wildfire mitigation program planned for the mountainside visible from Nelson by Kalesnikoff and the Regional District of Central Kootenay.</p><p>The Selous in Bloom idea was originated by Gerald Cordeiro, a forest development manager at Kalesnikoff Lumber.</p><p>He says this experiment could improve on conventional methods of mitigating wildfire danger, which mostly involve thinning the forest and cleaning up the forest floor.</p><p>Cordeiro said that method has some drawbacks because it is not a natural ecological process. It can reduce soil fertility and make sparse standing trees vulnerable to windstorms. It can also reduce both biodiversity and long-term timber supply, and it is expensive because it has to be done every few years.</p><p>Multi-level, diverse, and fire resistant</p><p>Agroforesty, he said, would create a multi-level, diverse, fire resistant forest and garden that would also improve local food security and provide employment.</p><p>He said it could also promote reconciliation with Indigenous people through use of traditional ecological knowledge, and provide opportunities for education, research and collaboration.</p><p>Kalesnikoff would sacrifice some timber at the site.</p><p>\"We can intentionally set these things up so that we can maintain some timber supply out of them,\" Cordeiro said, \"probably on a smaller scale, and on a slower removal. But there is room for timber within these systems. And so we would then try to focus a little bit more on value instead of volume.\"</p><p>Evans praised this idea.</p><p>\"If you grow less trees per acre, you grow better trees, higher value trees, and this could set an example for the industry provincially,\" he said.</p><p>Evans, a resident of the Slocan Valley, was a B.C. cabinet minister in the late 1990s and early 2000s, who headed, at different times, the ministries of agriculture, transportation, and health.</p><p>Cordeiro said he would like to see a mix of native conifers and additional tree species including walnut, \"with the lower part of the canopy that is made up of non-flammable, valuable species from an agricultural perspective.</p><p>Cordeiro says the company is looking for a non-profit organization that might want to take the project over and run it.</p><p>\"Ultimately, it's not a project that Kalesnikoff is looking to take on and run long term,\" he said. \"My intention is to try and give it a real good shove in the right direction and get it into the hands of people who can run it long term day-to-day.\"</p><p>A new kind of forest tenure?</p><p>But Cordeiro's vision is larger than two hectares. He thinks the province should set up a new kind of forest tenure that would encourage agroforestry.</p><p>\"My vision is that this is a major tool that gets used throughout the urban interface in B.C., and throughout the world, to be honest. It's being done in some places. It's not like I've invented this idea.\"</p><p>[gps-image name=\"24021140_web_210128-KWS-SelousInBloom-Map_1.jpg\"]</p><p>He said agroforestry could address wildfire and food security threats at once.</p><p>\"We think we can tackle both and get some other great benefits. And I think that the provincial government should take a deep dive into figuring out how to do this so it becomes the norm in our urban interface areas.\"</p><p>This would require changes to forest tenure legislation.</p><p>\"So far, local government people that I've spoken with support the idea. But you can't go around willy nilly on public lands starting to grow stuff. So I think we need to improve the legislative framework to expand this into Crown land.\"</p><p>Asked at the meeting if agroforestry could replace clearcutting, Cordeiro said such a project would probably only happen in forests adjacent to communities.</p><p>\"We're trying to improve our practices, and partial cut where it's suitable to partially cut. We can't partial cut every single place we go. So I can't say that there's not going to be clear cutting elsewhere.\"</p><p>Cordeiro admits the agroforestry idea is experimental.</p><p>\"Maybe it's not the be-all end-all, but I think we'd be really remiss in not trying it. There's a lot of scrutiny on the forest industry, a lot of public interest at this time, and how do we push forward in new and innovative ways? I think this is one of them.\"</p><p>Gregoire Lamoureux, a restoration ecologist and permaculture designer who runs Kootenay Permaculture, says the project is progressive and innovative.</p><p>\"I appreciate this pilot project, which will be starting small, and with careful observation and adaptive management, it can fine-tune the specific plants and spacing for the site and create a successful project that could be implemented in other regions of the province and possibly across Canada,\" Lamoureux told the Nelson Star.</p><p>Local forest consultant Herb Hammond is more skeptical.

(CSE:BSKY)(OTCQB:BSKCF)(FWB:QE4 /WKN:A401NM) (\"BluSky\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative entry into the carbon removal clean technology sector, is pleased to announce that its recent joint business venture, doing business as BluMountain Carbon (see the Company's press release dated October 11, 2024), has entered into preliminary agreements with two commercial prospects focussed on earning Carbon Credit revenues through BioChar production in Orlando, Florida and the United Republic of Tanzania. The terms of each agreement are described below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TANZANIA PROJECT<br/>BluMountain has entered a binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with Carbon Market Exchange Inc. (\"CMX\") to collaborate on the development and operation of biochar production facilities utilizing local biomass feedstock provided by an existing agreement (to which CMX is a party) with a regional growers' association and other parties in Tanzania. The intention is for the facility to utilize BluSky Vulcan pyrolysis equipment, operational and consulting services to produce biochar, carbon removal credits, bio-oils and other products.</p><p>The LOI contemplates an exclusive relationship between the Company and CMX in regard to biochar production, bioenergy production, and biomass carbon removal (BCR) in Tanzania. The LOI is structured such that BluMountain would receive 66.67% of any net profits, and CMX would receive 33.33%, subject to adjustment if CMX fails to secure a formal deal with the regional growers' association or does not otherwise fulfill its contractual obligations, as reasonably determined by BluMountain.</p><p>CMX is a U.S.-based Delaware Corporation with primary operations in North Carolina and Michigan, USA, hosting an expert team and growing number of field offices worldwide. Led by CEO Shenna Fortner, the organization aims to develop innovative carbon offset programs to bridge the gap between environmental law, climate finance, and cutting-edge technology. Carbon Market Exchange Ltd was established in 2021 from the efforts of a group of environmentalists and finance executives aiming to bring together the financial industry and climate action in a way that makes meeting the international climate targets more accessible for companies and more supportive for conservationists. To date, CMX has led the development of carbon offset programs in Belize, Brazil, Tanzania, and Indonesia. In Tanzania, CMX is uniquely positioned to meet the rapidly growing demand for carbon offsets through a project which encompasses over 2.6 million acres of agroforestry, coastal ecosystems, and coral reefs.</p><p>\"We are excited to work with BluMountain to bring biochar and regenerative agriculture solutions to Tanzania's agricultural industry,\" said Shenna Fortner, CEO of Carbon Market Exchange. \"This collaboration represents a significant step toward sustainable development in Tanzania, helping to enrich soil health, support local communities, and capture carbon at scale.\"</p><p>ORLANDO PROJECT<br/>The project is structured as a 50/50 \"Joint Venture\" (\"JV\") between BluMountain and Neutralizing Environmental Trash Inc. (\"N.E.T. Inc.\" or \"NET\") under which BluMountain is to provide Vulcan pyrolysis equipment, operational and consulting service for biochar production, bioenergy production, and biomass carbon removal under the business joint venture brand \"NET of the Villages LLC,\" proposed to be located in the Orlando, Florida area. Local wood waste has been identified by NET for use as feedstock to service the estimated 50,000 tonnes of annual carbon removal projected from the venture.</p><p>NET is focused on converting waste biomass into biochar as a carbon-negative soil amendment to enrich soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable agriculture. Headquartered in Medford, Oregon, NET is led by President Nicolaas Vanderwey with over three decades of experience in the recycling and environmental sustainability industry, and Senior VP, Development, Misty Burris who oversees strategic planning, financial management, and also serves as President of CO2 Trust, a carbon credit marketplace.</p><p>Misty Burris, Senior VP of N.E.T. Inc. and President of CO2 Trust comments, \"Our partnership with BluMountain signifies a leap forward in demonstrating the transformative power of biochar as a solution for climate resilience. With this joint venture, we're not only advancing carbon sequestration but also fostering sustainable practices that strengthen local economies and ecosystems. This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation, community engagement, and meaningful environmental impact.\"</p><p>BluSky CEO, Will Hessert notes, \"The creation of our BluMountain joint venture is kicking off with some great opportunities. The team at CMX are very professional and exciting to work with, as are the dynamic folks at NET. With the carbon price index as fixed by NASDAQ collaborator PURO.earth currently sitting above \u20ac120 (~130USD), these projects hold great promise. It's particularly gratifying to pursue projects that are aimed not only at removing carbon, , but that may also provide biochar products to localized agricultural initiatives that could lead to positive economic impacts including food production stability and job creation.\"</p><p>\"The usefulness of biochar is becoming increasingly understood by the public and we believe this will help drive the need to deploy internationally to meet the increasingly important need to remove carbon at an unprecedented scale,\" continues CEO Hessert. \"Our \"building-block\" approach is designed for cost effective scalability to achieve gigatonne capacity, so we will continue to relentlessly advance our plans to seek out potential partners including governments, corporations, and investors to help us achieve global carbon neutrality in our lifetime. We look forward to more exciting opportunities from the BluMountain venture as we look forward to 2025 becoming a breakout year for Blusky.\"</p><p>About BluMountain Carbon<br/>BluMountain Carbon (\"BluMountain\") is a business venture (\"Joint Venture\" or \"JV\") of BluSky Carbon and Texas-based Red Mountain Biochar, LLC (\"Red Mountain\") to commercialize multiple potential biochar offtake and project financing opportunities for the benefit of BluSky and Red Mountain with a particular emphasis on the (i) production and processing of biochar, (ii) deployment of carbon removal technologies, and (iii) exploration and deployment of opportunities in related industries and technologies, as well as other commercial opportunities that the Joint Venture may identify from time to time.

(\"BluSky\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative entry into the carbon removal clean technology sector, is pleased to announce that its recent joint business venture, doing business as BluMountain Carbon (see the Company's press release dated October 11, 2024), has entered into preliminary agreements with two commercial prospects focussed on earning Carbon Credit revenues through BioChar production in Orlando, Florida and the United Republic of Tanzania. The terms of each agreement are described below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TANZANIA PROJECT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BluMountain has entered a binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with Carbon Market Exchange Inc. (\"CMX\") to collaborate on the development and operation of biochar production facilities utilizing local biomass feedstock provided by an existing agreement (to which CMX is a party) with a regional growers' association and other parties in Tanzania. The intention is for the facility to utilize BluSky Vulcan pyrolysis equipment, operational and consulting services to produce biochar, carbon removal credits, bio-oils and other products.</p><p>The LOI contemplates an exclusive relationship between the Company and CMX in regard to biochar production, bioenergy production, and biomass carbon removal (BCR) in Tanzania. The LOI is structured such that BluMountain would receive 66.67% of any net profits, and CMX would receive 33.33%, subject to adjustment if CMX fails to secure a formal deal with the regional growers' association or does not otherwise fulfill its contractual obligations, as reasonably determined by BluMountain.</p><p>CMX is a U.S.-based Delaware Corporation with primary operations in North Carolina and Michigan, USA, hosting an expert team and growing number of field offices worldwide. Led by CEO Shenna Fortner, the organization aims to develop innovative carbon offset programs to bridge the gap between environmental law, climate finance, and cutting-edge technology. Carbon Market Exchange Ltd was established in 2021 from the efforts of a group of environmentalists and finance executives aiming to bring together the financial industry and climate action in a way that makes meeting the international climate targets more accessible for companies and more supportive for conservationists. To date, CMX has led the development of carbon offset programs in Belize, Brazil, Tanzania, and Indonesia. In Tanzania, CMX is uniquely positioned to meet the rapidly growing demand for carbon offsets through a project which encompasses over 2.6 million acres of agroforestry, coastal ecosystems, and coral reefs.</p><p>\"We are excited to work with BluMountain to bring biochar and regenerative agriculture solutions to Tanzania's agricultural industry,\" said Shenna Fortner, CEO of Carbon Market Exchange. \"This collaboration represents a significant step toward sustainable development in Tanzania, helping to enrich soil health, support local communities, and capture carbon at scale.\"</p><p>ORLANDO PROJECT</p><p>The project is structured as a 50/50 \"Joint Venture\" (\"JV\") between BluMountain and Neutralizing Environmental Trash Inc. (\"N.E.T. Inc.\" or \"NET\") under which BluMountain is to provide Vulcan pyrolysis equipment, operational and consulting service for biochar production, bioenergy production, and biomass carbon removal under the business joint venture brand \"NET of the Villages LLC,\" proposed to be located in the Orlando, Florida area. Local wood waste has been identified by NET for use as feedstock to service the estimated 50,000 tonnes of annual carbon removal projected from the venture.</p><p>NET is focused on converting waste biomass into biochar as a carbon-negative soil amendment to enrich soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable agriculture. Headquartered in Medford, Oregon, NET is led by President Nicolaas Vanderwey with over three decades of experience in the recycling and environmental sustainability industry, and Senior VP, Development, Misty Burris who oversees strategic planning, financial management, and also serves as President of CO2 Trust, a carbon credit marketplace.</p><p>Misty Burris, Senior VP of N.E.T. Inc. and President of CO2 Trust comments, \"Our partnership with BluMountain signifies a leap forward in demonstrating the transformative power of biochar as a solution for climate resilience. With this joint venture, we're not only advancing carbon sequestration but also fostering sustainable practices that strengthen local economies and ecosystems. This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation, community engagement, and meaningful environmental impact.\"</p><p>BluSky CEO, Will Hessert notes, \"The creation of our BluMountain joint venture is kicking off with some great opportunities. The team at CMX are very professional and exciting to work with, as are the dynamic folks at NET. With the carbon price index as fixed by NASDAQ collaborator PURO.earth currently sitting above 120 (~130USD), these projects hold great promise. It's particularly gratifying to pursue projects that are aimed not only at removing carbon, , but that may also provide biochar products to localized agricultural initiatives that could lead to positive economic impacts including food production stability and job creation.\"</p><p>\"The usefulness of biochar is becoming increasingly understood by the public and we believe this will help drive the need to deploy internationally to meet the increasingly important need to remove carbon at an unprecedented scale,\" continues CEO Hessert. \"Our \"building-block\" approach is designed for cost effective scalability to achieve gigatonne capacity, so we will continue to relentlessly advance our plans to seek out potential partners including governments, corporations, and investors to help us achieve global carbon neutrality in our lifetime. We look forward to more exciting opportunities from the BluMountain venture as we look forward to 2025 becoming a breakout year for Blusky.\"</p><p>About BluMountain Carbon</p><p>BluMountain Carbon (\"BluMountain\") is a business venture (\"Joint Venture\" or \"JV\") of BluSky Carbon and Texas-based Red Mountain Biochar, LLC (\"Red Mountain\") to commercialize multiple potential biochar offtake and project financing opportunities for the benefit of BluSky and Red Mountain with a particular emphasis on the (i) production and processing of biochar, (ii) deployment of carbon removal technologies, and (iii) exploration and deployment of opportunities in related industries and technologies, as well as other commercial opportunities that the Joint Venture may identify from time to time.

Users of LBank Exchange can brace themselves for the MLC/USDT trading pair, which went live already..</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MLC Listing Banner</p><p>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8831/214459_7e4c652cf4c1e95f_001full.jpg\">https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8831/214459_7e4c652cf4c1e95f_001full.jpg</url></p><p>My Lovely Coin (MLC) is a green utility token at the heart of the My Lovely Planet game, enabling players to contribute to real-world environmental impact through their in-game actions.</p><p>Introducing My Lovely Coin: The green token that turns gaming into real-world environmental action</p><p>LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of My Lovely Coin (MLC), the primary currency of My Lovely Planet, a pioneering Web3 mobile game that seamlessly connects in-game activities with real-world environmental efforts. Backed by gaming giants Ubisoft and Unity, MLC enables players to make tangible contributions to environmental protection as they play. For instance, when players plant trees or clean up waste within the game, corresponding actions are funded and executed in reality, making gaming a force for positive environmental change.</p><p>The unique tokenomics of MLC are designed to aim for sustainability and growth. With a fixed supply of 350 million tokens, MLC incorporates a deflationary model where 2% of repurchased tokens are burned until the supply reduces to 300 million. A significant portion of the token supply, 28%, is allocated to the Environmental Treasury, dedicated to funding impactful environmental initiatives chosen by the community. This structure aims to support environmental projects and potentially the value of MLC as more players engage with the game and its ecosystem.</p><p>To celebrate the launch of My Lovely Coin ($MLC) on DEX and CEX, the team hosted a special live event on Tuesday, June 25th, at 3:00 PM UTC+2. This event featured exciting guests, including Lady Of Crypto, House of Crypto, and Polygon Labs, alongside major announcements. Participants helped the team reach their goal of 1 million active players by December and amplified their environmental impact through significant projects like the Agroforestry initiative in Madagascar. The event has ended; for details, please visit:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/rvDJpiX3M5\">https://x.com/MyLovelyPlanet1/status/1805586822711623806. Everyone is invited to join this revolutionary movement to protect the planet through gaming.</url></p><p>About MLC Token</p><p>Based on POLY, MLC has a total supply of 350 million (i.e. 350,000,000). The distribution of MLC tokens is as follows: Environmental Treasury (28%), Community Reward Treasury (19%), Private Sale (10%), Public Sale (14.6%), Team (15%), Operational Fund (4.14%), Liquidity (5%), Advisors (2%), and KOL Round (2.29%). The MLC token is poised for its debut on LBank Exchange at 15:00 UTC on June 25, 2024.

We prioritize policy implementation, research and development, and partnership to protect farmers' livelihoods and resilience, as well as to lessen rice farming's impact on the climate and environment.</p><p>New Varieties of Rice</p><p>Mr Chitnucha stated that his department recently introduced ten new rice varieties that are of higher quality, appropriate for cultivation in any section of the country, and resistant to droughts and floods while lowering fertilizer consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p><p>'These rice varieties will improve farmer livelihoods and Thailand's competitiveness in the international market,' he stated.</p><p>Thailand is the global leader in rice production and exports. Increased productivity in recent decades without sustainable landscape management has resulted in environmental deterioration, GHG emissions, and reductions in biodiversity and ecosystem services, he claims.</p><p>Nana Kuenkel, Project Director and Cluster Coordinator at GIZ, stated, 'The Inclusive Sustainable Rice Landscapes in Thailand (ISRL) project will enable all stakeholders to transform rice and agricultural production landscapes by reconciling competing social, economic, and environmental interests.'</p><p>Rice Farming Training</p><p>Ms Kuenkel stated that the ISRL project aims to co-develop and demonstrate an integrated and multi-disciplinary landscape management approach to transition from traditional rice farming to inclusive, sustainable rice farming.</p><p>It seeks to develop policy, capacity, and money to implement and expand sustainable rice farming practices while preserving, restoring, and improving landscapes, ecosystems, and biodiversity.</p><p>She stated that by 2027, more than 45,000 Thai rice farmers in Chiang Rai and Ubon Ratchathani will have received training to better their management and production techniques.</p><p>Communities will learn how to make their own natural composts and biocontrol products, lowering farming expenses and potential hazards from conventional fertilizers and pesticides.</p><p>Crop diversification and agroforestry will also take place. An estimated one million rai of rice farms and forest (160,00 hectares) will adopt such farming methods, resulting in a reduction in GHG emissions and hazardous chemicals.</p><p>She also stated that the project will help enhance the management of high conservation value forests and restore forest areas in Chiang Rai and Ubon Ratchathani.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIRAI-CHIANGRAITIMES0605202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIRAI2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BYP-50M1-F00C-63F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472526</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CTN News - Chiangrai Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Chiang Rai Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 6, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Wensink was a former Kemptville Campus forester, who ran the centre from 2009 to 2014.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Peter Wensink Maple Forest signage was unveiled with much of his family in attendance, along with about 100 guests including North Grenville Mayor Nancy Peckford.</p><p>\"Peter was pretty clear that we had something pretty amazing and that was a resource centre,\" Peckford said. \"I was just really struck by how passionate Peter was. I (learned) that he was a master of that reverse osmosis machine that produces maple syrup, and that he had such a belief that no matter what our expertise was as a council or as a community, we really needed to take care of our sugar bush.\"</p><p>Kemptville Campus board chair Karen Cooper first acknowledged the land on which we gathered - the unceded, traditional Algonquin territory of the Anishinaabe people.</p><p>\"I think that they would be proud of the stewardship that Peter showed to this land,\" she said.</p><p>She said she couldn't see the board naming this piece of property \"after a more deserving steward of this forest.\"</p><p>Erin Wensink thanks those in attendance Sunday, Sept. 26 during a dedication ceremony in her late husband Peter's honour. The Kemptville Agroforestry Centre was named the Peter Wensink Forest Centre, thanks to the work of many individuals, including Frank Heerkens (centre) and Jim Hendry (right). - Laurie Weir/Metroland</p><p>Jim Hendry, manager of the Kemptville Campus forest, and longtime friend of Wensink, shared many walks in the forest, breakfasts together, and dreams of making maple syrup.</p><p>\"He was very good at that. I've been honoured to follow in his footsteps in this facility,\" Hendry said. But his strongest memory of his friend was Wensink's \"gentle nature and warm, welcoming personality.\"</p><p>Wensink's love for family was first and foremost, Hendry noted. \"And he was an expert\" in his field at Upper Canada Village near Morrisburg.</p><p>Some of the maple products processed at the Kemptville Agroforestry Centre. - Laurie Weir/Metroland</p><p>Frank Heerkens, Ontario Maple Syrup Producers Association president and syrup producer at the Kemptville sugar bush, had a huge hand in organizing the weekend's events in Kemptville, alongside Hendry.</p><p>\"(Wensink) was great at maple syrup, but he was also great at forest biodiversity,\" Heerkens said. \"If you went for a walk with Peter while making maple syrup and you didn't learn anything, then you weren't listening.\"</p><p>Wensink's widow, Erin Wensink, thanked those in attendance, and everyone who had a hand in the success of the event, as well as the new signage.</p><p>\"This has really been an amazing day for our family,\" she said. She referred to how the pandemic has made it especially difficult for everyone, and for them, without her husband.</p><p>\"It's best to focus on the happy things and happy memories, if you can,\" she said. \"And one of the happy things for Peter is this operation. It's just one of his happy places. He was certainly in his element here as much as he was at his other job at Upper Canada Village and with his own consulting business. He loved meeting people. He loved learning new things. And he loved being outside. He never stopped trying to come up with new ideas or new ways to do things.\"</p><p>Erin added: \"I think he would be astounded at its dedication. He definitely would be grinning from ear to ear and shaking his head in disbelief ... He never would have thought in his wildest dreams that his contributions had an impact and his work is respected. It's a wonderful comfort to his family and we know how incredibly honoured he would have been.</p><p>\"So on behalf of Peter and our family, I'd like to thank everyone who's made this possible.\"</p><p>Lead</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-news20210926TMKB2021092662342206</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63R0-CBD1-F197-54PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

The music drifted through Apiwtxa village, which had welcomed guests from Indigenous communities in Brazil and neighboring Peru, some having traveled three days. As the sun rose, they moved beneath the shadow of a huge mango tree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dancing, which would last until the following morning, marked the end of the annual celebration recognizing the Ashaninka territory along the winding Amonia River in the western Amazon. The multi-day, nearly aroundthe-clock festivities included the ritual of drinking ayahuasca, the sacred psychedelic brew, archery tournaments, climbing towering acai palm trees and face-painting with red dye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was once a gathering to commemorate the Ashaninka has evolved into a showcase of what they have done:the village\u2019s self-sufficiency, which comes from growing crops and protecting its forest, is now a model for an ambitious project to help 12 Indigenous territories in western Amazon, amounting to 640,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), about the size of the U.S.state of Delaware.</p><p>In November, the Organization of Indigenous People of the Jurua River, known by the Portuguese acronym OPIRJ, secured $6.8 million in support from the Amazon Fund, the world\u2019s largest initiative to combat rainforest deforestation. With Apiwtxa as the model, the grant is geared toward improving Indigenous land management with an emphasis on food production, cultural strengthening and forest surveillance.</p><p>\u201cWe are expanding everything that we did at Apiwxta to an entire region,\u201d said Ashaninka and OPIRJ leader Francisco Piy\u00e3ko, speaking in front of his home in Apiwtxa. \u201cThis is not only about implementing a project. What is at stake is cultural change. This is essential to protect life, the territory and its peoples.\u201d</p><p>Indigenous groups have long argued that they are in the best position to conserve and protect forests, having been successful stewards of lands for thousands of years. Indigenous land management is increasingly a central policy discussion at climate talks as global warming worsens and other methods to protect forests, such as carbon credit schemes, have largely not been successful.</p><p>In Brazil, Indigenous territories comprise 23% of the Amazon region, which is roughly the size of South Africa and largely covered with old-growth rainforests that store large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when released into the atmosphere. In 2022, only 2% of all deforestation in the Amazon happened inside Indigenous territories, most by non-Indigenous land-grabbers. In Ashaninka\u2019s Amonia territory, the deforested area today is 0.03%, underscoring the tribe\u2019s successful forest management.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago, when the Brazilian government recognized the Ashaninka\u2019s territorial rights, the area where Apiwtxa sits was a sprawling cattle farm run by non-Indigenous settlers. Loggers had degraded the remaining forest, depleting the region of mahogany and other valuable trees. Indigenous families lived scattered and in fear. With few options, some worked for farmers and loggers in slave-like conditions.</p><p>The land demarcation, which forced outsiders to leave, opened the door to reforestation and cultural rebirth. The Ashaninka transferred their main village, Apiwtxa, to an abandoned pasture in a strategic location for surveillance. In the following years, the village leadership, spearheaded by Francisco Piy\u00e3ko\u2019s father, Ant\u00f4nio, and his siblings, set up a governance system focused on the collective good and self-sufficiency, according to an article coauthored by anthropologist Carolina Comandulli and the Apiwtxa Association.</p><p>In Apiwtxa today, each one of the 80 families must take care of an area of forest that includes fruit trees and medicinal plants. Around the village, there are also agricultural plots with cassava, potato, banana and other produce. Over the years, the Ashaninka have replanted trees such as mahogany.</p><p>Apiwtxa\u2019s expansive traditional huts are surrounded by fishponds and land that combines crops and forest, providing food for their school, cotton for clothing, the vine that yields the sacred Ayahuasca hallucinogenic brew, urucum trees for dye extraction, palm trees to build thatched roofs, medicinal plants and embauba trees that provide strings for bows.</p><p>The land management systems sustain various dimensions of Ashaninka\u2019s daily lives, said Comandulli, the anthropologist.</p><p>\u201cThey support their autonomy, which is something they value greatly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seek food sovereignty, aim to control their own house construction, medical healing and engage in the economic process of market relations, by which handicrafts become a source of income.\u201d</p><p>Just as important, the Ashaninka created a strategy of developing relationships with neighboring communities, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to create a \u201cbuffer zone,\u201d as well as to reach institutions outside the region.</p><p>Wewito Piy\u00e3ko, president of the Apiwtxa Association and Francisco\u2019s brother, said that successful management, including stopping invasions from outsiders like loggers or miners, required working both within their territory and beyond.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we created this policy of working with the surrounding areas, so they understand what we are doing is for our benefit and theirs, too,\u201d said Piy\u00e3ko.</p><p>The Ashaninka started expanding efforts beyond their territory in 2007, founding the Yorenka Atame, or Knowledge of the Forest Center, close to the nearest town, Marechal Thaumaturgo, a three-hour boat trip from Apiwtxa. There, the Ashaninka created a project integrating crops and forest preservation, a small factory to process fruit and a venue for events with non-Indigenous allies.</p><p>In 2015, the Amazon Fund granted the Apiwxta Association, led by the Piy\u00e3ko clan, $2.2 million to improve agroforestry in its territory and extend the experience to other Indigenous tribes and riverine communities. It was the first time that the fund, backed mostly by Norway but also by the U.S.and other countries, financed an Indigenous organization.</p><p>The next year, Isaac Piy\u00e3ko, brother of Wewito and Francisco Piy\u00e3ko, was elected mayor of Marechal Thaumaturgo, a town of 17,000 people, mostly non-Indigenous, historically run by business owners who profited from rubber-tapping and families with ties to logging and cattle ranching. It was the first, and so far only, time that an Indigenous leader had become a mayor among the 22 municipalities of Acre state. In 2020, Piy\u00e3ko was reelected.</p><p>Francisco said the Ashaninka leader\u2019s candidacy was based on the same principle as OPIRJ\u2019s project:to spread their experience to the entire region, including non-Indigenous areas. One of the Apiwtxa\u2019s projects that became municipal policy under Isaac has been the purchase of local school meals from small farming families, thus reducing industrialized products such as canned sardines brought from thousands of kilometers (miles) away.</p><p>Despite that success, climate change has impacted local production, making it one more issue the Ashaninka must confront. Last year, during record drought in the Amazon, the Amonia River\u2019s water was so warm that for the first time the Ashaninka stopped bathing in it and thousands of fish died. This year, Amazon communities are again suffering from widespread drought.</p><p>\u201cThe culprits for this live far from us,\u201d said Francisco, speaking about climate change, which historically industrialized nations have been most responsible for. \u201cBut if we start pointing fingers, we\u2019ll waste a lot of energy and solve nothing. Instead, we\u2019re focusing on adaptation. We\u2019re identifying the best places to build houses and grow crops, improving access to water and managing fire risks.\u201d</p><p>Another beneficiary of the OPIRJ project is the Apolima-Arara territory. It is located in a stretch of the Amonia River between Apiwtxa and Marechal Thaumaturgo and is one of Brazil\u2019s most recently demarcated Indigenous lands. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed its designation into law in April 2023, following a two-decade struggle for recognition.</p><p>The Apolima-Arara, who participated in the Ashaninka\u2019s festivities along with Yawanawa, Huni Kuin, and other tribes, are dealing with some of the same problems faced by their neighbors decades ago. Part of their territory has been deforested by non-Indigenous people, and they are working to improve their agricultural production. The main village, Nordestino, has largely eliminated surrounding pasture by planting trees.</p><p>So far, the OPIRJ project has provided agricultural equipment and a boat for territorial surveillance.</p><p>\u201cApiwtxa is an example to us. No Indigenous people retook their territory easily,\u201d Apolima-Arara leader Jos\u00e9 Angelo Macedo Avelino said from inside the village\u2019s collective hut, accompanied by other tribe members. \u201cApiwtxa suffered just like us, and now their territory is recovered. We plan to do the same.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YUKONW-news20240913PTEA0004593570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YUKONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CYP-V621-F0HF-802N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459618</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Black Press Inc.

What is at stake is cultural change. This is essential to protect life, the territory and its peoples.\u201d </p><p>______</p><p>EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.</p><p>______</p><p>Indigenous groups have long argued that they are in the best position to conserve and protect forests, having been successful stewards of lands for thousands of years. Indigenous land management is increasingly a central policy discussion at climate talks as global warming worsens and other methods to protect forests, such as carbon credit schemes, have largely not been successful. </p><p>In Brazil, Indigenous territories comprise 23% of the Amazon region, which is roughly the size of South Africa and largely covered with old-growth rainforests that store large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when released into the atmosphere. In 2022, only 2% of all deforestation in the Amazon happened inside Indigenous territories, most by non-Indigenous land-grabbers. In Ashaninka's Amonia territory, the deforested area today is 0.03%, underscoring the tribe's successful forest management. </p><p>Thirty-two years ago, when the Brazilian government recognized the Ashaninka\u2019s territorial rights, the area where Apiwtxa sits was a sprawling cattle farm run by non-Indigenous settlers. Loggers had degraded the remaining forest, depleting the region of mahogany and other valuable trees. Indigenous families lived scattered and in fear. With few options, some worked for farmers and loggers in slave-like conditions.</p><p>The land demarcation, which forced outsiders to leave, opened the door to reforestation and cultural rebirth. The Ashaninka transferred their main village, Apiwtxa, to an abandoned pasture in a strategic location for surveillance. In the following years, the village leadership, spearheaded by Francisco Piy\u00e3ko's father, Ant\u00f4nio, and his siblings, set up a governance system focused on the collective good and self-sufficiency, according to an article coauthored by anthropologist Carolina Comandulli and the Apiwtxa Association.</p><p>In Apiwtxa today, each one of the 80 families must take care of an area of forest that includes fruit trees and medicinal plants. Around the village, there are also agricultural plots with cassava, potato, banana and other produce. Over the years, the Ashaninka have replanted trees such as mahogany.</p><p>Apiwtxa\u2019s expansive traditional huts are surrounded by fishponds and land that combines crops and forest, providing food for their school, cotton for clothing, the vine that yields the sacred Ayahuasca hallucinogenic brew, urucum trees for dye extraction, palm trees to build thatched roofs, medicinal plants and embauba trees that provide strings for bows.</p><p>The land management systems sustain various dimensions of Ashaninka's daily lives, said Comandulli, the anthropologist.</p><p>\u201cThey support their autonomy, which is something they value greatly,\u201d she said. \"They seek food sovereignty, aim to control their own house construction, medical healing and engage in the economic process of market relations, by which handicrafts become a source of income.\u201d </p><p>Just as important, the Ashaninka created a strategy of developing relationships with neighboring communities, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to create a \u201cbuffer zone,\u201d as well as to reach institutions outside the region.</p><p>Wewito Piy\u00e3ko, president of the Apiwtxa Association and Francisco\u2019s brother, said that successful management, including stopping invasions from outsiders like loggers or miners, required working both within their territory and beyond. </p><p>\u201cThat's why we created this policy of working with the surrounding areas, so they understand what we are doing is for our benefit and theirs, too,\u201d said Piy\u00e3ko.</p><p>The Ashaninka started expanding efforts beyond their territory in 2007, founding the Yorenka Atame, or Knowledge of the Forest Center, close to the nearest town, Marechal Thaumaturgo, a three-hour boat trip from Apiwtxa. There, the Ashaninka created a project integrating crops and forest preservation, a small factory to process fruit and a venue for events with non-Indigenous allies.</p><p>In 2015, the Amazon Fund granted the Apiwxta Association, led by the Piy\u00e3ko clan, $2.2 million to improve agroforestry in its territory and extend the experience to other Indigenous tribes and riverine communities. It was the first time that the fund, backed mostly by Norway but also by the U.S. and other countries, financed an Indigenous organization.</p><p>The next year, Isaac Piy\u00e3ko, brother of Wewito and Francisco Piy\u00e3ko, was elected mayor of Marechal Thaumaturgo, a town of 17,000 people, mostly non-Indigenous, historically run by business owners who profited from rubber-tapping and families with ties to logging and cattle ranching. It was the first, and so far only, time that an Indigenous leader had become a mayor among the 22 municipalities of Acre state. In 2020, Piy\u00e3ko was reelected.</p><p>Francisco said the Ashaninka leader\u2019s candidacy was based on the same principle as OPIRJ\u2019s project: to spread their experience to the entire region, including non-Indigenous areas. One of the Apiwtxa\u2019s projects that became municipal policy under Isaac has been the purchase of local school meals from small farming families, thus reducing industrialized products such as canned sardines brought from thousands of kilometers (miles) away.</p><p>Despite that success, climate change has impacted local production, making it one more issue the Ashaninka must confront. Last year, during record drought in the Amazon, the Amonia River\u2019s water was so warm that for the first time the Ashaninka stopped bathing in it and thousands of fish died. This year, Amazon communities are again suffering from widespread drought.</p><p>\u201cThe culprits for this live far from us,\" said Francisco, speaking about climate change, which historically industrialized nations have been most responsible for. \"But if we start pointing fingers, we\u2019ll waste a lot of energy and solve nothing. Instead, we\u2019re focusing on adaptation. We\u2019re identifying the best places to build houses and grow crops, improving access to water and managing fire risks.\u201d</p><p>Another beneficiary of the OPIRJ project is the Apolima-Arara territory. It is located in a stretch of the Amonia River between Apiwtxa and Marechal Thaumaturgo and is one of Brazil's most recently demarcated Indigenous lands. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed its designation into law in April 2023, following a two-decade struggle for recognition.</p><p>The Apolima-Arara, who participated in the Ashaninka's festivities along with Yawanawa, Huni Kuin, and other tribes, are dealing with some of the same problems faced by their neighbors decades ago. Part of their territory has been deforested by non-Indigenous people, and they are working to improve their agricultural production. The main village, Nordestino, has largely eliminated surrounding pasture by planting trees.</p><p>So far, the OPIRJ project has provided agricultural equipment and a boat for territorial surveillance.</p><p>\u201cApiwtxa is an example to us. No Indigenous people retook their territory easily,\" Apolima-Arara leader Jos\u00e9 Angelo Macedo Avelino said from inside the village's collective hut, accompanied by other tribe members. \u201cApiwtxa suffered just like us, and now their territory is recovered. We plan to do the same.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

A detailed accounting of the company's footprint and science-based targets are foundational to the company's strategy to drive progress on emissions reduction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At Hershey, our business depends on ingredients grown around the world and the health of those ecosystems,\" said Rachel Grunberg, senior manager of environmental sustainability at The Hershey Company. \"We have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint to build resiliency for our business and the planet and are doing so with challenging goals aligned with best-in-class science to inform our strategy.\"</p><p>Hershey's target to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline was re-validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To date, Hershey has achieved a 43% reduction against this target. The company has also set near-term Forest Land and Agriculture (FLAG) and non-FLAG targets. It is committed to reduce scope 3 Forest Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions by 36% and non-FLAG emissions by 30% by 2030. These newly validated targets are in line with climate science and are consistent with levels necessary to meet the Paris Agreement's goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Hershey implements a variety of programs and initiatives across its operations and its supply chain to reduce its carbon footprint.</p><p>Reducing Energy Consumption and Leveraging Renewable Energy</p><p>To improve energy consumption and efficiency, Hershey has created a cross-functional team to oversee delivery of plant-level energy reduction targets. In 2023, Hershey sourced approximately 80% of electricity from renewable and zero-emission sources, an increase made through a combination of solar Power Purchase Agreements, Renewable Energy Credits, and Zero Emission Credits and investments in, including: //st * Directly sourcing hydropower for facilities in Brazil and Canada * Operational PPAs that delivered approximately 25% of U.S. electricity needs * 100% renewable or zero-emission electricity for manufacturing facilities for confectionery in the U.S. and Canada and several of our salty brands</p><p>Scaling Good Agricultural Practices</p><p>The company leveraged partnerships to promote good agricultural practices and technology to mitigate risks from climate change in cocoa, dairy and sugar supply chains. A selection of projects include: //st * Investing in farmers to improve livelihoods and manage climate variability through implementation of soil health improvement and agroforestry with the Hershey Income Accelerator Program * Piloting projects like the Sustainable Dairy PA program which implements riparian forest buffers, nutrient management, conservation tillage, and manure management practices * Promoting regenerative agricultural initiatives such as the North Dakota Trusted Advisor Partnership to promote the use of cover crops and reduced tillage</p><p>Preventing Deforestation and Advancing Biodiversity</p><p>Preventing deforestation and conversion caused by changing land use is another important driver in reducing Scope 3 emissions. In 2023, Hershey accelerated its commitment by five years to achieve a deforestation and conversion-free supply chain for cocoa, palm oil, pulp and paper, and soy to December 31, 2025. Examples of these initiatives include: //st * Restoring forest habitat with the Arbor Day Foundation, planting one million trees and restoring more than 2,300 acres of forest as part of this partnership since 2017 * Partnered with the Foundation for Parks and Reserves of Cote d'Ivoire on conservation of the Mabi-Yaya Nature Reserve to restore forest on 687 hectares of degraded land</p><p>To learn more about Hershey's sustainability strategy and progress, view the company's ESG Report.</p><p>About The Hershey Company</p><p>The Hershey Company is an industry-leading snacks company known for making more moments of goodness through its iconic brands, remarkable people and enduring commitment to doing the right thing for its people, planet, and communities.

A detailed accounting of the company's footprint and science-based targets are foundational to the company's strategy to drive progress on emissions reduction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At Hershey, our business depends on ingredients grown around the world and the health of those ecosystems,\" said Rachel Grunberg, senior manager of environmental sustainability at The Hershey Company. \"We have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint to build resiliency for our business and the planet and are doing so with challenging goals aligned with best-in-class science to inform our strategy.\"</p><p>Hershey's target to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline was re-validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To date, Hershey has achieved a 43% reduction against this target. The company has also set near-term Forest Land and Agriculture (FLAG) and non-FLAG targets. It is committed to reduce scope 3 Forest Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions by 36% and non-FLAG emissions by 30% by 2030. These newly validated targets are in line with climate science and are consistent with levels necessary to meet the Paris Agreement's goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Hershey implements a variety of programs and initiatives across its operations and its supply chain to reduce its carbon footprint.</p><p>Reducing Energy Consumption and Leveraging Renewable Energy</p><p>To improve energy consumption and efficiency, Hershey has created a cross-functional team to oversee delivery of plant-level energy reduction targets. In 2023, Hershey sourced approximately 80% of electricity from renewable and zero-emission sources, an increase made through a combination of solar Power Purchase Agreements, Renewable Energy Credits, and Zero Emission Credits and investments in, including:</p><p>Directly sourcing hydropower for facilities in Brazil and Canada<br/>Operational PPAs that delivered approximately 25% of U.S. electricity needs<br/>100% renewable or zero-emission electricity for manufacturing facilities for confectionery in the U.S. and Canada and several of our salty brands</p><p>Scaling Good Agricultural Practices</p><p>The company leveraged partnerships to promote good agricultural practices and technology to mitigate risks from climate change in cocoa, dairy and sugar supply chains. A selection of projects include:</p><p>Investing in farmers to improve livelihoods and manage climate variability through implementation of soil health improvement and agroforestry with the Hershey Income Accelerator Program<br/>Piloting projects like the Sustainable Dairy PA program which implements riparian forest buffers, nutrient management, conservation tillage, and manure management practices<br/>Promoting regenerative agricultural initiatives such as the North Dakota Trusted Advisor Partnership to promote the use of cover crops and reduced tillage</p><p>Preventing Deforestation and Advancing Biodiversity</p><p>Preventing deforestation and conversion caused by changing land use is another important driver in reducing Scope 3 emissions. In 2023, Hershey accelerated its commitment by five years to achieve a deforestation and conversion-free supply chain for cocoa, palm oil, pulp and paper, and soy to December 31, 2025. Examples of these initiatives include:</p><p>Restoring forest habitat with the Arbor Day Foundation, planting one million trees and restoring more than 2,300 acres of forest as part of this partnership since 2017<br/>Partnered with the Foundation for Parks and Reserves of Cote d'Ivoire on conservation of the Mabi-Yaya Nature Reserve to restore forest on 687 hectares of degraded land</p><p>To learn more about Hershey's sustainability strategy and progress, view the company's ESG Report.</p><p>About The Hershey Company</p><p>The Hershey Company is an industry-leading snacks company known for making more moments of goodness through its iconic brands, remarkable people and enduring commitment to doing the right thing for its people, planet, and communities.

He not only guides the project team through the process of planning and fabricating but also in delivering work products for clients. Before his role at EP Carbon, he was a Senior Research Analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund within the Natural Climate Solutions team, where he focused on agriculture and forest-based solutions. His expertise encompasses inferential statistics, carbon accounting and dynamics, agronomy, silviculture, and the design of voluntary carbon projects.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Melikov's recent projects have centered around forest conservation, improved forest management, as well as on reforestation across diverse ecological settings, including agroforestry systems, plantations, and native species mixes. He has also been involved in research efforts to predict carbon accumulation in forest plantations, as well as in identifying the most effective nature-based climate solutions at both global and national scales.</p><p>'Observing nature's complex living systems has long been a passion of mine,' Melikov adds and says that he learned the art of fly fishing as a child and has always been a great lover of nature.</p><p>It was this love that drove a desire to understand how ecosystems work, and how they play a part in the protection at the point where they interact with human activities. Melikov's master's thesis, which was conducted at UC Berkeley, focused on investigating the net impacts of various widely-used management actions, such as thinning and fertilization, on carbon stocks in forest plantations, which aimed to inform and refine the design and scoping of forest carbon management projects. His work resulted in publication in a top forestry journal, Current Forestry Reports. Through this, Melikov gained a deep understanding of carbon dynamics within forest ecosystems and was introduced to the world of carbon offset markets for the first time.</p><p>'This experience was pivotal because it was the first time I realized that the theoretical concepts I had been studying could have practical applications in the real world,' Melikov says.</p><p>This revelation not only broadened his professional outlook but ignited a drive to become a global contributor to the implementation of these solutions. This drive led Melikov to contribute to peer-reviewed publications published in prestigious journals such as Natural Climate Change, as well as to participate in the drafting of several impactful reports either as the first author or as a co-author in his professional career. He says that one of his proudest projects was the research he participated in that was led by Brian Buma and Doria Gordon of the Environmental Defense Fund, which aimed at identifying Nature-Based Climate Solutions pathways that carbon market actors should prioritize for investment and implementation. This study was one of the first of its kind involving dozens of experts, and Melikov played a key role in the extensive literature review that led to the identification of the 42 assessed pathways, as well as all the carbon science available around these pathways.</p><p>When speaking on how he helps inspire others, Melikov says that he mentors emerging professionals in environmental science and forestry, and has helped initiate and manage collaborations between NGOs, universities, and private sector partners. Melikov uses this natural flexibility to thrive in both field and office environments, stepping out of his comfort zone on countless projects. He believes that utilizing this skill to engage with local stakeholders has been instrumental in shaping his leadership and influence within the professional community.</p><p>He says, 'By shaping industry standards and guiding policy decisions on nature-based solutions, I help provide roadmaps for others in the field, inspiring them to base their work on robust science and advocate for policies that support sustainable practices.'</p><p>Though he has been challenged in managing diverse teams, often with members from different cultures and ages than himself, Melikov has maintained an open mind and actively fostered positive relations within his teams. His work - which directly tackles climate change - aims to safeguard the ecosystems, produce verifiable climate benefits, and enhance the well-being of communities worldwide.</p><p>'In my current role, I am fully committed to providing technical support to carbon projects that are transparent, additional, and build on realistic and robust baselines,' he elaborates. He hopes to instill trust in his projects by addressing concerns encountered by some of the pioneer forest carbon projects.</p><p>Melikov aspires to become a globally recognized leader in Nature-Based Climate solutions delivering expert guidance on climate mitigation and resilience for agriculture and forestry projects.</p><p>'I am devoted to driving significant environmental impact by marrying cutting-edge scientific research with scalable practical applications,' he says, adding that his approach focuses on crafting innovative solutions that prioritize not just effectiveness, but sustainability as well.</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/restoring-trust-in-the-carbon-market-with-cyril-melikov/article\">Restoring trust in the carbon market with Cyril Melikov</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">Digital Journal</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/restoring-trust-in-the-carbon-market-with-cyril-melikov/article\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXDJ-DIJO100903171804815535525876100106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C77-3F31-F03R-N0TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><timeReceived>6:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

(\"Klimat X\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:KLX)which carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets, is pleased to announce it has signed a binding agreement with the national government of Suriname to develop mangrove carbon credit and agroforestry projects. The Company has built a presence in Suriname and is actively conducting fieldwork to establish project size and feasibility.</p><p>       The Agreement identifies 2 initial mangrove carbon credit projects in the Coronie and Commewijne Districts (the 'Projects') covering at least 3,000 ha, which will be led, structured, and managed by Klimat X (the \"Company\") while exploring for other project sites.Since the signing of the Agreement in December 2022, a team led by the Company team has conducted extensive due diligence and scoping to optimize and de-risk the projects.On April 24, the Klimat X technical and field team, led by Dr. Steve Crooks from Silvestrum Climate Associates commenced fieldwork in Suriname to establish the technical foundations for measuring greenhouse gas emissions reductions.Building on the previous expeditionary trips, the team is working to evaluate the potential immediate and long-term greenhouse gas benefits from mangrove conservation and restoration from the projects.Degraded mangroves with impaired hydrology can be a significant source of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and the team will be directly measuring these emissions during the fieldwork. Interventions that restore the natural hydrology of the project sites can dramatically reduce methane emissions, generating significant volumes of carbon credits.Klimat X is also in active discussions with two significant international organizations (and prospective partners), already active in-country, to assist with elements of both civil engineering and community work that are likely to be needed in the successful delivery of the projects.Klimat X remains grateful to the Faculty of Technical Sciences at the University of Suriname for their continued insights and support for the Projects and hopes a relationship of mutual benefit will continue to strengthen with Company investment in capacity building.</p><p>CEO, Dr. James Tansey comments, \"Mangroves play a critical role in regulating climate change and in protecting coastlines from storms and sea level rise. This latest jurisdictional agreement builds on the model we have established in other countries including Mexico and Sierra Leone. We will be able to invest in the protection and restoration of these mangrove areas, reducing emissions of carbon and methane on an unprecedented scale. As recently announced, there is strong interest from buyers in these projects.\"</p><p> Background</p><p>Klimat X, through its controlled subsidiary, Pomeroon Trading (Holdings) Limited ('PTHL'), has entered into a legally binding co-operation agreement (the 'Agreement') with the Government of the Republic of Suriname. The Agreement outlines details of the co-operation agreed between the parties with regard to the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation of mangroves in Suriname, including the qualification of these projects for voluntary carbon credits and the subsequent sale and marketing of those credits. The background to the agreement acknowledged the globally leading significance of the Republic of Suriname as one of only three net negative carbon emitters globally, and the commitment of its people and Government to protecting and restoring its considerable natural endowment. Suriname has approximately 100,000 ha of mangroves, which provide critical biodiversity habitat and protect the coastline from floods and sea level rise. Following the completion of the current period of fieldwork, the Company will provide estimates of the potential scale of the carbon credit production from these interventions. Klimat X will work directly with large buyers to fund the completion of the project through a pre-purchase or investment agreement.</p><p> About Klimat X</p><p>Klimat X carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets. In contrast to streaming and royalty companies, Klimat X works upstream as a direct owner and operator of projects, addressing a key supply constraint the current market and the rapidly growing demand for carbon credits in global voluntary and regulated markets. The Corporation intends to achieve this by investing in the exploration, restoration and management of terrestrial and marine systems that can either be protected to enhance the sequestration of greenhouse gases or restored from a degraded status to fully productive ecosystems. Klimat X will draw on the experience of a senior executive team and board that provide access into key target jurisdictions through relationships in the mining and natural resources sectors, combined with decades of experience in carbon markets. Klimat X plans to deploy capital at risk under various arrangements (including cooperation, assignment and production sharing agreements) with large landowners and governments in various suitable jurisdictions around the world.</p><p> Reader Advisory</p><p>The TSXV has in no way passed upon the merits of the Acquisition or the Project Rights Assignment Agreement and has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this news release.</p><p>Neither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. </p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

In 2021, they determined that what\u2019s needed is a decade focused on ecosystem restoration, because ecosystems support all life on earth. </p><p>\u201cThe healthier our ecosystems are, the healthier the planet and its people,\u201d reads a statement from the UN. \u201cRestoring our damaged ecosystems will help to end poverty, combat climate change, and prevent mass extinction. But we will only succeed if everyone plays a part.\u201d </p><p>Alarmingly, our oceans and waterways are filling up with plastic, making these aquatic ecosystems acidic. Carbon dioxide emissions are affecting the climate, which has a trickledown effect to almost every aspect of our lives. </p><p>As well, the UN recognizes a host of other human actions as \u201ccrimes\u201d against the world\u2019s biodiversity. These include, but are not limited to, deforestation, land use changes, intensified agriculture and livestock production, and the growing illegal wildlife trade, all of which serve to accelerate the speed of ecosystem collapse. </p><p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General for the UN, offered a message to mankind on International Mother Earth Day 2024. </p><p>\u201cHumanity is acting like Mother Earth\u2019s delinquent child,\u201d Guterres says. \u201cWe depend on nature for the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. Yet we have brought chaos to the natural world [by] poisoning our planet with pollution, wiping out species and ecosystems with abandon, and destabilizing our climate with greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s not just important, he adds, but imperative that each person alive today begin working towards restoring harmony with nature. Putting an end to pollution and supporting sustainable food and commodity production and consumption are just a few ways in which it can be achieved. </p><p>He says that we need to support those around the world who are being hit hardest by pollution and the climate and biodiversity crisis. </p><p>\u201cCountries must produce new national climate plans that align with limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d Guterres says. \u201cAnd the G20 must lead a fast, fair, and funded global phaseout of fossil fuels, and put a stop to nature-wrecking subsidies, such as those that underwrite runaway production of planet-choking plastics. Repairing relations with Mother Earth is the mother of all of humanity\u2019s challenges. We must act\u2014and act now\u2014to create a better future for us all.\u201d </p><p>About 50 new initiatives are taking place worldwide, supported by the UN, to help mitigate the environmental and biodiversity challenges we face. Members hope that, in coming years, many more will come on board as education on the subject grows. </p><p>Among these initiatives is the Africa Wood Grow project. With a focus on regreening Kenya\u2019s degraded lands, fraught with soil erosion and depletion, the program has been picking up steam since 2010. Today, 61 Kenyan farmers are improving their own livelihoods by participating in an agroforestry transition program. </p><p>In the United Kingdom, Project Seagrass Ocean Rescue is well underway. With the help of community volunteers, one organization has undertaken the eventual restoration of 10 hectares of seagrass below the ocean\u2019s surface through the use of cutting-edge technology. </p><p>Closer to home, Ontario\u2019s Grasslands Stewardship Initiative provides support for the creation, enhancement, and maintenance of grassland habitats. The aim of the initiative is to protect at-risk species, including birds such as the bobolink and eastern meadowlark, while improving soil quality and carbon capture. </p><p>More than 44 Ontario organizations and volunteers are focused on affecting more than 640 hectares of grassland ecosystems and maintaining 940 hectares of wildlife habitat. </p><p>The province of Manitoba decided to recognize the International Mother Earth Day by announcing new funding initiatives for three local environmental non-profit organizations: Climate Change Connection, Green Action Centre, and Manitoba Eco-Network. </p><p>\u201cManitobans are seeing the impacts of climate change firsthand and they want to know that our province is doing its part to protect our air, land, and water for future generations,\u201d said Environment and Climate Change Minister Tracy Schmidt in a press release. </p><p>Climate Change Connection is the beneficiary of $100,000, which they\u2019ll use to advance awareness, capacity building, and action on climate change across Manitoba. </p><p>A grant of $230,000 will assist the Green Action Centre to advance climate action planning, the circular economy, active transportation, and outreach initiatives. </p><p>Finally, the Manitoba Eco-Network will use their $60,000 grant to help further inner-city climate adaptation work in Winnipeg through the Climate Safe, Green City project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5d7f3af21e0d4ae194f3f60453087a0d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BVY-5581-DY9S-T3B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><timeReceived>06:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 22, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This includes new or expanded projects in Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ghana and Rwanda that will contribute to the Companys climate action, restore nature, promote biodiversity and build ecological and community resilience, spanning over 100,000 hectares worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The investment builds on AstraZenecas initial AZ Forest commitment, announced in 2020, to plant and maintain more than 50 million trees by the end of 2025 in recognition of the strong connection between healthy people and a healthy planet.1 Planting has progressed at pace in Australia, Indonesia, Ghana, the UK, the US and France with over 300 tree species, allowing the restoration of biodiversity and natural habitats.2 In addition, the expanded programme will deliver benefits to local communities, positively impacting an estimated 80,000 livelihoods.</p><p>AZ Forest is part of AstraZenecas flagship sustainability strategy, Ambition Zero Carbon, which is focused on delivering deep decarbonisation in line with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting planetary warming to 1.5C.3 The Company is on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from its operations and fleet by 98% by 2026* and halve its entire value chain footprint by 2030, on the way to a 90% absolute emissions reduction and becoming science-based net zero by 2045 at the latest.2 Through AZ Forest, the Company aims to remove its residual emissions from the atmosphere from 2030 onwards.</p><p>Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: The twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are damaging the planet and harming human health. Through AZ Forest, we are working with local communities and ecological experts to deliver reforestation at scale, as well as support biodiversity and sustain livelihoods. We are taking a science-based approach, and AZ Forest will remove around 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over about 30 years.</p><p>AZ Forest projects are co-designed with planting experts, local communities and governments to deliver natural forest restoration and agroforestry, with co-benefits such as the creation of new skills and jobs, the protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species and improved public health.4 Projects will be audited and assessed by world-leading delivery partners and independent third-party experts, including the European Forest Institute (EFI).</p><p>Marc Palah, Chair, Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA), said: Forests play a key role in fighting climate change, hosting biodiversity and powering a circular bioeconomy that prospers in harmony with nature. Forests and trees are the backbone for life on our planet and the basis for human health and wellbeing. Through the design and delivery of public-private partnerships like AZ Forest, which are underpinned by a science-based and principles-led approach, we can mitigate the impacts of climate change and create economic and social value for local communities.</p><p>As part of its commitment to reforestation, AstraZeneca has partnered with the EFI and the CBA to publish a first-of-its kind, science-based framework for sustainable, resilient and locally appropriate landscape regeneration. The CBA Principles for Regenerative Landscapes will enable circular bioeconomy value chains and restore biodiversity.</p><p>AZ Forest contributes to the World Economic Forums 1t.org initiative, a public-private partnership to conserve, restore and grow one trillion trees by 2030.</p><p>Notes</p><p>AZ Forest</p><p>AZ Forest is AstraZenecas commitment to plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030, in partnership with experts and local communities. AZ Forest projects support planetary and human health with significant socio-economic co-benefits and are part of AstraZenecas science-based net zero strategy, Ambition Zero Carbon.</p><p>Building on projects underway in Australia, Indonesia, Ghana, the UK, the US and France, the expansion of AZ Forest includes new and expanded projects across Africa, Asia and South America: //st * Brazil: A new 30-year AZ Forest partnership with Bioflica Ambipar and Instituto de Pesquisas Ecolgicas (IPE) called Corridors for Life will plant 12 million trees within the Atlantic Forest, with over 100 native species planned in each project area. Creating ecological corridors between fragmented pockets of forests in the west of So Paulo state, this programme will build an important habitat for vulnerable and endangered species. * India: A new 30-year AZ Forest partnership with Earthbanc and local implementation partners in the state of Meghalaya in north-east India will plant an estimated 64 million trees, focusing on a diverse mix of species. The project is expected to be the largest of the CBAs Living Labs for Nature, People and Planet. It will restore nature in this degraded biodiversity hotspot while supporting farming livelihoods. * Ghana: An expansion of the existing AZ Forest programme in Ghana with the CBA, New Generation Plantation Technical Assistance (NGPTA) and other partners will see an additional 2.2 million trees planted, bringing the total targeted number of surviving trees to 4.7 million, and restoring 8,000 hectares of degraded areas in the Atebubu-Amantin and Sene West districts of central Ghana. This community-led programme, part of a network of Living Labs, seeks to boost forest restoration, agroforestry, biodiversity and nature-based business models for small-holder farmers. * Rwanda: AstraZeneca has provided funding for the pilot phase of an agroforestry project with smallholder farmers to help accelerate the development of a new 30-year project in partnership with the Albertine Rift Conservation Society (ARCOS) and ReforestAction. The project will plant more than 5.8 million trees, with a focus on agroforestry and agricultural land management which will benefit local communities and improve livelihoods. With the aim to be another Living Lab, the MuLaKiLa project will help more than 30,000 farming households in what is one of the largest forest restoration initiatives in Rwanda. * Vietnam: AstraZeneca has committed to planting 22.5 million trees across at least 30,500 hectares to restore Vietnams forests and landscapes. This new investment will allow biodiversity to flourish, provide sustainable livelihoods for more than 17,000 small-holder farmers, improve diets and nutrition, and conserve soil and water. * Additional projects are in development.</p><p>AZ Forest projects support planetary and human health with significant socio-economic co-benefits, as part of AstraZenecas science-based net zero strategy, Ambition Zero Carbon. By the end of 2022, over 10.5 million trees had been planted, despite a global pandemic, in: //st * Australia: In partnership with Greening Australia and One Tree Planted, more than four million trees have been planted (total programme of 25 million), including 260 native tree species, supporting vulnerable and endangered wildlife species. * Indonesia: In partnership with One Tree Planted and Trees4Trees, more than three million trees have been planted, with over 13,000 farmers opting into agroforestry activities in 2022. * Ghana: Over one million trees have been planted out of an initial commitment to plant three million surviving trees, driving ecological and community resilience through the community-led Living Lab project in partnership with CBA. * France: AstraZeneca has replanted 450 rare oak trees lost in the devastating storms of 1990 and 1999 at the Palace of Versailles. The oak trees provide a natural habitat for butterflies, birds, fungi and mammals, promoting biodiversity and bringing life back to the iconic gardens of Versailles. * UK: More than 470,000 trees have been planted in Scotland and England with Forestry England and Borders Forest Trust Scotland, to create high-quality woodland areas that provide additional green space in support of physical and mental wellbeing. * US: More than 100,000 trees have been planted to date, restoring more than 100 kilometres of riverside woodlands in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.</p><p>AstraZeneca</p><p>AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialisation of prescription medicines in Oncology, Rare Diseases and BioPharmaceuticals, including Cardiovascular, Renal &amp;Metabolism and Respiratory &amp;Immunology.

(\"Resouro\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on project studies for the Tiros Titanium and Rare Earth Elements Project in Brazil (Tiros Project or the Project). This includes progressing the metallurgical testwork and appointing industry leading technical experts to advance mining studies, environmental assessments and project approvals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following the announcement dated 18th July 2024 of the 1.7 billion tonne, maiden JORC Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resource for the Tiros Project1, Resouro has advanced the following key activities:</p><p>1. Progressed first phase metallurgical testwork for the Tiros Project Central Block resource: //st * Near completion of non-conventional first phase rare earth testwork with our partner, Altilium Group Ltd. ( Altilium ) with results expected imminently; * Commenced conventional rare earth metallurgical testwork with our partners, Centre for Intelligent Technologies (CIT) Senai ( CIT Senai ) and SGS S.A. Laboratories ( SGS ), in Belo Horizonte, Brazil;</p><p>2. Appointed Atticus to complete initial mine planning activities as part of the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for Tiros;</p><p>3. Appointed Ausenco Limited (Ausenco) to lead and manage the PEA for Tiros;</p><p>4. Appointed CLAM Meio Ambiente (CLAM) environmental and social consultants to complete an Environmental Assessment as part of the project permitting and approvals process; and</p><p>5. Positive engagement with regulatory authorities in Minas Gerais, leading to commencing the process for application of a Mining Concession over the Central Block of Tiros.</p><p>Commenting on the appointment of these consultants and progress at Tiros, President, CEO, Director and Founder, Chris Eager commented:</p><p>Completion of the JORC compliant Mineral Resource Estimate has paved the way for the selection of initial mining areas and compilation of representative composite samples for metallurgical testwork for the planned PEA Scoping Study for Tiros.</p><p>These initiatives are designed to highlight the full potential of our resources, optimize processes and deliver sustainable solutions. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and expert insights, we aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in metallurgy and achieve superior results, in terms of both economic and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Resouro remains committed to sustainable practices and positive community engagement, ensuring that our growth contributes to the well-being of the regions in which we operate.</p><p>Resouro looks forward to updating the market on metallurgical testwork results and progress to completion of our Preliminary Economic Assessment.</p><p>Metallurgical Testwork Programs</p><p>Resouro is undertaking two major streams of metallurgical testwork in parallel, to gain insight into the preferred rare earth and TiO2 recoveries and processing route.</p><p>a) Altilium Metallurgical Testwork</p><p>The scope for the first stage Altilium test work was aimed at understanding the feasibility of applying the Altilium Ti/REE Process technology to Resouros samples mainly for the extraction of rare earth elements into solution.</p><p>The work involved a composite sample of approximately 50kg, premixed by Resouro, air dried and milled to 100% passing 0.5mm. Chemical and mineralogical analysis was conducted on the head sample. Three optimization sighter leach tests were conducted using nitric acid (HNO3) applying the Altilium Ti/REE Process in Laboratories in Brisbane, Australia to generate Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) and residue. The samples were assayed for aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), gallium (Ga), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), sulphur (S), scandium (Sc), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and rare earth elements (REEs).</p><p>The assay results of the Altilium sighter testwork are under review and are expected to be announced imminently.</p><p>About the Altilium Group Limited</p><p>Altilium Group Limited (Altilium Group), incorporated in England, is the parent company of Altilium Licensing Limited (ALL) and Altilium Projects (Australia) Pty Ltd).</p><p>Research and development for the Altilium Group is performed in Australia.

Some shade trees, edible fruits and phototropic soil makers were added features to the cleaner water from the system.</p><p>The colour photos and diagrams by Matt Beam are most helpful in explaining how the eco designed systems work and what future developments are going to work in the longterm. For example the ecological pipeline, artificial kelp forest and eco-machine restorer are future designs for specific problem solving.</p><p>Inventor Todd also deals with marine environments starting with chapter 8 lessons from the sea, centred on eelgrass and the associated organisms like scallops, sea horses and stickle back fish.</p><p>Another ambitious project is using ecosystems to clean up after oil spills or oil contaminated soils. To date most of the experiments have been on small bays or resort areas and while the initial impact of eco machines has been promising ongoing funding has not been as it was first anticipated.</p><p>The author closes with an example from the Appalachian mountains where a million acres of sterile land has been created after taking the tops of mountains and filling the adjacent valleys during coal mining in the area.</p><p>After trying a number of grasses the Atlantic Coastal panic grass and switch grass did the best at establishment. As well as a soil former, the grass can be used for animal feed along with fuel for a biochar plant which by year 16 would contribute to agroforestry, an eco-park, conservation forest, aquaculture and biofuels for a sustainable community.</p><p>Don\u2019t miss out on reading the latest local, provincial and national news offered at the Williams LakeTribune.

Interested participants will gather at the Triangle Hall 15 km west of High Prairie, AB, for a day-long information session on grazing methodologies. </p><p>The event will focus on several topics running from 9:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Northern Sunrise County\u2019s environmental program coordinator Katie Bartman says the workshop is being hosted in collaboration with Northern Sunrise County, Big Lakes County, the Peace Country Beef &amp; Forage Association (PCBFA), Cows &amp; Fish, the Agroforestry and Woodlot Extension Society (AWES), and members from Agriculture &amp; Irrigation &amp; Alberta Wildfire. </p><p>\u201cAll of the workshop will be in class now as we are assuming the weather may not be the best for a field portion,\u201d says Bartman. </p><p>\u201cAnyone interested in learning about enhanced grazing management, as well as forward management when dealing with natural events like drought, floods, and wildfires (should attend).\u201d </p><p>The event will showcase short presentations from the many collaborators, as well as an opportunity for attendees to have a more in-depth conversation with presenters regarding specific topics of interest. </p><p>Topics discussed will include Weed and Plant ID and Management, Riparian Areas, Forest Restoration, Basics of Wildfire Preparedness, Forest &amp; Forage Recovery/Forward Management. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to host this workshop as it\u2019s an opportunity for attendees to learn about lands that they may not have seen as potential grazing lands, and how to manage them for long-term sustainability and resiliency in times of difficult growing conditions,\u201d says Bartman. </p><p>\u201cWe are hoping this workshop will be an opportunity for attendees to learn land management techniques they may not have known, link them with organizations and programs/ support available, as well as provide a deeper understanding of the workings of a healthy ecosystem and how to manage the land for sustainability and resiliency,\u201d she adds. </p><p>Emily Plihal Local Journalism Initiative Reporter - South Peace News - southpeacenews.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0870239e7079409aad0160188a879ba7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GJ-DJG1-DY9S-T10N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"364\"/><timeReceived>03:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 25, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

While he works, his children go to school and his wife prepares food that is harvested from the plot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like Don Manuel and his family, there is not a single person or business that does not rely on services provided by our natural ecosystems. Yet the adverse effects caused by species overexploitation, changes in land and sea uses, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution, climate change and displacement of communities are putting these ecosystems under ever-increasing pressure. This means we are increasingly challenged on how to preserve natural capital while also meeting production and consumption needs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there is a solution. All stakeholders who make use of a landscape's natural resources, whether directly or indirectly, have a key role to play in maintaining the ongoing health and feasibility of that landscape. A collaborative approach is the best way to achieve global climate and biodiversity goals and to protect our landscapes - and this is where the sustainable landscape approach comes in.</p><p>What is a landscape?</p><p>There is currently no scientific consensus on the definition of a 'landscape.' South Pole considers a landscape to be a geographical space consisting of natural and/or human-modified ecosystems which are influenced by ecological, historical, political, economic and socio-cultural activities and processes.</p><p>To get the boundaries just right, the area to be considered as a landscape should be defined collectively and collaboratively by all the stakeholders involved, with a clear goal in mind of maximising positive impacts while maintaining control over the monitoring and governance processes. If a defined landscape is too small, it won't capture the breadth of activities that influence or are impacted by the natural health of the landscape. But if it's too big, it may not be useful for driving action relating to governance, ecosystem services, human living patterns, supply chains, and sustainable production.</p><p>The Sustainable Landscape Approach (SLA)</p><p>The sustainable landscape approach (SLA) is a collaborative process that integrates policies and practices for multiple land uses within a given area. This is done in order to effectively address environmental challenges and maximise positive outcomes.</p><p>The sustainable landscape approach brings together all stakeholders (landowners, businesses, governments, civil society, NGOs, investors and others) who have an influence on a specific landscape and incentivises them to partner up in working towards a common goal. The specific roles and responsibilities for the SLA are defined in an action plan, and a committee and landscape manager are also appointed to lead the coordination and the follow-up. Consensus and communal benefit should be at the heart of the process.</p><p>Ultimately, the sustainable landscape approach ensures that the landscape is considered as a broader ecosystem of activities and actors, rather than as a patchwork of individual sites and/or projects. The approach also helps address the environmental, social and political challenges commonly associated with the protection and restoration of ecosystems: by systematically coordinating the design, implementation, monitoring, and follow-up of the activities implemented in a territory by a given group of actors, the SLA seeks to reconcile agricultural, industrial, conservation, economic development and other competing land use activities..</p><p>Benefits of the SLA</p><p>Managing an area with a sustainable landscape approach can provide several key benefits, including:</p><p>Enhanced ecosystem services to store carbon, maintain watersheds and conserve biodiversity, all contributing to the local economy and to productivity in the agricultural sector.<br/>Improvement of value chains through more efficient use of resources, along with reduced pressure on the agricultural frontier on local ecosystems.<br/>Defined opportunities for technical assistance to build farmers' capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources.<br/>The design of financial mechanisms to channel investments into promoting biodiversity and reducing emissions.<br/>Better access to premium markets and potentially higher incomes from implementing sustainability protocols that are recognised by buyers.<br/>Incentives for communities to take conservation actions based on clear results.<br/>Greater recognition of all stakeholders, activities, and challenges through an inclusive governance structure.</p><p>The four pillars of sustainable landscape management</p><p>All activities implemented under the SLA - like forest conservation or restoration, the installation of solar panels, development of agroforestry and silvopastoral systems, capacity building, job creation or creating better health or education infrastructure - should fall under one of four fundamental pillars:</p><p>Governance: actions to promote transparency, participation, inclusion, and coordination in land use policies.<br/>Human well-being: actions to protect and improve quality of life across health, education and employment.<br/>Sustainable production: actions to manage supply chains by using more sustainable practices with a reduced impact on ecosystems.<br/>Natural capital: actions to protect and restore ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p><p>Such activities are generally implemented and monitored by the owner of the land area that is being managed with a sustainable landscape approach, and this landowner receives technical support from other stakeholders, including NGOs, academics and project developers. The landowner reports on progress using specific metrics and shares any lessons learned in order to improve the management of the landscape.</p><p>Can two different conservation instruments coexist?</p><p>Within a landscape, environmental projects can be leveraged to improve the local quality of life and to conserve vulnerable ecosystems, all while contributing to the fight against climate change and offering adaptation options for local communities.</p><p>Depending on a landscape's characteristics, different types of projects can be combined within a landscape's boundaries, even when those projects are associated with different environmental markets (i.e. the compliance or voluntary market). For example, a single landscape could combine a REDD+ project in a stable forest, a habitat bank for biodiversity offsets, and a water payment for ecosystem services scheme (PES).</p><p>Case study: the Alicante River Canyon</p><p>South Pole's Alicante River Canyon project is an example that brings together different project types within the same landscape. Deep in the mountains of the department of Antioquia, Colombia, small communities of landowners cultivate the land and raise cattle between patches of forest. In some cases, agriculture is combined with agroforestry systems of cocoa, coffee, and fruit trees, while cattle ranching is sometimes established in silvopastoral systems, meaning that agroforestry, foraging and the grazing of domesticated animals are integrated in a mutually beneficial way.</p><p>The common goal of the project is to create ecological corridors that connect areas subject to sustainable production practices (e.g. agroforestry) with remaining forest patches and protected areas.</p><p>Communities in the landscape in Antioquia are already experiencing the negative impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss. Developing projects under the SLA provides an opportunity to channel investments into maintaining ecosystem services and protecting biodiversity - but also into supporting the development of smallholder farmers and rural communities in an effective, measurable way.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from South Pole on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: South Pole<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/south-pole\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/south-pole</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: South Pole</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/762785/The-Sustainable-Landscape-Approach-Puts-Collaboration-at-the-Heart-of-Biodiversity-Action\">https://www.accesswire.com/762785/The-Sustainable-Landscape-Approach-Puts-Collaboration-at-the-Heart-of-Biodiversity-Action</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-130124810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HG-X9V1-JDJN-6400-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Filing Services Canada Inc.

This tropical savanna is home to the maca\u00faba, a highly adaptable oil-producing tree with a penchant for scrubbing harmful CO2 from the air. Maca\u00faba fruit yields advanced vegetable oils (AVOs) and high-protein food - and it can be 15 times more productive than soybeans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are restoring the landscape that was deforested\u2026Macau\u0301ba was native here many, many years ago,\" Felipe Morbi, S.Oleum co-founder and Agroforestry VP, said. \"Now we are bringing back these trees, and also all the other species, to restore this biodiversity.\"</p><p>S.Oleum seeks to accomplish this scientifically, using maca\u00faba and other crops in an integrated crop-livestock-forest approach, according to Morbi. The goal is to create working farms that rejuvenate degraded, low-yielding soil - and that sequester into the soil more carbon than they generate.</p><p>Science-Based Approach to Reforesting the Cerrado</p><p>\"We are looking for the balance of the system,\" Morbi said in a new SAP video. \"We will measure the amount of carbon in the soil, the moisture, the biodiversity in terms of the plants we have, and also native animals coming back to the area.\"</p><p>Toward that end, S.Oleum is starting small, but aiming big. Most of the current crop grows on a 700-hectare, or more than 1,700-acre, pilot farm. But S.Oleum intends to plant more than 65 million additional maca\u00faba trees by 2029, which would reforest 180,00 hectares - about 444,800 acres - in Brazil's southeastern state of Minas Gerais.</p><p>Over time, maca\u00faba trees also help improve the nutrient and moisture capacity of the soil, making it easier to grow other crops, according to de Blanco. And S.Oleum increases farm productivity by growing carefully chosen crops in between rows of maca\u00faba trees, such as sunflowers, peanuts, and yucas.</p><p>\"If you do it right, agriculture as a system is positive for the environment,\" de Blanco said. \"Plants that were deforested a few decades ago, they are currently in a poor state because they were depleted by poor management\u2026We believe there are better ways, and that's what we are pursuing here.\"</p><p>An innovative case in point: maca\u00faba trees increase a biome's carbon sequestration levels. Removing this greenhouse gas helps more than the planet; S.Oleum also generates revenue by selling carbon credits and building trust via its data.</p><p>Any Little Bit of Data</p><p>\"Any little thing, any generation of data that R&amp;D is currently developing, is extremely important,\" Mirelle Santos, S.Oleum Agroforestry R&amp;D manager, said. \"We want to deploy technologies as dictated by those urgent needs.\"</p><p>This could include remote sensing via drones that run fruit-recognition software, according to Santos. This would help S.Oleum gather and compile data quickly, without human error - and without sending workers, who must dress in personal protective equipment (PPE) to defend against snakes, mosquitos, the brutal Cerrado sun (even in winter), and dangerous maca\u00faba thorns, which grow even on seedlings.</p><p>S.Oleum's intricate business model combines agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, and carbon offsetting - and that leads to a lot of complexity. SAP technology will be an important differentiator for this small enterprise, as well as a foundation for its future growth.</p><p>\"We have a big project to run; so, a lot of people, a lot of machines, a lot of suppliers,\" Morbi said. \"And we need everything in the right moment, in the right way.\"</p><p>How to Best Manage ESG Metrics</p><p>\"SAP is different because it is recognized as one of the most reliable ERP systems on the market, not only based on the technology,\" de Blanco said. \"Also, because it has well-established and well-defined processes.\"</p><p>Standardizing processes was \"extremely important\" for S.Oleum both internally and to inspire customer, stakeholder, and regulatory confidence, according to de Blanco. SAP will also enable S.Oleum to run its circular enterprise as well as record, report, and act on its sustainability data.</p><p>\"We have a very integrated system, and a very circular way to produce things,\" de Blanco said. \"Finding out where waste is generated - and where it's being used - is very important to ensure the carbon intensity and the circularity of our systems at our entire site\u2026This is where SAP helps us.\"</p><p>SAP S/4HANA, SAPAriba solutions, SAP Concur solutions, and SAP SuccessFactors solutions will help standardize all of S.Oleum's processes, which will improve transparency and compliance, according to S.Oleum IT Director Marcio Propp. To help better manage and understand its myriad environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, the company has also begun implementation of SAP Sustainability Control Tower and SAP Sustainability Footprint Management.</p><p>\"It is super important that we have a very robust core system in place because it will serve as the basis for all our other processes\u2026and practically all niche applications focused on digital agriculture connect with this core with SAP,\" Propp said. \"SAP is an agribusiness market standard, and it makes perfect sense for S.Oleum to be part of this ecosystem.\"</p><p>That's a big deal because compliant, transparent ESG metrics are crucial to S.Oleum's success, according to de Blanco.</p><p>A Matter of Trust</p><p>\"Somewhere around one-third of our revenues come from carbon credits,\" de Blanco said. \"This is our, let's say, core business\u2026to convert sustainability into revenues and financial results.\"</p><p>That will require trust. SAP core technologies, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Sustainability solutions, will help S.Oleum keep that trust, thanks to a reliable foundation of sustainability data and robust, auditable ESG metrics for reporting.</p><p>\"My advice for companies that are starting their sustainability endeavor: do it as quick as you can,\" de Blanco said. \"And do it attached to science.\"</p><p>For more information on how SAP helps companies record, report, and act on their sustainability goals, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sap.com/sustainability\">www.sap.com/sustainability</url>.</p><p>Photo Credit S.Oleum</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from SAP on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: SAP<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sap\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sap</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: SAP</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/772986/How-High-Tech-Helps-SOleum-Deliver-ESG-Metrics-You-Can-Trust\">https://www.accesswire.com/772986/How-High-Tech-Helps-SOleum-Deliver-ESG-Metrics-You-Can-Trust</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FSCWRE-140570896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WS-5FP1-F11P-X04S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Filing Services Canada Inc.

Awarded to World Food ProgramUSA, One Acre Fund, and The Nature Conservancy, these are the three largest grants in the foundation's history and strengthen John Deere's commitment to creating a world in which food is a moral right for all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These grants were announced by Josh Jepsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of John Deere, at the World Food Prize Foundation's Norman E. Borlaug International Dialogue in Des Moines, Iowa.</p><p>\"We believe firmly that the world's farmers deserve our collective support and advocacy if our goal is to realize the full promise of the 'Green Revolution,'\" Jepsen said during his remarks. \"The private sector, including specifically those businesses involved in agriculture, have the responsibility to help close the gaps in investment. Guided by concepts such as 'trust-based philanthropy,' we can do better, particularly in honoring the work of nonprofit organizations serving marginalized growers capable of making leaps of their own.\" //st * World Food ProgramUSA was awarded $5 million to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the world's largest humanitarian organization, to realize its vision of a world without hunger. In 2022, WFP reached an estimated 160 million people with vital food, cash, commodity vouchers, and other support, often during emergencies and within conflict zones. Through its Innovation Accelerator, WFP also invests in technology and digital transformation intended to eliminate the causes of hunger and improve WFP's humanitarian responses.</p><p>\"We thank our long-standing partner, the John Deere Foundation, for their transformational investment. They have been committed to supporting WFP's innovation and tackling the root causes of global hunger. Not only are they helping fund innovations, but they are lending their expertise and actively participating in co-creating solutions. Together, we'll help make life better for millions of people,\" said Barron Segar , World Food ProgramUSA President and CEO. * One Acre Fund was awarded $7.5 million to accelerate its work to ensure that every farm family has the knowledge and means to achieve big harvests, support healthy families, and cultivate rich soil. In 2022, One Acre Fund served more than 4 million farmers through partnerships and its full-service programs, equipping farmers to achieve $316 million in new profits and assets.</p><p>\"As a result of the John Deere Foundation's grant, we will be able to support more than 750,000 farm families across sub-Saharan Africa over five years; unlocking nearly $65 million in new farmer profits and assets through increased food crop, cash crop, and agroforestry productivity.\" said Matthew Forti , One Acre Fund's Managing Director. \"Our relationship with the John Deere Foundation allows us to provide farm families with pathways to prosperity and food security, while building needed climate and ecological resilience in the face of increasing challenges.\" * The Nature Conservancy was awarded $6.5 million to promote natural climate solutions in key regions across the globe. The grant will fund forest restoration, conservation, and agroforestry projects in economically and environmentally vulnerable areas of Argentina , Brazil , Indonesia , Mexico , and the United States . In addition to the environmental benefits offered by natural climate solutions, the projects will help improve land use practices, boost climate resilience, and increase productivity and profitability for marginalized and indigenous farm households living in these areas.</p><p>\"Natural climate solutions unlock benefits for people, nature and agriculture by restoring soil health, increasing biodiversity, improving the water cycle and building climate resilience, however, they are often underfunded and underutilized,\" says Michael Doane , Global Managing Director for Food &amp;Freshwater Systems at The Nature Conservancy. \"This landmark grant will help The Nature Conservancy test natural climate solutions in food landscapes around the globe, improving the lives and livelihoods of farmers and illustrating the critical role of nature in sustainable food production.\"</p><p>This series of capacity-building and operational grants help commemorate the 75th anniversary of the John Deere Foundation, which continues to be a powerful source of philanthropy for nonprofit organizations serving John Deere home communities and farm communities around the world.</p><p>About John Deere</p><p>Deere&amp;Company (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.JohnDeere.com\">www.JohnDeere.com</url>) is a global leader in the delivery of agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment.
