But many people see Australia as the \"poster child\" for the climate crisis.To put it in perspective, the area burned so far is almost the size of England, which is 13 million hectares. And if you think the 2018 California fires were huge, coming in at 800,000 hectares (1.978 million acres), guess again. The bottom line is this: Scientists say that many of those forests won't recover in today's warmer climate.  They are not just talking about Australia. </p><p>They include parts of the American west, the Mediterranean Basin and even the Amazon Rainforest region in South America. Some of these post-fire landscapes will shift to brush or grasslands.   And after losing close to one billion animals, birds and reptiles in the fires, those remaining will have drastically changed habitats. Water and food sources will be different or even absent for some species, and carbon emissions will rise because there are fewer trees to absorb CO2 out of the air and store it.Further Reading: The human 'fingerprint' is now detectable in everyday weather[1]Australia's fire historyEmeritus Professor Stephen J Pyne of Arizona State University is an expert on the history of fire as well as a former firefighter in the U.S. and has written a book about Australia called Burning Bush: A Fire History of Australia.[2] He notes that most of Australia's great or notable fires are usually designated by the day they occurred, such as the 2009 Black Saturday fires that claimed the lives of nearly 173 people. Interestingly, the most destructive fires happened in 1974 and burned 117 million hectares in central Australia.   But because they didn't impact on any communities, they were not given a name. 'The 1974/75 fires had almost no impact and much of the damage was found by satellite after the fact,' Professor Pyne told news.com.au.[3] While it is true that Australia has always experienced fire seasons, just as California and Canada have fire seasons, They have been occurring more frequently and have been more destructive in the last 20 years.  'Undoubtedly climate change is real and my sense is that it's acting as a performance enhancer,' Professor Pyne said. 'Fires are becoming more and more savage, and they are more frequent. They used to happen every 30 or 50 years, now they seem to be happening by the decade.'Further Reading: The climate crisis has pushed Earth to a critical 'tipping point'[4]  The climate change link is evidentThe link between global warming, forests, and wildfires is multifaceted but very clear, said Nerilie Abram, a climate researcher at Australian National University. This combination of factors creates an unending cycle of events. \"Increasing temperatures dry out fuel and lead to more days of extreme fire weather,\" she said. \"The poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds is drawing winter rainfall away from southern Australia, causing a long-term drying trend that makes the landscape more vulnerable to burning.\" Digital Journal has written about this link and the cycle that's created when drought and loss of forests cause higher temperatures over the land and lower humidity, which, in turn, worsens wildfire conditions. This is what may happen in Australia's Alps.   Australian National University climate scientist Christopher Brack explains: \"These fires burning through the Southern Alps (in Australia) at the moment are re-burning alpine and mountain ash trees that were regenerating from fires less than 20 years ago,\" Brack said. In the warming climate, the current forests are likely to be replaced by brush and other shorter-lived and more flammable species that will intensify the fire cycle, he said. In a recent Australian television interview, according to Inside Climate News,[5] Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said the heartbreaking loss of irreplaceable forests in Australia is a clear sign of a climate tipping point playing out before our eyes. Similar scenarios are apparent in forests around the world, he said.  Arsonists and the \"disinformation campaign\"Yes, it is true that 24 people have been charged with arson for starting some of the fires in Australia. However, bot and troll accounts are involved in a 'disinformation campaign' [6]aimed at exaggerating the arsonist claims and downplaying climate change as being a factor in the bushfires, according to social media analysts.  Queensland University of Technology senior lecturer on social network analysis Dr. Timothy Graham examined content published on the #arsonemergency hashtag on Twitter. Out of a total of 1,340 tweets, he found that 1,203 were unique - all coming from 315 accounts.  Using a Twitter bot detection tool[7], he assessed a random sample for bot-like characteristics. The analysis showed a 'current disinformation campaign' on Twitter's #arsonemergency hashtag due to the 'suspiciously high number of bot-like and troll-like accounts.\" He also found suspicious accounts under the hashtags #australiafire and #bushfireaustralia. 'Australia suddenly appears to be getting swamped by mis/disinformation as a result of this environmental catastrophe, and we are suffering the consequences in terms of hyped-up polarisation and an increased difficulty and inability for citizens to discern truth,' Graham told the Guardian.

Our usual fire season is about 3 months. It's already been three months, and there are two more months to go. </p><p>These fires are also on a scale never before seen. This season is the equivalent of multiple bad seasons. A new heatwave will hit tomorrow[1], with temperatures in the 40C range across much of the country. In a bone-dry drought, that means perfect fire conditions, no humidity, and of course the ever-present smoke and dust. The smoke travels hundreds of miles, turning the sun orange even far away from the fires. We've also been lucky so far in that the big cities aren't under siege from the usual summer fires. If they were, there would have to be redeployments of firefighters away from the current fires to those areas, which would be another instant disaster. The damage Before we get onto the sheer fury of people who've lost everything, some background. Please bear in mind these are just the basics: \u2022 An area bigger than Texas has been incinerated. The scope and scale of destruction is unprecedented. The fires are coast to coast, nationwide. \u2022 Towns have been burned out. The residents of Mallacoota, a famous and popular holiday spot for generations, are being evacuated by the navy. The Far South Coast of New South Wales, where I used to live has lost a lot of land. \u2022 Coastal tourist areas with hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors have been devastated. \u2022 A lot of high value commercial, rural and residential property has gone, from Queensland to Western Australia.\u2022 Rebuilding will take a very long time. The cost in time, as well as money to rebuild, may be deadly for some places. In the middle of a drought which was already murdering cashflow in rural areas, that's likely to be a backbreaker for many people. For perhaps the first time in history, nobody's even trying to estimate the cost of the damage. That's a worrying sign, because normally people know roughly how much the damage costs. This time, nobody knows or even pretends to know. The cost will obviously be far in excess of any previous year. \u2022 Insurers will take a massive hit. Some payouts may take years, court actions, etc. Any claim may be an issue where payments aren't automatically made. For some of these towns, that inevitable delay could destroy their economies, close businesses, and set off a cascade of business collapses. \u2022 The national economy as a whole will be hit in multiple ways, including food prices, lost business, etc. It's an inventory of serious hits, affecting all aspects of basic business and daily life. \u2022 The environment: An estimated 500 million animals[2] may have perished. (This number is debatable. Estimating numbers of Australian animals isn't an exact science at the best of times. Native animals are adapted to fire, but maybe not to this sort of national inferno. There have certainly been a lot of deaths, but it's a catastrophic hit whatever the actual figures.)We're hoping it's not that bad, but there's no way of knowing, yet. There is simply no adequate way of expressing how dangerous and destructive these very fast-moving fires are. Our all-too-obviously under-resourced fire and emergency services have achieved miracles. Given the national scale of the ongoing disaster, we've got off a bit better than a decade ago, when 147 people died in smaller fires. Bushfires can turn cars into puddles of metal and buildings into pathetic, totally trashed garbage dumps in a few minutes. Radiant heat can burn you from a hundred metres or so away. We've been fortunate to receive very much appreciated help from America and Canada. They've already done an incredible job and provided some relief for our horribly over-strained fire teams. The anger is hotter than the firesAustralia's unprecedented fires have generated equally hot, fully justified anger. Australian governments, state and federal, are seen as responding poorly at best: \u2022 Everyone knows how severely stretched the Australian emergency services usually are. \u2022 They have to raise money by donations. \u2022 They tried to do proper fuel clearance before the fire season, but had 'inadequate resources'. That's not even funny. We're a super-rich country, and we do nothing about basic common sense? \u2022 Only now are people talking about pay for them. \u2022 They have to travel constantly in fire season, working in impossible heat. \u2022 The military, only now called in to help, could have been called in a lot sooner, allowing the firefighters to recover. \u2022 No word of support for fire victims, financial or otherwise, is trickling into the mix.\u2022 The financial uncertainties are a cruelty on top of a disaster for many fire victims. Australian governments are generally and rightly regarded as furniture and despised accordingly depending on portfolios. We have the Lounge Suite for Education, the Sofa for Social Security, or in this case the China Hutch for Emergency Services. Government should:\u2022 Move immediately to manage financial issues. \u2022 Take action ASAP to free up whatever resources are required for the current fire season.\u2022 Immediately begin a nationwide upgrade of all emergency services, terms of service for firefighters and other operators. \u2022 Pay attention when told resources aren't up to scratch.\u2022 Make it standard procedure to put the ADF on standby to support emergency services. \u2022 Upgrade all fire services. They don't even have adequate respirators[3]. A no-brainer, for sure, but that's another total incompetence issue. This sloppy response is totally inadequate on every level. Get off your fat rich backsides and do the job properly for once, you bludgers.

At Beta Hunt, a robust gold mineral resource and reserve is hosted in multiple gold shears, with gold intersections along a 4 km strike length remaining open in multiple directions. HGO is a highly prospective land package totaling approximately 1,800 square kilometers. In addition, RNC has a 28% interest in a nickel joint venture that owns the Dumont Nickel-Cobalt Project located in the Abitibi region of Quebec. Dumont contains the second largest nickel reserve and ninth largest cobalt reserve in the world. RNC has a strong Board and management team focused on delivering shareholder value.

Factors that could affect the outcome include, among others: future prices and the supply of metals; the results of drilling; inability to raise the money necessary to incur the expenditures required to retain and advance the properties; environmental liabilities (known and unknown); general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; results of exploration programs; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry; political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war; or delays in obtaining governmental approvals, projected cash operating costs, failure to obtain regulatory or shareholder approvals. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, refer to RNC's filings with Canadian securities regulators, including the most recent Annual Information Form, available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>Although RNC has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended.

This decision by RNC to continue production and, to the knowledge of RNC, the prior production decision were not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, which include increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.

On Jan. 10, a group of 28 - both young and old - marched demanding greater environmental responsibility to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"From the scientists' messages that have come to us from Greta Thunberg, 'our house is burning,'\" says 89-year-old Frank Thompson, sitting on his walker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents held a wide array of informative signs as they marched from the Parry Sound Mall and to their assembly point. The group voiced solidarity for those affected by the Australian bushfires when eventually gathered out front the Parry Sound Public Library at noon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In March 2019, Thompson started the climate action demonstration outside the James Street constituency offices of Norm Miller and recently elected Scott Aitchison. Regular demonstrators grew over the months that followed.</p><p>\"The mathematics fits; the studies mean something, truth matters. What's right is out there. Martin Luther King sensed this when 'the arch of the universe is long when it bends toward justice,'\" he quotes. \"Our problem is it's got to bend to justice in 10 years.\"</p><p>Led by Ken Christenson, members of the group Climate Action Parry Sound took turns reading 15-year climate scientist and journalist Eric Holthaus' interactive letter of action to our future titled: In 2030, we ended the climate emergency. Here's how.</p><p>The letter was written as a collective to-do list for humanity. It outlines that necessitating political change only takes 3.5 per cent of the population. By the end of 2020, we should adopt an environmental policy like New Zealand did in 2019. In that country, 3.5 per cent of population were engaged in making a change. By 2023, we should criminalize and delegitimize the fossil fuel industry through crimes against humanity tribunals of fossil fuel executives, the document states.</p><p>Ken's wife Judy said they have marched five times now since September's Global Fridays for Future Climate Strike March initiated by Greta Thunberg; and have continued weekly Friday demonstrations outside the Parry Sound constituencies since March. She says their objective is to provide a regular presence in the region and further attention alongside ongoing international movements.</p><p>Last month the group submitted the signed provincial petition with over 1,000 signatures, asking MPP Miller to declare a climate emergency after international scientific consensus for governments to take action within the next 12 years. The petition asks the Ontario government to regulate industrial, residential and automotive emissions, for alternative energy projects be subsidized, and species protection be supported.</p><p>More local collaborations are promised as with the Georgian Bay Biosphere and the Parry Sound and Area Food Collaborative.</p><p>\"We are a go-to platform for people to learn what they can do and to connect with these other groups and initiatives in Parry Sound and beyond,\" said Judy.</p><p>The group plans to be back at the James Street Parry Sound constituency offices, this time to present a signed federal petition with over 1,000 signatures. If the Parry Sound constituency office is still not opened for Conservative MP Scott Aitchison, the group plans to drive to the Huntsville office to present it.</p><p>Ken has taken on the voice of his brother Terry Christenson, a 72-year-old Carling-Parry Sound resident who is currently arrested in British Columbia. Terry, the Juno-nominee and climbing rope designer, is also known as the \"Protesting Grandpa.\" He was arrested for the third time in July. He wore snorkel gear and entered the Trans Mountain pipeline terminal from the water - in peaceful protest.</p><p>Terry is currently serving the longest sentence given to any activist protesting the pipeline expansion in British Columbia, and one of the longest given to any activist ever in the province. On Nov. 20, he was sentenced to five months for criminal contempt of court. The Prostesting Grampa, who is M\u00e9tis, pleaded not guilty to the charges - like many Indigenous activists who denounce settlers' laws on unceded territory as illegitimate.</p><p>Lakota drummer Matt MacDonald moved to Parry Sound in the fall from out west, and said he appreciates the non-Indigenous solidarity to Indigenous environmental plight for universal responsibility. He was featured in the documentary Waabishki-ma'iingan - A White Wolf (2018), and shared how culture and tradition saved his life while being moved from home to home in the child welfare system.</p><p>\"The world is changing and it's going to harm a lot of people if we don't stop the way we use fossil fuels,\" he said, acknowledging those more directly impacted by pollution and the farmers who experience damaged soil.</p><p>\"In nature, we are actually rich,\" he said. \"It's just people are stuck in what my people call an illusion,\" referring to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. \"People have forgotten where we came from,\" he says.</p><p>In reference to the term \"two-eyed seeing,\" he said that while we cannot go back to pre-colonial living, natural laws to the land, respect and way of living together remain the same.</p><p>Graham Clark, who recently moved to Parry Sound from Ottawa with his wife, heard the drumming from inside the library and came out to listen.</p><p>As a non-Indigenous person who has invested over 10 years on Indigenous studies and is now working towards a Masters in education, Clark appreciated the welcoming and supportive nature of the mostly non-Indigenous group: including people saying miigwetch (thank you) and being allies of Indigenous knowledge and protocol.</p><p>\"There is a lot of lost and ignored Indigenous knowledge as part of ongoing processes of colonialism,\" he said. \"A lot of understanding about ecological management is imbued in those Indigenous practices and ways of knowing.\"</p><p>He reflected on the initiative of the local group, saying no matter how big or small the group or initiative in changing wasteful habits, it speaks to the importance of continuing to do that and holding corporations and governments to account.</p><p>He and his partner have moved to town to reduce transportation costs and emissions. Additionally, they buy glass containers instead of plastic containers or single-use plastic, and have sought out an ecologically and ethically conscious building contractor, the Fourth Pig, to refurbish their house with better energy-saving insulation.</p><p>\"In the long run it's cheaper,\" he said of their financial and environmental decision. \"Although it does largely hinge on corporations and government to do some of the large actions ... it comes (down) to the individual's choice of who they vote for and what they buy.\"</p><p>The Climate Action Parry Sound's federal petition asks to immediately focus all its actions through the lens of a declared climate emergency to avoid a global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees. The petition is available to sign outside MPP Norm Miller's office at 17 James Street Fridays from 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.</p><p>Karli Zschogner is a freelance journalist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">METPAP-2020012056935247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">METPAP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1S-5631-JDH1-C32K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

With the acquisition of the Higginsville mine and mill in June, our company has matured into a growing, profitable gold producer with two operations feeding a centralized mill. Our fourth quarter results continue to build upon the success of the previous quarter despite the challenges associated with the bushfires in Australia in late 2019. I would like to take this opportunity to personally commend our personnel in Australia for an outstanding job, which ensured that despite these challenges our mill remained in operation with ample feed from our mines and stockpiles. These efforts were reflected in our results, driving both a beat to production guidance and finishing</p><p>With respect to current operations, we are now mining from three sources: Baloo, Fairplay North and Beta Hunt, with opportunities for expansion at all three mines. As we work through our open pit optimizations at Higginsville, we look forward to announcing an updated LOM plan for Higginsville later this year. With operations performing well YTD 2020, we remain on track to meet our previously reported 2020 guidance of 90,000-95,000 ounces and AISC1 guidance of US$1,050-US$1,200 per ounce.</p><p>I would also like to highlight our early 2020 exploration success. The renegotiation of the Morgan Stanley royalty in December unlocked our 1,800 km2 land package surrounding the mill and, as we announced during January and February, we are seeing outstanding results from the drilling bit and our review of the large historical HGO database. I am extremely excited to see what this year has in store with our large exploration program at Higginsville; the first of its kind in many years.</p><p>Lastly, and certainly not least, we have experienced significant impact in global financial markets both on our share price and that of our peers as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis. I remind our shareholders and stakeholders that we have taken careful steps at our operations to prepare for potential disruptions, and we remain in constant contact with the local, state and federal health authorities. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our workforce and stakeholders.</p><p>We finished the year with an extremely strong balance sheet, nearly C$35 million in cash. We have continued to build stockpiles in front of the mill, just as we did ahead of the Australian bushfires last year. Once again, I would like to thank our personnel on site for their tireless efforts in preparing our operations during this period. I remain confident that with all our collective efforts we will get through this and all stakeholders can regain confidence once the global situation begins to improve and normalize.</p><p>Most importantly, I wish good health to all.\"</p><p>COVID-19 Preparedness</p><p>As announced in RNC's news release dated March 18, 2020, the Corporation has implemented strict control measures at its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A task force at RNC's Australian operations has been established to ensure the operating sites remain as prepared and responsive to this evolving situation as possible. RNC is carefully monitoring the advice of local health authorities and has informed site personnel of the precautions that need to be taken with respect to travel to and from site, along with isolation periods should anyone exhibit symptoms consistent with COVID-19. RNC has also proactively employed a full-time nurse specifically to monitor the status of people entering and leaving site. Additionally, RNC has also sealed off both operations from any outside visitors not critical to business operations.</p><p>In order to minimize potential disruptions to supply chains, RNC is building additional critical supplies beyond normal levels. As part of our ability to manage the fallout from the December bushfires, ROM stockpiles are now growing steadily from three sources: Baloo, Beta Hunt and Fairplay North.</p><p>RNC will continue to monitor this fluid situation, with our top priority being the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders.</p><p>Table 1 - Highlights of operational results for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 //st</p><p>Three months ended, Year ended, For the periods ended 2019 2018 2019 2018 December 31, Gold Operations (Consolidated)1,2 Tonnes milled (000s) 321 71 755 493 Recoveries 90% 95% 91% 93% Gold milled, grade (g/t 2.60 9.42 2.65 4.22 Au) Gold produced (ounces) 26,874 20,495 64,277 62,233 Gold sold (ounces) 28,359 19,512 65,225 62,806 Average realized price 1,451 1,324 1,368 1,261 (USD $/oz sold) Cash operating costs 929 445 1,004 924 (USD $/oz sold)3 All-in sustaining cost 1,131 685 1,155 1,037 (AISC) (USD $/oz sold)3 Gold (Beta Hunt Mine)1,2 Tonnes milled (000s) 133 71 475 493 Gold milled, grade (g/t 3.81 9.42 3.11 4.22 Au) Gold produced(ounces)1 16,290 20,495 47,642 62,233 Gold sold (ounces) 17,561 19,512 48,716 62,806 Cash operating cost (USD 773 445 958 924 $/oz sold)3 Gold (HGO Mine)1 Tonnes milled (000s) 188 - 280 - Gold milled grade (g/t 1.75 - 1.85 - Au) Gold produced (ounces) 10,584 - 16,635 - Gold sold (ounces) 10,798 - 16,509 - Cash operating cost (USD 1,182 - 1,136 - $/oz sold)3 //st 1.

The</p><p>AISC1 costs were higher by US$446 per ounce sold compared to US$685 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included sales from coarse gold production from the Father's Day Vein discovery. //st 1. Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are</p><p>included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated March</p><p>25, 2020.</p><p>Cash operating costs were US$929 per ounce sold on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2019, US$103 per ounce or 10% lower than in the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>With the HGO mill fed at 100% capacity, fourth quarter results from the combined Beta Hunt and Higginsville mines showed significant improvement over third quarter results,. This was despite significant challenges during December due to the Australian bushfires, which impacted the supply chain to the region. With critical supplies and tonnes stockpiled in front of the mill, processing operations were able to continue unabated.</p><p>Higginsville Gold Operation (HGO)</p><p>Gold production at Higginsville was 10,584 ounces at a milled grade of 1.75 g/t Au during the fourth quarter, an 84% increase from 5,756 ounces in the prior quarter. Grade was down slightly from the third quarter due to milling of lower grade Mt. Henry stockpiles during the Australian bushfires. The increase reflects the ramp up of mining operations at Higginsville, which now includes production from the both the Baloo and Fairplay North open pits.</p><p>At Higginsville, cash operating costs were USD $1,182 per ounce for the fourth quarter, US$504, or 74% higher, than in the prior quarter. The increased cash cost was largely due to the reallocation of processing costs inside the Western Australia business unit and several one-off items.</p><p>With Higginsville operations now fully integrated into the Western Australia business unit, internal processing charges have been normalized. This has resulted in the internal reallocation of processing charges between Beta Hunt and Higginsville. This is reflected by the reported cash operating costs in Table 1. Importantly this reallocation of costs does not change the consolidated rates for the Australian business such as cash operating costs and AISC.</p><p>Significant items, totaling approximately A$6 million, included work associated with the decision to build up run-of-mine (\"ROM\") stockpiles ahead of the significant bushfires in Western Australian during the month of December. In order to achieve this, the Company elected to double-shift at Baloo in order to fast track pre-strip development and build stockpiles while maintaining normal feed to the plant. Mining at Baloo also transitioned into the underlying fresh rock which resulted in additional drilling and blasting costs. Lastly, costs were also impacted with increased dewatering operations associated with larger water inflows into the pit during heavy rains early in the fourth quarter.</p><p>As previously announced, mining at Baloo Stage 1 is now forecast to continue to mid-2020 and Stage 2 will now be extended to January 2021. Recent drilling has the potential for Baloo to be extended even beyond January 2021.</p><p>At Fairplay North, located just 1 km from the HGO mill, mining is underway concurrently with Baloo, providing two sources of feed from HGO to the mill. An additional A$2.7 million in pre-stripping capital was associated with the Fairplay North pit during the fourth quarter as the renegotiation of the royalty at Higginsville allowed RNC to begin mining activities.</p><p>The Fairplay North pit will be mined in two stages, with Stage 2 expected to be completed by the end of third quarter 2020. However, as with Baloo, recent drilling has raised the potential for this to be extended.</p><p>Milling at Higginsville continued to perform well during the fourth quarter, with overall mill availability improving to 97% from 93% in the third quarter. This trend has continued during the first few months of 2020 and is expected to support RNC's continued cost reduction strategy.</p><p>See RNC's news release dated January 29, 2020 for more information on early drilling success at both Baloo and Fairplay North.</p><p>Beta Hunt Mine</p><p>Gold production at Beta Hunt was 16,290 ounces during the fourth quarter. Milled grades at Beta Hunt in the fourth quarter were 3.81 grams per tonne Au, higher than 2.93 grams per tonne in the third quarter but lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to production from the high-grade Father's Day Vein.</p><p>Beta Hunt gold production is mainly focused on the Western Flanks and A Zone mining areas. A number of stoping areas are being developed within the Western Flanks that will access some of the wider Beta Hunt stoping blocks (up to 20 metres wide). Combined production from Western Flanks and A Zone is forecast to increase to +50,000 tonnes per month while mining from these wider stoping blocks.</p><p>Table 2 - Highlights of Annual Financial Results (in thousands of dollars except per share amounts) //st For the years ended December 31, 2019 2018 Revenue $128,036 $128,770 Production and processing costs 78,836 82,742 Loss before income taxes (7,716) (7,911) Net loss (6,942) (8,396) Basic and diluted loss per share 0.01 0.02 Adjusted EBITDA1,2 18,284 17,979 Adjusted EBITDA per share1,2 0.03 0.05 Adjusted earnings1 15,913 13,886 Adjusted earnings per share1 0.03 0.04 Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities 15,179 (8,316) Cash investment in property, plant and equipment (25,391) (13,013) and mineral property interests //st 1.

(\"Morgan Stanley\") over a number of tenements at its Higginsville Gold Operations located in Western Australia. This revised royalty structure has allowed for a new strategic approach to many of the previously uneconomic mineralized zones throughout the HGO tenements.</p><p>In news releases dated January 23, January 29 and February 27, 2020, RNC announced comprehensive updates on exploration activities since the renegotiation of the royalty. Highlights include: //st * At Baloo, 20 resource definition holes totalling 492 metres and 19 exploration holes totalling 1,897 metres were completed. Drilling focused on the following target areas with the aim of increasing and upgrading the existing historical resource: * North Baloo (BLOR0003- 8.7 g/t over 3.0m from 63m)2 * Eastern Footwall mineralization (BLOR0033 - 4.8 g/t over 3.0 m, from 7</p><p>m)1 * Down-dip Infill of the Baloo mineralization (BLOR0009- 2.5 g/t over</p><p>18.5 m, from 14 m)1 (/ul) //st</p><p>1. Estimated true thickness.</p><p>2. True thickness cannot be estimated with available information. //st * At Fairplay North, 26 resource definition RC holes totalling 1,721 metres were completed. Drilling focused on upgrading the existing historical resource within and on the margins of an optimised pit shell. Assay results confirmed the mineralization interpretation and has extended the near surface supergene mineralization. Highlights are summarized below1: * FPNGC_1305-078: 16.5 g/t over 16 m from 24 m, including 59.8 g/t over 4</p><p>m * FPNGC_1305-083: 5.8 g/t over 13 m from 25 m * FPNGC_1305-102: 3.2 g/t over 14 m from 53 m (/ul) //st</p><p>1. Drillhole intervals are estimated true widths. //st * A high-density gravity survey program was completed at HGO and the results were announced on January 29, 2020. The program identified a newly interpreted structure extending over 5 kms north of the previously mined high grade 1.0 Moz Trident gold deposit. The new structure is considered to have high potential for mineralization at depth and will be the focus of a new round of drilling by RNC as part of its 2020 exploration program. //st * At the Aquarius project (formerly Corona project), RNC's ongoing review of HGO historical mineral resources and drill results has confirmed the potential of the deposit as a future high-grade open pit and/or underground operation. //st * RNC drilling has extended mineralization at the Hidden Secret (HDS) and Mousehollow (MOH) projects, which now form part of RNC's near-term mine plan. Additionally, visible gold has been discovered in a surface sample taken at the Hidden Secret project. Intersection highlights from RNC's drill program include1 * HDSR0136: 5.1 g/t over 4 m from 24 m, including 47.8 g/t over 1 m * HDSR085: 24.8 g/t over 4 m from 17 m, including 92.6 g/t over 1 m * MOHR0055: 26.1 g/t over 3 m from 22 m * MOHR0075: 3.3 g/t over 19 m from 0 m //st</p><p>1. Estimated true widths.</p><p>Beta Hunt Maiden Gold Mineral Reserve</p><p>On February 6, 2020 RNC filed the Technical Report for the maiden Gold Mineral Reserve of 306,000 ounces (3.45 Mt at an average grade of 2.8 g/t) at its Beta Hunt mine. The Gold Mineral Reserve forms the basis for Beta Hunt's mine plan, which schedules base-load feed to the Corporation's 100% owned Higginsville treatment plant. The Maiden Gold Mineral Reserve remains open for potential additions along strike and at depth from both the existing Gold Mineral Resource (underpinning the Mineral Reserve) and from exploration targets that will be drill-tested. On February 6, 2020, the Corporation filed a new technical report for the Beta Hunt Mine and HGO entitled \"Technical Report Western Australia Operations - Eastern Goldfields: Beta Hunt Mine (Kambalda) and Higginsville Gold Operations (Higginsville)\".

Factors that could affect the outcome include, among others: future prices and the supply of metals; the results of drilling; inability to raise the money necessary to incur the expenditures required to retain and advance the properties; environmental liabilities (known and unknown); general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; results of exploration programs; accidents, labour disputes, labour and operational disruptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak and other risks of the mining industry; political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war; or delays in obtaining governmental approvals, projected cash operating costs, failure to obtain regulatory or shareholder approvals. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, refer to RNC's filings with Canadian securities regulators, including the most recent Annual Information Form, available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>Although RNC has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this news release and RNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding the Higginsville Mining Operations</p><p>A production decision at the Higginsville gold operations was made by previous operators of the mine, prior to the completion of the acquisition of the Higginsville gold operations by RNC and RNC made a decision to continue production subsequent to the acquisition. This decision by RNC to continue production and, to the knowledge of RNC, the prior production decision were not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, which include increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.</p><p>Rob Buchanan, Director, Investor Relations, T: (416) 363-0649, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rncminerals.com\">www.rncminerals.com</url> Tel : 416-363-0649 ROYAL NICKEL CORP Fax : 416-363-7826 Email : <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rbuchanan@rncminerals.com\">rbuchanan@rncminerals.com</email> WWW :       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.royalnickel.com\">http://www.royalnickel.com</url></p><p>______________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2020 Market News Publishing Inc.

With the acquisition of the Higginsville mine and mill in June, our company has matured into a growing, profitable gold producer with two operations feeding a centralized mill. Our fourth quarter results continue to build upon the success of the previous quarter despite the challenges associated with the bushfires in Australia in late 2019. I would like to take this opportunity to personally commend our personnel in Australia for an outstanding job, which ensured that despite these challenges our mill remained in operation with ample feed from our mines and stockpiles. These efforts were reflected in our results, driving both a beat to production guidance and finishing 2H19 with AISC of US$1,144 per ounce, below our guided range of US$1,150-$1,250 per ounce. </p><p>With respect to current operations, we are now mining from three sources: Baloo, Fairplay North and Beta Hunt, with opportunities for expansion at all three mines. As we work through our open pit optimizations at Higginsville, we look forward to announcing an updated LOM plan for Higginsville later this year. With operations performing well YTD 2020, we remain on track to meet our previously reported 2020 guidance of 90,000-95,000 ounces and AISC1 guidance of US$1,050-US$1,200 per ounce. </p><p>I would also like to highlight our early 2020 exploration success. The renegotiation of the Morgan Stanley royalty in December unlocked our 1,800 km2 land package surrounding the mill and, as we announced during January and February, we are seeing outstanding results from the drilling bit and our review of the large historical HGO database. I am extremely excited to see what this year has in store with our large exploration program at Higginsville; the first of its kind in many years. </p><p>Lastly, and certainly not least, we have experienced significant impact in global financial markets both on our share price and that of our peers as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis. I remind our shareholders and stakeholders that we have taken careful steps at our operations to prepare for potential disruptions, and we remain in constant contact with the local, state and federal health authorities. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our workforce and stakeholders. </p><p>We finished the year with an extremely strong balance sheet, nearly C$35 million in cash. We have continued to build stockpiles in front of the mill, just as we did ahead of the Australian bushfires last year. Once again, I would like to thank our personnel on site for their tireless efforts in preparing our operations during this period. I remain confident that with all our collective efforts we will get through this and all stakeholders can regain confidence once the global situation begins to improve and normalize.</p><p>Most importantly, I wish good health to all.\" </p><p>COVID-19 Preparedness</p><p>As announced in RNC's news release dated March 18, 2020, the Corporation has implemented strict control measures at its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A task force at RNC's Australian operations has been established to ensure the operating sites remain as prepared and responsive to this evolving situation as possible.\u00a0 RNC is carefully monitoring the advice of local health authorities and has informed site personnel of the precautions that need to be taken with respect to travel to and from site, along with isolation periods should anyone exhibit symptoms consistent with COVID-19. RNC has also proactively employed a full-time nurse specifically to monitor the status of people entering and leaving site. Additionally, RNC has also sealed off both operations from any outside visitors not critical to business operations.</p><p>In order to minimize potential disruptions to supply chains, RNC is building additional critical supplies beyond normal levels. As part of our ability to manage the fallout from the December bushfires, ROM stockpiles are now growing steadily from three sources: Baloo, Beta Hunt and Fairplay North.</p><p>RNC will continue to monitor this fluid situation, with our top priority being the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders.</p><p>  Table 1 - Highlights of operational results for the periods ended December

gold production of 26,874 ounces was 6,379 ounces higher than the corresponding quarter in 2018 (20,495 ounces). Production during the fourth quarter of 2019 consisted of Beta Hunt underground, Baloo open pit and a small amount of stockpile material. The milled grade was 2.60 grams per tonne of gold (\"g/t Au\"), compared to 9.42 grams per tonne the fourth quarter of 2018. The higher grade in 2018 was the result of high-grade Father's Day Vein specimen gold production. </p><p>Consolidated AISC1 was US$1,131 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2019, an improvement of 4% over the third quarter of 2019 and 12% over the first half of 2019. The 2H19 AISC of US$1,144 per ounce came in below 2H19 guidance of US$1,150-$1,250 per ounce. This continued reduction in AISC was achieved despite the increased capital outlays arising as a result of the Australian bushfires, a major rebuild of an underground mining truck at Beta Hunt and pre-stripping capital costs associated with the ramp up of the Fairplay North open pit at Higginsville. </p><p>  AISC1 costs were higher by US$446 per ounce sold compared to US$685 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included sales from coarse gold production from the Father's Day Vein discovery.\u00a0</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated March 25, 2020.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>Cash operating costs were US$929 per ounce sold on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2019, US$103 per ounce or 10% lower than in the third quarter of 2019. </p><p>With the HGO mill fed at 100% capacity, fourth quarter results from the combined Beta Hunt and Higginsville mines showed significant improvement over third quarter results,. This was despite significant challenges during December due to the Australian bushfires, which impacted the supply chain to the region. With critical supplies and tonnes stockpiled in front of the mill, processing operations were able to continue unabated.</p><p>Higginsville Gold Operation (HGO)</p><p>Gold production at Higginsville was 10,584 ounces at a milled grade of 1.75 g/t Au during the fourth quarter, an 84% increase from 5,756 ounces in the prior quarter. Grade was down slightly from the third quarter due to milling of lower grade Mt. Henry stockpiles during the Australian bushfires. The increase reflects the ramp up of mining operations at Higginsville, which now includes production from the both the Baloo and Fairplay North open pits. </p><p>At Higginsville, cash operating costs were USD $1,182 per ounce for the fourth quarter, US$504, or 74% higher, than in the prior quarter. The increased cash cost was largely due to the reallocation of processing costs inside the Western Australia business unit and several one-off items.</p><p>With Higginsville operations now fully integrated into the Western Australia business unit, internal processing charges have been normalized. This has resulted in the internal reallocation of processing charges between Beta Hunt and Higginsville. This is reflected by the reported cash operating costs in Table 1. Importantly this reallocation of costs does not change the consolidated rates for the Australian business such as cash operating costs and AISC.\u00a0</p><p>Significant items, totaling approximately A$6 million, included work associated with the decision to build up run-of-mine (\"ROM\") stockpiles ahead of the significant bushfires in Western Australian during the month of December. In order to achieve this, the Company elected to double-shift at Baloo in order to fast track pre-strip development and build stockpiles while maintaining normal feed to the plant. Mining at Baloo also transitioned into the underlying fresh rock which resulted in additional drilling and blasting costs. Lastly, costs were also impacted with increased dewatering operations associated with larger water inflows into the pit during heavy rains early in the fourth quarter. </p><p>As previously announced, mining at Baloo Stage 1 is now forecast to continue to mid-2020 and Stage 2 will now be extended to January 2021. Recent drilling has the potential for Baloo to be extended even beyond January 2021. </p><p>At Fairplay North, located just 1 km from the HGO mill, mining is underway concurrently with Baloo, providing two sources of feed from HGO to the mill. An additional A$2.7 million in pre-stripping capital was associated with the Fairplay North pit during the fourth quarter as the renegotiation of the royalty at Higginsville allowed RNC to begin mining activities.</p><p>The Fairplay North pit will be mined in two stages, with Stage 2 expected to be completed by the end of third quarter 2020. However, as with Baloo, recent drilling has raised the potential for this to be extended.</p><p>Milling at Higginsville continued to perform well during the fourth quarter, with overall mill availability improving to 97% from 93% in the third quarter. This trend has continued during the first few months of 2020 and is expected to support RNC's continued cost reduction strategy. </p><p>See RNC's news release dated January 29, 2020 for more information on early drilling success at both Baloo and Fairplay North. </p><p>Beta Hunt Mine</p><p>Gold production at Beta Hunt was 16,290 ounces during the fourth quarter. Milled grades at Beta Hunt in the fourth quarter were 3.81 grams per tonne Au, higher than 2.93 grams per tonne in the third quarter but lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to production from the high-grade Father's Day Vein. </p><p>Beta Hunt gold production is mainly focused on the Western Flanks and A Zone mining areas. A number of stoping areas are being developed within the Western Flanks that will access some of the wider Beta Hunt stoping blocks (up to 20 metres wide). Combined production from Western Flanks and A Zone is forecast to increase to +50,000 tonnes per month while mining from these wider stoping blocks. </p><p>  Table 2 - Highlights of Annual Financial Results\u00a0(in thousands of dollars except per share amounts)</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"488\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the years ended December 31,</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2019</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2018</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$128,036</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$128,770</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Production and processing costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">78,836</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">82,742</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss before income taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(7,716)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7,911)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(6,942)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(8,396)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic and diluted loss per share</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.01</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.02</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA1,2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">18,284</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">17,979</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA per share1,2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.05</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted earnings1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15,913</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">13,886</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted earnings per share1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.04</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15,179</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(8,316)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash investment in property, plant and equipment and mineral property interests</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(25,391)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(13,013)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated March 25, 2020.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\").</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues of 128.0 million decreased slightly by $0.7 million compared to 2018.

The Higginsville treatment facility is a low-cost 1.4 Mtpa processing plant which is fed at capacity from RNC's underground Beta Hunt mine and open pit Higginsville mine. At Beta Hunt, a robust gold mineral resource and reserve is hosted in multiple gold shears, with gold intersections along a 4 km strike length remaining open in multiple directions. HGO is a highly prospective land package totaling approximately 1,800 square kilometers. In addition, RNC has a 28% interest in a nickel joint venture that owns the Dumont Nickel-Cobalt Project located in the Abitibi region of Quebec. Dumont contains the second largest nickel reserve and ninth largest cobalt reserve in the world. RNC has a strong Board and management team focused on delivering shareholder value. RNC's common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol RNX. RNC shares also trade on the OTCQX market under the symbol RNKLF.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements</p><p>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" including without limitation statements relating to the liquidity and capital resources of RNC, production and AISC guidance for 2020 and the potential of the Beta Hunt Mine, Higginsville Gold Operation and Dumont Nickel Project.</p><p>Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of RNC to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the outcome include, among others: future prices and the supply of metals; the results of drilling; inability to raise the money necessary to incur the expenditures required to retain and advance the properties; environmental liabilities (known and unknown); general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; results of exploration programs; accidents, labour disputes, labour and operational disruptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak and other risks of the mining industry; political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war; or delays in obtaining governmental approvals, projected cash operating costs, failure to obtain regulatory or shareholder approvals. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, refer to RNC's filings with Canadian securities regulators, including the most recent Annual Information Form, available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>Although RNC has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this news release and RNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding the Higginsville Mining Operations</p><p>A production decision at the Higginsville gold operations was made by previous operators of the mine, prior to the completion of the acquisition of the Higginsville gold operations by RNC and RNC made a decision to continue production subsequent to the acquisition. This decision by RNC to continue production and, to the knowledge of RNC, the prior production decision were not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, which include increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.</p><p>SOURCE  RNC Minerals</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2020/26/c1251.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2020/26/c1251.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNW-20200326C1251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6153-BC11-DYRK-D124-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7263\"/><timeReceived>7:29 AM Eastern Time</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CNW Group</copyright><publicationName>Canada NewsWire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 26, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Eco-anxiety leads to intense feelings of stress, fear and grief in reaction to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, some countries are introducing more targeted climate curricula. But that movement is slow to arrive in Canada.</p><p>\"I first became aware of eco-anxiety when it happened to me,\" says Howard, an emergency doctor in the Northwest Territories. She began dealing with crippling anxiety after educating herself about the state of our planet in 2012.</p><p>\"I finished reading Bill McKibben's 'Global Warming's Terrifying New Math' in the fetal position, curled up around my eight-month-old daughter, thinking climate change is going to change her life.\"</p><p>Today she has transformed that fear into action, speaking out about her experience with eco-anxiety and advocating for the expansion of climate education.</p><p>Eco-anxiety was first defined in 2017 by the American Psychological Association as \"a chronic fear of environmental doom.\" The condition can be debilitating, emotionally exhausting and lead to depression, loneliness, lethargy and feelings of helplessness. \"I didn't know anyone else feeling this way and was incredibly lonely,\" says Howard. \"It impacted my daily function a lot.\"</p><p>Eco-anxiety presents itself differently from other forms of anxiety, says Niki Harre, a psychology professor at the University of Auckland. It is less individual; instead, it is a fear for the collective future.</p><p>The phenomenon is relatively new, and the term eco-anxiety is not yet commonplace, says Harre, even among people who are experiencing it. While there is no clinical diagnosis, the trend is definitely becoming more and more clear, and young people are most at risk.</p><p>Rachael Buchwald, a 20-year-old student at the University of Manitoba, says her eco-anxiety has increased in the last year. She did study climate change when she was younger, but has only recently begun to feel \"just how overwhelming of an issue climate change really is.\"</p><p>Buchwald describes completing a Grade 5 project on ecological sustainability as just another part of the curriculum.</p><p>\"I don't think I really understood what it all meant,\" she said, but she believes today's younger children are immersed in an environment where they are told their future is uncertain. They grow up hearing about natural disasters and some even see that devastation first hand.</p><p>That was the case in Vernon, B.C., says Julia Payson, executive director of the local Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) branch. Wildfires surrounded the town in 2018, and residents were told to stay indoors for a week because of the smoke. The CMHA's crisis line lit up.</p><p>It received calls from individuals who felt socially isolated, first responders were reporting PTSD, and many said they felt powerless and stressed. Young people were especially worried. Payson remembers her own terrified children asking: \"What's happening? How close are the fires? Why is the sky orange?\"</p><p>\"A lot of parents didn't know how to explain the fires to their kids,\" says Payson. The Vernon CMHA created a toolkit to support parents whose children were dealing with eco-anxiety. However, Canadian curricula have little to offer teachers whose students express the same concerns.</p><p>People who witness the effects of climate change up close, such as those in Vernon, face more risk of experiencing eco-anxiety. In Nunavut, elders in the community are also expressing eco-anxiety, says Howard, as they have seen the land and hunting practices change in their lifetimes.</p><p>Others experiencing more general eco-anxiety may not see the imminent risk of climate change first hand, but they often are following ecological crises closely on social media.</p><p>Today, climate change is framed as the biggest threat to biodiversity, economic growth, global health and even the human species itself. Many experts on eco-anxiety compare it with the nuclear threat for previous generations. Young people in Canada were too often left out of the nuclear conversation.</p><p>\"When parents weren't levelling with their children about the nuclear crisis, their kids lost trust in them,\" says Howard. This left a generation of young people feeling unsafe, confused and generated much stress.</p><p>Unlike the nuclear threat, however, climate change is visible daily, at least on phones and televisions. A never-ending news cycle of wildfires, flooding, heat waves and cyclones makes climate change appear more imminent than ever before for many young people.</p><p>Sarah Rundle, a Grade 11 student at Malvern Collegiate Institute in Toronto, is the president of her school's eco-club. \"There has been more of a push to get involved in the fight against climate change this year than ever before,\" she says.</p><p>Rundle says students are more fearful this year. In weekly club meetings, they talk about these concerns, including whether they will be able to have children and what jobs will be available for them.</p><p>To address this type of concern, countries such as New Zealand and Italy are introducing climate change curriculums, which try to address eco-anxiety. The idea is to emphasize the science behind climate change, while presenting strategies to better manage eco-anxiety.</p><p>In New Zealand, middle-school students are now being taught climate science, current international responses, local implications and how to join climate change movements. They are also encouraged to keep a \"feelings thermometer\" to track their emotions in a curriculum developed in collaboration with scientists and psychologists.</p><p>\"The curriculum includes important tools for managing eco-anxiety,\" says Jackie Feather, a psychologist and senior lecturer at the Auckland University of Technology. \"When students understand the science behind climate change it helps ease their anxiety,\" she says.</p><p>Mental health tools in the new curriculum encourage students to acknowledge and cope with difficult emotions around climate change, and a new Wellbeing Guide teaches mindfulness, to \"check in with your values\" and be grateful.</p><p>Meanwhile in Canada, climate education is widely seen as lacking and inconsistent. A study on secondary school curriculums last year found the majority of students were not being taught about the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change. Many textbooks are outdated and do not reflect the current scientific data. For instance, Manitoba's climate curriculum was published in 2001.</p><p>\"I'm part of a generation that didn't really learn a lot about climate change in school,\" says Talia Smith, who graduated from Oak Park High School in Winnipeg in 2014.</p><p>Even Rundle, who is a current high school student, says \"I only really started learning about climate change when I was 14, which I think is far too late.\"</p><p>The new climate change curricula being developed also focus on collective activism and individual lifestyle changes in response to eco-anxiety. As Yellowknife's Courtney Howard has experienced first hand, \"action feels better than anxiety.\"</p><p>This is also why students at Malvern Collegiate have been organizing their own beach clean-ups, fundraising for koalas in the Australian bushfires and tracking the school's waste management. As well, Rundle has given up meat this year, is avoiding fast fashion, limiting her water and electricity use and is trying to use public transit more often.</p><p>Joining the fight against climate change has helped some students feel better about the future, but others say the task feels daunting.</p><p>\"It can feel very overwhelming and exhausting to try and tackle climate change as just one person facing a global problem,\" says Winnipeg's Smith.</p><p>Likewise, Buchwald says she was excited when her family began composting. But then she realized her neighbours were not, and that her university definitely wasn't and the restaurant she works at combines recycled bottles with garbage at the end of each night. This is an \"overwhelming feeling,\" she says.</p><p>Such feelings of helplessness are why experts warn against letting anxiety lead to burnout.

Eco-anxiety leads to intense feelings of stress, fear and grief in reaction to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, some countries are introducing more targeted climate curricula. But that movement is slow to arrive in Canada.</p><p>\"I first became aware of eco-anxiety when it happened to me,\" says Howard, an emergency doctor in the Northwest Territories. She began dealing with crippling anxiety after educating herself about the state of our planet in 2012.</p><p>\"I finished reading Bill McKibben's 'Global Warming's Terrifying New Math' in the fetal position, curled up around my eight-month-old daughter, thinking climate change is going to change her life.\"</p><p>Today she has transformed that fear into action, speaking out about her experience with eco-anxiety and advocating for the expansion of climate education.</p><p>Eco-anxiety was first defined in 2017 by the American Psychological Association as \"a chronic fear of environmental doom.\" The condition can be debilitating, emotionally exhausting and lead to depression, loneliness, lethargy and feelings of helplessness. \"I didn't know anyone else feeling this way and was incredibly lonely,\" says Howard. \"It impacted my daily function a lot.\"</p><p>Eco-anxiety presents itself differently from other forms of anxiety, says Niki Harre, a psychology professor at the University of Auckland. It is less individual; instead, it is a fear for the collective future.</p><p>The phenomenon is relatively new, and the term eco-anxiety is not yet commonplace, says Harre, even among people who are experiencing it. While there is no clinical diagnosis, the trend is definitely becoming more and more clear, and young people are most at risk.</p><p>Rachael Buchwald, a 20-year-old student at the University of Manitoba, says her eco-anxiety has increased in the last year. She did study climate change when she was younger but has only recently begun to feel \"just how overwhelming of an issue climate change really is.\"</p><p>Buchwald describes completing a Grade 5 project on ecological sustainability as just another part of the curriculum.</p><p>\"I don't think I really understood what it all meant,\" she said, but she believes today's younger children are immersed in an environment where they are told their future is uncertain. They grow up hearing about natural disasters and some even see that devastation first hand.</p><p>That was the case in Vernon, B.C., says Julia Payson, executive director of the local Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) branch. Wildfires surrounded the town in 2018, and residents were told to stay indoors for a week because of the smoke. The CMHA's crisis line lit up.</p><p>It received calls from individuals who felt socially isolated, first responders were reporting PTSD, and many said they felt powerless and stressed. Young people were especially worried. Payson remembers her own terrified children asking: \"What's happening? How close are the fires? Why is the sky orange?\"</p><p>\"A lot of parents didn't know how to explain the fires to their kids,\" says Payson. The Vernon CMHA created a toolkit to support parents whose children were dealing with eco-anxiety. However, Canadian curricula have little to offer teachers whose students express the same concerns.</p><p>People who witness the effects of climate change up close, such as those in Vernon, face more risk of experiencing eco-anxiety. In Nunavut, elders in the community are also expressing eco-anxiety, says Howard, as they have seen the land and hunting practices change in their lifetimes.</p><p>Others experiencing more general eco-anxiety may not see the imminent risk of climate change first hand, but they often are following ecological crises closely on social media.</p><p>Today, climate change is framed as the biggest threat to biodiversity, economic growth, global health and even the human species itself. Many experts on eco-anxiety compare it with the nuclear threat for previous generations. Young people in Canada were too often left out of the nuclear conversation.</p><p>\"When parents weren't levelling with their children about the nuclear crisis, their kids lost trust in them,\" says Howard. This left a generation of young people feeling unsafe, confused and generated much stress.</p><p>Unlike the nuclear threat, however, climate change is visible daily, at least on phones and televisions. A never-ending news cycle of wildfires, flooding, heat waves and cyclones makes climate change appear more imminent than ever before for many young people.</p><p>Sarah Rundle, a Grade 11 student at Malvern Collegiate Institute in Toronto, is the president of her school's eco club. \"There has been more of a push to get involved in the fight against climate change this year than ever before,\" she says.</p><p>Rundle says students are more fearful this year. In weekly club meetings, they talk about these concerns, including whether they will be able to have children and what jobs will be available for them.</p><p>To address this type of concern, countries such as New Zealand and Italy are introducing climate change curriculums, which try to address eco-anxiety. The idea is to emphasize the science behind climate change, while presenting strategies to better manage eco-anxiety.</p><p>In New Zealand, middle-school students are now being taught climate science, current international responses, local implications and how to join climate change movements. They are also encouraged to keep a \" feelings thermometer\" to track their emotions in a curriculum developed in collaboration with scientists and psychologists.</p><p>\"The curriculum includes important tools for managing eco-anxiety,\" says Jackie Feather, a psychologist and senior lecturer at the Auckland University of Technology. \"When students understand the science behind climate change it helps ease their anxiety,\" she says.</p><p>Mental health tools in the new curriculum encourage students to acknowledge and cope with difficult emotions around climate change, and a new Wellbeing Guide teaches mindfulness, to \"check in with your values\" and be grateful.</p><p>Meanwhile in Canada, climate education is widely seen as lacking and inconsistent. A study on secondary school curriculums last year found the majority of students were not being taught about the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change. Many textbooks are outdated and do not reflect the current scientific data. For instance, Manitoba's climate curriculum was published in 2001.</p><p>\"I'm part of a generation that didn't really learn a lot about climate change in school,\" says Talia Smith, who graduated from Oak Park High School in Winnipeg in 2014.</p><p>Even Rundle, who is a current high school student, says \"I only really started learning about climate change when I was 14, which I think is far too late.\"</p><p>The new climate change curricula being developed also focus on collective activism and individual lifestyle changes in response to eco-anxiety. As Yellowknife's Courtney Howard has experienced first hand, \"action feels better than anxiety.\"</p><p>This is also why students at Malvern Collegiate have been organizing their own beach clean-ups, fundraising for koalas in the Australian bushfires and tracking the school's waste management. As well, Sarah Rundle has given up meat this year, is avoiding fast fashion, limiting her water and electricity use and is trying to use public transit more often.</p><p>Joining the fight against climate change has helped some students feel better about the future, but others say the task feels daunting.</p><p>\"It can feel very overwhelming and exhausting to try and tackle climate change as just one person facing a global problem,\" says Winnipeg's Smith.</p><p>Likewise, Buchwald says she was excited when her family began composting. But then she realized her neighbours were not, and that her university definitely wasn't and the restaurant she works at combines recycled bottles with garbage at the end of each night. This is an \"overwhelming feeling,\" she says.</p><p>Such feelings of helplessness are why experts warn against letting anxiety lead to burnout. When Howard first got involved in climate activism, she says, \"I was completely driven by anxiety instead of strategy.\" Today, she says \"if you want to make change, you have to be quite centred in your emotions.\"</p><p>Howard's involvement in the climate movement helped her feel less alone and find people in her community who were experiencing the same feelings of eco-anxiety.</p><p>Feather emphasizes that when it comes to anxiety, \"it's what you do with that anxiety that is important.\"</p><p>\"Anxiety is not necessarily a bad thing; it is a natural reaction to a threat,\" says Feather.

However, Canadian curricula have little to offer teachers whose students express the same concerns.</p><p>People who witness the effects of climate change up close, such as those in Vernon, face more risk of experiencing eco-anxiety. In Nunavut, elders in the community are also expressing eco-anxiety, says Howard, as they have seen the land and hunting practices change in their lifetimes.</p><p>Today, climate change is framed as the biggest threat to biodiversity, economic growth, global health and even the human species itself. Many experts on eco-anxiety compare it with the nuclear threat for previous generations. Young people in Canada were too often left out of the nuclear conversation.</p><p>\"When parents weren't levelling with their children about the nuclear crisis, their kids lost trust in them,\" says Howard. This left a generation of young people feeling unsafe, confused and generated much stress.</p><p>Unlike the nuclear threat, however, climate change is visible daily, at least on phones and televisions. A never-ending news cycle of wildfires, flooding, heat waves and cyclones makes climate change appear more imminent than ever before for many young people.</p><p>Sarah Rundle, a Grade 11 student at Malvern Collegiate Institute in Toronto, is the president of her school's eco club. \"There has been more of a push to get involved in the fight against climate change this year than ever before,\" she says.</p><p>Rundle says students are more fearful this year. In weekly club meetings, they talk about these concerns, including whether they will be able to have children and what jobs will be available for them.</p><p>To address this type of concern, countries such as New Zealand and Italy are introducing climate change curriculums, which try to address eco-anxiety. The idea is to emphasize the science behind climate change, while presenting strategies to better manage eco-anxiety.</p><p>In New Zealand, middle-school students are now being taught climate science, current international responses, local implications and how to join climate change movements. They are also encouraged to keep a \"feelings thermometer\" to track their emotions in a curriculum developed in collaboration with scientists and psychologists.</p><p>Mental health tools in the new curriculum encourage students to acknowledge and cope with difficult emotions around climate change, and a new Wellbeing Guide teaches mindfulness, to \"check in with your values\" and be grateful.</p><p>Meanwhile in Canada, climate education is widely seen as lacking and inconsistent. A study on secondary school curriculums last year found the majority of students were not being taught about the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change. Many textbooks are outdated and do not reflect the current scientific data. For instance, Manitoba's climate curriculum was published in 2001.</p><p>\"I'm part of a generation that didn't really learn a lot about climate change in school,\" says Talia Smith, who graduated from Oak Park High School in Winnipeg in 2014.</p><p>Even Rundle, who is a current high school student, says \"I only really started learning about climate change when I was 14, which I think is far too late.\"</p><p>The new climate change curricula being developed also focus on collective activism and individual lifestyle changes in response to eco-anxiety. As Yellowknife's Courtney Howard has experienced first hand, \"action feels better than anxiety.\"</p><p>This is also why students at Malvern Collegiate have been organizing their own beach cleanups, fundraising for koalas in the Australian bushfires and tracking the school's waste management. As well, Rundle has given up meat this year, is avoiding fast fashion, limiting her water and electricity use and is trying to use public transit more often.</p><p>Joining the fight against climate change has helped some students feel better about the future, but others say the task feels daunting.</p><p>\"It can feel very overwhelming and exhausting to try and tackle climate change as just one person facing a global problem,\" says Winnipeg's Smith.</p><p>Likewise, Buchwald says she was excited when her family began composting. But then she realized her neighbours were not, and that her university definitely wasn't and the restaurant she works at combines recycled bottles with garbage at the end of each night. This is an \"overwhelming feeling,\" she says.</p><p>Such feelings of helplessness are why experts warn against letting anxiety lead to burnout. When Howard first got involved in climate activism, she says, \"I was completely driven by anxiety instead of strategy.\" Today, she says \"if you want to make change, you have to be quite centred in your emotions.\"</p><p>Howard's involvement in the climate movement helped her feel less alone and find people in her community who were experiencing the same feelings of eco-anxiety.</p><p>Feather emphasizes that when it comes to anxiety, \"it's what you do with that anxiety that is important.\"</p><p>\"Anxiety is not necessarily a bad thing; it is a natural reaction to a threat,\" says Feather. Eco-anxiety is therefore a rational response, not something to suppress or ignore.</p><p>Payson, of the Canadian Mental Health Association, says \"stress can be a good motivator but if we maintain it for too long, it turns into distress and starts to impair us.\"</p><p>When she works with individuals experiencing eco-anxiety, she emphasizes \"that we have to take care of ourselves and we have to find ways to practise self-compassion.\"</p><p>Another important tool for managing eco-anxiety is ensuring correct resources are used, which means better media literacy for young people immersed in social media.</p><p>With little formal climate education in Canada, many young people instead rely on their own research to inform their opinions, the majority of which comes from social media.</p><p>This can be a great tool for young people to follow what is happening globally, like the fires in Australia, but it can also spread false information.</p><p>Exaggerated, overly dramatic or inaccurate news spreads quickly on social media and can have harmful impacts on people's mental health. Headlines claiming there are \"only five years left to save the planet\" can be especially terrifying to children.</p><p>Buchwald says the children she babysits often show her alarmist and unverifiable news on Instagram.</p><p>Howard says education in Canada needs \"to respect our children enough to be honest with them about the challenges we are facing.\"</p><p>Natasha Comeau is a Fellow in Global Journalism at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

Web links to longer stories if available.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">12:03 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed faith in the young people of today to face the myriad challenges facing Canada and world, comparing them to the generation who came of age during the Second World War.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The comments came in a speech delivered Wednesday at Carleton University and carried live to graduates across the country whose graduation ceremonies have been affected by COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world is facing an unprecedented number of challenges, including climate change, racism and the pandemic, all of which have caused levels of upheaval not seen in generations, Trudeau said.</p><p>\"No student gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but if you could - and let's be honest here - you probably wouldn't have chosen the world of 2020,\" Trudeau said, according to prepared remarks.</p><p>\"The Australian bushfires linked to climate change. The horrific plane crash in Iran. The worst mass shooting in our country's history. Horrifying scenes of police violence against Black and Indigenous people. And of course, the reason why we're gathered here virtually and not in person - COVID-19, which has triggered the greatest health and economic crisis in generations.\"</p><p>11:05 a.m. In a time of social distancing, Friday's remembrance of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre will be different from years past, but church bells will still sound, rainbow flags will still wave, and the 49 individuals who lost their lives will not be forgotten.</p><p>The onePULSE Foundation, which has organized a remembrance ceremony each year and is raising money for a permanent memorial and museum, will close the interim memorial site on South Orange Avenue on Friday to allow family members of the 49 victims, survivors and first responders to pay tribute privately.</p><p>At 7 p.m. Friday, the onePULSE Foundation will stream a pre-taped ceremony on its Facebook page and YouTube channel. The program includes the reading of the 49 names by family members and remarks from Barbara Poma, the nightclub's former owner and now CEO of onePULSE Foundation, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings and onePULSE Foundation board chairman Earl Crittenden.</p><p>10:57 a.m. The U.S.'s largest owner of malls is backing out of a $3.6 billion deal to buy a major rival as the coronavirus pandemic shakes the retail economy.</p><p>It is the second major retail deal that was signed just before the pandemic hit the U.S. to crumble. The sale of Victoria's Secret to a private equity group fell apart last month.</p><p>In early February, Simon Property Group said it would buy Taubman Centers, just weeks before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a California patient was being treated for coronavirus, the first known case in the U.S.</p><p>The plunge in sales for retailers since then has been unprecedented. J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J.Crew, have all filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p><p>10:55 a.m. An 18-year-old from Mississauga behind a crowdsourcing website that maps COVID-19 hot spots in Canada is now helping Somalia gather information about the virus.</p><p>Shrey Jain, who with fellow U of T students created the flatten.ca virus-tracking website in March, is part of a team that has developed a similar Internet-based survey tool rolled out Monday in Mogadishu.</p><p>More than 400 volunteers began going door to door in the capital, asking questions not only to gauge knowledge about the virus and symptoms, but also to collect mobility data as well as socio-economic and demographic information about households.</p><p>Read full story from the Star's Patty Winsa here.</p><p>10:22 a.m. Ethiopia's prime minister faces an extra year or more in office after lawmakers voted Wednesday to extend their mandates and hold the national election nine to 12 months after health authorities determine it's safe.</p><p>Some in the opposition have objected to delaying the vote for the coronavirus as no one knows when the pandemic will end or whether the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will seek further postponements.</p><p>10:06 a.m. The top U.S. infectious disease specialist called the coronavirus pandemic his \"worst nightmare\" and warned that the deadly outbreak is far from over.</p><p>In just a few months, COVID-19 has devastated countries around the world, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday in online comments to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group.</p><p>Societies, businesses and economies have all suffered as people have sequestered themselves to prevent the spread of the virus and inundation of health systems with severely ill patients. Now that some nations and states are emerging from lockdowns, there's still a risk that the virus will also return, Fauci said.</p><p>The infection won't \"burn itself out with mere public health measures,\" he said. \"We're going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses.\"</p><p>9:49 a.m. Major League Soccer will return to action July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament that will run through Aug. 11 in the Orlando area.</p><p>All 26 teams will take part in the \"MLS is Back Tournament\" at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p><p>The NBA is also looking to resume play at the Disney complex.</p><p>The 54-match MLS tournament, which will be played before empty stands, marks a resumption to the league's 25th season, which was halted March 12 after two rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Read full story here.</p><p>9:47 a.m. The Liberals are pushing forward with a contentious piece of emergency legislation that would extend COVID-19 aid programs even though Opposition parties appear unlikely to allow it to move forward quickly.</p><p>Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the bill is the quickest and most efficient way to get help to some of the most vulnerable Canadians impacted by the pandemic, and he hopes the other parties will give unanimous consent to allow the bill to be debated today.</p><p>The bill would bring in a number of promised measures, including benefits for Canadians with disabilities and expansion of the wage-subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>But it would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - a move that appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>9:37 a.m. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, says the World Health Organization had to backtrack on its statement about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus being rare because that simply \"was not correct.\"</p><p>WHO's technical lead on the pandemic has tried to clear up \"misunderstandings\" about comments she made that were widely understood to suggest that people without COVID-19 symptoms rarely transmit the virus. Maria Van Kerkhove insisted Tuesday that she was referring only to a few studies, not a complete picture.</p><p>Weighing in on Wednesday, Fauci said the range of ways symptoms manifest is \"extraordinary\" in that some infected people have no or barely noticeable symptoms while others have more severe symptoms that require them to be hospitalized in intensive care.</p><p>9:15 a.m. COVID-19 infections in younger people are on the rise in certain hotspots across the GTA and Hamilton, according to provincial data, medical officers and researchers - especially in Toronto and Peel, both of which have seen a recent increase in reported cases among 20-somethings in recent weeks.</p><p>Public health units are now investigating this emerging trend to better understand what's driving this apparent demographic shift in the province's COVID epidemic, which is now largely centred in the GTA.</p><p>While some suspect it could reflect a change in testing patterns, medical officers and health workers are pointing to other factors like workplace outbreaks, housing arrangements and lockdown fatigue coupled with an \"invincible\" attitude amongst younger people who might feel insulated from COVID's worst effects - even though deaths and severe outcomes have been reported in these age groups across the province.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's Jennifer Yang, Megan Ogilvie, May Warren and Andrew Bailey</p><p>8:18 a.m. Parliament's spending watchdog will detail today the possible costs associated with extending and changing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p><p>Budget officer Yves Giroux's report scheduled to be released this morning comes as the House of Commons is set to discuss proposed changes to the COVID-19 pandemic-related aid.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that his government wants to rework how it doles out the $2,000-a-month benefit and get more people back to work, while also cracking down on fraud.</p><p>The most recent federal figures show 8.41 million people have applied for the CERB, with $43.51 billion in payments made as of June 4.</p><p>7:08 a.m. Manchester United abruptly cancelled one of its friendly matches ahead of the resumption of the Premier League after the opposing team's manager tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Michael O'Neill, the manager of second-tier Stoke City, had tested negative in five previous rounds of COVID-19 checks before a positive result came from a test administered on Monday.</p><p>Stoke had been scheduled to play United in a friendly at the Premier League team's Carrington training centre on Tuesday, the day O'Neill learned of the positive test. The game was immediately called off.</p><p>O'Neill was never on site at United's training centre. Players and staff of Stoke had arrived and were located in a separate building to their United counterparts, in accordance with protocol, when news of the positive test came through.</p><p>The two squads reportedly had not interacted or come into contact with each other by the time Stoke left.</p><p>6:15 a.m.: The number of coronavirus cases in India continued to rapidly increase Wednesday, with officials reporting nearly 10,000 new cases over the past 24 hours.</p><p>The spike has come as the government moves forward with reopening restaurants, shopping malls and religious places in most of its states after a more than two-month-old lockdown.</p><p>The government has already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Subways, hotels and schools and colleges, however, remain shuttered nationwide.</p><p>The Health Ministry on Wednesday reported an 24-hour increase of 9,985 cases and 274 deaths. India has recorded 276,583 positive cases, the fifth highest in the world, and 7,745 deaths.</p><p>The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be fair higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing.</p><p>6:11 a.m.: Africa's coronavirus cases have surpassed 200,000. That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The 54-nation continent has 202,782 cases and 5,516 deaths.</p><p>While Africa still represents a tiny percentage of the world's total COVID-19 cases, well under 5%, officials in South Africa and elsewhere have expressed concern as the number of infections continues to climb.</p><p>South Africa leads the continent with 52,991 cases, with almost two-thirds of them in the Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town.</p><p>Egypt has 36,829 cases and Nigeria has 13,464.</p><p>6:10 a.m.: Germany is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August.</p><p>The government agreed Wednesday to extend the guidance introduced on March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak.</p><p>Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.</p><p>4 a.m.: The non-partisan spirit that has allowed Parliament to swiftly pass emergency legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic seems likely to come to an abrupt end today.</p><p>And that could leave in limbo a number of promised measures, including benefits for disabled Canadians and expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>The Trudeau government's latest bill - which would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>Without unanimous consent, the government will not be able to pass the bill this afternoon after just a few hours of debate, as it has done with four previous pandemic-related bills.</p><p>Tuesday 7:15 p.m.: Michael Ford is the first Toronto city councillor to test positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The 26-year-old Ward 1 Etobicoke North representative, a nephew of Premier Doug Ford, confirmed his diagnosis in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>\"This morning I was made aware that I have tested positive for COVID-19,\" he wrote. \"I have been self-isolating and will continue to do so over the next 14 days as I work from home to participate virtually in city business and committee meetings, and to continue serving the residents of Etobicoke North.</p><p>\"I am feeling well and will continue to remain in constant contact with Toronto Public Health.\"</p><p>Ford did not say what prompted the test or if he knows how he was infected. He did not immediately return a call from the Star on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The youngest member of council, he was elected at age 22 in 2016 and the ward that was previously held by his late uncle Rob Ford.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's David Rider.</p><p>Tuesday 6:20 p.m.: Ontario's regional health units reported fewer than 300 new COVID-19 infections Tuesday as the province's average for daily reported cases has fallen to the lowest level since before the epidemic first peaked in April, according to the Star's latest count.</p><p>Since last Tuesday, Ontario has seen an average of 348 cases reported each day, the lowest for any seven-day period since April 2, a time when case counts were still growing rapidly ahead of the pandemic's worst weeks in the province.</p><p>The rate of new cases has fallen even including nearly 300 old but previously unreported infections that were added to the tally this week several days after not being initially reported to Toronto Public Health.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the health units had reported a total of 32,894 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,519 deaths, up a total of 282 new cases since Monday evening - a relatively low one-day total.</p><p>And, as has been the case this month, the overwhelming majority of new infections came in the GTA. The region's five health units saw a total of 214 new cases; the rest of Ontario reported 68.</p><p>The 12 new fatal cases reported Monday were also down from recent trends and considerably below from the height of the pandemic from late April to early May, when the province saw as many as 90 deaths in a day.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the province also reported that 600 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 116 in intensive care, of whom 88 are on a ventilator - numbers that have fallen sharply since early May.</p><p>The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day.

Web links to longer stories if available.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">12:03 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed faith in the young people of today to face the myriad challenges facing Canada and world, comparing them to the generation who came of age during the Second World War.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The comments came in a speech delivered Wednesday at Carleton University and carried live to graduates across the country whose graduation ceremonies have been affected by COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world is facing an unprecedented number of challenges, including climate change, racism and the pandemic, all of which have caused levels of upheaval not seen in generations, Trudeau said.</p><p>\"No student gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but if you could - and let's be honest here - you probably wouldn't have chosen the world of 2020,\" Trudeau said, according to prepared remarks.</p><p>\"The Australian bushfires linked to climate change. The horrific plane crash in Iran. The worst mass shooting in our country's history. Horrifying scenes of police violence against Black and Indigenous people. And of course, the reason why we're gathered here virtually and not in person - COVID-19, which has triggered the greatest health and economic crisis in generations.\"</p><p>11:51 a.m. Effective July 2, wearing a non-medical mask or face covering will be mandatory when travelling on Mississauga's MiWay, at stops and transit terminals to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Children under the age of two, people with disabilities or other medical conditions that prevent them from wearing any mask will not be required to wear one. Fare collection and front door boarding for all customers will also resume on July 2.</p><p>\"To help keep our riders and drivers safe and following the strong recommendation of Peel Public Health and the Governments of Ontario and Canada, we will be mandating transit riders to wear masks while riding MiWay,\" said Mayor Bonnie Crombie. \"Additional safety measures, including the installation of plexiglass barriers, will enable us to resume fare collection and front door boarding next month. These measures will help our City recover much-needed revenue as a result of this crisis while ensuring the safety of riders. We are taking a thoughtful and phased approach to recovery that prioritizes health and safety, and reduces the risk of a second wave.\"</p><p>11:05 a.m. In a time of social distancing, Friday's remembrance of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre will be different from years past, but church bells will still sound, rainbow flags will still wave, and the 49 individuals who lost their lives will not be forgotten.</p><p>The onePULSE Foundation, which has organized a remembrance ceremony each year and is raising money for a permanent memorial and museum, will close the interim memorial site on South Orange Avenue on Friday to allow family members of the 49 victims, survivors and first responders to pay tribute privately.</p><p>At 7 p.m. Friday, the onePULSE Foundation will stream a pre-taped ceremony on its Facebook page and YouTube channel. The program includes the reading of the 49 names by family members and remarks from Barbara Poma, the nightclub's former owner and now CEO of onePULSE Foundation, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings and onePULSE Foundation board chairman Earl Crittenden.</p><p>10:57 a.m. The U.S.'s largest owner of malls is backing out of a $3.6 billion deal to buy a major rival as the coronavirus pandemic shakes the retail economy.</p><p>It is the second major retail deal that was signed just before the pandemic hit the U.S. to crumble. The sale of Victoria's Secret to a private equity group fell apart last month.</p><p>In early February, Simon Property Group said it would buy Taubman Centers, just weeks before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a California patient was being treated for coronavirus, the first known case in the U.S.</p><p>The plunge in sales for retailers since then has been unprecedented. J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J.Crew, have all filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p><p>10:55 a.m. An 18-year-old from Mississauga behind a crowdsourcing website that maps COVID-19 hot spots in Canada is now helping Somalia gather information about the virus.</p><p>Shrey Jain, who with fellow U of T students created the flatten.ca virus-tracking website in March, is part of a team that has developed a similar Internet-based survey tool rolled out Monday in Mogadishu.</p><p>More than 400 volunteers began going door to door in the capital, asking questions not only to gauge knowledge about the virus and symptoms, but also to collect mobility data as well as socio-economic and demographic information about households.</p><p>Read full story from the Star's Patty Winsa here.</p><p>10:22 a.m. Ethiopia's prime minister faces an extra year or more in office after lawmakers voted Wednesday to extend their mandates and hold the national election nine to 12 months after health authorities determine it's safe.</p><p>Some in the opposition have objected to delaying the vote for the coronavirus as no one knows when the pandemic will end or whether the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will seek further postponements.</p><p>10:06 a.m. The top U.S. infectious disease specialist called the coronavirus pandemic his \"worst nightmare\" and warned that the deadly outbreak is far from over.</p><p>In just a few months, COVID-19 has devastated countries around the world, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday in online comments to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group.</p><p>Societies, businesses and economies have all suffered as people have sequestered themselves to prevent the spread of the virus and inundation of health systems with severely ill patients. Now that some nations and states are emerging from lockdowns, there's still a risk that the virus will also return, Fauci said.</p><p>The infection won't \"burn itself out with mere public health measures,\" he said. \"We're going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses.\"</p><p>9:49 a.m. Major League Soccer will return to action July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament that will run through Aug. 11 in the Orlando area.</p><p>All 26 teams will take part in the \"MLS is Back Tournament\" at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p><p>The NBA is also looking to resume play at the Disney complex.</p><p>The 54-match MLS tournament, which will be played before empty stands, marks a resumption to the league's 25th season, which was halted March 12 after two rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Read full story here.</p><p>9:47 a.m. The Liberals are pushing forward with a contentious piece of emergency legislation that would extend COVID-19 aid programs even though Opposition parties appear unlikely to allow it to move forward quickly.</p><p>Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the bill is the quickest and most efficient way to get help to some of the most vulnerable Canadians impacted by the pandemic, and he hopes the other parties will give unanimous consent to allow the bill to be debated today.</p><p>The bill would bring in a number of promised measures, including benefits for Canadians with disabilities and expansion of the wage-subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>But it would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - a move that appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>9:37 a.m. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, says the World Health Organization had to backtrack on its statement about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus being rare because that simply \"was not correct.\"</p><p>WHO's technical lead on the pandemic has tried to clear up \"misunderstandings\" about comments she made that were widely understood to suggest that people without COVID-19 symptoms rarely transmit the virus. Maria Van Kerkhove insisted Tuesday that she was referring only to a few studies, not a complete picture.</p><p>Weighing in on Wednesday, Fauci said the range of ways symptoms manifest is \"extraordinary\" in that some infected people have no or barely noticeable symptoms while others have more severe symptoms that require them to be hospitalized in intensive care.</p><p>9:15 a.m. COVID-19 infections in younger people are on the rise in certain hotspots across the GTA and Hamilton, according to provincial data, medical officers and researchers - especially in Toronto and Peel, both of which have seen a recent increase in reported cases among 20-somethings in recent weeks.</p><p>Public health units are now investigating this emerging trend to better understand what's driving this apparent demographic shift in the province's COVID epidemic, which is now largely centred in the GTA.</p><p>While some suspect it could reflect a change in testing patterns, medical officers and health workers are pointing to other factors like workplace outbreaks, housing arrangements and lockdown fatigue coupled with an \"invincible\" attitude amongst younger people who might feel insulated from COVID's worst effects - even though deaths and severe outcomes have been reported in these age groups across the province.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's Jennifer Yang, Megan Ogilvie, May Warren and Andrew Bailey</p><p>8:18 a.m. Parliament's spending watchdog will detail today the possible costs associated with extending and changing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p><p>Budget officer Yves Giroux's report scheduled to be released this morning comes as the House of Commons is set to discuss proposed changes to the COVID-19 pandemic-related aid.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that his government wants to rework how it doles out the $2,000-a-month benefit and get more people back to work, while also cracking down on fraud.</p><p>The most recent federal figures show 8.41 million people have applied for the CERB, with $43.51 billion in payments made as of June 4.</p><p>7:08 a.m. Manchester United abruptly cancelled one of its friendly matches ahead of the resumption of the Premier League after the opposing team's manager tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Michael O'Neill, the manager of second-tier Stoke City, had tested negative in five previous rounds of COVID-19 checks before a positive result came from a test administered on Monday.</p><p>Stoke had been scheduled to play United in a friendly at the Premier League team's Carrington training centre on Tuesday, the day O'Neill learned of the positive test. The game was immediately called off.</p><p>O'Neill was never on site at United's training centre. Players and staff of Stoke had arrived and were located in a separate building to their United counterparts, in accordance with protocol, when news of the positive test came through.</p><p>The two squads reportedly had not interacted or come into contact with each other by the time Stoke left.</p><p>6:15 a.m.: The number of coronavirus cases in India continued to rapidly increase Wednesday, with officials reporting nearly 10,000 new cases over the past 24 hours.</p><p>The spike has come as the government moves forward with reopening restaurants, shopping malls and religious places in most of its states after a more than two-month-old lockdown.</p><p>The government has already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Subways, hotels and schools and colleges, however, remain shuttered nationwide.</p><p>The Health Ministry on Wednesday reported an 24-hour increase of 9,985 cases and 274 deaths. India has recorded 276,583 positive cases, the fifth highest in the world, and 7,745 deaths.</p><p>The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be fair higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing.</p><p>6:11 a.m.: Africa's coronavirus cases have surpassed 200,000. That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The 54-nation continent has 202,782 cases and 5,516 deaths.</p><p>While Africa still represents a tiny percentage of the world's total COVID-19 cases, well under 5%, officials in South Africa and elsewhere have expressed concern as the number of infections continues to climb.</p><p>South Africa leads the continent with 52,991 cases, with almost two-thirds of them in the Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town.</p><p>Egypt has 36,829 cases and Nigeria has 13,464.</p><p>6:10 a.m.: Germany is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August.</p><p>The government agreed Wednesday to extend the guidance introduced on March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak.</p><p>Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.</p><p>4 a.m.: The non-partisan spirit that has allowed Parliament to swiftly pass emergency legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic seems likely to come to an abrupt end today.</p><p>And that could leave in limbo a number of promised measures, including benefits for disabled Canadians and expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>The Trudeau government's latest bill - which would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>Without unanimous consent, the government will not be able to pass the bill this afternoon after just a few hours of debate, as it has done with four previous pandemic-related bills.</p><p>Tuesday 7:15 p.m.: Michael Ford is the first Toronto city councillor to test positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The 26-year-old Ward 1 Etobicoke North representative, a nephew of Premier Doug Ford, confirmed his diagnosis in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>\"This morning I was made aware that I have tested positive for COVID-19,\" he wrote. \"I have been self-isolating and will continue to do so over the next 14 days as I work from home to participate virtually in city business and committee meetings, and to continue serving the residents of Etobicoke North.</p><p>\"I am feeling well and will continue to remain in constant contact with Toronto Public Health.\"</p><p>Ford did not say what prompted the test or if he knows how he was infected. He did not immediately return a call from the Star on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The youngest member of council, he was elected at age 22 in 2016 and the ward that was previously held by his late uncle Rob Ford.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's David Rider.</p><p>Tuesday 6:20 p.m.: Ontario's regional health units reported fewer than 300 new COVID-19 infections Tuesday as the province's average for daily reported cases has fallen to the lowest level since before the epidemic first peaked in April, according to the Star's latest count.</p><p>Since last Tuesday, Ontario has seen an average of 348 cases reported each day, the lowest for any seven-day period since April 2, a time when case counts were still growing rapidly ahead of the pandemic's worst weeks in the province.</p><p>The rate of new cases has fallen even including nearly 300 old but previously unreported infections that were added to the tally this week several days after not being initially reported to Toronto Public Health.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the health units had reported a total of 32,894 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,519 deaths, up a total of 282 new cases since Monday evening - a relatively low one-day total.</p><p>And, as has been the case this month, the overwhelming majority of new infections came in the GTA. The region's five health units saw a total of 214 new cases; the rest of Ontario reported 68.</p><p>The 12 new fatal cases reported Monday were also down from recent trends and considerably below from the height of the pandemic from late April to early May, when the province saw as many as 90 deaths in a day.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the province also reported that 600 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 116 in intensive care, of whom 88 are on a ventilator - numbers that have fallen sharply since early May.</p><p>The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths - 2,464 - may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, \"data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.\"</p><p>The Star's count includes some patients reported as \"probable\" COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020061058146855</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603N-NNB1-F103-3545-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Web links to longer stories if available.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1:24 p.m. In a news conference at Queen's Park, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and provincial cabinet ministers Christine Elliott (health) and Ross Romano (colleges and universities) provide an update on their government's response to the ongoing COVID-19. Watch below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">12:03 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed faith in the young people of today to face the myriad challenges facing Canada and world, comparing them to the generation who came of age during the Second World War.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The comments came in a speech delivered Wednesday at Carleton University and carried live to graduates across the country whose graduation ceremonies have been affected by COVID-19.</p><p>The world is facing an unprecedented number of challenges, including climate change, racism and the pandemic, all of which have caused levels of upheaval not seen in generations, Trudeau said.</p><p>\"No student gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but if you could - and let's be honest here - you probably wouldn't have chosen the world of 2020,\" Trudeau said, according to prepared remarks.</p><p>\"The Australian bushfires linked to climate change. The horrific plane crash in Iran. The worst mass shooting in our country's history. Horrifying scenes of police violence against Black and Indigenous people. And of course, the reason why we're gathered here virtually and not in person - COVID-19, which has triggered the greatest health and economic crisis in generations.\"</p><p>11:51 a.m. Effective July 2, wearing a non-medical mask or face covering will be mandatory when travelling on Mississauga's MiWay, at stops and transit terminals to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Children under the age of two, people with disabilities or other medical conditions that prevent them from wearing any mask will not be required to wear one. Fare collection and front door boarding for all customers will also resume on July 2.</p><p>\"To help keep our riders and drivers safe and following the strong recommendation of Peel Public Health and the Governments of Ontario and Canada, we will be mandating transit riders to wear masks while riding MiWay,\" said Mayor Bonnie Crombie. \"Additional safety measures, including the installation of plexiglass barriers, will enable us to resume fare collection and front door boarding next month. These measures will help our City recover much-needed revenue as a result of this crisis while ensuring the safety of riders. We are taking a thoughtful and phased approach to recovery that prioritizes health and safety, and reduces the risk of a second wave.\"</p><p>11:05 a.m. In a time of social distancing, Friday's remembrance of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre will be different from years past, but church bells will still sound, rainbow flags will still wave, and the 49 individuals who lost their lives will not be forgotten.</p><p>The onePULSE Foundation, which has organized a remembrance ceremony each year and is raising money for a permanent memorial and museum, will close the interim memorial site on South Orange Avenue on Friday to allow family members of the 49 victims, survivors and first responders to pay tribute privately.</p><p>At 7 p.m. Friday, the onePULSE Foundation will stream a pre-taped ceremony on its Facebook page and YouTube channel. The program includes the reading of the 49 names by family members and remarks from Barbara Poma, the nightclub's former owner and now CEO of onePULSE Foundation, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings and onePULSE Foundation board chairman Earl Crittenden.</p><p>10:57 a.m. The U.S.'s largest owner of malls is backing out of a $3.6 billion deal to buy a major rival as the coronavirus pandemic shakes the retail economy.</p><p>It is the second major retail deal that was signed just before the pandemic hit the U.S. to crumble. The sale of Victoria's Secret to a private equity group fell apart last month.</p><p>In early February, Simon Property Group said it would buy Taubman Centers, just weeks before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a California patient was being treated for coronavirus, the first known case in the U.S.</p><p>The plunge in sales for retailers since then has been unprecedented. J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J.Crew, have all filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p><p>10:55 a.m. An 18-year-old from Mississauga behind a crowdsourcing website that maps COVID-19 hot spots in Canada is now helping Somalia gather information about the virus.</p><p>Shrey Jain, who with fellow U of T students created the flatten.ca virus-tracking website in March, is part of a team that has developed a similar Internet-based survey tool rolled out Monday in Mogadishu.</p><p>More than 400 volunteers began going door to door in the capital, asking questions not only to gauge knowledge about the virus and symptoms, but also to collect mobility data as well as socio-economic and demographic information about households.</p><p>Read full story from the Star's Patty Winsa here.</p><p>10:22 a.m. Ethiopia's prime minister faces an extra year or more in office after lawmakers voted Wednesday to extend their mandates and hold the national election nine to 12 months after health authorities determine it's safe.</p><p>Some in the opposition have objected to delaying the vote for the coronavirus as no one knows when the pandemic will end or whether the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will seek further postponements.</p><p>10:06 a.m. The top U.S. infectious disease specialist called the coronavirus pandemic his \"worst nightmare\" and warned that the deadly outbreak is far from over.</p><p>In just a few months, COVID-19 has devastated countries around the world, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday in online comments to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group.</p><p>Societies, businesses and economies have all suffered as people have sequestered themselves to prevent the spread of the virus and inundation of health systems with severely ill patients. Now that some nations and states are emerging from lockdowns, there's still a risk that the virus will also return, Fauci said.</p><p>The infection won't \"burn itself out with mere public health measures,\" he said. \"We're going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses.\"</p><p>9:49 a.m. Major League Soccer will return to action July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament that will run through Aug. 11 in the Orlando area.</p><p>All 26 teams will take part in the \"MLS is Back Tournament\" at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p><p>The NBA is also looking to resume play at the Disney complex.</p><p>The 54-match MLS tournament, which will be played before empty stands, marks a resumption to the league's 25th season, which was halted March 12 after two rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Read full story here.</p><p>9:47 a.m. The Liberals are pushing forward with a contentious piece of emergency legislation that would extend COVID-19 aid programs even though Opposition parties appear unlikely to allow it to move forward quickly.</p><p>Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the bill is the quickest and most efficient way to get help to some of the most vulnerable Canadians impacted by the pandemic, and he hopes the other parties will give unanimous consent to allow the bill to be debated today.</p><p>The bill would bring in a number of promised measures, including benefits for Canadians with disabilities and expansion of the wage-subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>But it would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - a move that appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>9:37 a.m. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, says the World Health Organization had to backtrack on its statement about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus being rare because that simply \"was not correct.\"</p><p>WHO's technical lead on the pandemic has tried to clear up \"misunderstandings\" about comments she made that were widely understood to suggest that people without COVID-19 symptoms rarely transmit the virus. Maria Van Kerkhove insisted Tuesday that she was referring only to a few studies, not a complete picture.</p><p>Weighing in on Wednesday, Fauci said the range of ways symptoms manifest is \"extraordinary\" in that some infected people have no or barely noticeable symptoms while others have more severe symptoms that require them to be hospitalized in intensive care.</p><p>9:15 a.m. COVID-19 infections in younger people are on the rise in certain hotspots across the GTA and Hamilton, according to provincial data, medical officers and researchers - especially in Toronto and Peel, both of which have seen a recent increase in reported cases among 20-somethings in recent weeks.</p><p>Public health units are now investigating this emerging trend to better understand what's driving this apparent demographic shift in the province's COVID epidemic, which is now largely centred in the GTA.</p><p>While some suspect it could reflect a change in testing patterns, medical officers and health workers are pointing to other factors like workplace outbreaks, housing arrangements and lockdown fatigue coupled with an \"invincible\" attitude amongst younger people who might feel insulated from COVID's worst effects - even though deaths and severe outcomes have been reported in these age groups across the province.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's Jennifer Yang, Megan Ogilvie, May Warren and Andrew Bailey</p><p>8:18 a.m. Parliament's spending watchdog will detail today the possible costs associated with extending and changing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p><p>Budget officer Yves Giroux's report scheduled to be released this morning comes as the House of Commons is set to discuss proposed changes to the COVID-19 pandemic-related aid.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that his government wants to rework how it doles out the $2,000-a-month benefit and get more people back to work, while also cracking down on fraud.</p><p>The most recent federal figures show 8.41 million people have applied for the CERB, with $43.51 billion in payments made as of June 4.</p><p>7:08 a.m. Manchester United abruptly cancelled one of its friendly matches ahead of the resumption of the Premier League after the opposing team's manager tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Michael O'Neill, the manager of second-tier Stoke City, had tested negative in five previous rounds of COVID-19 checks before a positive result came from a test administered on Monday.</p><p>Stoke had been scheduled to play United in a friendly at the Premier League team's Carrington training centre on Tuesday, the day O'Neill learned of the positive test. The game was immediately called off.</p><p>O'Neill was never on site at United's training centre. Players and staff of Stoke had arrived and were located in a separate building to their United counterparts, in accordance with protocol, when news of the positive test came through.</p><p>The two squads reportedly had not interacted or come into contact with each other by the time Stoke left.</p><p>6:15 a.m.: The number of coronavirus cases in India continued to rapidly increase Wednesday, with officials reporting nearly 10,000 new cases over the past 24 hours.</p><p>The spike has come as the government moves forward with reopening restaurants, shopping malls and religious places in most of its states after a more than two-month-old lockdown.</p><p>The government has already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Subways, hotels and schools and colleges, however, remain shuttered nationwide.</p><p>The Health Ministry on Wednesday reported an 24-hour increase of 9,985 cases and 274 deaths. India has recorded 276,583 positive cases, the fifth highest in the world, and 7,745 deaths.</p><p>The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be fair higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing.</p><p>6:11 a.m.: Africa's coronavirus cases have surpassed 200,000. That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The 54-nation continent has 202,782 cases and 5,516 deaths.</p><p>While Africa still represents a tiny percentage of the world's total COVID-19 cases, well under 5%, officials in South Africa and elsewhere have expressed concern as the number of infections continues to climb.</p><p>South Africa leads the continent with 52,991 cases, with almost two-thirds of them in the Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town.</p><p>Egypt has 36,829 cases and Nigeria has 13,464.</p><p>6:10 a.m.: Germany is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August.</p><p>The government agreed Wednesday to extend the guidance introduced on March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak.</p><p>Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.</p><p>4 a.m.: The non-partisan spirit that has allowed Parliament to swiftly pass emergency legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic seems likely to come to an abrupt end today.</p><p>And that could leave in limbo a number of promised measures, including benefits for disabled Canadians and expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>The Trudeau government's latest bill - which would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>Without unanimous consent, the government will not be able to pass the bill this afternoon after just a few hours of debate, as it has done with four previous pandemic-related bills.</p><p>Tuesday 7:15 p.m.: Michael Ford is the first Toronto city councillor to test positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The 26-year-old Ward 1 Etobicoke North representative, a nephew of Premier Doug Ford, confirmed his diagnosis in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>\"This morning I was made aware that I have tested positive for COVID-19,\" he wrote. \"I have been self-isolating and will continue to do so over the next 14 days as I work from home to participate virtually in city business and committee meetings, and to continue serving the residents of Etobicoke North.</p><p>\"I am feeling well and will continue to remain in constant contact with Toronto Public Health.\"</p><p>Ford did not say what prompted the test or if he knows how he was infected. He did not immediately return a call from the Star on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The youngest member of council, he was elected at age 22 in 2016 and the ward that was previously held by his late uncle Rob Ford.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's David Rider.</p><p>Tuesday 6:20 p.m.: Ontario's regional health units reported fewer than 300 new COVID-19 infections Tuesday as the province's average for daily reported cases has fallen to the lowest level since before the epidemic first peaked in April, according to the Star's latest count.</p><p>Since last Tuesday, Ontario has seen an average of 348 cases reported each day, the lowest for any seven-day period since April 2, a time when case counts were still growing rapidly ahead of the pandemic's worst weeks in the province.</p><p>The rate of new cases has fallen even including nearly 300 old but previously unreported infections that were added to the tally this week several days after not being initially reported to Toronto Public Health.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the health units had reported a total of 32,894 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,519 deaths, up a total of 282 new cases since Monday evening - a relatively low one-day total.</p><p>And, as has been the case this month, the overwhelming majority of new infections came in the GTA. The region's five health units saw a total of 214 new cases; the rest of Ontario reported 68.</p><p>The 12 new fatal cases reported Monday were also down from recent trends and considerably below from the height of the pandemic from late April to early May, when the province saw as many as 90 deaths in a day.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the province also reported that 600 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 116 in intensive care, of whom 88 are on a ventilator - numbers that have fallen sharply since early May.</p><p>The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths - 2,464 - may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, \"data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.\"</p><p>The Star's count includes some patients reported as \"probable\" COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020061058147296</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603N-NNB1-F103-354F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

I also want to thank all Ontarians who are working together to fight COVID-19.\"</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's Robert Benzie here.</p><p>1:37 p.m. The Star's Queen's Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie reports that Premier Doug Ford and Health Minister Christine Elliott cancelled their press conference today after Education Minister Stephen Lecce came in contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19. More to come.</p><p>1:34 p.m. The top doctor in Windsor-Essex says the region has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases among agri-food workers in recent days.</p><p>The medical officer of health reported today that 38 additional workers had tested positive for the virus.</p><p>On Tuesday, the health unit reported 34 new cases among workers.</p><p>Dr. Wajid Ahmed says more than 200 agri-food workers in the region have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>He says that of those cases, about 90 per cent are temporary foreign workers.</p><p>Ahmed says the health unit is working with the province to address the spike in cases.</p><p>1:24 p.m. In a news conference at Queen's Park, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and provincial cabinet ministers Christine Elliott and Ross Romano provide an update on the government's response to COVID-19. Watch below.</p><p>12:03 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed faith in the young people of today to face the myriad challenges facing Canada and world, comparing them to the generation who came of age during the Second World War.</p><p>The comments came in a speech delivered Wednesday at Carleton University and carried live to graduates across the country whose graduation ceremonies have been affected by COVID-19.</p><p>The world is facing an unprecedented number of challenges, including climate change, racism and the pandemic, all of which have caused levels of upheaval not seen in generations, Trudeau said.</p><p>\"No student gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but if you could - and let's be honest here - you probably wouldn't have chosen the world of 2020,\" Trudeau said, according to prepared remarks.</p><p>\"The Australian bushfires linked to climate change. The horrific plane crash in Iran. The worst mass shooting in our country's history. Horrifying scenes of police violence against Black and Indigenous people. And of course, the reason why we're gathered here virtually and not in person - COVID-19, which has triggered the greatest health and economic crisis in generations.\"</p><p>11:51 a.m. Effective July 2, wearing a non-medical mask or face covering will be mandatory when travelling on Mississauga's MiWay, at stops and transit terminals to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Children under the age of two, people with disabilities or other medical conditions that prevent them from wearing any mask will not be required to wear one. Fare collection and front door boarding for all customers will also resume on July 2.</p><p>\"To help keep our riders and drivers safe and following the strong recommendation of Peel Public Health and the Governments of Ontario and Canada, we will be mandating transit riders to wear masks while riding MiWay,\" said Mayor Bonnie Crombie. \"Additional safety measures, including the installation of plexiglass barriers, will enable us to resume fare collection and front door boarding next month. These measures will help our City recover much-needed revenue as a result of this crisis while ensuring the safety of riders. We are taking a thoughtful and phased approach to recovery that prioritizes health and safety, and reduces the risk of a second wave.\"</p><p>11:05 a.m. In a time of social distancing, Friday's remembrance of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre will be different from years past, but church bells will still sound, rainbow flags will still wave, and the 49 individuals who lost their lives will not be forgotten.</p><p>The onePULSE Foundation, which has organized a remembrance ceremony each year and is raising money for a permanent memorial and museum, will close the interim memorial site on South Orange Avenue on Friday to allow family members of the 49 victims, survivors and first responders to pay tribute privately.</p><p>At 7 p.m. Friday, the onePULSE Foundation will stream a pre-taped ceremony on its Facebook page and YouTube channel. The program includes the reading of the 49 names by family members and remarks from Barbara Poma, the nightclub's former owner and now CEO of onePULSE Foundation, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings and onePULSE Foundation board chairman Earl Crittenden.</p><p>10:57 a.m. The U.S.'s largest owner of malls is backing out of a $3.6 billion deal to buy a major rival as the coronavirus pandemic shakes the retail economy.</p><p>It is the second major retail deal that was signed just before the pandemic hit the U.S. to crumble. The sale of Victoria's Secret to a private equity group fell apart last month.</p><p>In early February, Simon Property Group said it would buy Taubman Centers, just weeks before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a California patient was being treated for coronavirus, the first known case in the U.S.</p><p>The plunge in sales for retailers since then has been unprecedented. J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J.Crew, have all filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p><p>10:55 a.m. An 18-year-old from Mississauga behind a crowdsourcing website that maps COVID-19 hot spots in Canada is now helping Somalia gather information about the virus.</p><p>Shrey Jain, who with fellow U of T students created the flatten.ca virus-tracking website in March, is part of a team that has developed a similar Internet-based survey tool rolled out Monday in Mogadishu.</p><p>More than 400 volunteers began going door to door in the capital, asking questions not only to gauge knowledge about the virus and symptoms, but also to collect mobility data as well as socio-economic and demographic information about households.</p><p>Read full story from the Star's Patty Winsa here.</p><p>10:22 a.m. Ethiopia's prime minister faces an extra year or more in office after lawmakers voted Wednesday to extend their mandates and hold the national election nine to 12 months after health authorities determine it's safe.</p><p>Some in the opposition have objected to delaying the vote for the coronavirus as no one knows when the pandemic will end or whether the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will seek further postponements.</p><p>10:06 a.m. The top U.S. infectious disease specialist called the coronavirus pandemic his \"worst nightmare\" and warned that the deadly outbreak is far from over.</p><p>In just a few months, COVID-19 has devastated countries around the world, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday in online comments to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group.</p><p>Societies, businesses and economies have all suffered as people have sequestered themselves to prevent the spread of the virus and inundation of health systems with severely ill patients. Now that some nations and states are emerging from lockdowns, there's still a risk that the virus will also return, Fauci said.</p><p>The infection won't \"burn itself out with mere public health measures,\" he said. \"We're going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses.\"</p><p>9:49 a.m. Major League Soccer will return to action July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament that will run through Aug. 11 in the Orlando area.</p><p>All 26 teams will take part in the \"MLS is Back Tournament\" at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p><p>The NBA is also looking to resume play at the Disney complex.</p><p>The 54-match MLS tournament, which will be played before empty stands, marks a resumption to the league's 25th season, which was halted March 12 after two rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Read full story here.</p><p>9:47 a.m. The Liberals are pushing forward with a contentious piece of emergency legislation that would extend COVID-19 aid programs even though Opposition parties appear unlikely to allow it to move forward quickly.</p><p>Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the bill is the quickest and most efficient way to get help to some of the most vulnerable Canadians impacted by the pandemic, and he hopes the other parties will give unanimous consent to allow the bill to be debated today.</p><p>The bill would bring in a number of promised measures, including benefits for Canadians with disabilities and expansion of the wage-subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>But it would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - a move that appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>9:37 a.m. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, says the World Health Organization had to backtrack on its statement about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus being rare because that simply \"was not correct.\"</p><p>WHO's technical lead on the pandemic has tried to clear up \"misunderstandings\" about comments she made that were widely understood to suggest that people without COVID-19 symptoms rarely transmit the virus. Maria Van Kerkhove insisted Tuesday that she was referring only to a few studies, not a complete picture.</p><p>Weighing in on Wednesday, Fauci said the range of ways symptoms manifest is \"extraordinary\" in that some infected people have no or barely noticeable symptoms while others have more severe symptoms that require them to be hospitalized in intensive care.</p><p>9:15 a.m. COVID-19 infections in younger people are on the rise in certain hotspots across the GTA and Hamilton, according to provincial data, medical officers and researchers - especially in Toronto and Peel, both of which have seen a recent increase in reported cases among 20-somethings in recent weeks.</p><p>Public health units are now investigating this emerging trend to better understand what's driving this apparent demographic shift in the province's COVID epidemic, which is now largely centred in the GTA.</p><p>While some suspect it could reflect a change in testing patterns, medical officers and health workers are pointing to other factors like workplace outbreaks, housing arrangements and lockdown fatigue coupled with an \"invincible\" attitude amongst younger people who might feel insulated from COVID's worst effects - even though deaths and severe outcomes have been reported in these age groups across the province.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's Jennifer Yang, Megan Ogilvie, May Warren and Andrew Bailey</p><p>8:18 a.m. Parliament's spending watchdog will detail today the possible costs associated with extending and changing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p><p>Budget officer Yves Giroux's report scheduled to be released this morning comes as the House of Commons is set to discuss proposed changes to the COVID-19 pandemic-related aid.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that his government wants to rework how it doles out the $2,000-a-month benefit and get more people back to work, while also cracking down on fraud.</p><p>The most recent federal figures show 8.41 million people have applied for the CERB, with $43.51 billion in payments made as of June 4.</p><p>7:08 a.m. Manchester United abruptly cancelled one of its friendly matches ahead of the resumption of the Premier League after the opposing team's manager tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Michael O'Neill, the manager of second-tier Stoke City, had tested negative in five previous rounds of COVID-19 checks before a positive result came from a test administered on Monday.</p><p>Stoke had been scheduled to play United in a friendly at the Premier League team's Carrington training centre on Tuesday, the day O'Neill learned of the positive test. The game was immediately called off.</p><p>O'Neill was never on site at United's training centre. Players and staff of Stoke had arrived and were located in a separate building to their United counterparts, in accordance with protocol, when news of the positive test came through.</p><p>The two squads reportedly had not interacted or come into contact with each other by the time Stoke left.</p><p>6:15 a.m.: The number of coronavirus cases in India continued to rapidly increase Wednesday, with officials reporting nearly 10,000 new cases over the past 24 hours.</p><p>The spike has come as the government moves forward with reopening restaurants, shopping malls and religious places in most of its states after a more than two-month-old lockdown.</p><p>The government has already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Subways, hotels and schools and colleges, however, remain shuttered nationwide.</p><p>The Health Ministry on Wednesday reported an 24-hour increase of 9,985 cases and 274 deaths. India has recorded 276,583 positive cases, the fifth highest in the world, and 7,745 deaths.</p><p>The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be fair higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing.</p><p>6:11 a.m.: Africa's coronavirus cases have surpassed 200,000. That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The 54-nation continent has 202,782 cases and 5,516 deaths.</p><p>While Africa still represents a tiny percentage of the world's total COVID-19 cases, well under 5%, officials in South Africa and elsewhere have expressed concern as the number of infections continues to climb.</p><p>South Africa leads the continent with 52,991 cases, with almost two-thirds of them in the Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town.</p><p>Egypt has 36,829 cases and Nigeria has 13,464.</p><p>6:10 a.m.: Germany is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August.</p><p>The government agreed Wednesday to extend the guidance introduced on March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak.</p><p>Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.</p><p>4 a.m.: The non-partisan spirit that has allowed Parliament to swiftly pass emergency legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic seems likely to come to an abrupt end today.</p><p>And that could leave in limbo a number of promised measures, including benefits for disabled Canadians and expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>The Trudeau government's latest bill - which would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>Without unanimous consent, the government will not be able to pass the bill this afternoon after just a few hours of debate, as it has done with four previous pandemic-related bills.</p><p>Tuesday 7:15 p.m.: Michael Ford is the first Toronto city councillor to test positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The 26-year-old Ward 1 Etobicoke North representative, a nephew of Premier Doug Ford, confirmed his diagnosis in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>\"This morning I was made aware that I have tested positive for COVID-19,\" he wrote. \"I have been self-isolating and will continue to do so over the next 14 days as I work from home to participate virtually in city business and committee meetings, and to continue serving the residents of Etobicoke North.</p><p>\"I am feeling well and will continue to remain in constant contact with Toronto Public Health.\"</p><p>Ford did not say what prompted the test or if he knows how he was infected. He did not immediately return a call from the Star on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The youngest member of council, he was elected at age 22 in 2016 and the ward that was previously held by his late uncle Rob Ford.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's David Rider.</p><p>Tuesday 6:20 p.m.: Ontario's regional health units reported fewer than 300 new COVID-19 infections Tuesday as the province's average for daily reported cases has fallen to the lowest level since before the epidemic first peaked in April, according to the Star's latest count.</p><p>Since last Tuesday, Ontario has seen an average of 348 cases reported each day, the lowest for any seven-day period since April 2, a time when case counts were still growing rapidly ahead of the pandemic's worst weeks in the province.</p><p>The rate of new cases has fallen even including nearly 300 old but previously unreported infections that were added to the tally this week several days after not being initially reported to Toronto Public Health.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the health units had reported a total of 32,894 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,519 deaths, up a total of 282 new cases since Monday evening - a relatively low one-day total.</p><p>And, as has been the case this month, the overwhelming majority of new infections came in the GTA. The region's five health units saw a total of 214 new cases; the rest of Ontario reported 68.</p><p>The 12 new fatal cases reported Monday were also down from recent trends and considerably below from the height of the pandemic from late April to early May, when the province saw as many as 90 deaths in a day.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the province also reported that 600 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 116 in intensive care, of whom 88 are on a ventilator - numbers that have fallen sharply since early May.</p><p>The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths - 2,464 - may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, \"data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.\"</p><p>The Star's count includes some patients reported as \"probable\" COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020061058147878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603N-NNB1-F103-3550-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths - 2,475 - may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, \"data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.\"</p><p>The Star's count includes some patients reported as \"probable\" COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.</p><p>12:03 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed faith in the young people of today to face the myriad challenges facing Canada and world, comparing them to the generation who came of age during the Second World War.</p><p>The comments came in a speech delivered Wednesday at Carleton University and carried live to graduates across the country whose graduation ceremonies have been affected by COVID-19.</p><p>The world is facing an unprecedented number of challenges, including climate change, racism and the pandemic, all of which have caused levels of upheaval not seen in generations, Trudeau said.</p><p>\"No student gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but if you could - and let's be honest here - you probably wouldn't have chosen the world of 2020,\" Trudeau said, according to prepared remarks.</p><p>\"The Australian bushfires linked to climate change. The horrific plane crash in Iran. The worst mass shooting in our country's history. Horrifying scenes of police violence against Black and Indigenous people. And of course, the reason why we're gathered here virtually and not in person - COVID-19, which has triggered the greatest health and economic crisis in generations.\"</p><p>11:51 a.m. Effective July 2, wearing a non-medical mask or face covering will be mandatory when travelling on Mississauga's MiWay, at stops and transit terminals to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Children under the age of two, people with disabilities or other medical conditions that prevent them from wearing any mask will not be required to wear one. Fare collection and front door boarding for all customers will also resume on July 2.</p><p>\"To help keep our riders and drivers safe and following the strong recommendation of Peel Public Health and the Governments of Ontario and Canada, we will be mandating transit riders to wear masks while riding MiWay,\" said Mayor Bonnie Crombie. \"Additional safety measures, including the installation of plexiglass barriers, will enable us to resume fare collection and front door boarding next month. These measures will help our City recover much-needed revenue as a result of this crisis while ensuring the safety of riders. We are taking a thoughtful and phased approach to recovery that prioritizes health and safety, and reduces the risk of a second wave.\"</p><p>11:05 a.m. In a time of social distancing, Friday's remembrance of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre will be different from years past, but church bells will still sound, rainbow flags will still wave, and the 49 individuals who lost their lives will not be forgotten.</p><p>The onePULSE Foundation, which has organized a remembrance ceremony each year and is raising money for a permanent memorial and museum, will close the interim memorial site on South Orange Avenue on Friday to allow family members of the 49 victims, survivors and first responders to pay tribute privately.</p><p>At 7 p.m. Friday, the onePULSE Foundation will stream a pre-taped ceremony on its Facebook page and YouTube channel.

Now that some nations and states are emerging from lockdowns, there's still a risk that the virus will also return, Fauci said.</p><p>The infection won't \"burn itself out with mere public health measures,\" he said. \"We're going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses.\"</p><p>9:49 a.m. Major League Soccer will return to action July 8 with a World Cup-style tournament that will run through Aug. 11 in the Orlando area.</p><p>All 26 teams will take part in the \"MLS is Back Tournament\" at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.</p><p>The NBA is also looking to resume play at the Disney complex.</p><p>The 54-match MLS tournament, which will be played before empty stands, marks a resumption to the league's 25th season, which was halted March 12 after two rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Read full story here.</p><p>9:47 a.m. The Liberals are pushing forward with a contentious piece of emergency legislation that would extend COVID-19 aid programs even though Opposition parties appear unlikely to allow it to move forward quickly.</p><p>Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says the bill is the quickest and most efficient way to get help to some of the most vulnerable Canadians impacted by the pandemic, and he hopes the other parties will give unanimous consent to allow the bill to be debated today.</p><p>The bill would bring in a number of promised measures, including benefits for Canadians with disabilities and expansion of the wage-subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>But it would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - a move that appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>9:37 a.m. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, says the World Health Organization had to backtrack on its statement about asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus being rare because that simply \"was not correct.\"</p><p>WHO's technical lead on the pandemic has tried to clear up \"misunderstandings\" about comments she made that were widely understood to suggest that people without COVID-19 symptoms rarely transmit the virus. Maria Van Kerkhove insisted Tuesday that she was referring only to a few studies, not a complete picture.</p><p>Weighing in on Wednesday, Fauci said the range of ways symptoms manifest is \"extraordinary\" in that some infected people have no or barely noticeable symptoms while others have more severe symptoms that require them to be hospitalized in intensive care.</p><p>9:15 a.m. COVID-19 infections in younger people are on the rise in certain hotspots across the GTA and Hamilton, according to provincial data, medical officers and researchers - especially in Toronto and Peel, both of which have seen a recent increase in reported cases among 20-somethings in recent weeks.</p><p>Public health units are now investigating this emerging trend to better understand what's driving this apparent demographic shift in the province's COVID epidemic, which is now largely centred in the GTA.</p><p>While some suspect it could reflect a change in testing patterns, medical officers and health workers are pointing to other factors like workplace outbreaks, housing arrangements and lockdown fatigue coupled with an \"invincible\" attitude amongst younger people who might feel insulated from COVID's worst effects - even though deaths and severe outcomes have been reported in these age groups across the province.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's Jennifer Yang, Megan Ogilvie, May Warren and Andrew Bailey</p><p>8:18 a.m. Parliament's spending watchdog will detail today the possible costs associated with extending and changing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p><p>Budget officer Yves Giroux's report scheduled to be released this morning comes as the House of Commons is set to discuss proposed changes to the COVID-19 pandemic-related aid.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that his government wants to rework how it doles out the $2,000-a-month benefit and get more people back to work, while also cracking down on fraud.</p><p>The most recent federal figures show 8.41 million people have applied for the CERB, with $43.51 billion in payments made as of June 4.</p><p>7:08 a.m. Manchester United abruptly cancelled one of its friendly matches ahead of the resumption of the Premier League after the opposing team's manager tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>Michael O'Neill, the manager of second-tier Stoke City, had tested negative in five previous rounds of COVID-19 checks before a positive result came from a test administered on Monday.</p><p>Stoke had been scheduled to play United in a friendly at the Premier League team's Carrington training centre on Tuesday, the day O'Neill learned of the positive test. The game was immediately called off.</p><p>O'Neill was never on site at United's training centre. Players and staff of Stoke had arrived and were located in a separate building to their United counterparts, in accordance with protocol, when news of the positive test came through.</p><p>The two squads reportedly had not interacted or come into contact with each other by the time Stoke left.</p><p>6:15 a.m.: The number of coronavirus cases in India continued to rapidly increase Wednesday, with officials reporting nearly 10,000 new cases over the past 24 hours.</p><p>The spike has come as the government moves forward with reopening restaurants, shopping malls and religious places in most of its states after a more than two-month-old lockdown.</p><p>The government has already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Subways, hotels and schools and colleges, however, remain shuttered nationwide.</p><p>The Health Ministry on Wednesday reported an 24-hour increase of 9,985 cases and 274 deaths. India has recorded 276,583 positive cases, the fifth highest in the world, and 7,745 deaths.</p><p>The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be fair higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing.</p><p>6:11 a.m.: Africa's coronavirus cases have surpassed 200,000. That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The 54-nation continent has 202,782 cases and 5,516 deaths.</p><p>While Africa still represents a tiny percentage of the world's total COVID-19 cases, well under 5%, officials in South Africa and elsewhere have expressed concern as the number of infections continues to climb.</p><p>South Africa leads the continent with 52,991 cases, with almost two-thirds of them in the Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town.</p><p>Egypt has 36,829 cases and Nigeria has 13,464.</p><p>6:10 a.m.: Germany is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August.</p><p>The government agreed Wednesday to extend the guidance introduced on March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak.</p><p>Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.</p><p>4 a.m.: The non-partisan spirit that has allowed Parliament to swiftly pass emergency legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic seems likely to come to an abrupt end today.</p><p>And that could leave in limbo a number of promised measures, including benefits for disabled Canadians and expansion of the wage subsidy program to include seasonal workers and some additional businesses.</p><p>The Trudeau government's latest bill - which would also impose penalties for fraudulently claiming the Canada Emergency Response Benefit - appears to have no support among the main opposition parties.</p><p>Without unanimous consent, the government will not be able to pass the bill this afternoon after just a few hours of debate, as it has done with four previous pandemic-related bills.</p><p>Tuesday 7:15 p.m.: Michael Ford is the first Toronto city councillor to test positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The 26-year-old Ward 1 Etobicoke North representative, a nephew of Premier Doug Ford, confirmed his diagnosis in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>\"This morning I was made aware that I have tested positive for COVID-19,\" he wrote. \"I have been self-isolating and will continue to do so over the next 14 days as I work from home to participate virtually in city business and committee meetings, and to continue serving the residents of Etobicoke North.</p><p>\"I am feeling well and will continue to remain in constant contact with Toronto Public Health.\"</p><p>Ford did not say what prompted the test or if he knows how he was infected. He did not immediately return a call from the Star on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The youngest member of council, he was elected at age 22 in 2016 and the ward that was previously held by his late uncle Rob Ford.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's David Rider.</p><p>Tuesday 6:20 p.m.: Ontario's regional health units reported fewer than 300 new COVID-19 infections Tuesday as the province's average for daily reported cases has fallen to the lowest level since before the epidemic first peaked in April, according to the Star's latest count.</p><p>Since last Tuesday, Ontario has seen an average of 348 cases reported each day, the lowest for any seven-day period since April 2, a time when case counts were still growing rapidly ahead of the pandemic's worst weeks in the province.</p><p>The rate of new cases has fallen even including nearly 300 old but previously unreported infections that were added to the tally this week several days after not being initially reported to Toronto Public Health.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the health units had reported a total of 32,894 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,519 deaths, up a total of 282 new cases since Monday evening - a relatively low one-day total.</p><p>And, as has been the case this month, the overwhelming majority of new infections came in the GTA.

He did not immediately return a call from the Star on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The youngest member of council, he was elected at age 22 in 2016 and the ward that was previously held by his late uncle Rob Ford.</p><p>Read the full story from the Star's David Rider.</p><p>Tuesday 6:20 p.m.: Ontario's regional health units reported fewer than 300 new COVID-19 infections Tuesday as the province's average for daily reported cases has fallen to the lowest level since before the epidemic first peaked in April, according to the Star's latest count.</p><p>Since last Tuesday, Ontario has seen an average of 348 cases reported each day, the lowest for any seven-day period since April 2, a time when case counts were still growing rapidly ahead of the pandemic's worst weeks in the province.</p><p>The rate of new cases has fallen even including nearly 300 old but previously unreported infections that were added to the tally this week several days after not being initially reported to Toronto Public Health.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the health units had reported a total of 32,894 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,519 deaths, up a total of 282 new cases since Monday evening - a relatively low one-day total.</p><p>And, as has been the case this month, the overwhelming majority of new infections came in the GTA. The region's five health units saw a total of 214 new cases; the rest of Ontario reported 68.</p><p>The 12 new fatal cases reported Monday were also down from recent trends and considerably below from the height of the pandemic from late April to early May, when the province saw as many as 90 deaths in a day.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the province also reported that 600 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 116 in intensive care, of whom 88 are on a ventilator - numbers that have fallen sharply since early May.</p><p>The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths - 2,464 - may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, \"data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.\"</p><p>The Star's count includes some patients reported as \"probable\" COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020061058150183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603S-P7S1-F103-30KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5923\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The Company's expected financial performance for fiscal 2020 is specifically based on assumptions about the successful execution of its business plan, the contribution of recent acquisitions, the capacity of the Company to generate operational efficiencies and revenues, the general economic conditions and the competitive environment within the dairy industry, the anticipated market supply and demand levels for dairy products, the availability and cost of milk as raw material, the anticipated warehousing, logistical and transportation costs, the anticipated cost of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) program, the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the currencies of the other countries where the Company is operating, and the anticipated international and domestic selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients.

The Canada Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Canada), the USA Sector consists of the Cheese Division (USA) and the Dairy Foods Division (USA), the International Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Australia) and the Dairy Division (Argentina) and the Europe Sector consists of the Dairy Division (UK).</p><p>Consolidated revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $3.891 billion, an increase of $313.6 million or 8.8%, as compared to $3.577 billion for the same quarter last fiscal year. The inclusion of the Dairy Crest Acquisition, the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition, for nine weeks, and the activities of F&amp;A Dairy Products, Inc. (F&amp;A Acquisition) contributed positively to revenues. The combined effect of a higher average block market** per pound of cheese and the fluctuation of the average butter market** price per pound increased revenues by approximately $148 million. The devaluation of the Argentine peso and the Australian dollar versus the US dollar in the export market had a positive impact on revenues. Additionally, higher international selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients, a favourable product mix, as well as higher domestic selling prices in the International Sector due to the increased cost of milk as raw material, positively impacted revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes as a result of competitive market conditions in the fluid milk category in Canada and in the cheese category in the USA, and the decline of raw milk availability in Australia. The fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar decreased revenues by approximately $81 million, mainly in the International Sector.</p><p>For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, revenues totalled $11.225 billion, an increase of $959.4 million or 9.3%, as compared to $10.265 billion for the same period last fiscal year. Revenues increased due to the contribution of recent acquisitions, including $534.5 million from the Dairy Crest Acquisition for the 37-week period ended December 31, 2019. The combined effect of a higher average block market per pound of cheese and the fluctuation of the butter market price per pound increased revenues by approximately $277 million. The devaluation of the Argentine peso and the Australian dollar versus the US dollar in the export market had a positive impact on revenues. Additionally, higher international selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients, a favourable product mix, as well as higher domestic selling prices in the Canada and International Sectors due to the increased cost of milk as raw material, positively impacted revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes as a result of competitive market conditions in Canada, mainly in the fluid milk category, and the decline of raw milk availability in Australia. Finally, the fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar decreased revenues by approximately $221 million, mainly in the International Sector and partially offset by the USA Sector.</p><p>Consolidated adjusted EBITDA* for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $417.0 million, an increase of $95.8 million or 29.8%, as compared to $321.2 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. The contribution of the Dairy Crest Acquisition increased adjusted EBITDA by $34.7 million, and the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition also contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. In addition, pricing initiatives in the USA Sector positively affected adjusted EBITDA through a better alignment of selling prices with costs related to warehousing, delivery and logistics. USA Market Factors had a positive effect of approximately $14 million. Furthermore, higher international dairy ingredient and cheese market prices also positively impacted adjusted EBITDA. Despite lower sales volumes, product mix optimization and improved operational efficiencies favourably impacted adjusted EBITDA. The adoption of IFRS 16, Leases positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $16 million. The fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $15 million, mainly in the International Sector.</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. ** Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, consolidated adjusted EBITDA totalled $1.169 billion, an increase of $223.2 million or 23.6%, as compared to $946.2 million for the same period last fiscal year. The contribution of the Dairy Crest Acquisition, for the 37-week period ended December 31, 2019, increased adjusted EBITDA by $96.5 million. Also, adjusted EBITDA increased due to the contribution of recent acquisitions for the full period, as compared to partial contributions for the same period last fiscal year, and the contribution of the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition for nine weeks in the period. Pricing initiatives in the USA Sector also positively affected adjusted EBITDA through a better alignment of selling prices with costs related to warehousing, delivery and logistics. The positive effect of higher international dairy ingredient and cheese market prices was partially offset by lower sales volumes of fluid milk in Canada, as a result of competitive market conditions. Despite lower sales volumes following the decline of raw milk availability in Australia, product mix optimization favourably impacted adjusted EBITDA. USA Market Factors also had a favourable impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $16 million. Furthermore, improved operational efficiencies positively impacted adjusted EBITDA. The adoption of IFRS 16, Leases positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $47 million. Lastly, the fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar had an unfavourable impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $33 million, mainly in the International Sector and partially offset by the USA Sector.</p><p>Depreciation and amortization for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $121.8 million, an increase of $41.1 million, as compared to $80.7 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $339.4 million, an increase of $107.5 million, as compared to $231.9 million for the same period last fiscal year. These increases were mainly attributable to additional depreciation and amortization related to recent acquisitions and to additions to property, plant and equipment, which increased the depreciable base. Also, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, depreciation of right-of-use assets represented an increase of approximately $13 million and $38 million for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, respectively.</p><p>Inventory revaluation resulting from a business acquisition for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, amounted to nil and $40.1 million, respectively. These revaluations were related to the Dairy Crest Acquisition, stemming from added value attributed to the acquired inventory as part of the purchase price allocation, and were fully amortized in the income statement as at September 30, 2019.</p><p>Acquisition costs for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, amounted to $9.4 million and $32.2 million, respectively. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, acquisition costs were mainly related to the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition, including approximately $9 million in stamp duty taxes. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, acquisition costs were mainly related to the Dairy Crest Acquisition and the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition.</p><p>Net interest expense for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, increased by $13.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods last fiscal year. These increases were mainly attributed to additional debt related to the Dairy Crest Acquisition and the Speciality Cheese Business Acquisition as well as higher bank loans denominated in Argentine peso, which bear higher interest rates. Also, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, interest expenses on lease liabilities pertaining to right-of-use assets represented an increase of approximately $4 million and $12 million, respectively.</p><p>In accordance with IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy since July 1, 2018. For the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, the gain on hyperinflation totalled $7.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively. These gains were derived from the indexation of non-monetary assets and liabilities.</p><p>Income tax expense for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $61.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.6% compared to 20.8% for the same quarter last fiscal year. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.7 million related to a tax inflation adjustment pursuant to an Argentine tax legislation, as amended. Excluding the effects of the tax inflation adjustment in Argentina and the gain on disposal of assets realized during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, would have been 26.2% and 26.8%, respectively. Income tax expense for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $173.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.0% as compared to 22.7% for the same period last fiscal year. Excluding the effects of the tax inflation adjustment in Argentina, the gain realized on disposal of assets and acquisition costs for both periods, the effective tax rates for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, would have been 26.4% and 26.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate varies and could increase or decrease based on the amount and source of taxable income, amendments to tax legislations and income tax rates, changes in assumptions, as well as estimates used for the computation of tax assets and liabilities by the Company and its affiliates.</p><p>Net earnings for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $197.8 million, a decrease of $144.2 million or 42.2%, as compared to $342.0 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, net earnings totalled $494.1 million, a decrease of $137.0 million or 21.7%, as compared to $631.1 million for the same period last fiscal year. These decreases were mainly due to the after-tax gain of $167.8 million on the sale of its facility in Burnaby, British Columbia, recorded in fiscal 2019.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings* for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $204.2 million, an increase of $29.8 million or 17.1%, as compared to $174.4 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, adjusted net earnings totalled $554.9 million, an increase of $57.1 million or 11.5%, as compared to $497.8 million for the same period last fiscal year. These increases were due to the above-mentioned factors.</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION //st (in millions of CDN dollars, except per share amounts) Fiscal years 2020 2019 2018</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Revenues 3,890.8 3,665.6 3,668.4 3,236.5 3,577.2 3,420.4 3,267.8 2,744.4 Adjusted 417.0 394.4 358.0 275.1 321.2 317.5 307.5 261.7 EBITDA* Net earnings 197.8 174.9 121.4 124.2 342.0 163.1 126.0 130.0 Gain on - - - - (167.8) - - - disposal of assets1 Inventory - 10.5 22.0 - - - - - revaluation resulting from a business acquisition1 Acquisition 6.4 0.4 21.5 1.6 0.2 - 34.3 5.3 and restructuring costs1 Adjusted net 204.2 185.8 164.9 125.8 174.4 163.1 160.3 135.3 earnings* Per share Net earnings Basic 0.49 0.44 0.31 0.32 0.88 0.42 0.32 0.34 Diluted 0.48 0.44 0.31 0.32 0.87 0.42 0.32 0.33 Adjusted net earnings* Basic 0.50 0.47 0.42 0.32 0.45 0.42 0.41 0.35 Diluted 0.50 0.47 0.42 0.32 0.44 0.42 0.41 0.35 Earnings 7.53 9.77 10.76 12.69 14.20 12.57 15.37 20.83 coverage ratio**</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. ** Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 1 Net of income taxes. //st Selected factors positively (negatively) affecting financial performance (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 USA Market Factors*,1 14 10 (8) 4 (19) (7) 2 Inventory write-down - - - (2) (1) - - Foreign currency (15) (14) (4) 2 1 5 (13) exchange1, 2</p><p>* Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 1 As compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. 2 Foreign currency exchange includes effect on adjusted EBITDA of conversion of US dollars, Australian dollars, British pounds sterling and Argentine pesos to Canadian dollars.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Saputo benefits from a solid financial position and capital structure, supplemented by a high level of cash generated by operations, allowing the Company to continue to grow through targeted acquisitions and organically through strategic capital investments, innovation and product portfolio diversification. Profitability enhancement and shareholder value creation remain the cornerstones of the Company's objectives. Saputo has a long-standing commitment to manufacture quality products and will remain focused on operational efficiencies. The Company is committed to living up to the values on which its business was founded in 1954. It is these values that led to the development of the Saputo Promise - its 7-Pillar approach to social, environmental, and economic performance. With a strong foundation in place and clear strategic direction, the Company is continually looking for opportunities to improve its performance across each of the 7 Pillars: Food Quality and Safety, Our People, Business Ethics, Responsible Sourcing, Environment, Nutrition and Healthy Living, and Community. For Saputo, pursuing growth as a global dairy processor includes building a healthier future for its employees, consumers, customers, and those living in the communities where it operates. In fiscal 2020, the Company continues to focus on the execution of the Saputo Promise three-year plan launched earlier this year. As part of its efforts, Saputo intends to ramp up its commitment to responsible environmental practices with a key focus on climate, water and waste. Going forward, Saputo is committed to diversifying its product portfolio by pursuing more plant-based opportunities. The Company aims to capitalize on the growing consumer demand, and to leverage a common customer base, technology, manufacturing expertise, assets and supply chain. Saputo will look to increase its presence in this category through a series of investments in manufacturing, sales and distribution. To lead its plans, the Company has appointed a Senior Vice-President, Business Development, Plant-Based Food. For fiscal 2020, the Company continues to expect its business operations to deliver slightly higher adjusted EBITDA when compared to fiscal 2019. This excludes the positive contributions of the Dairy Crest Acquisition and the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition, as well as the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases in fiscal 2020. While benefiting from the contribution of other recent acquisitions, the Company expects to continue facing competitive market conditions in the USA, unsettled economic conditions in Argentina, volatility in international selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients, and reduced availability of raw milk due to extreme weather in Australia. The Company expects, through increased efficiencies and pricing initiatives, to mitigate the impact of elevated costs in warehousing, logistics and transportation.</p><p>Canada Sector</p><p>While the competitive Canadian landscape continues to exercise downward pressure on financial performance, market conditions continue to show signs of easing, providing the Dairy Division (Canada) with an improved outlook for capturing profitable sales volumes. The Division will keep emphasizing its specialty and value-added products for both the retail and foodservice channels while building on its customer and consumer loyalty. The Dairy Division (Canada) will also continue to focus on increasing its operational efficiency, decreasing costs and optimizing its platform through strategic investments to mitigate low growth and consistently high warehousing, logistics and transportation costs. In an effort to pursue additional efficiencies and right-size both its manufacturing footprint and sales force, Saputo will be closing its Trenton, Ontario, and Saint John, New Brunswick, facilities in Canada. These closures are scheduled in September 2020 and January 2021, respectively, and the production of both these sites will be integrated into other Saputo facilities across Canada.</p><p>USA Sector</p><p>Although improving, domestic market conditions remain challenging, resulting in an excess supply of commodity products. The USA Sector will continue to focus on increasing operational efficiencies and controlling costs to mitigate the impacts of dairy commodity market fluctuations, competitive market conditions and consistently high warehousing, logistics and transportation costs, which will continue to affect its financial performance. The Company expects cheese markets to remain firm while the dairy ingredient market is expected to remain volatile until the first half of fiscal 2021. The Cheese Division (USA) will continue to focus on increasing operational efficiencies and controlling costs in order to mitigate the effect of competitive market conditions on adjusted EBITDA. It will focus on growing its specialty and value-added products business, pursuing operational efficiencies and ensuring customer demands are met in its commodity products business.</p><p>The Dairy Foods Division (USA) will continue to optimize its national manufacturing and logistics network, as well as its systems and processes. The Division will also focus on growing its business and utilizing the increased manufacturing capacity it is adding to its network.</p><p>International Sector</p><p>The International Sector will keep pursuing sales volume growth in existing markets, as well as the development of additional international markets. The Sector will continue to focus on controlling costs, evaluating overall activities to improve efficiencies and aim to maximize its operational flexibility to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in market conditions and their impact on financial performance. The Sector will also continue to focus on innovation, and the optimization of its product mix and customer portfolios, both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Despite the devaluation of the Argentine peso, the Dairy Division (Argentina) will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions.</p><p>The Dairy Division (Australia) continues to proceed with the integration of the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition which adds to and complements its current activities.</p><p>As a result of the decrease in milk production in Australia, the Dairy Division (Australia) expects increased competition in the sourcing of raw milk to persist and to continue to put pressure on margins. As such, the Division is implementing alternate measures to mitigate these factors. It will also continue to review operations to optimize the network at its disposal and benefit from its manufacturing flexibility. The Company aims to further capture opportunities derived from the operational combination of Murray Goulburn and Warrnambool Cheese and Butter under a single platform and from the wide portfolio of Australian brands inherited through the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition.</p><p>At this time, the impact of the Australian bushfires on the Company's operations has been limited and its facilities are operating as usual. Saputo has been able to collect close to all the milk from farmers and continues to work on a variety of ongoing practical support initiatives for those suppliers that are affected. The Company has confirmed its support to disaster relief efforts through financial and product donations, and has supported employee initiatives to raise additional funds and volunteer.</p><p>For the first half of fiscal 2021, the Company expects prices to remain relatively stable in the cheese and dairy ingredient markets as there is a better equilibrium between supply and demand in the international market.</p><p>Europe Sector</p><p>For the remainder of fiscal 2020, the Company will continue its integration of the Dairy Division (UK) and focus on aligning processes, systems, and sharing best practices. The Division will pursue capital investments in its manufacturing facilities with the objective of increasing its cheesemaking capabilities and driving overall growth.</p><p>At present, the Dairy Division (UK) is a UK-focused business with a predominantly local supply chain and customer base, which mitigates the Division's exposure to risks surrounding Brexit.</p><p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program</p><p>The Company will continue planning, designing and implementing activities for the migration to the new ERP system. In the first half of calendar 2020, the Company will start the deployment of the ERP program in the remainder of the Dairy Division (Australia) to ensure its alignment under a single system and begin the subsequent phases of the implementation within the Cheese Division (USA), having recently completed the first phase. The Dairy Division (Canada) implementation will begin during calendar 2021. The Dairy Division (UK) is not currently in the scope of Saputo's global ERP program and its business will continue to operate under its existing ERP system.</p><p>Trade Agreements</p><p>The Company expects to continue making an effective use of its interim quota allocation under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and intends to focus on importing dairy products that complement the current Canadian product offering. Provided final allocations of dairy import licences are handled in a manner similar to the initial allocation, the Company does not foresee the CPTPP having significant impacts on its operations and will seek to take advantage of export opportunities arising from Australia and Canada to other signatory countries.</p><p>The North American Free Trade Agreement will remain in force until the new Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) is ratified by all three signatory countries. At this stage, Canada is the only country that has yet to complete this step. The Company does not foresee significant impacts on its operations upon formal adoption of the CUSMA, assuming the bulk of the import licences is allocated to dairy processors in Canada.</p><p>Finally, the goal remains to continue to improve overall efficiencies in all sectors, pursue growth organically and through acquisitions, and always strive to be a stronger and better operator.</p><p>INFORMATION BY SECTOR //st CANADA SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal 2020 2019 years</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 1,049.0 1,029.4 968.8 924.8 1,059.6 1,047.7 1,011.0 Adjusted 111.7 103.2 98.5 90.0 113.8 104.4 105.5 EBITDA*</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>The Canada Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Canada). //st USA SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal 2020 2019 years</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 1,848.7 1,792.4 1,757.7 1,616.6 1,678.5 1,618.0 1,594.6 Adjusted 172.1 175.4 173.6 134.2 122.4 133.8 154.3 EBITDA*</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. //st Selected factors positively (negatively) affecting financial performance (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 USA Market factors*, 1 14 10 (8) 4 (19) (7) 2 US currency exchange1 - 1 6 7 6 7 (8)</p><p>* Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 1 As compared to same quarter last fiscal year. //st Other pertinent information (in US dollars, except for average exchange rate) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Block market* price Opening 1.958 1.858 1.645 1.430 1.690 1.555 1.530 Closing 1.910 1.958 1.858 1.645 1.430 1.690 1.555 Average 1.971 1.912 1.711 1.520 1.453 1.605 1.603 Butter market* price Opening 2.128 2.410 2.255 2.218 2.320 2.268 2.215 Closing 1.950 2.128 2.410 2.255 2.218 2.320 2.268 Average 2.043 2.284 2.330 2.264 2.238 2.264 2.339 Average whey 0.326 0.352 0.370 0.443 0.452 0.387 0.279 market price per pound* Spread* (0.018) 0.029 0.061 0.054 0.021 0.095 0.135 US average 1.320 1.320 1.337 1.330 1.321 1.307 1.290 exchange rate to Canadian dollar1</p><p>* Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 1 Based on Bloomberg published information.</p><p>The USA Sector consists of the Cheese Division (USA) and the Dairy Foods Division (USA). //st INTERNATIONAL SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 797.0 657.0 790.3 695.1 839.1 754.7 662.2 Adjusted EBITDA* 98.5 80.2 59.7 50.9 85.0 79.3 47.7</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. //st Selected factors positively (negatively) affecting financial performance (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Inventory write-down - - - (2) (1) - - Foreign currency exchange1 (14) (16) (10) (3) (5) - (7)</p><p>1 As compared to same quarter last fiscal year.</p><p>The International Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Australia) and the Dairy Division (Argentina). //st EUROPE SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 196.1 186.8 151.6 - - - - Adjusted EBITDA* 34.7 35.6 26.2 - - - -</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>The Europe Sector consists of the Dairy Division (UK) following the Dairy Crest Acquisition.

Police are searching for more bodies. The speed of the fires preempted the usual well organized evacuations.By statistics, this is the worst fire in Australian history, but its also been one of the most complex and hardest to fight. </p><p>Thanks to the ongoing drought, the known risk factor for this summer was already high. Bushfires dont usually achieve this level of surprise. The sheer size of the fires, which covered hundreds of thousands of hectares, was overwhelming.The usual practice with big fires is a well organized operation, evacuations are carried out systematically, and lives are rarely lost. Australias firefighters are all highly experienced, and they know how to handle most fires, arson related or not.Not this time. A huge area went up like a match head. People whove lived through bushfires before were taken completely by surprise. Ive never even heard of a bushfire where you couldnt smell it beforehand. Fires travel downwind, and the smell of burning eucalypts is quite unmistakable. You can smell bushfires from a hundred miles away, literally.Making things much worse was the fact that people tried to drive out through the fires. According to police there are burned out cars everywhere, and these remain to be checked for fatalities. The toll could go a lot higher, if so. Police were actually issuing public warnings on TV last night not to try driving through smoke, and were told not to evacuate because of the risks.The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25026935-5001021,00.html\">fatalities</url>were met with near disbelief, then real concern. Deaths are so rare these days that the constantly increasing numbers came as a very nasty shock to the whole country.A former household name, national newsreader Brian Naylor and his wife, were killed by the fires at Kinglake.The town of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25026839-5001021,00.html\">Marysville</url> was practically obliterated. It was a pretty little town, a sort of bush village, like the early days.Police are now       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25027105-5001028,00.html\">investigating</url>all fire areas for indications of arson. There are stories emerging of people relighting fires in areas brought under control after this train wreck.The significance of this is that lighting a bush fire requires enough knowledge of what youre doing to survive doing it. You cant do it accidentally. There were no reports of lightning strikes prior to the big fires, only afterwards. An occasional fire can be started by campers, or stray cigarette butts, but those incidents are usually isolated, random things.Its being called \u0153terrorism, and thats a pretty fair description. The anger is getting as hot as the fires. Murder charges are fully justified and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/national/national/general/fire-starters-will-face-murder-charges/1428042.aspx\">are likely to happen</url>.Meanwhile, trying to help the victims is the major issue. Some really have been left with nothing.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-activates-federal-disaster-plan-to-help-victims/2009/02/08/1234027855632.html\">The Sydney Morning Herald</url> has a series of links to emergency assistance. This is the normal approach in Australia, where the news media, government and emergency services coordinate to deal with bushfires.Bushfires produce heroes with a sort of staggering frequency. These things are like napalm attacks, and it takes guts to look a fire in the face, let alone function rationally. One guy       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/daring-tractor-dash/2009/02/08/1234027855655.html\">rescued his sisters family on the back of a little tractor</url>.Bush firefighters have been known to fight fires for weeks in over 35C heat. At over 40C, the effect is continual dehydration. The fatigue factor is constant, and youll get a good idea of the kind of effort required by the size of the areas they have to cover.A cool change has made conditions at least bearable for the firefighters, but not much else.I've seen Australian bushfires where they blotted out the sun, from 40 miles away, and all you could see was a little disk of light through the smoke. There was a ground haze, covering Melbourne and Port Phillip Bay. I saw the 1994 Sydney fires, and I remember seeing something that looked like an a atomic bomb mushroom cloud in the south, where the state forest was practically wiped out.A fire that hits 220,000 hectares in about 24 hours, and a series of fires across a state the size of Texas, however, is something new.

That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire population of the European Union, and the number has been steadily rising \u2013 up 40 per cent over those two decades.  With intense, destructive fires often in the news, it can seem like more land is burning. And in parts of the world, including western North America, it is.  Globally, however, our team of fire researchers also found that the total area burned actually declined by 26% over those two decades.  How is that possible?  We found the driving reasons for those changes in Africa, which has the vast majority of all land burned, but the total burned area there has been falling. Agricultural activities in Africa are increasingly fragmenting wildland areas that are prone to burning. A cultivated farm field and roads can help stop a fire\u2019s spread. But more farms and development in wildland areas also means more people can be exposed to wildfires.  Drawing on our expertise in climate and wildfire sciences and geospatial modeling, we analyzed global wildfire activity over the past two decades. The results highlight some common misperceptions and show how the fire risk to humans is changing.  Global burned area down, intense fires up  Wildfire is a natural process that has existed for as long as vegetation has covered the Earth. Occasional fires in a forest are healthy. They clear out dead wood and leaf and branch litter, leaving less fuel for future fires to burn. That helps to keep wildfires from becoming too intense.  However, intense fires can also pose serious threats to human lives, infrastructure and economies, particularly as more people move into fire-prone areas.  North and South America have both experienced a rise in intense wildfires over the past two decades. Some notable examples include the 2018 Camp Fire in California and the 2023 record-breaking Canadian wildfires, which generated widespread smoke that blanketed large parts of Canada and the eastern United States, and even reached Europe.  The increase in intense wildfires aligns with the intensification of fire weather around the world. Heat, low humidity and strong winds can make wildfires more likely to spread and harder to control. The number of days conducive to extreme fire behaviour and new fire ignitions has increased by more than 50 per cent over the past four decades globally, elevating the odds that the amount of land burned in a particular region sets a new record.  But fire weather is not the only influence on wildfire risk. The amount of dry vegetation, and whether it\u2019s in a continuous stretch or broken up, influences fire risk. So do ignition sources, such as vehicles and power lines in wildland areas. Human activities can start fires and fuel climate change, which further dries out the land, amplifying wildfire activity. Fire suppression practices that don\u2019t allow low-intensity fires to burn can lead to the accumulation of flammable vegetation, raising the risk of intense fires.  North America is a fraction of total burned area  In recent years, a growing number of wildfire disasters in North America, Europe and Australia have captured global attention. From the deadly 2025 Los Angeles fires to the devastating 2019-2020 Australian bushfires and the 2018 wildfire in Athens, Greece, flames have increasingly encroached upon human settlements, claiming lives and livelihoods.  However, wildfire exposure isn\u2019t limited to these high-profile regions \u2212 we simply hear more about them.  The United States, Europe and Australia collectively account for less than 2.5 per cent of global human exposure to wildfire. Human exposure to fire occurs when people\u2019s homes fall directly within the area burned by a wildfire.  In stark contrast, Africa alone accounts for approximately 85% of all wildfire exposures and 65 per cent of the global burned area.  Remarkably, just five central African countries \u2013 the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola \u2013 experience half of all global human exposure to wildfires, even though they account for less than 3 per cent of the global population. These countries receive sufficient moisture to support plant growth, yet they are dry enough that trees and plants burn in frequent fires that in some places occur multiple times per year.  Regional trends and drivers of wildfire  We found that wildfire exposure increased across all continents except Europe and Oceania, but the underlying drivers of the increase varied by region.  In Africa, agricultural expansion has led to more people living in fire-prone areas.  In North America, particularly the United States, intensifying fire weather \u2013 the hot, dry, windy conditions conducive to spreading fires \u2013 has led to increasingly uncontrollable wildfires that threaten human settlements.  In South America, a combination of rising drought frequency and severity, intensifying heat waves and agricultural expansion has amplified wildfire intensity and increased the population in fire-prone regions.  In Asia, growing populations in fire-prone areas, combined with more days of fire-friendly weather, led to increased human exposure to wildfires.  In contrast, Europe and Oceania have seen declining wildfire exposures, largely due to more people moving to cities and fewer living in rural, fire-prone zones.  What to do about it  Communities can take steps to prevent destructive wildfires from spreading.  For example, vegetation management, such as prescribed fires, can avoid fuelLing intense fires. Public education, policy enforcement and engineering solutions \u2013 such as vegetation reduction and clearance along roads and power lines \u2013 can help reduce human-caused ignitions.  As climate change intensifies fire weather and people continue to move into fire-prone zones, proactive mitigation will be increasingly critical.

Flames are up to two metres high,\" the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) said in an advisory.&lt;nl/&gt;\"Homes in Salmon Gums and Grass Patch are under threat by fire now.\"&lt;nl/&gt;A bushfire emergency warning was also in place for people in the Stockyard Creek and Mullet Lakes areas around Esperance, with a fire contained but not controlled.&lt;nl/&gt;Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the government was ready to offer assistance.&lt;nl/&gt;\"Summer can be a very challenging and dangerous time in Australia as we know and this is a tragic event,\" he said.&lt;nl/&gt;\"We are obviously ready to provide assistance whenever required.\"&lt;nl/&gt;Bushfires are common in Australia's hotter months. \"Black Saturday\", the worst firestorm in recent years, devastated southern Victoria in 2009, razing thousands of homes and killing 173 people.&lt;nl/&gt;- Devastating, absolutely terrible -&lt;nl/&gt;Esperance Shire President Victoria Brown said the remote coastal community was in shock.&lt;nl/&gt;\"It was the day from hell, it was devastating,\" she told national radio. \"They got many of the fires out, but there were a few still burning, and they combined into an inferno. &lt;nl/&gt;\"This is going to have a massive impact on our community.

Even the amount of information being generated is a record. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed, historic towns have been wiped out. The fires are storming around the south east of the country.The defence force was called in when the emergency services got overloaded and sheer fatigue from not only the fires but the murderous 47C heat. Infrastructure like power lines has been destroyed, and some areas are without power. At least one primary school was also destroyed. The little town of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/marysville-almost-destroyed-in-victorian-bushfires/2009/02/08/1234027832317.html\">Maryville</url> was practically wiped off the map.Tornado victims will be able to identify with the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/photogallery/2009/02/07/1233423569062.html\">pictures</url>coming out of the areas. The ground is incinerated, the buildings look like theyve been flattened.An earlier article from The Sydney Morning Herald emphasizes the fears prior to discovering the toll the fires have taken. At that point, the first information was coming out, and injured firefighters were being sent to hospital. The police told people not to go sightseeing. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/many-may-be-trapped-in-homes/2009/02/07/1233423565321.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1\">http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/many-may-be-trapped-in-homes/2009/02/07/1233423565321.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1</url>A fire was burning near the main power station for Melbourne at Loy Yang, but soon after the horror of the toll swamped other news.The ABC has been doing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/events/bushfires/\">live coverage of the fires</url>. Its horrifying. One couple went out to do their shopping and came back to find their house gone. Another group of people had to flee from a fire which they couldnt even hear or smell.4500 firefighters, including those from other states, are fighting the fires. Just to simplify matters, two big fires have amalgamated. Lightning strikes are now being reported, which adds further problems with the dry bush being one huge fire hazard.Theres so much news its difficult to keep up with it. A zoo was evacuated. The power station is now back in the news, as firefighters try to protect it. The hospitals are on disaster alert, using methods they learned during the Bali bombings. A national appeal was launched by the Federal and Victorian governments.While I was writing this, the death toll went up to 66.

normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  Several Australian bushfires have combined to form a \"mega fire\" that is burning out of control across a swathe of land north of Sydney, authorities said Friday, warning they cannot contain the blaze.New South Wales Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers said \"there are probably more than eight fires in all\" that have merged to form what has been dubbed a \"mega fire\" in an area of national park forest.The blaze was burning across 300,000 hectares -- an area roughly 60 kilometres (37 miles) across -- within an hour's drive of Australia's largest city, which was again subsumed in a soup of toxic smoke.\"There is just fire that whole way\" said Rogers, who added that firefighters could do little more than get any residents out, protect property and hope for an end to fire-friendly dry and windy conditions.We \"cannot stop these fires, they will just keep burning until conditions ease, and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them,\" he told public broadcaster ABC.\"The best thing we can do is try to protect property and people as much as we can.\"Prolonged drought has left much of eastern Australia tinder-dry and spot fires have raged every day for the past three months.Bushfires are common in Australia but scientists say this year's season has come earlier and with more intensity due to a prolonged drought and climatic conditions fuelled by global warming.Dramatic footage of firefighters running from a wall of fire ripping through the tree canopy above them was captured overnight in Orangeville, less than 100 kilometres west of Sydney.The local fire and rescue team that shot the images said no one was injured and the vehicles surrounded by the swirling embers also survived the blaze.\"The video was put up to demonstrate why you need to listen to the fire advisory system,\" the team from Ingleburn fire station said on Facebook.\"If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and your (sic) not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away,\" they warned. </p><p>At a wildlife park in the area, 300 animals were evacuated.Walkabout Wildlife Park said it had shipped out lizards, dingoes, peacocks and marsupials, as firefighters battled more than 100 fires up and down the eastern seaboard.\"This fire has been doing some crazy things, so we have to be prepared,\" general manager Tassin Barnard told AFP.New South Wales rural fire chief Shane Fitzsimmons said some US and Canadian firefighters had arrived to help out.The specialists are expected to supervise waterbombing planes and heavy equipment used in creating fire containment lines.\"We are not only appreciative of their presence here today, but of their sacrifice,\" said Fitzsimmons -- who has become a fixture on Australian television screens for weeks, updating the public on blazes in towns, national parks and backwaters.\"They are volunteering to sacrifice time from loved ones, from families, to give up that special time of the year around Christmas and New Year to come down here and lend us a hand,\" he said.More than 600 homes have been destroyed and six people have died since the crisis began in September.That is many fewer than Australia's deadliest recent fire season in 2009 when almost 200 people died, but 2019's toll so far belies the scale of devastation.An estimated two million hectares have burned -- the size of some small countries -- across a region spanning hundreds of kilometres (miles).The fires have taken a toll in Sydney and other major cities, which have been blanketed in toxic smoke for weeks and occasionally sprinkled with snow-like embers.Fitzsimmons said he could not \"overstate the effect that this profound drought is having\" as he warned of a long, painful summer ahead.\"There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil, a lack of moisture in the vegetation... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly, and they are burning ridiculously intensely.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The effects of the fires were visible yesterday, with smoke like a solid cloud covering most of Western Sydney. Now the smoke is everywhere. </p><p>The smoke is now covering the entire city[1]. It's also heating up as summer starts, and that's not helping. The Big Drought has made the entire area ultra-dry, and since most Australian trees are pyrogenic, (using fire to reproduce), it means Sydney is covered in potential fuel.  Media coverage is updating every half hour [2]or so. The overall situation is getting worse, and horrific in terms of levels of possible risks. Australian bushfires can be all too lethal, and they can hit so fast people can't escape. The air quality is 'hazardous', which may be an understatement for some people.Health warningsHealth warnings have been issued [3]for all Sydney residents. These health warnings are no joke. Particularly at risk are people with respiratory conditions and of course asthma and hay fever sufferers. Even if you don't have a respiratory condition, try to restrict exposure to the very smoky air, which is full of particulates, ash, etc. Emergency Services advisory servicesThe Rural Fire Service 'Fires Near Me[4]' map is useful for both residents and people planning to travel. This map is current within half an hour. Also note that many areas have text fire alerts, so keep your phone handy. IMPORTANT - Travellers take extreme careTravellers please note: If you aren't sure about fire conditions in the areas in which you're travelling, check first. Emergency services are stretched, and it's far too easy to run into a fire zone with no help available. A record bushfire year? Let's hope not. This year's bushfire season is one of the worst in the last nearly 30 years. The drought is the main culprit, but the extreme dry conditions have created fire hazards on a scale rarely seen before. Although our fire services did carry out backburning about 2 months ago, the conditions are perfect for big fires. Sydney is quite literally surrounded by native bush. Sydneysiders love the bush, but it's not like we don't know the risks. During the 90s I was working in a place where we had a clear view of fires to the south. There was a gigantic mushroom cloud over the Royal National Park, looking exactly like an atomic bomb. The entire huge area was devastated. It was miraculous that nobody was killed, and that property damage was minimal. The problem is that this year could actually be worse. This drought is huge, unprecedented, and the fires so far have been big, fast and ferocious. Arson Some cases of arson, mainly by kids, have been reported. This, annoyingly, isn't uncommon, and is the cause of fires every year. The bushfire safety bottom lineThis is basic 'bushfire etiquette': Be ready to move fast if you're anywhere near a fire, like within 20km or if you're downwind of a fire. You will have no more than about an hour at most to get out safely. Try to be ready to move ASAP. Observe fire bans and don't light anything at all outdoors. (If you're a smoker, put the butt in your back pocket to make sure it doesn't start a fire. Serves you right if you didn't put it out properly, doesn't it?)Don't waste emergency services time. Just follow instructions. Tell emergency services if there are mobility-impaired or handicapped people in the area who'll need help to evacuate. Do what you can to assist and tell them about any possible risks. If you want to stay and fight the fire, be realistic. There's only so much you can do. Get the family out and be ready to run if necessary. If you see a suspected arson attack, report it immediately. Call emergency services on 000, and take whatever safety measures you need. Don't take the law into your own hands, tempting as it may be. Staying safe in fire-affected regions: Keep close track of any fires in adjoining areas, which may spread. Keep an eye out for anyone lost or in trouble, and help if you can, or get help for them ASAP.  THE BOTTOM LINE FOR BUSHFIRE SAFETY IS 'STAY SAFE'. JUST DO THAT, AND YOU'LL BE OK.

These big fires are relentlessly destructive. Communities have been shattered, at least 3 people are dead, and several are missing. </p><p> Bushfire reports are typically an ongoing series of events and numbers which keep going up, sometimes for days or weeks. So far the numbers are looking godawful, and the events are often beyond meaningful commentary. You can say 'X houses destroyed, X fires out of control\", and so on, but it barely gives a picture of what's happening. Australian bushfires can make puddles out of cars, obliterate homes in a minute or two, and can race across the country like burning trains at recorded speeds of at up to 125kmh. These fires hit very fast, in some cases, with even locals taken by surprise, and almost no warning but a big tower of smoke almost on the doorstep. Not much is left after these big fires go through. The fast movement also means they're like blowtorches, much hotter in the directions they travel. The heat incinerates extremely quickly. One man now has what is effectively a piece of scorched tin where he had a caravan. Air quality is horrible, and the smoky air looks like you're wearing yellow sunglasses. The basic stats barely tell the story:\u2022 There are 90 major fires in progress\u2022 42 communities in Queensland alone are at serious risk and a formal state of emergency\u2022 Northern New South Wales is in equally severe trouble, Numbers are starting to come in. 150 homes have been destroyed and 2 people have died. \u2022 A little town called Bobin was basically wiped out when even air bombing couldn't stop the fire which hit it. These areas are in the middle of a murderous and very long drought. Water to fight the fires is scarce enough. Economically, these areas were already under severe pressure. The farmers are still working the land as these fires roar past[2]. Tales of survival and miraculous escapes are always welcome, and there are already quite a few. We have another 3-4 months of this to come, and summer hasn't even started yet. With any luck, the Queensland wet season will help to block fire[3]s, but nobody's expecting much but more of the same.New to bushfires? A quick guide to staying out of troubleWe don't have too many 'fire groupies' in Australia. At least, not live ones. These fires are too dangerous to be spectator sports. The people most likely to get into trouble are tourists and people who don't know the risks. So, a few pointers: WHEN IN A BUSHFIRE ZONE:\u2022 DO NOT GET IN THE WAY OF EMERGENCY SERVICES OPERATIONS AT ANY TIME. \u2022 STAY OFF ROADS USED BY EMERGENCY VEHICLES. \u2022 POLICE WILL TELL YOU WHICH ROADS YOU CAN USE. INJURIES\u2022 If someone's injured or suffering from smoke inhalation, call 000 ASAP. Someone will show up to help as soon as they can. \u2022 Water can help with breathing issues. Injured people should only be moved when it's absolutely essential for their safety. (Fractures in particular are very dangerous, and should not be moved at all, if possible.) INSTRUCTIONS FROM EMERGENCY SERVICESFollow instructions from police and emergency services immediately, and go where they tell you to go. Don't waste time or breath on anything but asking them where to go to be safe. When they tell you to 'get out', do it ASAP. You may not get another chance. WHEN A BUSHFIRE'S COMING:\u2022 Even the smell of smoke is a signal to get everyone together and get ready to get out. \u2022 Make sure you know where everyone is at all times, and don't let kids out of your sight for a second.\u2022 Plumes of smoke are sometimes your only warning of big trouble. Get organised and get ready to move out of the area. \u2022 Do NOT approach ANY flames. Don't even think about getting close to them. A small flame could be the start of a 50-metre high wall of fire travelling at about 80kmh, and your chances of survival aren't likely to be good. By the time you turn around, the fire could be on you. Flames are incredibly hot at a surprisingly long range. \u2022 Make sure you can see where you're going when you're on the move. If you can't see, get into a position where you can. The risk is driving straight into the fire. \u2022 Cars are no protection at all against heat from flames. You're in an oven on wheels if you're in a burning area. Do NOT drive through any area where you can't see what's happening. \u2022 Take water with you, preferably at least 2 litres per person. Dehydration is a serious risk, particularly in hot weather above 35-40C. The heat alone can literally take the water out of your lungs, even without a bushfire to help.\u2022 You MIGHT be able to help others who are stuck or can't get away on their own. Whatever you can do, do it, but be very quick about it. \u2022 STAY ALERT. There are emergency service notifications on your phone, online and in the local media. Keep up to date on the situation at all times. Fires can spread in a wide arc beyond their main lines, and can start up new fires miles from the existing fires.You can follow the Twitter feed from the fires on this link[4].

Small fires have been doing tremendous damage, aided by sundowner winds and topography. Locals have described one fire as \u0153Armageddon, obliterating huge expensive houses. Guts and garden hoses werent enou      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sbfire15-2008nov15,0,3157160.story\">The LA Times</url>:\"We watched probably about $60 million dollars of houses just burning out on Mountain Valley, a real posh area,\" said Paul Morison, who defended and saved his own home in the Riviera area of Montecito. </p><p>\"This morning they're gone. . . . The big house we used to look at, probably over 10,000 square feet, there's nothing. There were probably five of those things burning last night when we were here.\"Morison estimated that 50 houses had burned around his. He and two friends had defied the flames with garden hoses until 3:30 a.m. Friday. I can sympathize. These are Australian type bushfires, ferocious and super fast. Theyre worst in valley environments, where they can use slopes to climb hills at incredible speeds. In 1993 they literally surrounded Sydney for weeks, using the mountains and dry bush as fuel, jumping around and straining resources to the limit.There's also been the inevitable stories of celebrity houses at risk, which is a bit beside the point. Never mind the real estate values, these fires can also kill people. Fortunately casualties have been light.Current state of play is that 111 houses have been destroyed. Hydeville has been practically obliterated, and 1500 houses are still threatened.The declaration of a state of emergency is pretty apt. The most that can be said at the moment is that the winds have slowed down a bit.The LAT has some pretty graphic images. For Californios with Fire Fatigue, I suggest the sports pages.One other suggestion:These are very like the Australian bushfires. Same terrain, same problems. We have a lot of people who could help and advise, and maybe repay some favors we received during our big fires.Give us a ring.

Wednesday published a picture showing the bare bottom of <person><nameText>Prince William's wife Kate, </nameText></person>refusing to follow a \"ridiculous\" ban imposed by the British media.</p><p><br/><br/>One of <person><nameText>Rupert Murdoch's </nameText></person>Australian newspapers on Wednesday published a picture showing the bare bottom of <person><nameText>Prince William's wife Kate, </nameText></person>refusing to follow a \"ridiculous\" ban imposed by the British media.<br/>The image was taken during the royal couple's hugely successful tour of Australia in April when they showed off their infant son George, and was run in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a day after it appeared in German tabloid Bild, which declared she had a \"beautiful bum\".<br/>It shows the <person><nameText>Duchess of Cambridge's </nameText></person>blue and white summer dress lifted by a gust of wind when the royal couple got out of a helicopter in the Blue Mountains, 80 kilometres (50 miles) west of Sydney.<br/>The Daily Telegraph said British newspapers had refused to run the photo out of respect to the royals, but in a comment piece said this was \"an antiquated code of etiquette\" under the headline \"My bare lady: Derri-heir to the throne is fair game.\"<br/>\"It seems a bit ridiculous to expect the rest of the world's media to follow suit, particularly in a world in which flesh and commercialism go hand in hand,\" said Telegraph social writer Annette Sharp.<br/><br/>\"If the Duchess can't be bothered protecting herself by having hem weights sewn into her garments, why should the media protect her?\"<br/>The duchess is no stranger to wardrobe malfunctions and struggled to control the hem of her red dress as she stepped off a plane in New Zealand ahead of her Australian tour.<br/>Diane Morel, a Blue Mountains local, took the Australian photo and almost deleted it before realising what she had captured.<br/>\"It wasn't until I got home and I popped my camera card into the computer that I realised what I had captured,\" the 47-year-old told the newspaper, vowing to donate any money raised from the photo's sale to a bushfire relief fund.<br/><br/>-'Breach of privacy'-<br/><br/>During their tour, the royal couple met survivors and toured the scene of devastating Australian bushfires last year that destroyed more than 200 homes. <br/>It is not the first time Australian media has abandoned royal protocols with two radio presenters causing outrage in 2012 when they duped a nurse at the hospital treating <person><nameText>Prince William's </nameText></person>pregnant wife into giving them details about her morning sickness condition.<br/><br/>The nurse who fielded the call later killed herself.<br/>William and Kate have faced numerous battles in the past to protect their privacy by preventing the publication of photographs.<br/>In one of the most famous cases in 2012, French magazine Closer provoked outrage among the royals and sections of the British press when it published paparazzi photos of a topless Kate. <br/>The royals took legal action and French authorities promptly banned Closer from any use or resale of the offending pictures, the most intimate of which showed the duchess topless and having suncream rubbed into her buttocks by William.<br/>The Telegraph argued those photos were taken while the duchess was at a private chateau, but the Blue Mountains picture was on a public street.<br/>\"There is a very clear distinction between private and public property,\" it said.<br/>The British press reacted with outrage to Bild's publication with the Daily Mail calling it \"a breach of privacy\" while blasting a \"crude\" caption that appeared alongside. <br/>Others reproducted the image but pixelated Kate's bottom with the Daily Mirror saying she would be \"deeply dismayed\" by the embarrassing image.<br/>The decision to run the photo sparked division in Australia with one comment on the Telegraph website saying \"we've all got one, so what's the fuss\".<br/>Others were more critical. \"It doesn't matter who has had a 'wardrobe malfunction', the photo shouldn't appear in the press,\" a reader said.<br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He closed all the windows, leaned a ladder against the house for firefighters and stuck a case of water in the fridge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then he went outside to watch for flames with other neighbours who decided to ignore a mandatory evacuation order and stay on their properties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">''It's my house, I don't want anything to happen to it,'' said the 47-year-old film producer, whose wife and daughter left Monday to stay with friends. ''I'd rather be here and leave at the last minute than down the hill not knowing what's happening.''</p><p>Pockets of holdouts are cropping up all over the swath of Los Angeles County imperiled by the wildfire, exasperating authorities who say people are just plain foolhardy and vastly underestimate the risk they run in hunkering down against the blaze.</p><p>One of the most visible holdout episodes in the fire occurred Saturday when two men ignored an evacuation order and remained in the Tujunga home they were staying in. As they were hosing down the roof, flames erupted. The men, whose names have not been released, jumped off the roof into a hot tub and remained there several hours.</p><p>The water offered scant protection. The men, aged 53 and 40, sustained second and third-degree burns on their faces, arms and legs from the fire and had to be rescued one at a time by a medivac helicopter after a regular helicopter could not get to the home because of the flames. They were in stable condition Tuesday.</p><p>''It was an extraordinarily difficult rescue,'' said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. ''It took about 45 minutes and put everybody's lives at risk. If there is a mandatory evacuation order, it means you are in danger right now and get out.''</p><p>The phenomenon of people refusing to leave their homes arises during virtually every disaster. It has become such an issue in Texas, which has seen its share of hurricane holdouts, that a law went into effect Tuesday giving police the power to arrest residents who refuse to heed a mandatory order.</p><p>In California, authorities cannot force residents to leave against their will, only emphasize that they stay at their own risk, said Whitmore.</p><p>''It's a combination of bravado, people who won't listen to authority and those who seek adventure,'' said Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness. ''It crosses the line from bravado to stupidity.''</p><p>About 20 per cent of homeowners in a mandatory fire evacuation area staying put, according to a wildfire studies by the National University System Institute for Policy Research in San Diego.</p><p>''They're typically men _ a type of machismo thing _ and have a greater distrust in government's ability to respond to a fire,'' said Erik Bruvold, institute president. ''They're ready and willing to rely on their own individual abilities.''</p><p>But holdouts say they can better save their homes, especially when firefighting resources run thin. That ''stay and defend'' strategy, which trains residents in how to protect their properties, has been mostly successful in Australia, and Southern California officials were considering encouraging it earlier this year.</p><p>However, after Australian bushfires last summer claimed 130 lives, the idea has been largely abandoned in California.</p><p>That hasn't daunted Joseph Stachura. He's staying with his 3,500-square-foot (325-sq. meter) home in Big Tujunga Canyon where he has his own well and a pump that can drain 12,000 gallons (45,000 litres) of water from his pool. He has also stocked fireproofing gel to spray on his roof along with other firefighting supplies.</p><p>''Sometimes it really is up to you to save your house,'' said Stachura, 45, who owns a theatre. ''It's not like people are standing around out here doing nothing.''</p><p>That was the key reason why Charlie Seo stayed behind to protect his La Crescenta home. ''What if firefighters can't make it to every house?'' the 29-year-old high school chemistry teacher said.</p><p>He and a dozen neighbours banded together to form a 24-hour patrol, forming a rotation of three-hour shifts to keep a watch out for flying embers so they could be immediately doused. Neighbors who evacuated left out their garden hoses and showed those who stayed where sprinkler switches were located.</p><p>''We weren't trying to be defiant and we're not here to cause more trouble,'' Seo said.

He closed all the windows, leaned a ladder against the house for firefighters and stuck a case of water in the fridge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then he went outside to watch for flames with other neighbours who decided to ignore a mandatory evacuation order and stay on their properties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">''It's my house, I don't want anything to happen to it,'' said the 47-year-old film producer, whose wife and daughter left Monday to stay with friends. ''I'd rather be here and leave at the last minute than down the hill not knowing what's happening.''</p><p>Pockets of holdouts are cropping up all over the swath of Los Angeles County imperiled by the wildfire, exasperating authorities who say people are just plain foolhardy and vastly underestimate the risk they run in hunkering down against the blaze.</p><p>One of the most visible holdout episodes in the fire occurred Saturday when two men ignored an evacuation order and remained in the Tujunga home they were staying in. As they were hosing down the roof, flames erupted. The men, whose names have not been released, jumped off the roof into a hot tub and remained there several hours.</p><p>The water offered scant protection. The men, aged 53 and 40, sustained second and third-degree burns on their faces, arms and legs from the fire and had to be rescued one at a time by a medivac helicopter after a regular helicopter could not get to the home because of the flames. They were in stable condition Tuesday.</p><p>''It was an extraordinarily difficult rescue,'' said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. ''It took about 45 minutes and put everybody's lives at risk. If there is a mandatory evacuation order, it means you are in danger right now and get out.''</p><p>The phenomenon of people refusing to leave their homes arises during virtually every disaster. It has become such an issue in Texas, which has seen its share of hurricane holdouts, that a law went into effect Tuesday giving police the power to arrest residents who refuse to heed a mandatory order.</p><p>In California, authorities cannot force residents to leave against their will, only emphasize that they stay at their own risk, said Whitmore.</p><p>''It's a combination of bravado, people who won't listen to authority and those who seek adventure,'' said Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness. ''It crosses the line from bravado to stupidity.''</p><p>About 20 per cent of homeowners in a mandatory fire evacuation area staying put, according to a wildfire studies by the National University System Institute for Policy Research in San Diego.</p><p>''They're typically men _ a type of machismo thing _ and have a greater distrust in government's ability to respond to a fire,'' said Erik Bruvold, institute president. ''They're ready and willing to rely on their own individual abilities.''</p><p>But holdouts say they can better save their homes, especially when firefighting resources run thin. That ''stay and defend'' strategy, which trains residents in how to protect their properties, has been mostly successful in Australia, and Southern California officials were considering encouraging it earlier this year.</p><p>However, after Australian bushfires last summer claimed 130 lives, the idea has been largely abandoned in California.</p><p>That hasn't daunted Joseph Stachura. He's staying with his 3,500-square-foot (325-sq. meter) home in Big Tujunga Canyon where he has his own well and a pump that can drain 12,000 gallons (45,000 litres) of water from his pool. He has also stocked fireproofing gel to spray on his roof along with other firefighting supplies.</p><p>''Sometimes it really is up to you to save your house,'' said Stachura, 45, who owns a theatre. ''It's not like people are standing around out here doing nothing.''</p><p>That was the key reason why Charlie Seo stayed behind to protect his La Crescenta home. ''What if firefighters can't make it to every house?'' the 29-year-old high school chemistry teacher said.</p><p>He and a dozen neighbours banded together to form a 24-hour patrol, forming a rotation of three-hour shifts to keep a watch out for flying embers so they could be immediately doused. Neighbors who evacuated left out their garden hoses and showed those who stayed where sprinkler switches were located.</p><p>''We weren't trying to be defiant and we're not here to cause more trouble,'' Seo said. ''But it's our home and if we lose it, we lose a lot.''</p><p>Some believe authorities overstate the danger. ''They're erring on the side of caution,'' Tarzian said. ''If we really feel the threat of flames, we're going. I've got my motorcycle. I'll just blast down the hill.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-20090902CPCPW1828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WJ0-31X1-2R6R-52KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Press News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Canadian Press(CP)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>September 2, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N922120TM</classCode><className>SHERIFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000506</classCode><className>DISASTER PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N512110MM</classCode><className>MOVIE &amp; VIDEO PRODUCTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX543</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX544</classCode><className>SAN DIEGO, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A chimpanzee mauls his owner. And a Digital Journalist reviews the Oscar's Best Picture nominees. These are the top stories making news around the world.</p><p><br/><br/>Digital Journalism was front and centre as reporters from across the world brought their expertise to a variety of meaty subjects. Whether the articles focus on new businesses opening in a struggling economy or the acclaimed films contending for an Oscar, there's something for every news junkie.<br/><br/>A hearty kudos goes to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/834120\">Sherri Reese</url>, a tireless journalist who brought us a story on      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/267546\"> TARP</url> and how a Congressman admits the funds may have been misused. This is an explosive story that deserves international attention, and it's nicely complemented with video and audio clips.<br/><br/>How can a salon expect booming business during a global recession? Ask       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/257733\">Adriana Stuijt</url> who wrote about Dutch hairdresser       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/267521\">Danguet Lumleot</url> and her entrepreneurial vision. This woman's story was intimately related while also shedding light on how a salon can thrive in an economic crisis. As Adriana wrote: \"She single-handedly also climbed that inevitable mountain of bureaucracy everybody has to scale in The Netherlands before one can set up any business.\" A true inspiration.<br/><br/>And not to be missed are the excellent film reviews of the Best Picture nominees, courtesy of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/441827\">KJ Mullins</url>.
