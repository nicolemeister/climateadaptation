Extensive lightning strikes recorded in Wells Gray Park and the headwaters of Adams River were the cause of many of the new blazes.

Anyway, the cops are here. Fire marshals are investigating. Do you know a good lawyer?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am so glad this bonkers trend of \"gender reveal parties\" arrived after my twin daughters were born. God knows if I would've felt peer pressure to set off a dirty bomb next to the hostas: \"Hey, thanks for coming and, just to let you know, it's time to strap on your gas masks and radiation suits because we are having - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">kaboom!</emphasis> - TWO GIRLS!\"</p><p>How did the stork get replaced by a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor?</p><p>Among last year's AFP Pictures of The Year, there was a haunting image of a firefighter in California, a hose draped over his shoulders as he's battling apocalyptic flames.

The explosion, according to an NBC affiliate, put cracks in home foundations, disrupted the clean water supply and could be heard from across the state line.</p><p>Entire towns shook. As one local resident told the station: \"We heard this godawful blast. It knocked pictures off our walls ... I'm all up for silliness and whatnot, but that was extreme.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Yeah</emphasis>. The gender reveal party is now all about the extreme.</p><p>Last month in Cancun, two people died when an airplane trailing pink contrails for the baby girl news suddenly nosedived into the sea. Previous gender party fatalities now include \"death by shrapnel\" and \"death by improvised device.\" In a recent story about the body count of these manic birth celebrations, Newsweek cited a February incident from Michigan in which, \"a couple fired a cannon at a baby shower, but accidentally killed one of their friends.\"</p><p>Good lord. Baby showers should be about feigned enthusiasm and questionable finger foods. That's it. As the mom-to-be rambles on sweetly and incoherently, unaware she's not going to get a good night's sleep for the next two years, all you should be doing is grinning and stealing glances at your watch. What you should absolutely not be doing is fretting about possibly meeting your maker after a merry mishap with 12th century artillery.</p><p>I don't want to sound like an old man shaking his fist at the clouds, even though that's exactly what I am, but all of our cultural rituals are now totally out of whack. For example, when I was a kid, birthday parties involved chips, pop, hot dogs, games and a slab cake more toxic than a dirty bomb. It was awesome. Parents back then didn't feel any need to recreate \"The Falcon and The Winter Soldier\" or go viral on Instagram. But as social media has become the second-hand smoke of an entire generation, parents are now choking on the fumes of their own folly.</p><p>Gender reveal parties started out innocently enough. New parents wheeled out blue or pink baked goods and everyone cheered. Or parents bought big helium balloons that, once popped, gave way to Trojan Horse streamers in the symbolic colours of male or female. What new parents did not do was succumb to extreme one-upmanship as guests ran for cover and the mushroom cloud spelled out boy or girl.</p><p>And the craziest part? Nobody cares about the gender of your baby. I mean, grandparents care. If you already have kids, they might also care, as is suggested by the YouTube library of Gender Reveal Party Fails in which distraught tykes have meltdowns over news of their impending siblings: \"I don't want a baby brother! I don't want a baby sister!\"</p><p>But everyone else in your social group? They don't care!</p><p>A gender reveal is not grounds to host a hare-brained party that possibly leads to an explosion, forest fire, earthquake, tsunami and fatalities. It's not. The sex of your baby is about as exciting as your views on Shakespeare. Nobody cares. If you want me to attend a party in which there's a risk I may be vapourized by a festive direct-energy weapon, your new bundle of joy better be capable of terraforming or interdimensional shape-shifting. I'll take that risk.</p><p>Boy or girl doesn't cut it.</p><p>When this pandemic is over, we should rethink all of our cultural rituals.

Follow him on Twitter: @vinaymenon</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kathy Etheridge I have been a part of the Creston Valley for over 40 years, and I love everything about living here. I have recently started a new venture as a small business owner taking over Simply Raw, a kitchen located inside Fly in the Fibre. My partner and I now reside in Canyon on a small acreage with our nine-year-old daughter, a cat, a dog, and some chickens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last couple years, I have been a volunteer with the Canyon-Lister Elementary School (CLES) breakfast program and I also joined the Parent Advisory Council.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My interest to be a trustee is for the students and parents of the community. I would like to be an assertive voice for Creston.</p><p>Prior to taking over a small business, I was employed with Labatt, where I was in a leadership role and collaborated with many different departments within the company. I believe my integrity, honesty, ability to be a team player, and my drive to obtain results makes me a good candidate.</p><p>At an early age my daughter was diagnosed with Distal 18q, with the diagnoses came along low muscle tone and a small ear canal. When she joined kindergarten, I was worried for her safety. CLES has been so amazing and after day one I never worried about that again. If elected, my focus will be the safety and equity of all students and staff in Creston.</p><p>Being a stakeholder, I will work hard and focus on what is important to students and staff in Creston. I will be a lifeline for inclusion, integrity, and equity for all learners. Student safety and success should be priority! Clements Verhoeven Thirty years of classroom experience only served to reinforce my motivation for entering the teaching profession in the first place-after parenting, teaching is the most important human activity. I taught english and history according to the timetable, but my focus was always critical thinking. \u201cWhat does this poem tell us about being human?\u201d was a favourite question. The discussion that didn\u2019t end because the bell rang meant the class had been a success.</p><p>Why do I wish to be Creston\u2019s school trustee? Because I want to be there to ensure that our school board values and facilitates the excitement of classrooms engaged in real learning, where students develop the thinking skills and self-awareness to confidently deal with our increasingly challenging world. And, to that end, I think there is much to be done in allocating resources, ensuring that Creston schools are safe, healthy, well-funded vibrant places of learning.</p><p>Committed administrators and teaching staff are critical in this quest of creating the best learning conditions, and their concerns need to be addressed in all school board decisions. Without representation and a sense that their concerns are valid and will be heard and acted upon by their school board, teacher morale suffers and a vibrant learning situation is that much harder to sustain.</p><p>My experience in the various roles I filled as a representative of my colleagues included voluntary work as chairperson for professional development and working learning conditions. As a leader in my department, I served at various times as department head of English, as an assistant for curriculum development and implementation, and as a member of the school\u2019s hiring committee. These roles have given me insights and skills that I will utilise as Creston\u2019s school trustee.</p><p>Why should people vote for me? Ask my former students about Mr. V.</p><p>Cody Beebe There\u2019s two options for writing an interview. You could choose to waste space bashing other opponents, trying to besmirch the name of others. Point fingers, blame, spread half truths, and insult others. Alternatively, you can choose to focus on yourself. I choose to tell the public about my plans, my ideals, and the type of person I am. I won\u2019t point fingers like the others have chosen to, since after all, it\u2019s a petty tactic to dismiss legitimate ideals of others.</p><p>I was born and raised in Creston. I have coached hockey here, taught Conservation and Outdoor Recreation Education here, and am currently helping to establish a drone program for the Creston Air Search and Rescue. I went through the schools that your kids have gone to, are going to, or will go to.</p><p>Though now the times are changing, many trustee candidates will want the older ways of teaching and schooling. But as parents, as neighbours, and as a community we all know that we need new innovations, new strategies. I myself have one child in post secondary, and two children in the public school system. I get an inside perspective on the issues at large, on what struggles our kids are really facing. Communication is very important to me. Without proper communication, the board can\u2019t function properly, which is why I will hold communication as a top priority. Along with providing a safe, equitable, and inclusive education for all. I believe strongly in putting funding into the children\u2019s hands, to further better their chances at receiving the best education they can. In a calm manner, with pro-fessionalism in mind, I have, and will continue to fight for these kids. One major issue that\u2019s being talked about is the de-amalgamation of Creston from School District 8. I am for this process, if Creston wants it, I will fight for it at every level. De-amalgamation will be a hard fight and will come with many issues on its own, but we mustn\u2019t look through one lens.</p><p>I intend to solve any issues in a way where Creston won\u2019t lose, where our community won\u2019t lose, where the kids don\u2019t lose out. I promise to keep the voice of Creston alive during my term, and intend for it to channel the community\u2019s voices to solve issues at a board level. By fixing communication, and fighting for our students in an effective manner that leaves everyone happy, I assure you, your kids will receive the best education Creston can offer them.</p><p>Mary Jayne Blackmore I am a teacher of 13 years in the Creston Valley I am passionate about education. My first love is to be in the classroom with students, yet the design of our school system plays such a critical role in how effective an individual teacher can be in supporting the learning journey of a child. I\u2019ve worked to support students from the Bountiful Community as they\u2019ve transitioned into the school district and college. I\u2019ve advocated to the trustees of School District 8 for the unique needs and challenges of many youth in this valley. I\u2019ve been frustrated to see that often programs designed for youth have not tried to address the distinct barriers our rural populations face:distance, relocating, cost of travel, and unsafe highways. During the sale of the Home Links building, I was infuriated as the school board gave no con-sideration to protecting a vital resource that is a hub and unique service supporting a vulnerable population in our community. I\u2019ve witnessed the continued erosion of educational assets in the Creston Valley and often hear the frustration many community members feel about this. My keen interest in community development is influenced by my training with Tamarack Institute. A school as the heartbeat of a community is a philosophy I follow. Healthy communities start with healthy schools. I\u2019ve worked as a vice principal of Mormon Hills Schools. I am familiar with the Ministry of Education accreditation process and school funding models. I\u2019ve worked in the non-profit sector as president of Trails for Creston Valley Society. I completed university studies in Utah and have studied many different educational models. I sat on a consultation committee for developing BC\u2019s new curriculum. I feel inspired by the direction the new curriculum is headed and the Ministry of Education\u2019s work to apply Indigenous ways of knowing into our everyday classrooms.</p><p>If elected, I promise to work towards building community through a culture of respect and support, listening and taking action for what families need, placing value on re-skilling our youth with practical life skills, creating a culture of reciprocity with the natural world to combat helplessness in our current climate crisis, serving an active and responsible role in truth and reconciliation, being an advocate and stronger voice for securing educational resources for youth, and lobby provincial government to return Creston Valley to its own school district.</p><p>Allan Gribbin As a school trustee running for re-election, I am in this race because there is unfinished business for Creston schools and our community. Since the amalgamation of the Creston School District with the larger Nelson District 25 years ago, Creston has faired poorly. There are six trustees on the north side of the district with close connections to Nelson and three trustees in the Creston region. One of the first decisions the new district made was to saddle Creston taxpayers with paying off a share of the $1 million debt that Nelson schools brought to the new amalgamated district. Creston had always operated with a balanced budget and Creston schools were never given any credit for the strict financial discipline we followed.</p><p>I am dedicated to community and strongly believe that a strong relationship between our schools and our community must be re-established and maintained. Last year.a $750,000 computer purchase was approved by the current school board. The contract went to a Kelowna business while a local business who wanted to participate in the bidding process was excluded. I was the only trustee who fought to try to give local business an opportunity to participate but my lone vote was shut down by our current board. Our board chair even refused to allow my motion that would require us to give local business an opportunity to bid on district contracts, a policy that other districts have.</p><p>I believe that we need to re-establish the relationship between the school district and our community. The importance of this relationship can be seen on graduation night with tens of thousands of dollars in donations for scholarships coming from local businesses. It is sad that the benefits of this relationship hasn\u2019t flowed back to these generous donors. I will continue to work to require the board to give local business an opportunity to bid on district contracts.</p><p>As a retired teacher of 28 years, I understand education and hold the board to account when they present education policy. I was the first teacher in the district to pilot the First Nations 11 course in the 90s, and I have maintained a strong relationship with the Yaqan Nukiy community ever sense. My two children graduated here in Creston and my son is about to graduate from the University of Regina education program. Education has been my life and advancing the benefits of education to every child is my vision and goal.</p><p>By electing Clements Verhoeven in Creston, and Mary Jayne Blackmore and myself in the South Rural Zone, you will have three trustees working to return Creston\u2019s school district where it belongs.</p><p>My wife Jo and I live in Canyon. We spent many years traveling the Kootenays, paddling and camping at the Kootenay, Columbia, and Slocan lakes. We always wanted to live in the Creston Valley. Our dream was to move here and have a big garden and a place for Jo\u2019s horses. Thankfully our dream has been realized and we absolutely love this valley.</p><p>Since our arrival, I have been an active member of the Canyon Community Association initially as a member and now as chairperson of the board focusing on developing and improving Canyon Park. With my experience in water systems and governmental affairs, I have served as a board member of the North Canyon Water Improvement District for the past three years. The board has achieved so much in that time developing the Roger Tierney water system to better sustain our users through drought conditions and to better support our neighbours. I have been actively involved as a certified spotter with the Civil Air Search and Rescue in the Creston Valley since 2019.</p><p>My previous work experience is highly suited for the role of RDCK director. I worked in government for 35 years, for BC Parks in roles such as operations manager for the East Kootenay Parks and later as the recreation head for the Kootenay Region. As such, I was responsible for the facility maintenance for the $75 million plant, spending approximately $1 million a year for facility rebuilds including potable and wastewater systems and new construction projects. I was also the project director for the Kokanee Glacier Cabin. In my position, I was responsible for Search and Rescue for BC Parks for the Kootenays. I was trained in Alpine Rescue and Recovery in my position as Superintendent of Mount Robson Provincial Park. I was a park ranger, deputy conservation officer, and auxiliary RCMP constable in addition to my work for BC Parks. This was all to serve and support the communities in which I lived.</p><p>I have in-depth knowledge of governmental affairs and processes, legalities, and funding. If elected, my points of focus will be the supply and affordability of accessible water, re-establishing planning commissions within Area B for residents to have a stronger voice and to be able to liaise with local government, being available and fully accessible, questioning initiatives that may impact taxation and additional costs to Area B residents, and requesting a review of directors\u2019 wages.</p><p>I wish to continue serving and making our communities better. I have a lot to offer and a tremendous amount of experience and energy. I see many opportunities to make a positive impact for Area B residents and to engage with local government so they are heard and involved in matters that impact them most.</p><p>Calling the Creston Valley home for over 40 years, I have lived for the last 15 years in Erickson.</p><p>In 2021, along with my partner Garry, we invested in a mobile food trailer business \u2013 Savour &amp; Company Kitchen. This has allowed me to follow my passion for food, showcasing what the Creston Valley produces, serving people as well as the flexibility to make my role as a regional director my priority.</p><p>Our valley is full of agricultural diversity, strong and resilient businesses, and recreational and tourism opportunities. These are just some of the reasons why I want to continue to serve this community. Serving as Director for Area B for the last eight years and two terms on Creston council prior, I understand the roles and responsibilities of this position. I have spent the last 14 years building relationships with other levels of government that have opened the doors to successful Tanya Wall grant applications. With experience in revitalizing and building a business such as Casey\u2019s Community House with my late husband Ralph, operating a safety consulting business, and 18 years at Columbia Brewery as the safety and environmental compliance manager, I have gained a vast skill set that is adaptable and can deal with many issues at once. Personally, I understand how quickly one\u2019s life can change and how to rebuild it. We can make all the plans in the world but there are times when circumstances are uncontrollable and those plans need to be adaptable, as we have seen through this global pandemic and in our ever-changing world.</p><p>Listening to the community, I know we have challenges coming out of the pandemic. We need to work together supporting our community associations and volunteers to ensure that we are fiscally responsible. My focus if re-elected will be to deal with arising issues, listen to residents\u2019 concerns, and adjust plans accordingly. Agricultural Sustainability \u2013 maintaining a healthy growth, supporting our food security needs, finding a balance on our greatest resource, water, and to continue with the provincial government to investigate a more affordable and sustainable supply for irrigation. Water-we face many challenges in our area water systems and we will need to be innovative to ensure we are investing for the future. Climate Awareness \u2013 this will require us to deal with extreme heat events, forest fire risk, flooding, and our changing weather patterns. Recreation \u2013 continue to invest in our parks and trails network, maintain and enhance our recreation facility and community halls and parks and offer programming that fits the needs of all ages. Economic Diversity \u2013to continue to support the businesses in Area B while creating new opportunities in agriculture tourism and showcasing the beauty and diversity of what the Creston Valley offers.</p><p>I will continue to work for you with confidence and leadership. I have the knowledge, determination and enthusiasm to continue working towards strengthening our community.</p><p>Adam Casemore I was born and raised in Creston. I am a bricklayer by trade, I own and operate my own Masonry Business. My wife and I live in Area C and enjoy everything the valley has to offer.</p><p>I want to continue to serve as Director for Area C because I\u2019m passionate about the community. I have built meaningful relationships with individuals and groups over the years who share the same passion and want to see enhancement and growth. I feel that I have a good foundation in place to continue that work.</p><p>I have previously served on town council and was able to obtain a good understanding of how municipal governments operate. I continued by being elected as a regional director the following term. I understand the partnership that is needed to work together collectively. I have established good working relationships with key stakeholders and RDCK staff to build a vast network that helps move things forward efficiently, as well as address any issues. I also was elected to the Association of Kootenay Boundary Local Government Executive where I eventually served as vice president. I have been elected and continue to serve as Chair of the Rural Affairs Committee for the RDCK for the last three years.</p><p>If re-elected, I would continue to move projects forward such as the construction of the West Creston Fire Hall, a supply of potable water for Alice siding, improved water access for recreation along the Goat River and Kootenay River, funding to address the dykes along the Kootenay River, improved services for the landfill and compost facility, and potential curbside pick-up for rural residents. These are just a few projects I would like keep working on and potentially complete in the next term.</p><p>Residents should consider voting for me because I\u2019m knowledgeable about the issues that mean the most. I have plans and funding in place to continue moving forward to execute and deliver on the initiatives. I have worked hard the last four years to deliver on the needs of the community and would like to use that experience and knowledge for the next term. I plan to continue Kelly Vandenberghe I am very pleased to be a member of this community. I come from an energy and auction business background and have always served in my communities from a firefighter and volunteer to taking on leadership roles. My wife and I have five kids and four grandchildren. She is a teacher in Creston. We both have a strong connection to agriculture.</p><p>My interest in public service comes from a strong desire to do my part in enriching the lives of my neighbours and my community. I have always served whether as a coach, fund-raising auctioneer, or leader. Municipal representatives are directly connected to the grass roots of their community.</p><p>I have experience as municipal elected official and am proud with how I served and what I accomplished. I believe strongly I am an effective communicator, always prepared, highly organized and with great attention to detail. Relationship building works very well for me. My business background allows me to understand the fiscal challenges and responsibilities in decision making. Integrity and honesty have always been my cornerstones.</p><p>I have talked with many people from this and surrounding areas listening to people\u2019s stories and points of view on what they feel is working and what is not. My job is to investigate and ask the hard questions (at the RDCK table) to ensure service level standards are appropriate and Area C is receiving their fair share of fiscal resources. Improving on service delivery and efficiency is a strength developed from my business and communications background.</p><p>Residents should count on someone committed to the task of professional representation, a pledge to report and gather feedback and a proven track record in returning calls within a day. Residents in Area C should feel comfortable and connected by voting for Kelly Vandenberghe to represent them in RDCK Area C.

Serbian, Swedish and Swiss planes and helicopters were among a fleet of seven aircraft providing support. <br/> 'Yesterday, we saw the light of the sun for the first time in days,' Istiaia mayor Yiannis Kontzias told state TV ERT. <br/> He was referring to giant smoke clouds that have choked residents and obstructed flights by water-bombing aircraft. <br/> EU states and other countries have so far contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and more than 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were due to arrive by Friday. <br/> Support from abroad has helped avert an even greater disaster. <br/> 'When we arrived, it seemed like the whole of Greece was burning,' said Nicolas Faure, part of a detachment of more than 170 French firefighters that began arriving late last week. <br/> - 'Entire ecosystem destroyed' - <br/><br/>Even as the immediate danger for his town receded, Kontzias said local businesses 'face extinction' in coming months in a tourism season already decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic. <br/> 'We have lost the month of August, which would have sustained people here over the coming year.' <br/> '(Local) tourism has been demolished, most (visitors) have left,' the mayor said. <br/> 'The damage is huge, and the environmental disaster will have economic repercussions for decades.' <br/> From July 29 to August 11, more than 93,000 hectares (231,000 acres) were burnt in Greece,according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average area burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 2,330 hectares. <br/> A draft UN assessment seen exclusively by AFP called the Mediterranean a 'climate change hotspot' and said increasing temperatures and aridity had lengthened fire seasons and 'doubled potential burnable area'. <br/> Dimitris Haliotis, the head of a Red Cross team, said that 'the entire ecosystem is destroyed' on the island, with the loss of forest animals running in the hundreds. <br/> Theodoros Roumeliotis, the local hoteliers president in the Greek spa town of Aidipsos, said August reservations had collapsed by 90 percent. <br/> 'It's a colossal loss,' he told AFP. <br/> 'Right now, hotels are obliged to refund one million euros in reservations cancelled,' he said, adding that some operators were unlikely to survive the blow. <br/> - Calls for sackings - <br/><br/>There have been growing calls in Greece for the resignation of top public safety officials who as recently as June had insisted that the country was well-prepared. <br/> There was additional anger over the loss last week of much of the forest of Varibobi, one of Athens' last remaining nature reserves. In that fire, the former royal estate of Tatoi narrowly avoided destruction. <br/> Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias said Greece's resources were 'stronger than ever before'. <br/> 'We faced an operationally unique situation with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather phenomenon in 40 years,' he said on Tuesday. <br/>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis this week apologised to the nation for any possible 'shortcomings' in the state's response. He is to hold a press conference on Thursday. <br/> The PM has pledged hundreds of millions of euros in additional funds for civil protection, reforestation and flood prevention. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-ups\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-upshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fgreece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=Greece%20counts%20cost%20as%20firefighters%20battle%20flare-ups</url><br/>The post Greece counts cost as firefighters battle flare-ups[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/greece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups/article\">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/greece-counts-cost-as-firefighters-battle-flare-ups/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url></p><p/>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALX RESOURCES CORP (\"AL-V\") - Receives Drilling Permit and Exercises Option to Purchase Claims at - the Vixen Gold Project</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALX Resources Corp. (\"ALX\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update for its 100%-owned Vixen Gold Project (\"Vixen\" or the \"Project\") located in the Red Lake Mining District of Ontario. Vixen consists of three sub-projects totaling 10,614 hectares (26,227 acres), Vixen North, Vixen South and Vixen West, located within the Birch-Uchi greenstone belt approximately 60 kilometres (37 miles) east of Red Lake, Ontario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vixen North Exploration Permit</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the fall of 2020, ALX completed a high-resolution helicopter-borne magnetic and VLF-EM survey totaling 475.7 line-kilometres to over a known 3,000 metre-long high magnetic trend and other important structural trends present at Vixen North. Drill targets were subsequently defined by the integration of the airborne survey results with the geochemical results of site visits carried out in 2019 and 2020 (see ALX news release dated October 29, 2020), which led to the filing of an exploration permit application for Vixen North.</p><p>In late June 2021, following a positive engagement with local First Nations, ALX received an exploration permit from the Ontario Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (the \"Permit\"). The Permit allows for diamond drilling at up to ten locations at Vixen North totaling approximately 1,000 metres (3,280 feet), and is effective until June 28, 2024. The drilling program is designed to be helicopter-supported with a start date to be determined, due to the continuing forest fire emergency and the resulting moratorium on exploration activities in the Red Lake Mining District.</p><p>Vixen South Claims Acquisition</p><p>In early May 2021, ALX executed an option-to-purchase agreement with arm's-length vendors (the \"Vendors\") to purchase a 100% interest in a group of claims west of Grace Lake, consisting of nineteen claim units and a single patented claim (the \"Claims\", see ALX news release dated May 12, 2021). The Claims comprise approximately 384 hectares (949 acres) and are located along the northern edge of the Vixen South claim block.</p><p>ALX carried out due diligence on the Claims, which included a site visit in late June 2021 before forest fires effectively closed off access to the Vixen South area. In August 2021, ALX decided to exercise its right to purchase a 100% interest in the Claims in exchange for a total of $40,000 cash and 500,000 common shares of ALX. The Claims remain subject to a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty (\"NSR\") in favour of the Vendors, which can be purchased in its entirety by ALX for $2.5 million.

Two other firefighters were in intensive care with severe burns.</p><p>\u201cWe handled an operationally unique situation, with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather conditions we\u2019ve seen in 40 years,\u201d Hardalias told a news conference. \u201cNever was there such a combination of adverse factors in the history of the fire service.\u201d</p><p>Greece had just experienced its worst heat wave since 1987, which left its forests tinder-dry. Other nearby nations such as Turkey  and Italy also faced the same searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires.</p><p>Worsening drought and heat \u2013 both linked to climate change \u2013 have also fueled wildfires this summer in the U.S. West  and in Siberia in northern Russia.</p><p>Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas  is driving extreme events. Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently.</p><p>In Greece, the worst blaze still burning Tuesday was in the northern section of Evia, the country's second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital's residents.</p><p>Nearly 900 firefighters, 50 ground teams and more than 200 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3, the fire service said. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Poland \u2014 part of a huge international response to Greece's plea for assistance.</p><p>Fourteen helicopters provided air support Tuesday on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was burning in an area in which villages and forests are entwined.</p><p>Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but firefighters were guarding the perimeter of the blaze, particularly around a cluster of villages that were among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it too dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist ground forces.</p><p>According to EU wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 49,000 hectares (121,000 acres) have burned up on Evia \u2014 by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece.</p><p>Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon. About 400 firefighters, including teams from the Czech Republic and Britain, battled that blaze, assisted by five helicopters and 23 water-dropping planes from several countries.</p><p>A judicial investigation is under way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether there is any organized arson plan, that\u2019s not my job,\u201d Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his \u201cfeeling\u201d that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, a woman convicted of intentionally starting a fire in an Athens park last week was sentenced to five years in prison.</p><p>Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes in the early stages that they say left the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous.</p><p>Hardalias argued that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia \u2014 a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years.</p><p>\u201cEvery house lost is a tragedy for all of us. It\u2019s a knife in our heart,\u201d he said.</p><p>Asked whether he was satisfied with the country's firefighting response, Hardalias said: \u201cObviously, there can be no satisfaction after such a catastrophe. But all our available forces, ground and airborne, were sent immediately to the fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether we could have done something different remains to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in any case, we fought a great battle, and the losses were among those fighting it, not among civilians.\u201d</p><p>Greek authorities have emphasized saving lives, issuing evacuation alerts for dozens of villages and neighborhoods this summer. In 2018, a deadly fire that engulfed a seaside settlement near Athens killed more than 100 people, including some who drowned trying to escape the flames and smoke by sea.</p><p>Critics say the government\u2019s focus on evacuating villages prevented villagers with local knowledge from helping firefighters and led to more property destruction.</p><p>Greece's center-right government has pledged to provide compensation to everyone who suffered loss from the wildfires and to undertake a massive reforestation effort to replace the trees that have burned.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a special cabinet meeting Tuesday that owners of destroyed or damaged homes would receive up to 150,000 euros ($176,000) in state compensation, with initial payments to begin next week, while businesses and farmers will also get support and tax breaks.</p><p>In southwest Turkey, crews battled two fires Tuesday in the coastal province of Mugla, including a brush fire near Bodrum\u2019s Gumusluk resort neighborhood. Bodrum\u2019s mayor said the fire was close to being extinguished and no residential areas were threatened.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters quickly put out a new blaze in a forest in Istanbul\u2019s Sariyer district.</p><p>___</p><p>Paphitis reported from Kontias, Greece.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow all AP stories about climate change issues at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate</url>.</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The northern portion of the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine is totally dependent on a single fibre optic cable route.

That fibre backbone could be used to complete a ring of cable in the north, running through Terrace, Dease Lake, Watson Lake, Dawson Creek and Prince George.</p><p>\"Once you've completed a ring like this a break in a fibre due to a forest fire or something means that all that connectivity can be rerouted around the ring so that there is no impact in service,\" said Mike Thomas, TANEx president.</p><p>A northern ring would not only be beneficial for the regional district but for the province as a whole, but it is not expected to happen anytime soon.</p><p>\"The reality is they are just plagued by excessive delays, these things take a long time to get through the funding process and even once they get through the funding process getting access to get these things built can take years,\" said Mike Thomas.</p><p>The report found that connectivity in the district is diverse. The Terrace area and the southern part of the district is reasonably developed, with many service providers. That is contrasted by the northern areas in the district, where there is little to no service and Northwestel is the only provider.</p><p>\"It's really about making high speed internet connectivity available throughout your region to benefit all of your constituents regardless of where they live, so that they can benefit from the economy as well as important services,\" said Kerri-Anne Thomas, TANEx project manager, to the district board.</p><p>Cellular service coverage in the district is far from total. Right now, over 600 kilometres of major roadways in the district do not have cellular service, a public safety issue because there is no access to emergency services.</p><p>The eventual goal is to have cellular coverage along all highway corridors in the regional district.</p><p>\"Obviously we all know that it's seriously lacking along many of the major roads, we think it's about 28 per cent now,\" said Kerri-Anne Thomas.</p><p>TANEx identified download and upload speeds for various types of homes and businesses in the region based on 50 megabytes per second download and 10 megabytes per second upload speeds (50/10).</p><p>Outside of municipalities, about 14 per cent of anchor tenants like schools, libraries, first responder facilities and healthcare facilities have 50/10 service. Within RDKS member municipalities that number is 42 per cent.</p><p>About one third of homes outside member municipalities have access to 50/10 service.</p><p>TANEx will present its final report to the regional district board in late July.</p><p>READ MORE: RDKS developing strategy to bring higher internet speeds to remote areas</p><p>@BenBogstie <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ben.bogstie@terracestandard.comLike\">ben.bogstie@terracestandard.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aug 07, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Hundreds of firefighters fought wildfires and flare-ups that have devoured record numbers of woodlands in Greece Saturday and left hundreds of families homeless, but heavy rains brought some respite to hard-hit Turkey. <br/> More than 1,450 Greek firefighters backed by at least 15 aircraft were battling the fires, with reinforcements arriving from other countries, the fire service said. </p><p><br/> The blazes in Greece are set to continue, with strong winds and temperatures of up to 38 degrees C (100 F) forecast in some regions on Saturday. <br/> This year's fires have been far more destructive than in previous years. <br/> In the last 10 days, 56,655 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece,according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average number of hectares burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 1,700 hectares. <br/> 'When this nightmarish summer ends we will reverse the damage as soon as possible,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledged on Saturday. <br/> In Pefkofyto, in the north of Athens, pensioner Tasos Tsilivakos struggled to contain his tears. <br/> 'This is a horrible disaster,' he told AFP. <br/> 'I'm really afraid that maybe only our great-grand children will have the chance to walk again in these areas.' <br/> One 62-year-old man from nearby Agios Stefanos told Alpha TV how after being evacuated he had had to watch his house burning on television. 'My child is still crying from the shock,' he said. <br/><br/>- Rains help Turkey - <br/><br/>Greece and Turkey have been fighting devastating fires for more than a week as the region suffers its worst heatwave in decades. Officials and experts have linked such intense weather events to climate change. <br/> So far, they have killed two people in Greece and eight in Turkey, with dozens more hospitalised there during 10 days of the blazes. <br/> A UN draft report seen by AFP labelled the Mediterranean region a 'climate change hotspot', warning that heatwaves, droughts and fires would become more fierce in the future, supercharged by rising temperatures. <br/> But the weather gave Turkey some respite Saturday. Officials in the Turkish coastal city of Antalya said the blazes were under control in the southwestern province after rainfall there. <br/> And heavy rainfall was expected to continue until the afternoon in areas including Manavgat, one of the most affected by the fires. <br/> The situation remained serious however around the tourist hotspot of Mugla, where at least three neighbourhoods have been ordered to evacuate. <br/> There have been over 200 fires in 47 of Turkey's 81 provinces, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli tweeted early on Saturday. Thirteen fires continue in five provinces. <br/><br/>- Fears of more high winds - <br/><br/>Greek Civil Protection deputy minister, Nikos Hardalias said on Saturday that 55 blazes were raging across Greece. <br/> They were burning on Evia, the country's second largest island, which lieseast of the capital; in the Peloponnese region in the southwest; and in Fthiotida in Central Greece. <br/> The fire front on Evia alone ran across 30 kilometres (18 miles) long, said Fanis Spanos, regional governor of Central Greece, but in Attica peninsula there the situation was 'more stable'. <br/> There is, however, concern as winds are expected to pick up pace later in the day, the Fire Brigade said. <br/> Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country that had been shut down as a precaution was reopened Saturday. <br/> In the northern Evia, where more than 1,300 people fled the fires on ferry boats Friday from the coastal village of Limni, another 23 were evacuated Saturday morning from a nearby beach at Rovies. <br/> Navy warships are on high alert off the north of the island in case more evacuations are required. <br/> Local officials there have already called for more air support in the firefighting efforts warning for hundreds of homeless families. <br/> Fanis Spanos told the Athens News Agency (ANA) that more than 300 families whose homes had been burned down were being sheltered in hotels. <br/> The situation remained dire in Mani, in the Peloponnese, where 5,000 people were evacuated on Friday. <br/> Eleni Drakoulakou, the mayor of East Mani, told ERT TV on Saturday that half the town had been burnt, blaming a lack of water-dropping air support during the critical first hours of the wildfire. <br/> ANA also reported that two people had been charged for arson. <br/> In Athens, police arrested a woman in a park on Friday as she was carrying two lighters, petrol and flammable materials,a few minutes after a fire broke out there. <br/> Authorities have banned visits to parks and forests through Greece. <br/> A 43-year-old man was arrested in the area of Krioneri and charged with arson, according to ANA. <br/><url

burning out of control in Greece and Turkey on Friday, including a major blaze just north of the Greek capital of Athens that left one person dead, as a protracted heat wave turned forests into tinderboxes and flames threatened populated areas, electricity installations and historic sites. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters across Greece were battling 56 active wildfires, Civil Protection chief Nikos Hardalias said. Multiple evacuation orders were issued for inhabited areas of the country's mainland and the nearby island of Evia, while the fire near Athens burned forestland and houses in its path heading toward Lake Marathon, the capital\u2019s main water reservoir. </p><p>\u201cWe continue our effort hour by hour to tackle the multiple fires we face today,\u201d Hardalias said. \u201cConditions are exceptionally dangerous.\u201d Strong winds were forecast for Friday afternoon in much of Greece, which could hamper firefighting efforts.</p><p>Athens' main trauma hospital said a 38-year-old man died after sustaining a head injury from a falling utility pole in Ippokrateios Politeia, one of the neighborhoods north of Athens affected by the fire. The man was taken to the hospital by ambulance Friday afternoon without any vital signs, and efforts to revive him for more than an hour were unsuccessful. </p><p>On Evia, the coast guard mounted a major operation to evacuate hundreds of people by sea, using patrol vessels, fishing and tourist boats and private vessels to rescue residents and vacationers overnight and into Friday. Dozens of other villages and neighborhoods were emptied in the southern Peloponnese region and just north of the Greek capital as blazes raced through pine forests. </p><p>\u201cWe're talking about the apocalypse, I don't know how to describe it,\u201d Sotiris Danikas, head of the coast guard in the town of Aidipsos on Evia, told state broadcaster ERT, describing the sea evacuation.</p><p>The coast guard said 668 people had been evacuated from beaches in northeast Evia by early Friday afternoon after flames cut off all other means of escape. Coast guard vessels continued to patrol the coastline.</p><p>A massive amphibious aircraft leased from Russia joined the firefighting effort on the island. The Beriev Be-200 is the largest firefighting plane Greece currently has at its disposal.</p><p>Greek and European officials have blamed climate change for the multiple fires burning through swathes of southern Europe, from southern Italy to the Balkans, Greece and Turkey. Massive fires have been burning across Siberia in Russia's north for weeks, while hot, bone-dry, gusty weather has also fueled devastating wildfires in California, decimating whole towns in some cases. </p><p>Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, with temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Thousands have fled homes and holiday accommodation, while at least 20 people, including four firefighters, have been treated for injuries. Two of the firefighters were in intensive care in Athens, while another two were hospitalized with light burns, the Health Ministry said. </p><p>In neighboring Turkey, wildfires described as the worst in decades have swept through swaths of the southern coast for the past 10 days, killing eight people.</p><p>More than 1,000 firefighters and nearly 20 aircraft are now battling major fires across Greece. Several European countries are sending or already sent firefighters, planes, helicopters and vehicles to help, while Israel also announced it was sending firefighters.</p><p>In Turkey, authorities on Friday evacuated six more neighborhoods near the Mugla province town of Milas as a wildfire fanned by winds burned some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from a power plant. At least 36,000 people were evacuated to safety in Mugla province alone, officials said.</p><p>Meanwhile, several excavators cleared strips of land to form firebreaks in a bid to stop flames from reaching the Yenikoy power plant, the second such facility to be threatened by wildfires in the region. </p><p>Wildfires near the tourism resort of Marmaris, also in Mugla province, were largely contained by late Thursday, officials said, while at least two fires were still burning in Antalya province, another beach holiday destination.</p><p>In Greece, firefighters went door to door in areas around 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) north of Athens telling people to evacuate, while helicopters dropped water on towering flames and thick smoke blanketed the area. Authorities sent push alerts to mobile phones in the area urging residents to leave. </p><p>Constant flare-ups that threatened inhabited areas hampered the work of hundreds of firefighters there.</p><p>The fire halted traffic on the country's main highway connecting Athens to northern Greece and damaged electricity installations. The power distribution company announced rolling cuts in the wider capital region to protect the electrical grid. </p><p>In the Drosopigi area, resident Giorgos Hatzispiros surveyed the damage to his house Friday morning, the first time he was seeing it after being ordered to evacuate the previous afternoon. Only the charred walls of the single-story home remained, along with his children's bicycles, somehow unscathed in a storeroom. Inside, smoke rose from a still-smoldering bookcase. </p><p>\u201cNothing is left,\u201d Hatzispiros said. He urged his mother to leave, to spare her the sight of their destroyed home. </p><p>In southern Greece, nearly 60 villages and settlements were evacuated Thursday and early Friday. In addition to Evia, fires were burning in multiple locations in the southern Peloponnese region where a blaze was stopped before reaching monuments at Olympia, birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games. </p><p>A summer palace outside Athens once used by the former Greek royal family was also spared. </p><p>The fires also disrupted COVID-19 vaccinations. The Health Ministry announced the suspension of vaccinations at centers in areas affected by the fires, saying appointments could be rescheduled when conditions allow.</p><p>\u201cOur priority is always the protection of human life, followed by the protection of property, the natural environment and critical infrastructure. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, achieving all these aims at the same time is simply impossible,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address Thursday night. </p><p>The wildfires, he said, display \u201cthe reality of climate change.\u201d</p><p>In 2018, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire engulfed a seaside settlement east of Athens. Some of them drowned trying to escape by sea from the choking smoke and flames after becoming trapped on a beach.</p><p>____</p><p>Becatoros reported from Argostoli, Greece, and Fraser from Ankara, Turkey.

K21-25 to K21-28 tested the area around the anomalous gold value that was returned earlier in drill hole K21-21 on the south side of Beauregard Lake. K21-29 to K21-34 tested IP anomalies on the Pakwash fault east of Beauregard Lake. The final hole in the program, K21-35, tested a mag and structural anomaly with weak IP in an area northwest of Beauregard Lake that is now interpreted to be directly up ice of the high gold in till values returned in early 2020.</p><p>Hole K21-35, which was just completed on October 1, cut multiple zones of brick red potassic alteration associated with brecciation, silicification, hematite and up to 15% disseminated sulfides. This hole was located off the main trend of the Pakwash fault targeting a crosscutting northwest trending magnetic anomaly associated with a weak IP anomaly. Recent geological fieldwork has established a 040 degree ice direction, which is much steeper than previously understood. This places K21-035 directly up ice of the strong gold in till results found on the West Grid. This alteration is very similar to a style of mineralization seen in the Red Lake region, in particular in the Spring Pole deposit area in the north end of the Uchi belt.</p><p>There are a number of untested weak IP anomalies beneath conductive overburden that are now potential targets and a large area of the northern part of the property has yet to be surveyed by IP. The original Kwai gold showing is in this area of unexplored terrain.</p><p>Figure 1: Red Lake District Properties including the Kwai and SLF properties of Golden Goliath</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Figure 1, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d</url></p><p>In July four holes were drilled to follow up on an anomalous gold value of 864 ppb over 1 m in hole K21-21 and these were K21-25 to K21-28, all of which intersected a shear-fault zone on the south side of Beauregard Lake in a feature parallel to and south of the Pakwash Fault. Although no further gold values were encountered in these four holes, a 400-500m long section of the structure with associated IP anomalies has yet to be drill tested.</p><p>The area east of Beauregard Lake was tested by holes K21-29 to K21-34 on lines 28E, 30E, 32E, 34E, 39E and 41E. Three other potential gold settings were encountered. Silicified sediments similar to those that occur on the Great Bear Dixie property to the north lie along a basalt contact, and wide albite alteration zones occur in holes 31 and 32. In addition a shear zone in basalt was found in hole K21-34 with disseminated pyrite and lenses of quartz. Assays are pending on these holes.</p><p>Figure2: Kwai Property showing completed drill hole locations</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Figure 2, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/4761/98600_d</url></p><p>The drill was then moved to an area north of the West Grid on line 6E where hole K21-35 intersected the very interesting zone of potassic alteration, silicification and hematite. A pause in the program will now take place to give time for assays to catch up prior to expanding the coverage of the Kwai project.</p><p>Golden Goliath CEO Paul Sorbara PGeo comments:</p><p>\"This drilling project, in such a great area of prospective geology, continues to excite our team as we explore along the Pakwash fault boundary edge of the Uchi Subprovince. We have confidence in the potential of the Kwai property given the number of favourable environments we have identified and, given the recent LP Fault deep drilling success at Great Bear, the fact that all of our drill holes are shallow. Our improved understanding of the geology, ice history, and models of mineralization are focusing our search. I would also like to thank Niigaani drilling, and the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, and Forestry for ensuring our program could be completed through what was a very difficult forest fire season in the area.\"</p><p>QAQC</p><p>All the gold values reported in this round of drilling were obtained by fire assaying 30 gm samples.

Selangor Fire and Rescue Department...</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sep 27, 2021( Digital Journal: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com\">http://www.digitaljournal.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Frequented by presidents, Supreme Court justices and even the occasional movie star, it is the transport of choice for some of the world's most powerful movers and shakers \u2014 yet few Americans know it exists. <br/> The Capitol Subway System, a network of trolleys in the fluorescent-lit bowels of the labyrinthine, 600-room US Congress in Washington, has been ferrying politicians back and forth for more than a century. </p><p><br/> The journey is just enough time for lawmakers such as Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, pictured in 2008, to engage in serious political conversation, idle gossip, an impromptu press conference or a pleasant daydream. \u2014  AFP<br/> It has made headlines as the scene of a botched assassination bid, an impromptu off-Broadway stage and a hiding place for a president who disappeared from the Oval Office without telling anyone. <br/> 'Children love it so there are always senators who are willing to bring family members with young children, nieces and nephews, to ride on it,' Dan Holt, an assistant historian at the Senate Historical Office, told AFP. <br/> 'And so I think there's just something kind of special about it.' <br/> The track stretches 3,100 feet \u2014 a shade under a kilometer \u2014 with the 90-second hop between stations just enough for serious political debate, idle gossip, an impromptu press conference or a moment of quiet reverie. <br/> 'Think about getting on the train to ride to work in other contexts, where you have that moment where you can just sit for a minute and think \u2014 or sit and have casual conversation,' Holt said. <br/> 'The train in the Capitol has served that purpose as well over time.' <br/> Barack Obama may be one of the world's most famous faces but to his fellow subway passengers in 2007, he was just another senator. \u2014  AFP<br/> It has also provided useful photo opportunities for presidential hopefuls looking to show the common touch, such as Ronald Reagan, although a boyish JFK \u2014 then just plain old Senator Jack Kennedy \u2014 was once refused entry and scolded to 'stand aside for the senators, son.' <br/> - 'Good fortune bad marksmanship' - <br/> Today, the bustling main station is abuzz whenever the Senate is in session, with journalists waiting patiently to swarm legislators as they disembark to vote in the upper chamber. <br/> But the cut-and-thrust of political discourse isn't always as convivial below ground as it is on the Senate floor. <br/> In 1950, Maine senator Margaret Chase Smith was preparing to deliver a rebuke to fellow Republican Joe McCarthy when the intimidating anti-communist crusader and smear-artist saw her in a subway car. <br/> 'Margaret, you look very serious,' Smithlater recalled McCarthy saying, according to Holt.'Are you going to make a speech?' <br/> 'Yes,' she responded, 'and you're not going to like it very much.' <br/> Three years earlier the subway had seen its only recorded assassination attempt, when disgruntled ex-Capitol Police officer William Kaiser opened fire from a .22-caliber pistol on presidential hopeful John Bricker. <br/> The Ohio senator dived for cover into the waiting subway car, yelling at the driver to whisk him away, as a second bullet whistled over his head. <br/> 'Only good fortune and the bad marksmanship of his assailant saved the senator,' The New York Times reported after the gunman fled the scene, only to be arrested later. <br/> Actor Denzel Washington, pictured in 2018 after riding the Capitol Subway, is a among a long list of celebrity patrons that also includes Richard Gere, Chuck Norris, Jon Stewart and the rock star Bono. \u2014  AFP<br/> In less querulous times, political leaders have seen the subway as something of a refuge from the frenetic pace of Washington politics. <br/> William Howard Taft, the 27th president, alarmed aides one Saturday in January 1911 when he went missing for around an hour to go see the trains. <br/> 'A keen thrill of fear swept over the city when anxious inquiries at the White House brought forth the reply that the president could not be found. The alarm spread like a forest fire,' the Washington Times reported at the time. <br/> - Show tunes - <br/> The first subway was opened on March 7 1909 for senators hoping to avoid the punishing Washington heat as they went between their offices and the upper chamber. <br/> Electric Studebaker automobiles were replaced by a monorail with its own track three years later and, in 1960, officials added four $75,000 electric subway cars \u2014 dubbed 'swift chariots of democracy' by the Senate chaplain. <br/> This 1934 image courtesy of the Library of Congress, shows people riding the US Capitol's subway system. \u2014  AFP<br/> A House line connected the Rayburn House Office Building to the Capitol five years after that and, in 1993, an $18 million Disneyland-style driverless train was introduced to great fanfare. <br/> Not everyone supported these improvements. Some senators grumbled about bumpy rides while others complainedthat their delicately coiffured hair was being ruined by gusts of wind. Ohio's Mike DeWine banned his staff from riding in protest against government waste. <br/> Future presidents aside, the system's famous patrons have included actors Richard Gere, Chuck Norris and Denzel Washington, satirist Jon Stewart and the rock star Bono. <br/> Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award-winningcreator of hit musical 'Hamilton,' decided to take a midnight ride and belt out show tunes for his Twitter following when he was in the building to receive an award in 2017. <br/> Some Capitol Hill staff see the gentility of subway interactions becoming rarer as health-conscious politicians with step-counting devices increasingly take to walking between buildings. <br/> But the clientele will never truly disappear as long as the urgent task of running the country requires busy people to be in 10 places at once. <br/> 'If you're in a rush, it's great,' Holt told AFP. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subway\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;linkname=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subwayhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaljournal.com%2Fworld%2Fswift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway%2Farticle&amp;#38;title=%27Swift%20chariots%20of%20democracy%27%3A%20all%20aboard%20Washington%27s%20secret%20subway</url><br/>The post 'Swift chariots of democracy': all aboard Washington's secret subway[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/swift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway/article\">https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/swift-chariots-of-democracy-all-aboard-washingtons-secret-subway/article</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com\">https://www.digitaljournal.com</url></p><p/>", "<p>40 YEARS AGO The Clearwater District Forest Office has reported nine fires so far this season with three of those still burning and under observation.

The Canadian Mental Health Association reports that suicide is one of the leading causes of death for both men and women from adolescence to middle age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How can society combat this epidemic? While there are medications to ease the effects of anxiety and depression, it is not a cure. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for depression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Everybody is sensitive to different things and has different thresholds. What barely bruises the ego for one person can be shattering to another person's sense of self.</p><p>But just because depression can't be eradicated doesn't mean that we should admit defeat. Metaphorically speaking, sadness is an illness of the heart and the heart is a muscle. Therefore, we can train it to be stronger. Just as our bodies can heal themselves, so can our hearts. We just need to figure out how to confront and tame our pain.</p><p>Using tarot as a meditation tool can help us understand and take control of our emotions. Because tarot is a reflection of life, it contains cards that speak of life's unpleasant events. Contemplating these \"negative\" cards can help us find the strength to face it with maturity. Studying their lessons can give us the determination to move through it.</p><p>The following cards reflect some of the rough patches in life's journey:</p><p>Card: 3 of Swords</p><p>This card is about heartbreaks. It can be caused by anything ranging from dramatic betrayals akin to those found in soap operas to quietly repressed disappointment. It represents all those times we felt let down and not receiving the results we'd hoped for in spite of our best and most sincere efforts. If left unchecked, pain can hijack our emotions until it's all we have room for in our hearts.</p><p>Although pain is something we try to avoid, when we do feel it, it's important to remember that this is an important life experience. Pain offers us a chance to grow. Taking time to understand how our hearts got broken will make us wiser, making us less likely to commit to the same situations and people in the future. Also, because it can be frightening to face the things that hurt us, we gain strength and courage once we make peace with it.</p><p>Card: 5 of Swords</p><p>In this card, we see the end of a battle. The victor holds the spoils while the losers walk away with their tails between their legs. This card speaks about those times when we feel beaten and defeated. There was no glory in a good fight, only the bitterness and humiliation of failure.</p><p>During these moments, it's easy to believe that nothing good came out of it. The irony here is that failure is a prerequisite to success. Every great figure in history has failed before. They say that whatever doesn't kill you will make you stronger. I say that it can also make you better. Moments of failures are windows of opportunity to self-reflect in ways we don't do when we feel good about ourselves. It forces us to confront our own weaknesses and arrogance.</p><p>Did we lose because we weren't well prepared? Or did we choose the wrong fight altogether? Acknowledging where we went wrong will give us a better chance of getting it right the next time. So if we ever fall short of our goals and someone else beats us to the finish line, instead of wallowing in self-pity or assuming that the world is unfair, concentrate on how we can improve. Remember, those who refuse to see their own faults will never rise above the cycle of failure.</p><p>Card: Tower</p><p>When people are first introduced to tarot, many think that Death or the Devil are the most difficult cards to work with. Personally, I think the Tower is the most frightening card of all. Unlike Death, in which we gradually come to an end of a chapter, the changes brought forth by the Tower are sudden and unexpected. The lightning strikes the watch tower out of nowhere, destroying a structure that is supposed to protect us. It speaks about radical changes, often not in our favour.</p><p>So what good can possibly come from this? How can we grow and learn from tragic events beyond our own control?</p><p>In truth, words alone cannot offer enough comfort when the Tower pays us a visit. The loss and suffering must be endured seemingly without reason. It's perhaps the most difficult lesson one can learn in life: sometimes bad things happen to good people.</p><p>The key to recovery is time, faith and determination. A forest fire may seem like a tragic event. During these times, we must remember that nature never destroys without purpose. With time, new flora will grow over the nutrient-rich ashes.</p><p>Just like nature, we must learn to salvage what we can and focus on rebuilding. Use this as an opportunity to consciously restart your life.</p><p>Wing is a GTA-based tarot reader and teacher, you can find her on Instagram @tarotmechanic</p>", "<p>40 YEARS AGO:Clearwater Timber Products mills were shut down Friday when IWA employees staged an illegal work stoppage.</p><p>Later in the day Weyerhaeuser Vavenby mill was also closed down by similar action.</p><p>Reason for the walkout is believed to be an effort to secure a single provincial agreement for members rather than bargaining in three units as at present.</p><p>35 YEARS AGO:Chosen to represent the area as the 1986 Miss Clearwater May Queen was Miss Lisa Wilgosh.

Major topics were camping fees for those staying overnight at the campsites along the two lakes, canoeonly campsites and how to lessen congestion at the boat launch at the south end of Clearwater Lake.</p><p>Boaters staying overnight along the lakes will now pay $5 per vessel per night, explained Parks\u2019 Brian Carruthers.</p><p>25 YEARS AGO:It was worthy of prime time TV.</p><p>As the two RCMP officers waved at the oncoming car to stop for an alcohol check, the driver hit the gas and dodged past, speeding along the shoulder of the gravel road.</p><p>We all piled into the police vehicles and gave chase down Candle Creek Road headed for Highway 5, red light flashing.</p><p>Looking for an out, the fleeing driver made a sharp turn onto a dirt road, the open front passenger side door of the car open and swinging wildly.</p><p>The desperate move proved just that, desperate, as the suspect vehicle was forced to a halt in the yard of a private residence approximately one-half kilometre later. Sgt. Henry, in the lead vehicle, leaped out of the unmarked police cruiser, collared the suspect driver, threw him over the trunk of his car and cuffed him while police service dog Brig, riding in the second RCMP vehicle, barked wildly and two of the suspect vehicle passengers screamed that the third needed medical attention.</p><p>20 YEARS AGO: Licenses and the rest of the forest sector have to recognize that First Nations have an underlying ownership title to the land.</p><p>That was the message brought by North Thompson Indian Band chief Nathan Matthew to about 30 local foresters at a breakfast meeting in Clearwater.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part for people to accept,\u201d said Matthew. \u201cMost can agree on the soft stuff, but when it gets to ownership of the land it gets difficult. It\u2019s a legal issue. \u201cThe companies want more power, and First Nations are seen as an impediment to that. This has led to First Nations being pushed out the door.\u201d</p><p>Possibly First Nations should share in stumpage and other resource revenue collected from their traditional territory, he felt. 15 YEARS AGO:RCMP officer and father of five, Chris Newel, is riding in the Cops for Kids Charitable Foundation in September. He says he\u2019s looking forward to the challenging 1,000 kilometre, nineday ride.</p><p>Newel first became interested in the ride when he saw the Cops for Cancer riders in the fall. However, due to location, he just couldn\u2019t get onboard. So this year, Newel is able to ride for Cops for Kids and raise some much-needed funds.</p><p>\u201cI was a little hesitant at first because it\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can just do on a whim.\u201d</p><p>Newel needs to have $1,500 in pledges before he can rise, but he\u2019s aiming for a total of $3,000 by September.</p><p>10 YEARS AGO:Black Press publisher Al Kirkwood said he\u2019s more than a little proud of how his papers fared at the recent Canadian Community Newspapers Assocation and B.C. and Yukon Community Newspaper Association\u2019s awards held during the Ink and Beyond conference, at the River Rock Resort in Richmond on April 30 and May 1. Kirkwood, commented that it takes outstanding staff to mold all facets of a newspaper into an award-winning publication. And that\u2019s why the staff at both papers, especially The Times, are celebrating their recent triumphs.</p><p>The North Thompson Times took first place honours at the CNA Awards for Best All-Round Newspaper circulation up to 1249, and Best Editorial Page circulation up to 1249.</p><p>5 YEARS AGO:Clearwater resident Tom Grimm and his son, Brue, recently returned home after being evacuated from Fort McMurray.</p><p>\u201cCompared to Fort Mac, 2003 was just a campfire,\u201d according to the elder Grimm.</p><p>Tom was comparing the forest fire that forced the evacuation last week of that northern Alberta town with the fire of 13 years ago that destroyed Louis Creek and forced the evacuation of much of the lower North Thompson Valley.</p><p>Grimm, a heavy equipment operator, had experience fighting both.</p><p>The fire behaviour at Fort McMurray was much more extreme, he said, and the damage to homes and property far more extensive.</p><p>\u201cI was on top of a hill they call Super Test in Fort Mac,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI looked toward town and it looked as if three or four volcanoes were going off.\u201d</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sometimes it feels like dissatisfaction is the backdrop of modern living. The Canadian Mental Health Association reports that suicide is one of the leading causes of death for both men and women from adolescence to middle age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How can society combat this epidemic? While there are medications to ease the effects of anxiety and depression, it is not a cure. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for depression. Everybody is sensitive to different things and has different thresholds. What barely bruises the ego for one person can be shattering to another person's sense of self.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But just because depression can't be eradicated doesn't mean that we should admit defeat. Metaphorically speaking, sadness is an illness of the heart and the heart is a muscle. Therefore, we can train it to be stronger. Just as our bodies can heal themselves, so can our hearts. We just need to figure out how to confront and tame our pain.</p><p>Using tarot as a meditation tool can help us understand and take control of our emotions. Because tarot is a reflection of life, it contains cards that speak of life's unpleasant events. Contemplating these \"negative\" cards can help us find the strength to face it with maturity. Studying their lessons can give us the determination to move through it.</p><p>The following cards reflect some of the rough patches in life's journey:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Card: 3 of Swords</emphasis></p><p>This card is about heartbreaks. It can be caused by anything ranging from dramatic betrayals akin to those found in soap operas to quietly repressed disappointment. It represents all those times we felt let down and not receiving the results we'd hoped for in spite of our best and most sincere efforts. If left unchecked, pain can hijack our emotions until it's all we have room for in our hearts.</p><p>Although pain is something we try to avoid, when we do feel it, it's important to remember that this is an important life experience. Pain offers us a chance to grow. Taking time to understand how our hearts got broken will make us wiser, making us less likely to commit to the same situations and people in the future. Also, because it can be frightening to face the things that hurt us, we gain strength and courage once we make peace with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Card: 5 of Swords</emphasis></p><p>In this card, we see the end of a battle. The victor holds the spoils while the losers walk away with their tails between their legs. This card speaks about those times when we feel beaten and defeated. There was no glory in a good fight, only the bitterness and humiliation of failure.</p><p>During these moments, it's easy to believe that nothing good came out of it. The irony here is that failure is a prerequisite to success. Every great figure in history has failed before. They say that whatever doesn't kill you will make you stronger. I say that it can also make you better. Moments of failures are windows of opportunity to self-reflect in ways we don't do when we feel good about ourselves. It forces us to confront our own weaknesses and arrogance.</p><p>Did we lose because we weren't well prepared? Or did we choose the wrong fight altogether? Acknowledging where we went wrong will give us a better chance of getting it right the next time. So if we ever fall short of our goals and someone else beats us to the finish line, instead of wallowing in self-pity or assuming that the world is unfair, concentrate on how we can improve. Remember, those who refuse to see their own faults will never rise above the cycle of failure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Card: Tower</emphasis></p><p>When people are first introduced to tarot, many think that Death or the Devil are the most difficult cards to work with. Personally, I think the Tower is the most frightening card of all. Unlike Death, in which we gradually come to an end of a chapter, the changes brought forth by the Tower are sudden and unexpected. The lightning strikes the watch tower out of nowhere, destroying a structure that is supposed to protect us. It speaks about radical changes, often not in our favour.</p><p>So what good can possibly come from this? How can we grow and learn from tragic events beyond our own control?</p><p>In truth, words alone cannot offer enough comfort when the Tower pays us a visit. The loss and suffering must be endured seemingly without reason. It's perhaps the most difficult lesson one can learn in life: sometimes bad things happen to good people.</p><p>The key to recovery is time, faith and determination. A forest fire may seem like a tragic event. During these times, we must remember that nature never destroys without purpose. With time, new flora will grow over the nutrient-rich ashes. Just like nature, we must learn to salvage what we can and focus on rebuilding. Use this as an opportunity to consciously restart your life.</p><p>Wing is a GTA-based tarot reader and teacher, you can find her on Instagram @tarotmechanic</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another 69 Canadians are heading to Australia this week to help fight the country's worst bush fires in recent memory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne says the deployment comes after Australia asked for more help.</p><p>More than 200 bush fires continue to rage across Australia, with the two most populated states of New South Wales and Victoria bearing the brunt of the damage.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says 27 incident management staff will leave for Melbourne Thursday, followed by two more incident managers and 40 firefighters on the weekend.</p><p>This is the sixth wave of Canadians helping out in Australia, bringing the total number to more than 160 people.</p><p>The first group of 21 experts left for Australia in early December, and returned to Canada last week.</p><p>The latest wave will spend 31 days, all of it in the state of Victoria.

(AP) &amp; - The monstrous wildfire burning in Oregon has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.</p><p>The 476-square-mile (1,210-square-kilometer) Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles (483 kilometers) southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges.</p><p>If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, \"it would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,\" said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University's College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. \"But it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It's not the Bay Area out there.\"</p><p>At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.</p><p>Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote.</p><p>Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek &amp; - both with fewer than 250 people &amp; - and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.</p><p>\"The Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas,\" Johnston said. \"There are no suburbs in that area.\"</p><p>But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's current size puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.</p><p>These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.</p><p>The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) in 2002 in the Rogue River&amp;#x26;#8211;Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The largest fire of any type was the Long Draw Fire in 2012, which incinerated 872 square miles (2,260 square kilometers) of mostly sagebrush and rangeland in the endless expanses of southeastern Oregon, where almost no one lives.</p><p>By the time the Bootleg Fire is extinguished months from now, it will likely be as big or bigger than those fires, but research shows that Oregon once experienced megafires much larger than these fairly often, Johnston said.</p><p>\"I think it's important for us to take the long view of wildfire. In the context of the last couple hundreds years, the Bootleg Fire is not large,\" he said. \"One of the things my lab group does is reconstruct historical fires, and fires that were burning in that area in the 1600s and 1700s were just as big as the Bootleg Fire or bigger.\"</p><p>That's little reassurance for fire crews battling the current blaze, which is 25% contained.</p><p>On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.</p><p>Fire pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said.</p><p>Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple \"slop fires\" &amp; - patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze &amp; - before they grew in size. One of those smaller fires was already nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in size. Thunderstorms with dry lightning were possible Monday as well, heightening the dangers.</p><p>\"We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,\" said Joe Hessel, incident commander. \"This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday, affecting a total of 767 square miles (1,986 square kilometers), the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center said.</p><p>Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>At the other end of Oregon, a fire in the northeast mountains grew to nearly 26 square miles (49 square kilometers).</p><p>The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, rural communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.</p><p>Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.</p><p>A complex of fires where the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho meet also grew, reaching 167 square miles (433 square kilometers). The Snake River Complex was 44% contained. The complex was made up of three fires started by lightning on July 7. Flames were chewing through a mix of grass and timber in an extremely remote area of steep terrain about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Lewiston, Idaho.</p><p>And in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 36 square miles (93 square kilometers) with no containment.</p><p>Thunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>Gillian Flaccus, The Associated Press</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each year, the Forest Resource Improvement Association of Alberta (FRIAA) requests Expressions of Interest to municipalities wanting vegetation cleared or forests thinned. Of the 51 applicants, FRIAA approved 36 proposals for a total cost of $2,437,513.25. The majority of the FireSmart programs commenced in late January 2021 and will continue through to the Spring and Fall. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The specific FireSmart project west of Fox Creek will consist of thinning the forest and mulching trees that are down or deadfall still standing. The neighbouring forested section, which has unmerchantable trees, is slated to be piled and burned. For the last three years, several areas on both sides of Highway 43, just east of Fox Creek, have had FireSmart work completed. The northside underwent thinning, and mulching and the cutline on the southside that runs parallel to Highway 43 was cleared of overgrown vegetation by Wildland fire crews conducting a controlled burn, thus creating a fire break between the forest and the highway.  </p><p>As Albertans, we know all too well the devastation that wildfires cause. Thousands of hectares of our timber resources are destroyed each year, costing billions of dollars in lost revenue for lumber mills, contributing to the shortage of lumber for export and retail, not to mention the wildlife that relies on our forests for shelter, food and survival. The impacts are much more severe when a wildfire gets out of control and encroaches into residential areas. Hundreds of homes can be destroyed quickly, which also puts human life at risk. Many still struggle with the aftermath of the Slave Lake, Fort McMurray and the Chuckegg Creek fires in 2019.  </p><p>The FireSmart project aims to reduce wildfires' risk from entering into populated areas. Managing overgrown vegetation, removing dead trees and surface fuels can help slow the spread should a fire occur. Reducing ground fuels can minimize flames from reaching into the treetops. Keep in mind; that not all ground fuels can be eliminated, but if shrubs are cut back, tall vegetation and deadfall removed, it all helps lessen the height of the fire\u2019s flames and intensity levels. The thinning of the forest is another critical factor that helps reduce the speed at which fire spreads. A third factor for protecting the forest is delimbing the lower branches close to the ground. By increasing space between the ground and the branches, the flames will have less chance of climbing the tree and reaching the crown.  </p><p>Knowing the three types of wildfires will help to understand why FireSmart programs are so important and effective in reducing the spread of forest fires. The first is an underground fire. These occur in areas where there\u2019s muskeg or an abundance of dead vegetation beneath the soil. Once ignited, they can smoulder for months or years and pose a risk of surface ignition. Next is a ground or surface fire. The fire stays relatively low to the ground and only burns surface vegetation and debris. </p><p>A prime example would be forested areas where FireSmart took place. Surface fires cause the least damage to our resources and are the easiest for firefighters to control and extinguish relatively quickly. The last and most dangerous is the crown fire. Once flames reach the crown, it will continue to spread from treetop to treetop quickly and become unpredictable and difficult for firefighters to battle. The previous large wildfires we've experienced in Northern Alberta have been crown fires. Again, participating in the FireSmart programs, cleaning up deadfall, and low-hanging branches all reduce a crown fire's chances.  </p><p>The thinning process and removing deadfall require the trees to be put in piles and burned. The safest time to conduct these burns is during the winter months, as the chance of starting a forest fire is significantly reduced. One drawback to burning large piles in the winter is its smoke. Forestry officials plan the burns on days when the weather is most favourable, but we all know that can change quickly, creating issues. For burns along the highway, such as what\u2019s occurring in Fox Creek, it can become a significant hazard for motorists. Smoke can accumulate and travel a great distance if a weather inversion occurs during burning. An inversion occurs when colder air is trapped near the ground by a warm layer above, and there\u2019s little to no wind. Once this happens, it will force the smoke to linger closer to ground level and not dissipate, creating poor visibility for long distances. According to Alberta Wildfire, the best burn practices are to burn in stages to reduce smoke and have time to adapt to the changing weather. Also, watch weather conditions and don't burn if an inversion is forecasted, and lastly, the perfect days to burn brush are when the temperatures remain consistent and wind speeds are 5 km/h or greater.  </p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">As you enter Cedar Hill Christmas Tree's long driveway in Pakenham, Christmas thoughts start to fill your mind as you see tiny fir trees lined up in the distance and catch a glimpse of wooden green reindeers prancing on top of hay bales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Christmas is always in season here,\" said Pam Martin, co-owner of the 114-acre tree farm. This year, the Martin family have decided to open early, with their kickoff event \"Fall into Christmas\" offering pancakes on the porch all served outdoors by Fulton's Pancake House.</p><p>\"We're looking forward to this fall event, we've never done it,\" she said. The event runs every weekend from September 26 until November 1 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. They also offer wagon rides around the farm for $3, a scavenger hunt (beginner to advance levels), a zip line, treats such as brownies, butter tarts, doughnuts and cookies to enjoy, and cute little bunnies to purchase.</p><p>Martin's 12-year-old son Graham bred bunnies as a lockdown project and is selling them for $40 each.</p><p>The store will be open to get a head start on Christmas shopping with Christmas ornaments and decor, handmade wreaths and new offerings of gourmet food available to purchase.</p><p>\"The gourmet food section is new to us. We worked really hard to source them all - all made locally in Ontario. My husband actually went to most of the places and picked them up directly from the farms,\" Martin said.</p><p>Martin is particularly proud of a special blend of hot sauce made out of new little growth from their farm's fir trees called \"Blazing Forest Fire,\" which she sent to a producer to manufacture.</p><p>Prior to taking over the farm in 2016, Martin's family were organic dairy farmers. As former members of the primary food supply chain, she holds farmers near and dear to her heart.</p><p>\"That's why we wanted to feature, focus and support other local farmers (by carrying their products). Farmers are the unsung heroes. You take for granted that when you go to the grocery store that there'd be food there, but it doesn't just appear on the shelves, there's a lot of work that goes into it,\" Martin said.</p><p>Martin also talked about the notion people have that growing Christmas trees is easy. \"People think we just plant the tree and that's it. It's a massive amount of work to grow a perfect looking tree. Most people don't appreciate how much work goes into it,\" she said.</p><p>For instance, in early summer they \"have to go out to every single tree and pull all the pine cones out by hand. Some trees will have 700 pine cones,\" she said.</p><p>If they don't pull all the pine cones out, the cones will shatter, ooze sap and ruin the tree. \"It takes us about three weeks to do that,\" Martin said. They also have to prune, fertilize and mow between the fir trees, which won't be ready to be full grown Christmas trees for eight years.</p><p>Looking ahead to Halloween, Martin plans on inviting kids to the farm.</p><p>\"Halloween may look a little bit different this year, we don't really know yet, but they can come here and be completely physically distant, do the scavenger hunt in their costumes and just enjoy the day,\" Martin said.</p><p>As for handing out candy, Martin has this to say: \"When you go trick or treating in a Christmas farm, you're going to get candy canes.\"</p><p>Cedar Hill Christmas Tree has launched their online store and will be selling Christmas trees from Nov. 12 until Dec. 24. They are located at 951 8th Concession South, Pakenham.

One fire burning near Rock Creek is very low danger. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Six days ago only 16 fires were considered extreme danger but high temperatures and no precipitation for the third week in a row have created a tinder dry forest undergrowth. No other area of the province is as at risk and currently beset by wildfires as the Southeast. </p><p>The Southern Interior only received 30 per cent of normal June rainfall, said Kim Wright, Southeast Fire Centre communications officer, and below-average spring precipitation with above seasonal temperatures accelerated the drying of forest fuels \u201cat a rate not previously observed, making them highly susceptible to ignition.\u201d </p><p>This has advanced the fire season. The region currently has 241 fire starts this year (65 active), 133 fire starts ahead of the five-year average. </p><p>\u201cBurning conditions across much of the province are currently three to four weeks ahead of schedule and more typical of average mid-July or August conditions,\u201d she said.  </p><p>\u201cFuels right now are very susceptible to ignition throughout the southern part of the province.\u201d </p><p>Above seasonal temperatures are forecasted to persist through the southern half of the province, she added. </p><p>With all of the fires burning, BC Wildfire Service is not fighting every one of them. The Service responds to wildfires on a priority basis within the Southeast Fire Centre, said Wright, with the top priority being human life and safety.  </p><p>The second priority is property, she added, with the third priority protection of areas with high environmental values including community watersheds and species at risk. The fourth priority is resource values.  </p><p>Other areas of Canada and the U.S. are facing similar issues, said Wright, and have resources tied up with their own wildfires. </p><p>\u201cThis means that some of the provinces and countries that would normally help out during B.C.\u2019s fire season are currently busy fighting their own wildfires and are unable to assist as much as they could under different circumstances,\u201d she said, noting that resources are being deployed strategically as a result. </p><p>Currently, there are two fires threatening communities or rural homes in the region, with the 742-hectare Trozzo Creek fire the closest to a community (Winlaw) in the area around Nelson.  </p><p>The lightning-caused, active fire is 7.5 kilometres northeast of Winlaw, with the Wildfire Service reporting all \u201ccontainment lines held, minimal growth\u201d as of Saturday.  </p><p>\u201cThis fire is visible from Winlaw, Nelson, Castlegar and surrounding areas, as well as to those travelling on Highway 6 in the area,\u201d said Wright about the fire.  </p><p>Even though the fire is not considered an interface fire \u2014 threatening homes \u2014 it is deploying 72 firefighters, three helicopters and seven pieces of heavy equipment to fight it. </p><p>According to the Southeast Fire Centre, \u201cgood progress was made yesterday (Saturday), with active danger tree assessing and falling\u201d taking place on the Trozzo Forest Service road that allowed for safe passage for water tenders to supply water to ground crews to the west.  </p><p>\u201cA fuel free was constructed and overlaid with hose and sprinklers from the north flank of the to the fire,\u201d a release from the centre noted. </p><p>In order to provide additional safe access for fire crews, two additional helipads were constructed, allowing suppression efforts to push farther into the higher elevation.  </p><p>Containment efforts are centring on the western and northwestern perimeters, with a guard extending toward the southwest to hold the fire in the upper Winlaw Creek drainage \u2014 which flows down into the community of Winlaw. </p><p>\u201cHelicopters will continue to provide support by bucketing the fire and moving equipment as needed,\u201d the report explained. </p><p>Other fires of note: </p><p>\u2022 The Octopus Creek fire is located about 11 kilometres south of Fauquier and is estimated to be 1,172 hecatres. The Regional District of Central Kootenay has implemented an evacuation order for five properties on the south side of Taite Creek, including the Taite Creek recreation site. An evacuation alert is also in place for 162 properties in the communities of Applegrove and Fauquier.  </p><p>\u2022 The Michaud Creek fire is located about 21 km south of Edgewood and is estimated to be 2,500 hectares. The RDCK has implemented an evacuation order for two properties in the Cinnamon Lake and Johnson Creek areas. An evacuation alert is also in place for properties in the communities of Edgewood and Needles. </p><p>Taking action on the home front </p><p>As this period of heightened fire behaviour continues, now is the time for homeowners to prepare themselves and property for wildfire, noted Wright.  </p><p>Preparing in advance for a potential wildfire in the area that may result in an evacuation alert or order can make the experience less stressful for everyone.  </p><p>Wright suggested taking the time now to develop a household evacuation plan, assemble an emergency kit and talk to neighbours.  </p><p>People can visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.FireSmartBC.ca\">www.FireSmartBC.ca</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.preparedbc.ca\">www.preparedbc.ca</url> to find resources to help prepare for wildfire. </p><p>\u201cIf a wildfire is directly threatening your community, the best information sources are your municipality, regional district, band office or local authority,\u201d she said. \u201cFind out in advance how they\u2019ll share vital information, whether it\u2019s via Facebook, Twitter, a website or phone number.\u201d </p><p>The importance of fire </p><p>Although the effect of a forest fire on domestic structures and some stands of timber can be devastating, there is an important role that fire plays. </p><p>Fire is a natural and essential ecological process and has influenced nearly all forest and grassland environments in British Columbia, said Wright.  </p><p>\u201cA wildfire is a \u2018natural disturbance event,\u2019 an acute environmental disruption that causes long-term changes to the affected ecosystem,\u201d she said.  </p><p>Following a wildfire, a resilient ecosystem \u2014 the ability to resist and recover from natural disturbances \u2014 will recover more quickly and will be more biodiverse, Wright added.  </p><p>\u201cFire is a natural component of B.C.\u2019s ecosystems, so when a wildfire is burning away from people, property, environmental values or resource values, it can actually be more beneficial than harmful in the long term,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">A top science adviser says Ontario is far from in the clear despite a downward trend in COVID-19 cases, while some provinces criticized Ottawa for lower-than-expected vaccine shipments and the pandemic was flagged as an outsized contributor to Quebec's death count last year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canada's most populous province reported 2,093 new infections Thursday and 56 more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus.

Quebec has received 411,200 doses of AstraZeneca and 267,000 remain unused. </p><p>The AstraZeneca vaccine is available to Quebecers between the ages of 55 and 79 at walk-in clinics and by appointment across the province. Quebec suspended use of that vaccine in those younger than 55 over concerns about rare blood clots in a small number of recipients. </p><p>While Montreal was the hardest-hit region in Quebec during the first and second wave of the pandemic, the number of new, daily cases in the city has remained relatively stable since late February. </p><p>Dr. Sarah-Amelie Mercure, the associate medical chief for infection and disease control at Montreal's public health authority, said that while officials have seen a slight increase in the number of new cases, the city is not reporting the explosive growth in infections that's been seen in other parts of the province.</p><p>Mercure said there are a number of factors limiting the spread of COVID-19 in Montreal, including relatively strict health orders that limit contacts and a more aggressive, targeted approach to controlling the spread of variants. </p><p>Public health has begun conducting more exhaustive contact-tracing investigations, she said in an interview Friday. \"We're really looking for the source. When we don't find the source, we look even further.\"</p><p>Going further, she said, involves looking in places that have not reported cases for people who may have come into contact with an infected individual, adding that officials may also ask \"contacts of contacts\" to isolate.</p><p>Vaccination is also playing a role in some areas, such as residences for elderly people, but not enough people have been vaccinated for it to be having a large impact on transmission in the broader community, Mercure said. </p><p>But, she said, it's not impossible that in parts of the city, acquired immunity among people who have recovered from the virus is slowing transmission.</p><p>Montreal's \"relatively enviable\" situation remains fragile, Mercure said, adding that a couple superspreader events \u2014 like the one at a Quebec City gym linked to hundreds of cases \u2014 could change that rapidly.</p><p>Benoit Masse, a public health professor at Universite de Montreal, said part of the reason Montreal is not being affected as much as elsewhere is due to the way viruses are transmitted in a population.</p><p>\"The virus infects the most susceptible and the epidemic dies out when there are no more susceptible people to infect,\" he wrote in an email Friday, comparing the virus to a forest fire that moves to a new area once all the trees in one place are burned. </p><p>\"Since reinfections are very rare, an infected person who recovers is no longer likely to be reinfected.\"</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, Montreal has reported a total of around 6,000 confirmed cases for every 100,000 people, Masse wrote, adding that the real number of cases is likely three to five times higher.</p><p>Elsewhere in Quebec, he said, there has been an average of around 3,500 reported cases per 100,000 people, leaving more opportunities for the virus to spread. </p><p>Meanwhile, Quebec set a pair of records for COVID-19 injections, inoculating 74,927 people on Thursday \u2014 the highest single-day number of Quebecers vaccinated since the campaign started. That daily total included 15,522 doses administered in pharmacies, also a record. </p><p>The seven-day average for shots is 66,000 per day, well above what had been planned for April, Dube said Friday. Health officials said Quebec has vaccinated 26 per cent of the population with at least one dose.</p><p>The pace of the vaccine rollout bodes well for the province's plan to dole out 5.3 million doses \u2014 one for every adult \u2014 by the Fete nationale holiday on June 24, Dube said. </p><p>Quebec reported 1,527 new COVID-19 cases Friday and seven more deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus. Hospitalizations were up by three patients, to 664, and eight more people were in intensive care, for a total of 167.</p><p>Montreal reported 355 cases, followed by the Quebec City area with 294 and Chaudiere-Appalaches, south of the capital region, with 204.</p><p>Quebec has reported 334,071 COVID-19 infections and 10,785 deaths linked to the virus since the beginning of the pandemic.

(\"Battery\" or \"BMR\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that drilling intercepted 4 main cobalt mineralized structures on the recently completed and initial diamond drill program at the White Reserve Project located about 120 kilometres northeast of Sudbury and 30 kilometers southwest of town of Elk Lake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights: //st * 17 drillholes completed for 1,838 meters (\"m\"); * Targets identified from recent three-dimensional model of historic</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">underground mine workings and results of a recent geophysical model; * Samples have been dispatched for assay and results are pending.</p><p>About the White Reserve program</p><p>The White Reserve property comprises 616 mining claims totaling 12,984 hectares of contiguous mining claims located in Banks, Barber, Speight, Van Nostrand and Whitson townships (Figure 1). Much of the White Reserve property was burnt by a devastating forest fire during the summer of 2018 (Photo 1). The 2018 fires severely limited access to the property with only a limited number of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping and rock sampling traverses completed.</p><p>In 2019 a grid-based geophysical three-dimensional distributed induced polarization (\"3D IP\") survey was conducted by Canadian Exploration Services. Limited rock grab sampling of rock dumps and surface outcrops yielded anomalous cobalt values ranging from 0.02% to 3.90% cobalt and 0.26g/t to 5.90g/t silver.</p><p>BMR compiled a 3D geological model of the historic workings and main vein structures to identify targets and design the drill program (17 drillholes / 1,838m). The drilling targeted both strike and vertical extensions of the main veins and two high chargeability induced polarization geophysical targets.</p><p>The four main east-west striking quartz-carbonate-silver-cobalt vein structures were drill tested. Several of the holes were also planned to test a north-south high chargeability 3D IP geophysical anomaly located just west of the old mine workings in the Nipissing diabase (Figure 2 and Table 1). Targeting was as follows: //st * Holes WRS20-001 - 004: Tested the #21 Vein * Holes WRS20-005 - 006: Tested the #14 Vein * Holes WRS20-007 - 008: Tested the #10 Vein * Hole WRS20-009: Tested IP Chargeability Anomaly &amp;#7 Vein * Hole WRS20-010: Tested IP Chargeability * Hole WRS20-011: Tested the #7, #8 &amp;#9 Veins * Hole WRS20-012: Tested the #10 Vein * Holes WRS20-013 - 014: Tested the #14 Vein * Holes WRS20-015 - 016: Tested the #7 Vein</p><p>Detailed core logging and sampling has been completed. Samples have been dispatched for assay. Results are pending.</p><p>Battery CEO Martin Kostuik states: \"We are encouraged that the 4 main mineralized vein structures targeted by this initial drill test were intercepted as-planned. This drilling targeted the historic mine area which includes 5 production shafts operating until approximately 1940. There remains an additional six known cobalt occurrences at White Reserve to be explored. We look forward to receiving the assay results and continuing this exciting portion of our Northern Ontario cobalt exploration program.\"</p><p>Background</p><p>The White Reserve project comprises a 15 km long, north-trending belt of Proterozoic Nipissing diabase that hosts seven cobalt-silver occurrences including the historic workings known as the White Reserve mine (Figure 3 and Figure 4). The minesite is nestled in a north-south trending valley bounded by high ridges of diabase.</p><p>The White Reserve mine was operated from 1909 - about 1940. Early mine development included sinking of a shaft to 45m with two levels at 21m and 43m. Four additional shafts and a total of 1105m of lateral underground workings were developed. Historically, 24 vein zones were located on the eastern and western rims of the diabase- enclosed valley. The more productive veins, #7, #10, #14, and #21 were explored with shafts and open cuts, the 3 former veins developed on the west side, and the latter, on the east. White Reserve mine \"reported historic\" production amounted to 19,775 ounces of silver &amp;452 pounds of cobalt from the #21 Vein.</p><p>The White Reserve project is dominated by a north-south striking Nipissing diabase sill, which intrudes quartzites and sandstones of the Lorraine formation, part of the Huronian Supergroup of the Cobalt Embayment. The diabase occurs mainly in the centre of the claim block. Regional north-south and northeast-trending faults transect the area.</p><p>Cobalt - silver mineralization is generally confined to the diabase in veins that parallel the numerous faults and structures. Cobalt - silver mineralization occurs as vein-filled fractures, ranging from hairline fractures to a maximum width of 0.08m. Vein selvages consist of epidote-hematite-altered zones. The dominant sulphide minerals are niccolite and smaltite, with minor amounts of native bismuth and silver. Disseminated cobalt sulphides are hosted in a granophyric phase of the Nipissing diabase. Additionally, disseminated cobalt-silver mineralization was noted up to 1.5 meters on either side of vein fractures.</p><p>Figure 1: White Reserve property location map</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Figure 1, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b</url></p><p>Note: *All coordinates are NAD83 UTM Zone 17N</p><p>Figure 2: White Reserve 2021 drill collar location plan on LiDAR topography</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Figure 2, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b</url></p><p>Figure 3: White Reserve geology map with cobalt-silver occurrences</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Figure 3, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b</url></p><p>Figure 4: 2018 White Reserve residual magnetic intensity (RMI) plot with cobalt-silver occurrences</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Figure 4, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b</url></p><p>Photo 1: 1909 Minesite boiler after the 2018 forest fire</p><p>To view an enhanced version of Photo 1, please visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b\">https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/6076/83029_b</url></p><p>Quality Control</p><p>Sample preparation, analysis and security procedures applied on the BMR exploration projects is aligned with industry best practice. BMR has implemented protocols and procedures to insure high quality collection and management of samples resulting in reliable exploration assay data. BMR has implemented formal analytical quality control monitoring for all of its field sampling and drilling programs by inserting blanks and certified reference materials into every sample sequence dispatched.</p><p>Sample preparation was performed by ALS Minerals Laboratories (ALS) in Sudbury, Ontario and sample analyses by ALS in North Vancouver, British Columbia. ALS analytical facilities are commercial laboratories and are independent from BMR. All BMR samples were bagged by BMR staff and delivered Upon receipt at the ALS Laboratory in Sudbury, samples were logged in a sophisticated laboratory information management system (LIMS) for sample tracking, scheduling, quality control, and electronic reporting. Samples were dried in special drying ovens prior to crushing. The samples were crushed to 70% ( -2 mm and a riffle split of 250 grams was then pulverized to 85% of the material achieving a size of (75 microns. These prepared samples were then shipped to the ALS Laboratory in North Vancouver for analyses by the following methods: //st * ME-MS61: A high precision, multi-acid digest including Hydrofluoric,</p><p>Nitric, Perchloric and Hydrochloric acids. Analysed by ICP (inductively</p><p>coupled plasma) mass spectrometry that produced results for 48 elements. * ME-OG62: Aqua-Regia digest: Analysed by ICP- AES (Atomic Emission</p><p>Spectrometry) or sometimes called optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)</p><p>for high levels of Co, Cu, Ni and Ag. * Ag-GRA21: Silver by fire assay and gravimetric finish; 30-gram charge.</p><p>Weight. Used when samples contain ) 1500 ppm silver. * Au-AA25: Gold was analysed by a 30-gram fire assay method, followed by</p><p>AAS (atomic absorption spectroscopy).</p><p>Note that 48 element ICP trace element data was also collected and reported by the laboratory. Certified international standards were inserted into sample batches by ALS. Blanks and duplicates are inserted within each analytical run. The blank is inserted at the beginning, internationally certified standards are inserted at random intervals, and duplicates are analysed at the end of the batch.</p><p>Qualified Persons</p><p>P. J.

The property covers a sulphide-facies iron formation that caps the northern assemblage of mafic metavolcanic flows overlain by intermediate pyroclastics. Gold deposits elsewhere in the BGB, such as the 4.5 Moz I&amp;I Hardrock deposit under development by Greenstone Gold near Geraldton, are considered classic examples of epigenetic, non-stratiform, banded iron formation-hosted gold deposits. Other notable deposits within the BGB include the Brookbank (0.6 Moz M&amp;I), the Sand River and Leitch Mine (past production of 0.9 Moz), the Northern Empire Mine and Sturgeon River Mine.</p><p>In July the Company completed a first pass mapping and prospecting program on Jolly Gold which included cutting and assaying of 114 channel samples on the historical Fat Beagle trench (Figure 2, Table 1) as well as collecting 82 prospecting grab samples across the 45.6 km2 property before work was halted due to local forest fire conditions. This work followed up on the initial property visit conducted in September 2020 (see November 24th, 2020 press release). Much of the property is covered by unconsolidated sediment and Nipigon diabase, limiting the exposure of the targeted Archean host rocks.</p><p>Channel sampling within the historic Fat Beagle trench returned very high-grade zones of gold mineralization, with assays of up to 146.5 g/t Au over 0.41 m, and 24.4 g/t Au over 0.61 m (Figure 2, Table 1). The best result from the 82 grab samples collected outside of the showing area returned was 1.35% Zn from an outcrop of sulphide facies iron formation (Figure 3).</p><p>CEO Scott McLean commented, \"The results of the sampling in the historic trench and identification of prospective sulphide facies iron formation supports the interpretation that our claims cover the western extension of the prolific Geraldton-Beardmore gold belt and have the potential to host significant gold mineralization. This camp scale exploration opportunity has seen only limited exploration despite its' accessible location. We believe that the application of advanced exploration techniques including, biogeochemical surveys that have proven successful on our Wollaston Cu project will assist in advancing our understanding of the property's prospectivity and identify major target areas for further exploration including diamond drilling.\"</p><p>Gignac et al. 2020.

I think it's going to be really tricky.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I needed to get tested on Friday, but I ended up having to wait until Monday to get tested.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EVAN SOLOMON: Testing nightmares across the country, backlogs, waits, it's been a nightmare, frankly. Meantime, the prime minister tested negative for COVID-19 back in August. Prime minister said his test result came back just a day later. How did he get tested so fast? Did he use the private paid clinic that MPs are allowed to use? Erin O'Toole used one. Did the prime minister also use that? And should private testing clinics, you can get some in Quebec, across the river from where I'm sitting right now, for about $250, should those be allowed, or, as the Health Minister Patty Hajdu said yesterday, are those a violation of the Canada Health Act and a doorway to two tier healthcare? And if so, why do MPs get it? Let's dig in with the press gallery. Bob Fife, the Globe and Mail's Ottawa bureau chief is here, Emilie Nicolas reporter of Le Devoir is here, and Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, CTV News infectious disease specialist joins us. Bob, I'll start with you. First of all, do we know more about the prime minister's test? He wasn't very transparent when he got it or how he got it. Now what do you make, what do you make of this, these private clinics charging for a quick test to break the logjam?</p><p/><p>ROBERT FIFE (Globe and Mail): Well the prime minister's office hasn't been very forthcoming about when he got that test, did he go to a private clinic, who did it? I suspect what happened is that he probably had the DND doctor, which travels with him, do the test, but they haven't provided with that kind of information. You know the problem we've had here is that governments had plenty of time to prepare for what everybody knew was going to happen in the fall, which was a second wave, a surge, and that we are facing that right now, and the governments did not prepare for that. But the solution is not to go to a two-tier system. The solution is to put more money into the system so that they can do proper testing. I don't think Canadians want to see a system where politicians jump the queue, or people with money can spend $250 and get a test, while everybody else cannot do that. So the onus lies on the feet of the politicians who did not properly prepare, and that we as Canadians have to demand more of our politicians to get this testing done.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah. I wonder about the walk. The walk. Of course, Emilie, in Quebec, it's different after of course that legal case, the Chow Lui case, if people can't get expedient health care they're allowed to take alternative routes so people are getting it in Quebec. How is the debate around private testing for COVID playing out there?</p><p>EMILIE NICOLAS (Le Devoir): Well it's important to understand that it's not just private testing. It's also all the normal surgeries, hospitals procedures that have been delayed because the hospitals are focused on COVID-19. So what you're seeing is a lot of folks who are actually paying because they've been waiting for so-called, you know, non-urgent surgeries, but they're still in pain, and so they turn to the private sector for that. So, really, I think it's, what's important to bear in mind is that whenever people have tried to privatize something, whether it be health care or schools, the first thing that they do is underfund the public system to make the public system inefficient and crappy in some way, and then that helps some of the public to be convinced that that they need the private option as well, right. So I guess that's what we're saying. There's no good option right now because the problem is upstream. The problem is why is it that we have a public health care system that cannot answer the needs of the Canadian population properly.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah, the very people, Dr. Sharkawy, who are running and upholding the notion of public health care when it doesn't work, they become the very illustration of why some will argue you need private health care. You're on the front lines. Give us a sense of the test crisis, if it's a major failure, and what you make of it as a way out?</p><p>DR. ABDU SHARKAWY (CTV News Infectious Disease Specialist): Well it absolutely a major crisis at this point in time. When you talk about a backlog of cases to be tested, you know, in the 80,000, 90,000 range, and concurrently having no effective tracing system at the same time, that's abject failure. You're in a situation now where the people who actually need to be tested are those that are in marginalized communities. Those that are disproportionately affected by this are those that don't have the resources available to them to advocate. They don't necessarily have the health literacy that many others do. And we've shifted to online appointments here in Ontario. I'm not sure that that's serving the population that is affected by this disease mostly here.</p><p>SOLOMON: Doc, let me just quickly stay with you, because I just talked to the Liberal leader in Ontario, Steven Del Duca, and he's calling for restaurants, bars, and gyms in Ontario, in hot spots anyway, to close down for 28 days. There's a lot of debate about a second lockdown. Again, you're on the front line. Do we need it in certain places?</p><p>SHARKAWY: I think at this point in time the evidence is abundantly clear. We can no longer continue to debate about whether this is an issue that continues to worsen. We have seen our hospitalizations increase slowly, but steadily, over the last week and a half. We know that hospitalizations and ICU admissions are the last indicators of disease progression within the community. And we know that venues such as bars and indoor dining in particular are those that help propagate transmission of this virus. That's an epidemiologic principle of reality that can no longer be denied. So I absolutely think we need targeted restrictions to be imposed without further delay, or we're going to make the situation much worse in the long run.</p><p>SOLOMON: Bob, just the politics of this, politicians who maybe had a lot of confidence a month ago, is the length of the pandemic, is this changing the political response and the impact of this?</p><p>FIFE: Well, look, I'm flabbergasted by this to be honest, because everybody had told us we're going to have a bad first wave, but the second wave is going to be worse, and it's going to come in the fall, and we're just seeing the early stages of it, because flu season is upon us as well. So the politicians have to get together, prime minister, he talks to the premiers once a week, he's got sit down with them and say, look, what resources do we need to solve this problem, and let's get to work to solving it. And to the doctor's point, if there are hot spots, then they should be closing down restaurants and bars in hot spots. This is like a forest fire. It blows up, you know, we can calm it down at some points, and other points, the wind comes up and it is blowing really badly and burning, and we, and this is what's happening in Toronto and the Ottawa area, and clearly they have to address this issue. But it takes political leadership to do so, and they've failed miserably over the summer months.</p><p>SOLOMON: Just real quick, Emilie, I just got a couple seconds. You're living in the forest fire, you're in one of the red zones in Quebec. Are they doing, is Quebec doing anything differently than other provinces?</p><p>NICOLAS: More things have been closed down already. The 28 days that is being suggested in Ontario is already in place, I'm living it right now. The one issue that I would say very quickly is that because there's no information on where the tracing is happening basically, how the outbreaks are happening, it's hard to justify why those measures are in place if you don't know that for example gyms are the problem, then you close gyms, then there's a backlash of people who are unhappy with that, so that's one of the issues, transparency.</p><p>SOLOMON: All right. Guys, I've got take a short break. I know Emilie and Bob are going to stay with us. Just to use Bob's metaphor, doc, you're our firefighter in this, our viral firefighter. Good luck, and we really appreciate your work, your information and your work on the frontlines as they fire starts to burn. But we got to take a break. Coming up next, a funeral was held today for Joyce Echaquan. She's the woman who died in a Quebec hospital while hearing racist comments about Indigenous peoples. How pervasive is racism in the healthcare system? We break that down next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>", "<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 7 (Bernama) -- The forest fire in the hilly area of \u200b\u200bTaman Seri Timah, Balakong, near here, was fully extinguished early this morningafter more than five hours of fire extinguishing operations by the...</p>", "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">West Nipissing council voted with a strong majority Tuesday against a resolution asking the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit to \u201cimmediately transition\u201d out of COVID-19 shutdown extension. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deputy Mayor Yvon Duhaime was the lone member to vote in support of asking Dr. Jim Chirico, the Medical Officer of Health, to align the district with the provincial framework, including the reopening of toboggan hills, outdoor rinks, and snowmobile trails. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The resolution, tabled by Mayor Joanne Savage in response to a widely-circulated letter by resident Rejean Venne, who cited statistics that argued the local health unit wasn\u2019t basing its decisions on available information. </p><p>Venne was also calling for a cost-benefit analysis to weigh the risks of COVID-19 against the toll on local businesses, increases in opiod deaths and overall impact on the mental health of residents. </p><p>See: Our region needs to be treated more fairly when it comes to the COVID-19 response </p><p>And: Parry Sound Chamber of Commerce demands data to justify extended lock down order </p><p>\u201cThis is not going to resolve our situation,\u201d Duhaime said of the current situation where other neighbouring regions have looser restrictions and more open economies. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop this from happening (when people can bring the virus back such as the case at the North Bay apartment building) meanwhile everybody suffers.\u201d </p><p>Duhaime said he agrees with the mayor of Sudbury who wants to create a northern bubble to keep non-essential travelers out of the area. </p><p>\u201cIn West Nipissing, we\u2019ve done reasonably well, we\u2019ve done everything humanly possible to keep everyone safe, but, unfortunately, you close the door in one area but you leave the windows open, then things can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to close it, let\u2019s close it and do it properly.\u201d </p><p>Otherwise, Duhaime said, the extension of the shutdown merely \u201cpenalizes the businesses in our area.\u201d </p><p>Councillor Chris Fisher said it is \u201cterrible with no end in sight, however \u2026 if we encourage Dr. Chirico to lift some rules and people start dropping dead around us, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d </p><p>Fisher also noted that West Nipissing council \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the same information he has.\u201d </p><p>Councillor Denis Senecal also supported the status quo of keeping the district under tighter restrictions \u201cespecially with that variant in North Bay.\u201d </p><p>Senecal said he\u2019s satisfied with Dr. Chirico\u2019s decisions that included closing snowmobile trails, outdoor rinks and toboggan hills even though most of the province didn\u2019t do so. </p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve been well served by Dr. Chirico, he\u2019s kept us safe so far. To open it up now I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise,\u201d he said. </p><p>Councillor Dan Roveda said it\u2019s not council\u2019s jurisdiction. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the health unit\u2019s responsibility to keep people healthy,\u201d Roveda said, adding he supports the \u201cradical\u201d closing of potential gathering activities 100 per cent. </p><p>\u201cDr. Chirico is trying to save lives. God forbid one of the variants get into our community, it would spread like a wildfire\u201d like it did in North Bay, he said. </p><p>Councillor Leo Mallette agreed with Venne\u2019s points and helped bring the motion to the table but he appeared to recognize council\u2019s lack of jurisdiction. </p><p>Councillor Rolly Larabie said there\u2019s no reason to discuss the resolution if they have no power to overrule Dr. Chirico. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless, we can\u2019t change his mind,\u201d he said, suggesting instead that the resolution go to the emergency control group for review. But Jay Barbeau, chief administrative officer, said that group respects \u201cincident command\u201d management structures. </p><p>Barbeau said they\u2019d follow the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry decisions if it was a forest fire and the police if it was a criminal situation. </p><p>\u201cThis is a health thing \u2026 and we tend to follow the direction of experts in those areas,\u201d he said, adding a cost-benefit analysis would more likely be done at global level rather than a district health unit. </p><p>Councillor Lise Senecal recognized that \u201ceverybody is sick and tired, getting cabin fever or whatever you call it \u2026 it\u2019s not fun for everybody.\u201d </p><p>Senecal shared she\u2019s been retired for a year and can\u2019t travel but going against Dr. Chirico isn\u2019t advisable, especially considering the aging demographic in the district that\u2019s most vulnerable to the virus. </p><p>Council can make decisions that prepare the municipality to open, such as giving staff the green light to get ready for outdoor rinks reopening or closing the arenas if it\u2019s no longer feasible. </p><p>Savage also said council should stick in its lane, although she\u2019d like to see more communication between health unit districts and municipal leaders. </p><p>\u201cOur role is as ambassador \u2026 to tell people to follow the health regulations,\u201d she said, which include for the North Bay and Parry Sound district to remain under lockdown until at least Monday. </p><p>Dave Dale is a Local Journalism Reporter with BayToday.ca.
