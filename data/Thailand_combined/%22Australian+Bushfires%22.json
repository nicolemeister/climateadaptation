The fires ravaged more than 115,000 square kilometres of drought-stricken bushland and forest across Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, killing more than 30 people and destroying thousands of homes.</p><p> It was the broadest and most prolonged bushfire season in modern Australian history, with scientists attributing the severity of the crisis to the impacts of climate change.

Sasin Chalermlap, secretary-general of the Seub Nakasathien foundation, argued that while the mountain looks more beautiful with green pines, the plantations have changed the Phu Kradueng ecology and, as a side effect, the area is now more susceptible to forest fires which are more dangerous during a time of climate change.</p><p> He also argued that pines consume large amounts of underground water, and the large plantations have sucked up water sources on the mountain top.

Real-time information helps paint a more complete picture of where affected people are located, so that resources like food, water, and medical supplies can be efficiently distributed where they are needed most. We launched Facebook Disaster Maps specifically to help fill information gaps during these events. So when the Australia fires began, we quickly shared real-time maps with our more than 100 Data for Good partners. Those maps illustrate how populations are evacuating and whether they have access to cellular networks, which are helping response organizations optimize their response efforts. To help support and amplify the efforts of our community, we will also be matching up to AU$1 million in donations made to GlobalGiving and donating AU$250,000 to the Australian Red Cross.</p><p>Currently, Disaster Maps in Australia are being used by a range of national and international relief, response, and academic organizations. Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization focused on health and emergency response, is using these tools to analyze evacuation proceedings and has plans to distribute more than 500,000 respiratory masks to the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. Direct Relief first used Disaster Maps to respond to the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides of December 2017 and January 2018 to learn how large numbers of people behave during crisis events and to develop insights about how best to respond to medical needs.</p><p>How Facebook Disaster Maps Help</p><p>Traditional forms of data often do not provide an accurate real-time view of affected areas, which makes it extremely difficult to understand how to best direct response efforts. To combat gaps in information, Facebook Disaster Maps are generated within 24 hours of disaster striking, then refreshed daily throughout the event. The data in these maps is gathered from people using the Facebook app who have chosen to turn on Location Services and opt into a feature called Location History, which can be modified at any time under Privacy Settings. Access to this near real-time data on evacuations, displacement, and network connectivity access means disaster response agencies can act quickly and efficiently to save lives. Plus, continuously updating information allows them to respond to changing circumstances on the ground during and after the event. To assist with the bushfires, four maps have been shared: the South Coast of New South Wales; East Gippsland in Victoria; Green Wattle Creek Fire in New South Wales; and the Cudlee Creek Fire in South Australia.</p><p>Such real-time information helps responders effectively deploy resources to serve the neediest survivors and protect vulnerable populations by painting a more complete picture of where affected people are located.

They're proving to be a remarkable tool for responders to the catastrophic Australian bushfires, the second-largest fire event ever recorded globally based on land size, which so far have destroyed more than 15 million acres, more than seven times the acreage of the shocking California fires of 2018 or last year's Amazon wildfire.

They are listed as a vulnerable species under federal environment law in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, where bushfires have destroyed vast areas of habitat in recent weeks.</p><p>Some campaigners have argued the koala is \"functionally extinct\" in parts of Australia.

Dozens of fires continue to burn across eastern Australia, and experts say it is impossible to know the impact on native wildlife.</p><p>A video of an Australian woman picking up an injured koala from a bushfire was widely viewed on social media. The animal later died at a wildlife hospital.</p><p>David Lindenmayer, a professor of ecology at the Australian National University, says droughts and fires can decimate koala populations.</p><p>\"What happens is that in many cases prior to these big fires, we have extensive drought periods and that means that many species of animals are actually declining quite dramatically even before the fires hit, and so there is often what we call an interaction between the drought and then the fire. And then even in the drought periods after the fire really impair the recovery process, he said. So many species are dealing with multiple processes which are very hard for populations to recover from often.\"</p><p>Not extinct yet</p><p>Scientists fear that koalas could be heading toward extinction by 2050 if the destruction of their habitat continues.</p><p>The picture, though, varies across the country.</p><p>There are large and thriving populations of koalas in southern Australia.
