In a plenary session at the 2024 Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (APMCDRR) on Tuesday, Japan Vice Minister for Policy Coordination Hara Hiroaki shared how the billions of dollars it invested to accelerate disaster risk reduction in the country has reaped fruits. In 2019, Japan was struck by Super Typhoon Hagibis, which left about USD15 billion in economic losses across the country. However, before the disaster, Japan had already been funding a three-year USD50 billion national resiliency plan, which focused on reducing the risk of flooding caused by the rise in river levels, among others. Another initiative was the USD1 billion integrated flood management project for the Abukuma River in Fukushima.

Prolonged rainfall caused more than 2200 deaths in India. Several hundred people also died in Afghanistan, South Sudan and Niger as heavy rains triggered landslides and destroyed homes. In Bolivia, heavy rains led to flooding, 34 people died and 23,000 families were left homeless. Fires also destroyed two million hectares of forest, grassland and protected areas.

The flagship report provides authoritative information for policy makers on the need for Climate Action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the UN Climate Change Conference in December that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.</p><p>2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1\\xB0C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Ni\u0144o event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.</p><p>We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5\\xB0C or 2\\xB0C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for, said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a foreword.</p><p>This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action. It brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change - from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement, he said.</p><p>The report was launched at a press conference given by the UN Secretary-General and WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at UN headquarters on 10 March.</p><p>Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time, said WMO Secretary-General Taalas.</p><p>We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Reported record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise, said Mr Taalas.</p><p>Temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. Changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. Sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in Greenland and Antarctica. This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas, said Mr Taalas.</p><p>Oceans</p><p>Marine heatwaves: More than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.</p><p>Ocean warming has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. It is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. In 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly 2 months of unusually warm temperatures. At least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.</p><p>Ocean Acidification: In the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual CO2 emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. The change of pH reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.</p><p>Ocean Deoxygenation: both observations and models indicate that oxygen is declining in the open and coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the middle of the last century, there has been an estimated 1%-2% decrease (77 billion-145 billion tons) in the global ocean oxygen inventory.</p><p>Marine Ecosystems: Deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5\\xB0C warming, and to less than 1% at 2\\xB0C warming.</p><p>Sea level has risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record.</p><p>Ice: The continued long-term decline of Arctic sea ice was confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.</p><p>Until 2016, Antarctic sea ice extent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.</p><p>The Greenland ice sheet has recorded nine of the 10 lowest surface mass balance years in the last 13 years. And 2019 was the 7th lowest on record. In terms of total mass balance. Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 458 Gt in 2011/12. The loss in 2019 was 329 Gt, well above the average.</p><p>Glaciers: Preliminary results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.</p><p>Climate-related Impacts</p><p>The report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life.

Flood trends across the European continent vary and will continue to, says the European Environment Agency (EEA), as warmer temperatures might lead to more intense precipitation and longer dry spells. Throughout this century, estimates say most parts of Europe will experience up to 35 percent more heavier rains in winter, while summers will be drier for regions in southern and south-western Europe.</p><p>River floods, already one of the top extreme climate events in Europe, will reflect the predicted changes in rainfall as shown in another EEA assessment. Future estimates say that once-in-a-century river floods will be seen more often across the continent, save for several northern regions, southern Spain, and Turkey.</p><p>Floods and urban infrastructures do not mix well</p><p>Flooding from rainfall will likely increase also as temperatures increase, and winters become wetter, with frequent rain and less frequent snow; across some European cities, flood risk might rise significantly. In the UK, 85 percent of cities on rivers might be facing more floods by the second half of the century, according to a study on 571 cities across Europe.</p><p>In a future where our greenhouse gases emissions continue to increase steeply, the most optimistic projections for river flooding see a worsening in the north, and especially, in north-western Europe, says Dr. Selma Guerreiro, hydrology and climate change researchers at Newcastle University and the study's lead author. However, the most pessimistic scenario shows most European cities affected by increases in river floods.</p><p>The study points out that 10-year high river flow in cities in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia will see increases of up to 20 percent. Should greenhouse gases emissions continue to rise at current rhythms, high flows in several European cities (e.g. Santiago de Compostela in Spain, Cork in Ireland, or Braga in Portugal) might increase by over 80 percent.</p><p>It's not just the rain that might increase floods in cities. Low-lying urban areas will be increasingly exposed to coastal flooding as an effect of sea-level rise and storm surges. In many parts of coastal Europe, floods might become ten times as frequent throughout the century, experts say. Without any adaptation measures and without reducing significantly greenhouse gases emissions, annual average losses from coastal flooding in 17 main coastal cities in the EU might increase from about 1 billion euros in 2030 to 31 billion in 2100. The population exposed will increase, in the absence of further adaptation measures, from 102,000 today to between 530,000 and 740,000 by 2050. Other studies point to coastal flooding causing 1 trillion euros in economic damage in Europe, if no adaptation is in place. Rising average temperatures will be behind these rising losses, and coastal flooding will become four times more damaging than river flooding starting from 2050, because of accelerating sea-level rise.</p><p>Adaptation policies rely on climate data at city level</p><p>Without adaptation measures, we are looking at 3 to 6-fold increase in exposure to and damages from river flooding, says Dr. Peter Salamon, senior researcher at the EU's Joint Research Center. We need to adapt, even for an optimistic 1.5\\xB0 C scenario and it's possible to do that. But we need a bundle of adaptation measures.</p><p>Predicting future floods remains essential for adaptation of urban infrastructure, economies, and people. But that is not without challenges. The storms responsible for flooding cities are too short-lived, so they are difficult to predict, says Prof. G\\xFCnter Bl\\xF6schl, Director of the Centre for Water Resource Systems at Vienna University of Technology. We know these storms are already getting more frequent and more intense, Dr. Guerreiro explains. There are now [...] models being developed specifically to simulate this type of storms, but it is too early to say how much worse this type of flooding is going to get, says Dr. Guerreiro. Various projects are looking at the different drivers behind flooding to improve the available data and inform adaptation measures.</p><p>The Copernicus Climate Change Service is developing with various actors a service that provides an all-rounded urban extreme rainfall flood risk assessment by looking at specific, critical rainfall events. The precipitations characterising these events could be used for impact models to determine the water depth and the potentially flooded areas, as well as the losses, says Dr. Paola Mercogliano, senior researcher at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC). The same approach can be potentially used to evaluate how pluvial risk in urban areas may change in the future as a consequence of human-induced climate changes.</p><p>Cities such as Copenhagen, which is exposed to flash floods, have piloted the service. Public administrations and local authorities, as well as insurance companies or impact modelers are interested in using this data, says Dr. Mercogliano. CMCC is leading the Copernicus Climate Change Service project aiming to build a catalogue of extreme precipitation events at European level using past data, and when possible, linking extreme events with damages.</p><p>Rotterdam has integrated flood defences in its fabric, as authorities are aiming to climate proof the city by 2025. Building its resilience to floods has included extending the land in the port, expanding its coastal protection, greening river banks and roofs, while designing urban areas to better cope with potential floods - creating underground water storage and blue-green corridors that allow for the natural cycle of water while protecting urban infrastructure. The Dutch port's aims to support other water-vulnerable cities in pairing their climate adaptation with urban development.</p><p>JPI, a transnational research programme, is working with Birmingham, Brussels and Rotterdam to develop FloodCitySense, an early warning service for urban pluvial floods that uses crowdsourcing. People in the cities will contribute to monitoring rainfall and flooding using low-cost sensors and digital tools, helping authorities to boost flood adaptation and reduce damages.</p><p>The European Flood Awareness System, part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, is the first system that monitors and forecasts river floods throughout the continent, supporting national authorities with additional medium-range (3-10 days) forecasts to prepare better. Many of our users are not so much interested in how much the river will rise, but they are asking what the impact will be, says Dr. Salamon. It goes beyond hydrological modelling, and we are connecting weather and hydrological data to impact models, trying to provide a testing ground for new ideas and trends that national authorities can follow and test. In 2018, the JRC and ECMWF also launched a Global Flood Awareness System, and work is currently underway for a constant highly detailed global flood monitoring service based on Copernicus satellites data, Salamon explains.</p><p>Beyond Europe, cities such as Tokyo are also using Copernicus Climate Change Service data on rainfall extremes, flood frequencies, and more to step up their adaptation measures to flood risk. Japan's capital has already invested $2 billion in the world's largest flood diversion system, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, which can redirect water excess from smaller rivers in the city to the main Edo river, more able to handle bigger volumes of water. But as flood risks seem to increase, climate information will help local authorities to adapt small and medium urban areas in the city for higher floods risks.</p><p>In the case of coastal flooding, the Copernicus Climate Change Service will provide in the near future high-quality climate data, covering storm surge, tides and waves, and the effect of sea-level rise for all European coastal waters. Developing the data within the European Storm Surge service included working with several cities exposed to floods, such as Venice and Copenhagen. We worked together in designing coastal flooding-related indicators that help users with flood risk management and planning, says Kun Yan, from Deltares, a Dutch research institute that partners with the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The climate data, that looks at both historical records and predictions, eventually helps produce flood indicators. These indicators help understand the frequency and magnitude of flood impacts at a specific location, says Yan. This helps to design flood structures, develop flood early warning systems, and improve coastal zone planning and management under climate change.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Shifting climate patterns are leading to more unpredictable weather extremes and changes in urban infrastructures are leaving cities around the world exposed to floods.

A few days before the typhoon arrived, instructions were given to the population on how to stay safe.</p><p> Individuals were asked to clear their balconies and not to leave anything behind, not even small items such as hangers or clips as they could possibly be blown away by the storm. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- who was leading the war room -- won praise for his leadership.</p><p> Moreover, the ability of the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, located in Saitama about 35km from Tokyo, to efficiently divert flood water was nothing short of impressive. Over the past week, we haven't heard any big words such as smart cities or smart devices from the Japanese cabinet.</p><p> Neither did Mr Abe's government ask the public for donations to help the typhoon victims. Instead, the government immediately allocated 710 million yen (almost 200 million baht) from its 2019 fiscal budget reserves to tackle the killer storm and its aftermath.</p><p> On social media, photos of several Japanese cities went viral since the typhoon first hit the country. Most photos showed how the country had been damaged by the worst storm to hit the country in decades, with some regions getting up to three feet of rain in just 24 hours.</p><p> Among the images shared which won praise from netizens were a pair of photos featuring a village inundated with water which did not have a single piece of rubbish. It was a testament to the country's efficient waste management system and duty to public responsibility.</p><p> Without trash, water could flow away unrestricted. Japan's cities are well-planned and so resilient that they can return to normal without delay when natural disasters strike.</p><p> Last September, Kansai International Airport was able to resume full service in just 17 days after being hit by Typhoon Jebi which had led to floods and damaged an access bridge. In comparison, things are far different in Thailand.</p><p> For example, look at Ubon Ratchathani in the Northeast which was battered by tropical storms Podul and Kajiki or how about Bangkok which gets flooded every time a depression lashes the city. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration always makes excuses such as the presence of too many reckless people who litter leading to rubbish clogging city sewage pipes.</p><p> Even though the capital boasts of having a giant tunnel to drain flood water, does anyone have an idea if it is really helpful? Imagine if a typhoon hit the city! I had a chance to visit Ubon Ratchathani last week, exactly one month after it was hit by the worst flooding in 17 years. Business in the province appeared to be slowly returning to normal, however, there were traces of the disaster the flooding had left behind.</p><p> The cleanup was ongoing at a snail's pace which meant that murky water could still be seen almost everywhere. Rubbish, small items like plastic bags and big items like beds were still scattered in the middle of fields.</p><p> It's not too difficult to imagine how such trash was swept away somewhere from the city by the floods. Some villagers outside Muang district that I met have not been able to get back on their feet because their rice crops were destroyed, leaving them empty rice stock for next year.</p><p> It will take a few more months to receive any compensation from the government. Remember Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's frustration when facing the glut of complaints from flood victims about sluggish help from the state.</p><p> He barked: \"Wherever I go, people always ask for money!\" He then made a plea for public donations. It's been more than a month now but our leader only just made the promise last week that the government would try to accelerate cash assistance disbursement.</p><p> The trip to Ubon Ratchathani gave me a strange impression.

As of today, nearly a million Rohingya live in overcrowded, flood-prone refugee camps in Bangladesh, while another 600,000 in Myanmar are confined to camps and villages under guard of local authorities and security forces who deny them freedom of movement and other basic rights.</p><p>Last year, the UN-backed Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar found that the violence inflicted by the military on the Rohingya population was carried out under direct orders from Min Aung Hlaing. In reaching the broader conclusion of genocidal intent, the fact-finding mission analyzed Min Aung Hlaing's statements and social-media posts - such as his declaration to solve the country's Bengali problem - and found that they revealed a disturbingly discriminatory understanding of the role of the Myanmar security forces and a flagrant disregard for one of the core principles of international human rights law, non-discrimination and equal protection.</p><p>Further credible evidence of the Myanmar military's atrocities against the Rohingya has been amassed by independent human-rights organizations and the media.

Competing with China for the good graces of even the worst human-rights abusers seems to be Japan's strategy.

Since July, four investment forums specifically geared toward business opportunities in Myanmar were held in Japan, all organized or sponsored by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).</p><p>At the most recent forum in Tokyo on Monday, Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, received a big round of applause as she entered the ceremony hall.</p><p>We sincerely hope that we can continue to receive the support and understanding of our friends from around the world, including Japan, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told several hundred investors and businesspeople.

The other clear trend is that CO2 levels rise and fall every year, according to the seasons. The levels are higher in late winter and early spring, and then decrease as plants and trees suck up the gas as they grow.</p><p>It raises the question of how carbon dioxide levels are currently measured, and whether we can we tell the difference between CO2 from plants and trees, and CO2 made by man.</p><p>Up at the Observatory of the Puy de Dome</p><p>That topic is a focus of research for Michel Ramonet, a scientist at from the French research organisation CNRS and the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement, and we met him at the Observatory of the Puy de Dome, in the Auvergne-Rh\\xF4ne-Alpes region of France.</p><p>The observatory measures CO2 and other atmospheric components every second of the day, sending the information about greenhouse gases to the Copernicus Climate Change Service every 24 hours.</p><p>At the moment, carbon dioxide levels are at 415 parts per million in the atmosphere on average, compared to the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million. \"We have a rise of about 2 to 3 parts per million per year,\" says Ramonet.</p><p>The rise in CO2 has spiked considerably in recent decades. When Ramonet began his career in the late 1980s his first measurements of CO2 had values around 300 parts per million.</p><p>Natural cycles of growth and decay can lead to the level of CO2 rising or falling by 15 to 20 parts per million.</p><p>Half of emissions absorbed by nature</p><p>Humans are responsible for the CO2 rise, emitting over 36 gigatonnes of CO2 last year. However, humanity is 'living on credit' from nature for the moment, with half of those emissions currently being absorbed by nature - with 30% going into plants and trees, and 20% going into the oceans.</p><p>For now, nature keeps pace with humanity, capturing half of our emissions. \"That's the good news,\" says Ramonet. \"The bad news is that living on credit for a long time is risky, so we do not know if these natural wells, so-called carbon sinks, will last forever. \"</p><p>Carbon dioxide mixes quickly into the atmosphere, so it's a huge challenge to know which emissions come from where.</p><p>\"We measure the total concentration level of CO2, and we'd love to be able to give this CO2 a colour, to have green CO2 for vegetation and black for when it comes from cars, but we don't have an easy tool to do that,\" he says.</p><p>The scientists believe they have an answer, using other gases like nitrogen oxide and certain carbon isotopes to link CO2 in the atmosphere to human activity. It's cutting edge science, and expensive, meaning it hasn't been widely rolled out.</p><p>More monitoring stations needed</p><p>The scientists are also determined to gather more data. They are working to have more CO2 monitoring stations around cities as well as at atmospheric observatories, and to deploy a new European satellite to measure remote areas from space.</p><p>Ramonet explains: \"There are areas of the world where there are almost no measurements - in Africa, the Amazon, Siberia - and these are key regions for understanding the global carbon cycle and interactions with the ecosystems on land in particular, be it the Amazonian forest, or the tropical forest in Africa. So we're desperately lacking in situ measurements.\"</p><p>Those measurements matter for several reasons. For example, Ramonet's research shows that during the 2018 heatwave in Europe last year the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by nature decreased because the plants became more stressed and less active. Land use changes such as deforestation and reforestation can also change a country's carbon budget.</p><p>There's intense interest in being able to better understand where emissions come from, where carbon sinks are to be found, and who is polluting the most. Such evidence is used by countries to judge how effective their emissions reduction policies really are.</p><p>However, Ramonet stresses that we should not be too optimistic about the effect of carbon dioxide reduction schemes in the short term, simply because of the relatively slow reaction of nature to any change.</p><p>\"The actions that can and should be taken now are aimed at reducing the acceleration of CO2 levels for future generations.

The levels are higher in late winter and early spring, and then decrease as plants and trees suck up the gas as they grow."]}, {"relevance_score": 32, "title": "Japan: Pope in Japan: Catholic Church pins high hopes on Francis' visit", "published": "2019-11-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pope Francis' visit to Japan is the first papal trip to the Asian country in 38 years and Catholics here are hoping his visit will breathe new life into the community. Julian Ryall reports from Tokyo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scourge of nuclear weapons, difficulties facing immigrant communities and the importance of interfaith dialogue are just some of the issues that Pope Francis is expected to address when he arrives in Japan on Saturday for the first papal visit to the Asian country in 38 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And members of the Catholic Church here anticipate that the pope's visit will breathe new life into their community. \"The Catholic community in Japan looks forward to the apostolic visit with sentiments of joy and gratitude to God,\" said Father Joseph Chennoth, the archbishop of Milevi who was appointed to serve as apostolic nuncio to Japan in August 2011.</p><p>\"It is a great opportunity for Pope Francis to visit Japan, where he wanted to come as a missionary during his youth,\" Chennoth told DW.</p><p>\"As supreme pastor of the church, he has innumerable pastoral concerns for the universal church spread across the world,\" he added. \"Now he comes to Japan to appreciate the strong faith inherited from the martyrs and to encourage the faithful to share the gospel of joy and compassion.\"</p><p>Deeply symbolic visit</p><p>The pope's visit is indeed rich in symbolism. It is significant that he will open his first official visit to Japan in the city of Nagasaki, where Christianity first gained a foothold in feudal Japan nearly 500 years ago, but is today best known as the second city to have been targeted with an atomic weapon during World War II.</p><p>The first Christian missionaries arrived in Kyushu, Japan's most southern main island, with Francis Xavier and the Jesuits stepping ashore in the 1540s and were initially successful in converting as many as 130,000 local people and even local \"daimyo,\" or feudal lords.</p><p>But Emperor Ogimachi began the pushback against what was seen as a foreign influence, and Christianity was repressed from 1587 onward. Opposition to the religion evolved into an outright ban in the early 17th century. Those who refused to reject Christianity were often executed; others - the \"hidden Christians\" - continued to practice their faith in secret.</p><p>Nagasaki is important to the history of Christianity in Japan because six Franciscan missionaries, three Japanese Jesuits and 17 followers of the church, including three boys, were crucified in the city on February 5, 1597, because they refused to recant their faith. Known as the \"Martyrs of Japan,\" they were canonized by the Catholic Church in 1862.</p><p>The last head of the Catholic Church to visit Japan was Pope John Paul II, who in 1981 also visited Nagasaki and met some of the descendants of the early converts who had managed to keep their faith secret.</p><p>Christianity returned openly to Japan after Tokyo ended its policy of seclusion from the outside world in 1853, although followers of the Catholic Church still only account for around 440,000 of the 127 million Japanese people.</p><p>Falling numbers</p><p>\"The number of Japanese Catholics is declining because of diminishing birth rates, an aging population and the modern pressures of life,\" Father Chennoth said. \"But I am sure that the pope's visit will give a new impetus to Catholics to deepen and share their faith with their fellow men by their commitment to building up a more peaceful, compassionate, humane and inclusive society.\"</p><p>While the number of Japanese Catholics may be in decline, the rising number of immigrants from deeply Catholic nations in other parts of Asia, such as the Philippines, means that churches here are still busy, said Father Kizito Mawayira. \"This visit by the pope is deeply significant to us because it shows us again the solidarity of the church,\" said Father Kizito, a Ugandan who serves as pastor at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Yokohama.</p><p>\"We are very much an international congregation and we have people from all over the world attending our masses - from France and India to the US, South Korea, Poland, the Congo, Croatia and many places in Southeast Asia,\" he said.</p><p>Some estimates put the number of foreign-born Catholics living in Japan at 520,000, eclipsing the number of Japanese church-goers, with more places of worship now offering masses in different languages. \"We also have Japanese in our congregation, of course, but mostly they are older people,\" Mawayira said. \"For younger people, there are so many things going on with their schools and other groups at the weekend that they do not always have a chance to attend mass.\"</p><p>Nuclear weapons opposition</p><p>Many Catholics are expected to flock to venues where Pope Francis will give a series of addresses, including in Hiroshima - where he is scheduled to meet with survivors of the atomic bomb that was dropped on the city in 1945 - and Tokyo.</p><p>Through his visit, the pope wants to send a strong message calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide.

The US and China have had agreement or close agreement in the past and those agreements have failed or are falling apart, so is China confident that this phase one agreement will last?</p><p>A: As to the latest round of China-U.S. high-level economic and trade consultations, the Chinese side has issued the press release. The two sides had candid, efficient and constructive discussions on trade and economic issues of mutual concern in this round of consultations and made substantive progress in such areas as agriculture, intellectual property protection, exchange rate, financial services, expanding trade cooperation, technology transfer and dispute settlement.

It is the first visit by a Chinese president in 23 years. Both sides signed cooperation agreements and also stressed the BRI and multilateral cooperation. Do you have any comment on that?</p><p>A: Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relationship, our two countries have been respecting, trusting and supporting each other, making this relationship an exemplar of harmonious co-existence between countries of different sizes. President Xi's visit to Nepal was the first visit conducted by a Chinese president in 23 years' time. The two sides issued a joint statement and signed 20 cooperation documents. The outcomes of this successful visit can be concluded in three parts.</p><p>First, the bilateral relationship was elevated to a new height. Following the spirit of sharing weal and woe as well as win-win cooperation, the two sides jointly announced the decision to upgrade the bilateral relations to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity. This new definition charts the course for future development and gives China-Nepal relationship greater influence in the region.</p><p>Second, new progress was made in connectivity. Both sides agreed to create synergies between bilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and Nepal's national policy of developing a land-linked state. The two sides will advance the construction of the trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network in areas of ports, highways, railways, aviation and communication. Both sides also launched the feasibility study of cross-border railway, which is considered a major progress of linking the two countries by transportation despite difficult natural conditions.</p><p>Third, new outcomes were achieved in cooperation featuring good-neighborliness and friendship. China and Nepal agreed to conduct all-dimensional cooperation, especially in trade and investment, post-earthquake reconstruction, energy and tourism. The two sides also agreed to bring our two peoples closer by expanding exchange and cooperation in education, youth and on the sub-national level. As Mount Qomolangma is a symbol of China-Nepal friendship, the two sides will cooperate in climate change and eco-tourism related to Mount Qomolangma, making these projects a new highlight in our bilateral cooperation.</p><p>China is ready to work with Nepal to implement the consensus of our leaders, scale our friendly cooperation to new heights and open a new chapter for bilateral relations.</p><p>Q: China Chamber of Commerce to the EU(CCCEU), based in Brussels, launched its first flagship report on 11 October, which summarized Chinese companies development in Europe and recommended to improve business environment in EU for the EU institutions and EU state governments. I wonder if you have a comment on that?</p><p>A: We noted the Report on the Development of Chinese Enterprises in the EU issued by the CCCEU, the chamber's first flagship report after its establishment in Brussels in 2018.</p><p>We are glad to see that Chinese enterprises generally operate well in Europe, with more Chinese companies establishing R&amp;D centers and factories there. Their investment and cooperation have contributed to employment and livelihood of the local communities as well as the upgrade of Europe's industrial chain in a multi-dimensional way. However, on the other hand, the report noted many worrying challenges and restrictions that Chinese enterprises face, such as limited access of Chinese companies due to the increasing censorship of foreign investment by the EU, restrictions on SOEs and the development of Chinese companies in science, technology, energy and some certain areas, insufficient communication between Chinese enterprises and local governments, etc.</p><p>Europe has always been an advocate of market economy and trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and a supporter and guardian of multilateralism and free trade. We hope the EU side will heed the opinions and demands from the Chinese enterprises, continue to keep its investment market open, and foster a business environment that is fair, transparent, stable and predictable for all foreign companies in Europe including Chinese ones. Under the current circumstances, following the spirit of mutual respect and win-win outcomes, it is important for China and the EU to remain open, inclusive and expand cooperation, which will benefit both and inject greater stability and positive energy into the world.</p><p>Q: Regarding Vice President Wang Qishan's visit to Japan, will he meet with Prime Minister Abe and other leaders? Can you tell us the plans and arrangements for his visit?</p><p>A: As I said earlier, Vice President Wang Qishan is to attend Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony as President Xi Jinping's special envoy. During his visit to Japan, he will be meeting with the Japanese leadership and representatives from various sectors. As I know, besides Tokyo, Vice President Wang will also visit Hokkaido.</p><p>Q: Further to what you said about Nepal, there were expectations of an extradition treaty to be signed during President Xi's visit, can you outline the reasons why it wasn't?</p><p>A: China attaches importance to judicial cooperation with Nepal. Both sides are pleased with the signing of a treaty of judicial assistance on criminal matters during this visit. We hope an extradition treaty will be concluded at an early date.</p><p>Q: As we note, Tencent returned some NBA preseason games to streaming status. Does the Chinese government support this move and what is your comment on it?</p><p>A: I believe you are aware that we generally do not comment on the business behaviors of companies. I'd refer you to the company if you are interested in this matter.</p><p>Sports exchange has played a positive role in China-US relations and friendship.

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has been deemed by Government House reporters a confused hypocrite, but his bigger worries should be about problems among coalition partners. Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit and his top lieutenants are staring at party dissolution and even jail.</p><p>All political protagonists, Thaksin Shinawatra included, go into the new year dreaded and none of them is in a good shape. That the Democrats are not even in the picture tells much about their party's current state of affairs.</p><p>2019 started with a promise, with a general election coming after years under a military rule. But extremely divisive politics quickly overshadowed everything and hopes for a fresh beginning disappeared as soon as vote counts were completed. It cut a swathe through Parliament, the conventional media, the social media, and Thailand as a whole.</p><p>The key players cannot be in fully celebratory moods during this festive season. Prayut's coalition won a couple of by-elections first in Nakhon Pathom and very recently in Khon Kaen and is believed to stand to benefit from a few defections and the uncertainties surrounding the Future Forward Party, but trouble remains unchanged in the grand scheme of things. Pheu Thai has been repeatedly rocked by rumoured or actual rebellion; realistic threats of losing grounds to the new-generation politicians and their supposedly growing fan base; and continued speculation that Thaksin's political and financial commitment to the party will be significantly fading.</p><p>Khon Kaen's by-election loss is not just a physical, but also psychological, blow. It renewed fears that Thaksin is not going all in any more. The defeat, which handed Palang Pracharat an additional parliamentary seat, was by just a couple of thousand votes, something that shouldn't have been a big problem if the man in Dubai had not folded like he did a lot lately, analysts and disgruntled party members said.</p><p>But in greatest jeopardy is Future Forward. The party faces being disbanded by the Constitutional Court, with the judgement day likely to come as soon as early 2020. Worse still, Thanathorn and top executives of the party are being threatened by possibility of jail sentences, a grave trouble that seemingly prompted them to test the waters with the recent Skywalk gathering. The torch of anti-government campaign may have been passed from Thaksin to Thanathorn, so to speak.</p><p>2020 will see more street protests and very likely counter protests. All will look peaceful at the beginning but everyone knows how ugly political demonstrations can turn. The Bangkok gubernatorial election will be an enormously significant contest that will determine not only the government's popularity, but also proclaimed unity between coalition parties and within the opposition bloc itself. A charter amendment drive may not contain issues that concern the well-being of Thais directly, but it can become highly explosive.</p><p>2019 laid the groundwork for what could be a perfect storm, especially if the economy gets staggeringly worse. Political divide may peak next year, compounded by conflicts within the coalition government and the opposition parties themselves. Palang Pracharat, the Democrats and the Bhumjaithai Party cannot see eye to eye, but neither can the Pheu Thai and Future Forward parties.</p><p>Who's the biggest loser? Those who deserve better, of course. In this case it's none of the aforementioned but the Thai public, who will continue to have to put up with old-fashioned, winners-take-all politics featuring costly populism designed to weaken enemies, nepotism which has kept truly qualified people away from key positions, constitutional amendment agendas that only serve to divide and not put food on the table, and national divisiveness cooked up by politicians who only want to protect their own vested interests. -
