Horticulture production also jumped from 280.70 million tonnes to 367.72 million tonnes. The Agriculture Minister also noted a significant increase in milk production in the country, entirely driven by farmers.</p><p>On the issue of farmers' income, Shri Chouhan asserted that many farmers have more than doubled their incomes under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, as he compared the previous UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government's agriculture budget of 27,000 crore with the current allocation of 1.27 lakh crore. The PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, which did not exist earlier, now benefits 10 crore farmers, Shri Chouhan said, adding that the central government is providing around 2 lakh crore in fertiliser subsidies annually.</p><p>The Agriculture Minister said that under the Modi government, institutional credit has also surged from 7 lakh crore during the UPA era to 25 lakh crore today. Regarding the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), he said the Centre has disbursed claims worth 1.83 lakh crore against a collected premium of 35,000 crore directly into farmers' accounts.</p><p>To promote income growth, the government is subsidising mechanisation and providing drip and sprinkler systems under the 'Per Drop More Crop' initiative. Investments are being made in polyhouses, greenhouses, and efforts are also underway to boost fruit and vegetable production and ensure fair procurement.</p><p>The Minister emphasised that to raise farmers' income, the government decided to ensure a minimum of 50% profit margin over cost in Minimum Support Prices (MSP). Large-scale procurement is currently underway, and farmers are receiving compensation for crop losses. Subsidised fertilisers like urea and DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) are also being made widely available, the Minister said.</p><p>Shri Chouhan further highlighted that special schemes have been designed for small landholders and tenant farmers. The Centre has allowed owners to authorise tenant farmers to receive PMFBY benefits. Recently, 6.55 lakh tenant and sharecropping farmers were covered under the scheme, benefiting a total of over 41.62 lakh farmers.</p><p>Shri Chouhan also informed the House that the PM-AASHA scheme has been launched to procure pulses and oilseeds like tur, masoor, and urad at 100% MSP. Measures are in place to ensure that middlemen don't exploit farmers, and that MSP rates are delivered effectively.</p><p>He cited data showing that MSP rates have significantly increased:</p><p>- Paddy: 1,310 (2013-14) 2,369</p><p>- Bajra: 1,250 2,775</p><p>- Ragi: 1,500 4,886</p><p>- Maize: 1,310 2,400</p><p>- Tur: 4,300 8,000</p><p>- Moong: 4,500 8,768</p><p>- Urad: 4,300 7,800</p><p>- Groundnut: 4,000 7,263</p><p>- Sunflower: 3,700 7,721</p><p>- Soybean: 2,560 5,328</p><p>- Sesame: 4,500 9,846</p><p>- Niger seed: 3,500 9,537</p><p>- Cotton: 3,700 7,710</p><p>He stressed that MSPs have not only doubled, but procurement volumes have also risen significantly. Under the previous government, only 6 lakh metric tonnes of pulses were procured in 10 years. Under the current government, this figure has soared to 1.82 crore metric tonnes.</p><p>Concluding his remarks, Shri Chouhan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a true well-wisher of farmers, and has restructured the PMFBY to be more farmer-friendly. If an insurance company fails to pay the due claim within 21 days of the deadline, 12% interest will be charged and credited directly to the farmer's account. The same 12% interest applies if a state government delays its share of the premium.</p><p>The Minister added that challenges related to crop cutting experiments are being addressed through YESTECH, a technology-based yield estimation system using satellite-based remote sensing. This shift will promote transparency and enable digital assessment of crop loss, ensuring timely and accurate compensation under PMFBY.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Union Minister for Agriculture, Farmers Welfare, and Rural Development, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, on Tuesday, during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, provided a comprehensive update on the state of agriculture in the country.

Shift of surplus manpower from farm to non-farm occupations</p><p>To achieve the above seven objectives, Government of lndia supplements the efforts of States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support and various schemes/ programmes. The Government has substantially enhanced the budget allocation of Department of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare (DA&amp;FW) from Rs. 21,933.50 crore during 2013-14 to Rs. 1,27,290.16 crore in 2025-26.</p><p>The various schemes/programmes of the Government of India are meant for the Welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers is at Annexure.</p><p>As per EU website (agriculture.ec.europa.eu), Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of European Union is linked to farmed area and conditionality for compliance with EU rules.

The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSPs at levels of one and half times of the cost of production.

PM-AASHA has components of Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficit Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Market Intervention Scheme (MIS).</p><p>PSS is implemented on the request of the State Govt./ UT that agrees to exempt from levy of Mandi tax on the procurement of notified pulses, oilseeds and copra and make arrangements like booking of scientific storage facility, identification of procurement centres, arrangement of gunny bags etc.. It is implemented within the stipulated period as and when the market prices of agricultural commodities fall below the notified MSP during peak harvesting period to provide the remunerative price to the farmers. From the procurement year 2024-25, the sanction for the procurement of notified Pulses, Oilseeds and Copra under PSS is given to the States/UTs initially upto a maximum of 25% of the production of the State for that particular season. Subsequently, if the State/UT achieves the overall procurement against sanctioned quantity and further intends to procure more beyond the sanctioned quantity, the proposal for the procurement under the PSS is considered upto a maximum of 25% of the national production. In order to incentivize the farmers contributing in enhancement of domestic production of pulses and to reduce the dependence on imports, the Government has allowed the procurement of Tur, Urad and Masur under PSS equivalent to 100% of the estimated production of the State till 2028-29.</p><p>PDPS envisages the direct payment of the price difference between the MSP and the selling / modal price in notified market upto 15% of MSP value (including 2% administrative cost) by the Central Government to the pre-registered farmers selling the oilseeds upto 40% of its production with prescribed Fair Average Quality (FAQ) in the notified market yard through a transparent auction process within the stipulated period. However, the States/UTs have the option to implement either PSS or PDPS for the notified oilseeds for the particular year/season. If any State is willing to cover quantities beyond 40%, it can do so from its resources.</p><p>MIS further enhances the diversity by supporting the perishable and horticulture crops that are not covered under above price stabilisation measures. MIS offers both physical as well as price difference payment along with a provision for storage and transportation of TOP (Tomato, Onion and Potato) crops.</p><p>This integrated approach leads to the prevention of distress sale by farmers, ensuring remunerative prices for their produce.

Over 1,500 hectares of dunes have been stabilized, 330 hectares reforested, and 24 nurseries created. Local leaders like Ralahy Fid\\xE8le and Nasta are driving this transformation - restoring hope, protecting livelihoods, and building long-term climate resilience for over 1.4 million people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want my region to be green. I don't want my children, or any future generation, to suffer the way we have from droughts, says Ralahy Fid\\xE8le, a resident of Iritsoka, a village in the Betroka district of Madagascar's Atsimo-Andrefana region. This is one of the three regions that form the Great South of Madagascar, a part of the country known for its stark beauty, but also for its harsh realities.</p><p>Life in southern Madagascar is tough. Over 90% of the population lives in poverty, relying on farming and fishing to survive while climate change is putting these livelihoods at risk. The region faces repeated droughts and water scarcity, which affect families in their daily lives. Because of climate change, extreme weather is becoming more common. When the droughts end, the rains that follow are often too strong, causing heavy floods like those that happened just a few months ago. Violent southern winds, called Tiokatimo have also become more frequent and intense. These winds sweep red sand across the land, covering fields and homes. As desertification advances and sand dunes spread, families are left struggling to grow food or remain on their ancestral lands.</p><p>In the past 20 years, southern Madagascar has faced five major droughts. The most recent in 2021 was devastating. The gradual loss of natural ecosystems has exacerbated the effect of climate change and increased the vulnerability of the local communities. Nature-based adaptation with green infrastructure is no longer optional, it is an urgent necessity for the communities' livelihood to continue and sustain. Building resilience is key to protecting lives and lifting people out of extreme poverty.</p><p>Laza Rakotondrasoa</p><p>Natural Resources Management Specialist at the World Bank in Madagascar</p><p>In response, the Malagasy government, with support from the World Bank, launched the Support for Resilient Livelihoods in the South of Madagascar project, or MIONJO, in 2020. It's a large-scale, multi-sectoral initiative designed to build resilience in the Great South. The MIONJO project, which aims to foster environmental resilience in southern Madagascar, serves around 1.4 million people in 235 rural communes across Atsimo-Andrefana, Androy, and Anosy.</p><p>One of MIONJO's core pillars is environmental restoration, including protecting farmland, strengthening ecosystems, halting desertification, and improving daily life. Through partnerships with local and international organizations including Tany Meva Foundation and Catholic Relief Services, the project is implementing practical solutions such as stabilizing sand dunes with sisal and climbing plants, planting windbreaks, promoting agroforestry and reforestation, and establishing plant nurseries with resilient species.</p><p>So far, over 1,500 hectares of dunes have been stabilized, 330 hectares reforested, and 24 nurseries established, producing thousands of seedlings to help revive the land.</p><p>Nasta, a young single mother, works in one of these nurseries. She tends to the seedlings daily, watering and caring for them. I see the changes caused by deforestation. That's why I chose to help restore our forests for a better life. This job also gave me income to raise my child, buy livestock, and pay for school, she says with pride.</p><p>Nearby, Ralahy Fid\\xE8le donated 5,000 square meters of his own land to build a nursery. He now leads a team of villagers, training them in planting and land restoration.

He emphasised that the Aravalli Green Wall Project will not only lead to increase the green cover and biodiversity of the Aravalli through afforestation, reforestation and restoration of water bodies, but also improve the soil fertility, water availability and climate resilience of the region, besides generating meaningful livelihood opportunities.</p><p>Shri Yadav further exhorted all stakeholders across the four States to adopt a 'Whole of Government' and 'Whole of Society' approach in the restoration of the Aravallis. Adoption of innovative ideas, technological interventions in planning and monitoring and emphasis on public awareness and public participation are paramount to the success of the programme, he stated.</p><p>The Minister stated that approaches such as creation of seedling nursery in every panchayat by dovetailing MNREGA and CAMPA, roping in youth and MY Bharat volunteers in taking up eco-restoration of Aravali, implementation of Green Credit Programme for eco-restoration work in Aravalli landscape, restoration of abandoned mines or maintenance water filled mine pits as sources of water and wildlife habitat, could also play a significant part in this initiative. Further, developing Aravalli landscapes and biodiversity for safari, nature parks and for trekking, removal of invasive species and re-plantation with native species and bamboo, roping in Eco-clubs and Eco-Task Force in raising plantations and awareness, linking Amrit Sarovars and waterbodies in Aravali restoration programme, creating a research and monitoring vertical under the NIRANTAR institutions such as BSI and ZSI in taxonomy and organizing annual workshops, could also prove to be effective measures in this direction, the Minister added.</p><p>Appreciating the efforts undertaken by the State Forest Departments of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi and other stakeholders, Shri Yadav urged the participants for their joint cooperation in attaining the envisioned objectives by adopting an integrated approach for restoration of Aravali from Delhi to Gujarat, with innovative scientific and technical approaches. He also stated that convergence should not only be in implementations of the Schemes but also in their attitude and planning and that the stakeholders should meet each year to review the progress made by the respective State Governments, identify the challenges and share the best practices.</p><p>The Action Plan released outlines a science-based, community-led, and policy-supported roadmap to restore the ecological integrity of the Aravallis. It focuses on five pillars:</p><p>- Ecological Restoration: Assisted natural regeneration, native species plantation, soil and moisture conservation.</p><p>- Community Participation: Involving local communities, especially women and youth, in planning and implementation.</p><p>- Policy and Governance: Strengthening regulatory frameworks, convergence of schemes, and effective monitoring.</p><p>- Sustainable Livelihoods: Promoting eco-tourism, agroforestry, and non-timber forest produce (NTFP)-based enterprises.</p><p>- Research and Innovation: Using GIS-based mapping, remote sensing, and restoration ecology practices for informed action.</p><p>The workshop was attended by Secretary (MoEFCC), Shri Tanmay Kumar; DG (Forests) and Special Secretary (MoEFCC), Shri Sushil Kumar Awasthi and other senior officials from the MoEFCC, as well as State Governments of Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and NCT of Delhi.

According to the FAO's State of the World's Forests report in 2022, agroforestry can help restore over one billion hectares of degraded agricultural land, to increase soil fertility and agricultural productivity, while enriching ecosystem services and livelihoods. The Director-General also emphasized agroforestry's vital importance for millions of smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on it. He also noted that it was paramount to create enabling environment to attract investors to help smallholder farmers apply innovative approaches. Farmers need access to training, technology, markets, and financial support to adopt agroforestry practices effectively, the Director-General said.", "QU Dongyu calls for greater collaboration between forestry and agriculture sectors to scale-up agroforestryAgroforestry is a key climate solution with huge potential to simultaneously improve food security and nutrition and alleviate poverty, while halting deforestation, conserving biodiversity, building resilience, and helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) QU Dongyu said today.

It hosts 17,700 species of animals (including over 500 endemic species) and 3,500 species of vascular plants (including 144 endemic species). Armenia is one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots and is part of the Caucasus ecoregion that makes a biogeography bridge between Europe and Asia. Among other ecosystems, wetlands and forests are of highest importance for biodiversity conservation and the mitigation of climate change worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Nation's Struggle with Land Degradation</p><p>Armenia's forests and wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems, providing habitat for a diverse range of species and offering essential ecosystem services. However, overexploitation, climate change, and poor land management practices have led to significant degradation. Forest cover has dwindled to just 9.3%, and wetlands have been reduced drastically, impacting biodiversity and increasing vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>Wetlands in Armenia, covering 492,200 hectares or 16.5% of the country's area, are highly productive ecosystems that support rich biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services such as water quality improvement, floodwater storage, and carbon sequestration. However, over a century of purposeful drainage, particularly during the Soviet period, has significantly reduced wetland areas, leading to a decline in biodiversity, water retention capacity, and carbon storage.</p><p>The degradation of these landscapes has far-reaching consequences. Soil erosion, uncontrolled surface runoff, landslides, and flooding are common, leading to economic losses and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Wetland degradation has also caused changes in humidity, increased droughts, and decreased productivity of grasslands, posing additional risks for livestock husbandry. The costs of inaction on forest and wetland degradation in Armenia are currently over US$80 million (equivalent to 0.4% of the country's gross domestic product, GDP) and will increase to over US$128 million in 2050 if no additional restorative actions are taken. Proper forest and wetland management is crucial to reverse these effects.</p><p>Addressing land degradation requires coordinated efforts across multiple institutions. The RESILAND project supports capacity-building initiatives that aim to strengthen governance structures, enhance policy coordination, and promote an integrated approach to landscape restoration. By fostering collaboration among key stakeholders, the project seeks to create a more effective enabling environment for sustainable land management.</p><p>A Comprehensive Approach to Restoration</p><p>Recognizing the urgent need for action, the Armenian government, with support from the World Bank, has launched the RESILAND: Armenia Resilient Landscapes Project.

Landscape Restoration: This component focuses on restoring degraded forests and wetlands in selected areas. Activities include planting indigenous trees, restoring wetland habitats, and reclaiming abandoned mining sites.</p><p>3. Promoting Communities' Benefits: This component aims to increase community economic benefits through the development of agroforestry, commercialization of non-timber forest products, and ecotourism. It also includes infrastructure development to reduce pressure on forest resources.</p><p>4.

In the Lori and Syunik provinces, the project aims to restore fragmented forests in Lori and Syunik provinces, and revitalize degraded wetlands in the Ararat Plain and Lori Plateau. These efforts will not only enhance biodiversity but also create new economic opportunities for local communities.</p><p>For example, the restoration of wetlands has already been attracting birdwatchers and other nature enthusiasts, boosting ecotourism in the region. Local communities will further benefit from new green jobs and sustainable economic activities, such as the collection and processing of wild fruits, berries, and medicinal herbs.</p><p>The project will directly benefit communities in targeted landscapes by enhancing access to alternative economic opportunities, such as sustainable agroforestry, non-timber forest product (NTFP) commercialization, and ecotourism development.

The consequences are severe - particularly for countries where a large proportion of the population relies heavily on forests for jobs, livelihoods and other ecosystem services (such as water regulation and protection from flooding). In these countries, the welfare of nature and of people are so closely connected that prioritizing the well-being of people tends to also secure forests against deforestation and degradation. At a global scale, shrinking forests are also a concern because forests remove 16 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reducing pressure on forest resources will require developing alternative, sustainable livelihoods for forest-adjacent communities. This approach gained momentum in Liberia, a West African country nestled between Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire, where more than half of the population lives within 2.5 kilometers of a tropical forest. These forests, which currently cover 43.4 percent of the country, have declined substantially in recent decades, shrinking by 0.7 percent on average each year between 2000 and 2015.</p><p>Forest-focused initiatives are bringing significant benefits across the world, including in Liberia. For example, the Liberia Forest Sector Project - a US$36.7 million, multi-year initiative - supported practical measures to improve forest management and increase benefit-sharing in targeted forest landscapes. Between 2016 and 2023, the project successfully enhanced community forest governance; improved measurement, reporting and verification systems; and strengthened regulatory and institutional arrangements. These improvements are discussed in greater detail below.</p><p>Community forest governance was enhanced, with a focus on income generation</p><p>The Liberia Forest Sector Project demonstrated how training and equipment can position local communities to contribute to a sustainable forest economy and develop financial resilience to impacts of climate change. In particular, the Liberia project successfully:</p><p>- Strengthened local community governance structures through capacity-building initiatives, benefiting more than 10,200 farmers while enabling sustainable agriculture and fostering forest-based community enterprises.</p><p>- Helped communities establish volunteer savings and loan associations (VSLAs) in the northwest and southeast priority conservation landscapes. VSLAs typically manage revolving funds that can be used to create microfinance options for community projects and forest enterprises, in effect supporting the creation of local jobs and small businesses that engage in sustainable forestry and agriculture.</p><p>Measurement, reporting, and verification systems were improved</p><p>The Liberia Forest Sector Project designed, developed, and commissioned a national-level measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system to track metrics such as emissions reductions and deforestation rates, so improving the evidence base for informed decision-making.</p><p>Regulatory and institutional arrangements were strengthened</p><p>The Liberia Forest Sector Project focused on building the capacity of multiple government institutions, including Liberia's Forestry Development Authority and its Environmental Protection Agency.

Out of 310 districts identified as vulnerable, 109 districts have been categorized as 'very high' and 201 districts as 'highly vulnerable. District Agriculture Contingency Plans (DACPs) for these 651 districts have also been prepared to address weather aberrations and recommending location specific climate resilient crops and varieties and management practices for use by the State Departments of Agriculture. For enhancing the resilience and adaptive capacity of farmers to climate variability, the Concept of \"Climate Resilient Villages\" (CRVs) has been initiated under NICRA. Location-specific climate resilient technologies have been demonstrated in 448 CRVs of 151 climatically vulnerable districts covering 28 states/UTs for adoption by farmers. ICAR through its NICRA project, creates awareness about impact of climate change in agriculture among farmers.

Some years earlier the Berlin Wall was torn down, and the former East State was no longer part of the Soviet Union. It was a feeling of freedom even though my country was not behind any wall. Today, the feelings are different. My daughters' feelings about today's situation and the future is about focusing on security.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, what unites our three countries, now, 30 years ago and even 130 years ago is our forests. Sweden, Finland and Austria have a strong tradition in sustainable agriculture and forestry. Each country in its own way. It is in our culture.</p><p>And today I would like to talk about the links, the links between sustainable agriculture and forestry together. What links the agriculture and forestry together with the environment.</p><p>I know that Sweden has a strong focus on upskilling and raising awareness on these topics among farmers. Austria is a pioneer in developing result-based approaches for improving biodiversity on farmlands. And Finland's Strategic Plan plays a crucial role in supporting the national carbon neutrality goal by 2035, including a 29% reduction of agricultural emissions compared to 2019 levels.</p><p>All three countries are also leaders in organic farming.

Some have said to me that this is a new approach. For me it is obvious, environment and agriculture need to work together. And that we do today.</p><p>Let me just say a few words from my perspective on the Vision.</p><p>The Vision underlines that farming and food are strategic sectors for the EU. They serve a major public interest. And that service is two-fold.</p><p>First, to provide food security for the 450 million people in our Union.</p><p>We must make sure that, without being protectionist we can achieve and maintain a high level of food sovereignty. And we must guarantee high quality and great taste, at an affordable price.</p><p>The second major public service is to be the guardians of our environment. Farmers and foresters together own and work on 65% of all land in Sweden, 70% in Finland, even 76% in Austria. In the EU, farmers also account for nearly 60% of freshwater use.</p><p>On water, you are important partners in our work on a Water Resilience Strategy, which I plan to present later this spring. We had our first structured dialogue today. We need to make sure that we use water more efficiently, and I know that you have a direct interest in this matter.</p><p>And it comes with a big responsibility. To preserve those finite natural resources and make sure they are in a good state. Now, and for our children and grandchildren.</p><p>Those two tasks, production and guardianship, go hand in hand. Farming and forestry depend on nature and healthy ecosystems.</p><p>And we can't overcome our climate and environmental challenges without farmers and foresters.</p><p>But I feel very optimistic about this. Because I know that your sectors want to be part of the solution.</p><p>Finally, I want to highlight the opportunities of the bioeconomy sector. You know this better than me.</p><p>The bioeconomy offers opportunities for farmers and foresters. It can bring new investments and innovation opportunities to rural areas. I have recently visited a biogas farm [Koeweidehof] in Flanders together with Christophe Hansen. This is a perfect example of how sustainability, investment, productivity and innovation can go hand in hand.</p><p>We need a change in mindset.</p><p>I will prepare a new Bioeconomy strategy by the end of the year.</p><p>It will be about boosting the bioeconomy as part of the competitiveness and resilience agenda.</p><p>It will be about creating jobs and using the bioeconomy for new and innovative applications. I just visited V\\xE4rmland, a region in Sweden that is more or less covered by forest. Another example is one I visited in Karlstad. They produce a world class fibre cork to reduce plastics and our carbon footprint.</p><p>Innovation is amazing!</p><p>And it will be about developing a strong industrial base in Europe, rooted in responsibility and sustainability. We have the resources and the skills to do this, and the demand is also there. Let's make this the forward-looking industry the EU needs.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>On all these topics, Austria, Finland and Sweden are making a difference for the EU and our discussions here in Brussels.</p><p>Your and our countries are bringing a strong voice for farmers, sustainable foresters, and innovative bioeconomy businesses.</p><p>A lot has happened in 30 years, over the next 30 years our responsibility is not only the environment.</p><p>It is our responsibility to bring security into the picture as well.

The demand for their high-quality honey far exceeds supply, highlighting both the success of their efforts and the growth potential.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This thriving beekeeping initiative, led by Fondazione AVSI and supported by the World Bank's Caribbean Hotspot Project, is transforming lives while promoting conservation. Forty local women have been trained in beekeeping and the preservation of key flora species essential to honey production. Together, they have planted 10 hectares of native trees valuable for pollinators, laying the foundation for a sustainable livelihood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, with new equipment that eliminates the need for manual processing, they are poised to scale up production and meet growing demand. The next step is to establish a \"payments for ecosystem services\" scheme, where communities will receive financial incentives for the ecological benefits-such as pollination-provided by the trees they have planted.</p><p>What began as a conservation effort has become a model for sustainable growth, proving that protecting biodiversity and strengthening local economies can go hand in hand.</p><p>Across the Caribbean, similar efforts are taking root. Implemented by the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund, the Caribbean Hotspot Project is helping local organizations to create innovative solutions to conserve biodiversity, protect endangered species, and empower communities. Whether through beekeeping, shade-grown coffee, climate risk mapping or species recovery programs, these initiatives highlight the power of local civil society organizations to drive conservation efforts while building a sustainable future for its people.</p><p>Bird-Friendly Coffee and Biodiversity Conservation in the Dominican Republic</p><p>In the Dominican Republic, The Sociedad Ornitol\\xF3gica de la Hispaniola (SOH Conservaci\\xF3n) is working to protect the country's unique ecosystems by supporting local farmers in the sustainable production of shade-grown coffee. Highly valued in the market for its superior quality, shade-grown coffee offers farmers the opportunity to earn a higher income while contributing to conservation efforts.</p><p>Thanks to this initiative, more than 56 coffee growers have been trained in organic agriculture, agroforestry, and the Smithsonian Bird Friendly program, a certification developed by scientists to preserve habitats and protect migratory songbirds. Equipped with this knowledge, local farmers have planted 34,725 tree seedlings on over 30 hectares, integrating bird-friendly practices into their coffee farms.</p><p>Now, their efforts are paying off. The coffee has successfully obtained Bird Friendly certification, and local producers are already exporting their specialty Bahoruco coffee to Japan, the EU, and the United States at premium prices. Given the complexity of the certification process, the initiative's grant to SOH covers the cost of a certification specialist to guide farmers through the requirements, ensuring long-term success.</p><p>By aligning sustainable farming with conservation, this initiative is not only safeguarding biodiversity but also creating economic opportunities for local communities.</p><p>Protecting the Critically Endangered Ridgway's Hawk in the Dominican Republic</p><p>With fewer than 500 individuals remaining in the wild, the Ridgway's Hawk is one of the most critically endangered raptors in the world due to habitat destruction and human persecution. To address the urgent need for their protection and prevent their extinction, The Peregrine Fund and Fondo Peregrino developed a ten-year conservation action plan to safeguard this iconic species. Their efforts, supported by CEPF, have led to the management of 125-150 hawk pairs in Los Haitises National Park and its surrounding areas.</p><p>The project has also spurred environmental outreach and capacity-building programs in ten communities, raising awareness about the hawk's ecological significance. Through outreach and capacity-building programs, the project empowered communities to take an active role in conservation efforts, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility for the species' survival.</p><p>A landmark achievement is the proposed special law for the protection and reproduction of the Hispaniolan Hawk, which, if passed, will legally protect the Ridgway's Hawk and establish May 25 as Ridgway's Hawk Day.</p><p>Climate and Conservation Risk Mapping in St. Vincent and the Grenadines</p><p>In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, six communities along the Central Mountain Range have embraced climate and conservation risk mapping to safeguard their ecosystems. Led by JEMS, a volunteer community organization that empowers communities to protect the natural resources, the project developed a 30-layer GIS map that gathered valuable data on various environmental factors, such as vegetation, species distribution, and climate vulnerabilities, to guide conservation efforts and improve the understanding of ecosystem risks. Additionally, the NGO conducted training for local communities on how to use climate risk mapping tools. This training helped communities better understand potential climate-related threats, such as hurricanes, and prepare accordingly. When Hurricane Beryl struck in July 2024, the communities that had participated in the risk mapping activity felt more prepared and were able to take proactive measures to protect themselves and their environment.</p><p>JEMS has also helped establish a Climate Change Association that has been effective in responding to emergencies and mobilizing resources, especially during the Beryl Hurricane. The core principle of the NGO is that communities have the power to shape their own future-they simply need the right tools and support to do so. With the support of the CEPF, this vision is moving closer to reality.</p><p>Collaborative Action Plans and Knowledge Sharing for Protecting Endangered Species across the region</p><p>Across five islands in the Caribbean, CEPF is supporting the development of Conservation Action Plans (CAPs) for nine priority species, including the Antiguan Racer, Bahamian Oriole, and Saint Lucia Whiptail. Spearheaded by Re:wild, these plans emphasize capacity building, cross-island collaboration, and technical conservation actions.</p><p>The Jamaican Blackbird is the first species to benefit from an implemented CAP, while plans for the rest are under review. In addition to the action plans, Re:wild is creating platforms for knowledge exchange, such as the Conservation Call to Action webinar series. These webinar series has united conservationists across the region, fostering knowledge-sharing and collaboration. The series has also inspired the creation of the Caribbean Species Conservation Action Network (CSCAN), a platform dedicated to advancing biodiversity protection.</p><p>A Future Built on Empowering Communities</p><p>The Caribbean Hotspot Project is a unique initiative for the World Bank, as it directly supports civil society organizations through the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund. The project's team leader and senior environmental specialist at the World Bank, Natalia Magradze, views this as a promising model for biodiversity conservation and community empowerment.</p><p>Civil society organizations play a vital role by engaging with local communities, helping them diversify their livelihoods, conserve the environment, all while building trust. They serve as pillars of continuity and support for communities most affected by biodiversity loss. This is the reason why civil society organizations are the cornerstone of this initiative. The project holds significant economies of scale by enabling dozens of grassroots organizations to implement tailored, impactful solutions on the ground.</p><p>Natalia Magradze</p><p>Senior Environmental Specialist - World Bank</p><p>As the region faces mounting environmental and climate challenges, these stories offer hope and a blueprint for sustainable development.</p><p>The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund - Caribbean Hotspot Project is the recipient executed trust-funded intervention for US$ 13.9 million.
