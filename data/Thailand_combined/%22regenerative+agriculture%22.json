Today's launch of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2025 report delivers sobering insights, and with them, the power to act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The data in this report tells us that around the world, hunger, malnutrition and inequality continue to deny millions of people the most basic human rights: the right to food, the right to health and the right to a dignified life. This is not just a humanitarian crisis, but also a development crisis, an economic crisis and a crisis of justice. These crises are manmade. It is within our power to deliver on the rights that all people should enjoy.</p><p>Ending hunger is not a single goal. It is the cornerstone of sustainable development. Progress on food and nutrition improves learning outcomes in children. It increases the earning potential of adults. It empowers women and youth. It reduces healthcare costs. It builds peaceful societies. In short, achieving food security unlocks progress across every other aspect of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Yet, we are far off track. Despite the fact that hunger has declined, and only slightly, tonight, more than 670 million people go to bed hungry, and in regions like Africa, the situation continues to worsen. 307 million people are hungry on that continent alone - nearly one in five.</p><p>Hunger is also deepening the inequality faced across the world. Women's nutrition continues to deteriorate. Anaemia among women aged 15 to 49 has risen over the past decade. Two thirds of women in that age group do not meet minimum dietary diversity, undermining their health and the health of future generations.</p><p>Meanwhile, children are suffering consequences that will last a lifetime. One third of children between 6 and 23 months are not getting the nutrients they need during the most critical window for brain development and growth.</p><p>Ultimately, affordability is at the heart of it all. Since 2020, global food price inflation has consistently outpaced general inflation. In low-income countries, this means skipping meals, selling assets or pulling children out of school just so families can afford to eat. In every region, these overlapping crises: conflict, climate shocks, inflation, displacement, are exposing the deep fragility of our food systems.</p><p>So, the message is clear: cooperation must replace conflict. We must transform the systems that feed the world. Urgently, systematically and inclusively. Food systems touch every part of our lives. They are not just about agriculture or nutrition. They are about how we grow, process, transport, trade, buy and consume food - and how these choices shape economies, societies and ecosystems.</p><p>Food systems are about opportunity. Today, food systems provide jobs and livelihoods to over a billion people worldwide, directly or indirectly. In many low-income countries, they account for up to 60 per cent of employment. So, transforming these systems is not only about feeding people, it is about reducing poverty, creating opportunities and building resilience.</p><p>Transformed food systems can: Help support smallholder farmers, women and youth; lower the cost of healthy diets by improving infrastructure, reducing losses and ensuring fair market access; create green jobs by shifting to sustainable production practices; improve public health by aligning production and marketing with nutritional needs; strengthen food sovereignty and reduce dependency by diversifying production and trade.</p><p>Perhaps most urgently, they can deliver climate solutions. Today, food systems contribute about one third of global greenhouse-gas emissions. But, they are also uniquely positioned to help restore ecosystems and adapt to a changing climate. Sustainable practices, regenerative agriculture, reduced food waste and smarter logistics can turn food systems from a source of degradation into a force for regeneration.</p><p>Let's not forget, the true cost of our current food systems is not just measured in dollars. It is measured in lives lost to malnutrition, in children's stunted futures, in degraded soils and polluted rivers, in growing inequality and lost opportunity.</p><p>Transformation will not happen on its own. It requires political will, long-term investment, and bold leadership. It demands policy coherence across sectors - from agriculture and trade to health, education and finance. It calls for empowering local governments and communities. It means working with the private sector to align incentives. And it requires putting people - especially the most vulnerable - at the center of decision-making.</p><p>If we want to succeed, we have to move beyond emergency response and short-term fixes. From individual projects to sector-wide transitions.</p><p>The good news is that we know what works, and we have the solutions. We have seen it in countries that have strengthened social protection, invested in school meals, supported farmers with technology, or created urban-rural market linkages. We have brilliant scientific minds and data to drive our work. What we need now is the determination to act at the speed and scale the moment demands.</p><p>The time for incremental change has passed. The time for ambition and solidarity is now. We must not accept a world where hunger or where what we put on our plates endangers the planet. Instead, let us commit to build food systems that are resilient, equitable and sustainable, ones that create opportunity and dignity for all.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["So, transforming these systems is not only about feeding people, it is about reducing poverty, creating opportunities and building resilience.

And right now, we are facing devastating losses. With the avalanche of global aid cuts, experts estimate that 2.3 million children in low- and middle-income countries will lose support to treat acute malnutrition. This means over 350,000 extra preventable child deaths yearly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change is accelerating. Rapid environmental shifts are robbing millions of smallholder farmers of their ability to grow nutritious food. Meanwhile, conflict and war continue to displace communities and deepen hunger. The Global Report on Food Crises shows that more than 295 million people faced acute hunger last year, the sixth consecutive annual increase.</p><p>In the face of multiple overlapping crises, losing access to real food cannot be an option. Since 2021, global leaders have responded to the UN Secretary-General's urgent call: transform our food systems to secure the future of real food. While \"food systems\" may sound abstract, their consequences are real and tangible. They show up in the rising cost of groceries, the dignity of farm work, the fight for food justice and growing demand for climate accountability. Food systems connect nutrition, sustainability, livelihoods and equity.</p><p>Thailand is playing a key role in this transformation. As host of the Preparatory Youth Conference for the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit +4 in May, Bangkok welcomed over 100 young leaders committed to reshaping how we grow, distribute, consume and dispose of food. These delegates -- most of whom came from developing countries -- shared strategies to support their national governments in implementing meaningful food systems reform.</p><p>With its ability to bring people together, the UN remains a critical space where declining trends can be reversed into collective progress. But to spark transformation, leadership is essential. And that leadership must include the next generation.</p><p>Young people are not waiting their turn -- they are stepping up now. They are demanding a seat at the decision-making table, especially on food policy. They understand that intergenerational change doesn't happen through viral social media posts or one-off events. It takes investment of time, money, training and trust. It means equipping young professionals with the political education and organising skills needed to influence and lead.</p><p>In an age dominated by ultra-processed foods and profit-driven agribusiness, youth are resisting systems that harm people and the planet. They know health doesn't come wrapped in plastic. They advocate for diets that prevent disease, farming that heals the Earth and policies that put people before profit. They are also challenging the gender norms that keep young women trapped in informal, undervalued roles across the food chain -- from harvesting to selling. Young leaders are thus reclaiming the meaning of real food: fresh, local, seasonal and grown with care. They are not only calling for change -- they are growing it, cooking it, and organising for it. Through agroecology, regenerative agriculture and localised economies, they are building food systems that restore ecosystems and communities.</p><p>Yet passion alone is not enough. Youth-led initiatives remain underfunded and under-supported. Youth unemployment globally still hovers at about 12.6% (2024), and many young changemakers face insecure work and limited opportunities for influence. To be effective, public policies must not be crafted behind closed doors or imposed top-down. They must be co-created with those who live the consequences of inaction -- and who are choosing, every day, to act anyway.</p><p>Activism. Politics. Systems leadership. These are not optional -- they are essential to change the status quo and build fair, resilient food systems. The Youth Preparatory Conference, organised by the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub with support from FAO, was more than a symbolic gathering. Its outcomes will feed into the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit +4 and inform global talks at COP30 in Brazil.</p><p>We call on governments, institutions and donors to fund youth-led innovation. Include youth in decision-making bodies. Create platforms not just for participation -- but for leadership.</p><p>To secure the future of food, leaders must serve people before profits.

Skill development cannot have prescriptive templates, he said. We must empower states to craft solutions that are rooted in their local economic contexts and aligned with the aspirations of their youth. Only then can we create meaningful impact and sustained transformation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Underscoring this vision for a more adaptive and responsive ecosystem, the Minister announced the establishment of two new Centres of Excellence-out of the five proposed nationwide-at National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) in Hyderabad and Chennai. These centres will serve as national reference points for high-quality instructor training and specialised skilling aligned with emerging domains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister, Shri Jayant Chaudhary underscored the imperative for states to adopt a more strategic, outcome-oriented approach to skill development-one that is deeply aligned with the aspirations of India's youth and the evolving demands of the economy.</p><p>Recognising that quality training is only as strong as the trainers who deliver it, the Minister called for dedicated investments in faculty development-through improved institutional capacity, competitive remuneration, and rigorous pedagogical standards. He urged states to adopt a decentralised and data-driven planning framework by working closely with district collectors to develop localised skilling plans, informed by granular skill gap assessments conducted in collaboration with expert bodies like the World Bank.</p><p>The Minister firmly directed that the CITS (Craft Instructor Training Scheme) certification be made mandatory for all newly recruited instructors, particularly in newly established ITIs across states. He emphasized that this requirement is critical to ensuring high-quality, standardized instruction across the country. To uphold instructional excellence and credibility, states were urged to revise their Recruitment Rules (RR) to align with NCVT norms, thereby institutionalizing CITS as a non-negotiable qualification. Uniform enforcement of this standard, the Minister noted, is essential to maintaining parity with national skilling benchmarks and delivering consistent training outcomes across the ecosystem.</p><p>Further, the Minister proposed the establishment of a robust grading and assessment framework for state-owned ITIs, to instil a culture of accountability, quality assurance, and performance-driven outcomes. He encouraged states to leverage platforms such as DISHA meetings to sensitise elected representatives about the role of skilling in economic development and social equity. Stronger industry linkages, aspirational positioning of vocational education, and language-based training for international mobility were identified as key enablers of a globally competitive workforce. Acknowledging the time-intensive nature of investing in youth, the Minister reaffirmed that such investments yield profound, long-term dividends-not just for the individual, but for the nation's collective progress.</p><p>Understanding the evolving landscape of high-growth sectors is essential for designing responsive skilling strategies.

The company is investing in its industry-leading pipeline to accelerate the delivery of solutions that growers need. Late-stage transformative technologies are being combined with the annual refresh of the global seed portfolio and the addition of hundreds of new product registrations and formulations every year.</p><p>Industry-leading pipeline delivers on the transformation of agriculture</p><p>In 2022, 15 projects advanced, including new crop protection active ingredients, new seed traits and digital models. Bayer refreshed its seed portfolio with 500 new hybrid and variety deployments and its crop protection portfolio with 10 new formulation launches and more than 250 new registrations. The R and D investment of 2.6 billion euros before special items in 2022 continues to advance a pipeline with an estimated peak sales potential of more than 30 billion euros, half of which are incremental to the existing base.</p><p>'A bold vision takes a bold investment. It takes all five of our innovation platforms - breeding, biotechnology, chemistry, biologicals and data science to power this pipeline. But it is far more than these platforms alone - it is the convergence of this innovation that allows us to generate system solutions to solve our most pressing challenges,' said Dr. Robert Reiter, Head of R and D at Bayer's Crop Science Division. 'Farmers need the best genetics with best-in-class traits, they need data-driven planting scripts to know when and where to plant those crops. And they need lower impact small molecule crop protection paired with late-season biological solutions and precision applications to sustainably protect those crops. We have a deep and proud history of successfully converting these engines into viable, valuable products for growers.'</p><p>Bayer's R and D pipeline includes several exciting and new technologies:</p><p>Designer Seeds and Next Generation Breeding Technology: With its unmatched germplasm library, Bayer is advancing existing breeding technologies while also developing the next generation of tools like gene editing to create designer seeds for growers in crops like corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables. The precision breeding program helps to improve both yield and efficiency for farmers, using AI technology to develop the right seeds for the right conditions. In addition, the company is hybridising staple crops like rice and wheat, to improve their productivity and sustainability. Direct seeded rice has the potential to transform rice production, significantly reducing water consumption while increasing yields. Initial trials under the Bayer Direct Acres program are underway in India.</p><p>Transformative Trait Technologies: The company is expanding its industry-leading expertise into new spaces, like the Preceon Smart Corn System, offering reduced plant height which brings multiple benefits to the farmer. This includes reducing the risk of losses from high wind, season-long access for more precise use of crop protection products and nutrient applications and the potential to optimise inputs, planting populations and field placement through digital tools. The system approach includes digital tools to support planting and showcases the transition from selling inputs to selling solutions. The first generation of short-stature corn to launch was developed via plant breeding and the next generation, expected mid-to-late this decade, was created using plant biotechnology and will expand the reach to more hybrids and acres. Earlier this month, the USDA completed the review of the biotech short-stature corn trait which will help advance through the approval process going forward. With the expertise in protein optimisation technology, RNAi technology and biotech, Bayer is able to stack new trait technologies like short-stature corn with current and next-generation insect-control traits like its third-generation corn rootworm trait, to allow farmers to reap the benefits of insect and weed control with this shorter stature product. Other value-driving examples are Bayer's insect and herbicide tolerant soybean varieties with multiple modes of action for Brazil, which are essential to manage the changing pest and weed resistance challenges typical in a tropical environment.</p><p>Sustainable Small Molecules: New approaches to crop protection are expected to shape the industry in future. This includes development of an entirely new herbicide mode-of-action for broadacre weed control, the first in the industry for over three decades. This molecule has demonstrated effective control of key resistant grasses in research and is expected to be commercialised towards the end of this decade. Further examples include a new broad-spectrum fungicide for cereals, corn, fruits and vegetables with blockbuster potential in research phase 3 and a new mode of action broad-spectrum horticulture fungicide in research phase 2 with opportunities to extent to cereals and oil seed rape. Artificial Intelligence helps Bayer design the next generation of crop protection, putting sustainability and environmental impact reduction at the core. New products will enable farmers to tailor and target use in specific ways, for example by using PROTAC technology which is being co-developed with Oerth Bio that is designed to interact with only one target protein and safeguard beneficial organisms. Bayer is also optimising application of existing chemicals through digital and AI technologies.</p><p>Bayer's innovation engines will power agricultural evolution by equipping farmers with the tools, technologies, and options they need for the future of regenerative agriculture. Precision bred seed products will offer significant acceleration for the genetic gain of yield potential and will be protected by game-changing traits that enable no-till farming to improve soil health. Combined with innovative small molecules and biological solutions that can protect biodiversity and offer low to no-residue solutions, and verified soil improvements through digital tools and technologies, Bayer will shape the future of regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Unparalleled pipeline with estimated peak sales potential of more than 30 billion euros to promote regenerative agricultural practices and enable farmers to support both global food security and mitigation of climate change</p><p>Bayer to expand into new accessible ag-adjacent markets</p><p>Beyond this core, Bayer is strongly positioned to expand into new market opportunities adjacent to its core offerings, for instance:</p><p>Crop Fertility and Biological Breakthroughs: Biologically based nitrogen-fixation technologies can help farmers grow more with less, reducing emissions and costs for farmers in crops like corn and wheat. The potential biodiversity and soil health benefits from reduced synthetic nitrogen use are significant, and the company's early-stage technology holds great promise. With late season application of biological-based crop protection for insect and disease control, the company also sees opportunities for reduced residues in fruit and vegetable production, an attribute increasingly desired by consumers. As market leaders in biologicals with products like Serenade, and through its open innovation partnerships with Gingko, Kimitec, M2i and AlphaBio, Bayer is well positioned in this critical, rapidly growing space and has the ambition to reach more than 1.5 billion euros in sales by 2035.</p><p>Biofuels: Cover crops help farmers protect their fields in a sustainable way, promoting soil health. CoverCress, in which Bayer is the majority share owner, will open additional revenue streams from the sale of the same-named cover crop to biofuel makers. Oil extracted from CoverCress is designed to achieve a lower carbon intensity score and can be made into renewable fuels without competing against food crops, due to its planting in between seasons. With more uptake, there is significant market opportunity for this sustainable crop.</p><p>Digital value chain: Advancements in precision agriculture and digital farming technology are helping farmers maximise the productivity and sustainability of their land and agricultural practices. Climate FieldView has become an essential decision tool with subscriptions on more than 220 million crop acres globally. In addition to delivering real-time agronomic insights to farmers, it also serves as the digital platform delivering tailored solutions like the Preceon Smart Corn System, combining Bayer's new short-stature corn hybrids with digital recommendations tailored to our customers' fields and performance goals. Beyond the farm, FieldView is the gateway to creating value chain solutions, serving as the system of record for our customers' climate-smart farming practices and powering Bayer's global carbon programs, including Bayer's ForGround platform in the US. Earlier this year, the company unveiled new cloud-based enterprise solutions: Bayer AgPowered Services, powered by the new Microsoft Azure Data Manager for Agriculture, offering a suite of advanced digital capabilities and robust digital infrastructure to accelerate innovation in the food and agriculture industries. Building from the new cloud offerings, innovators and companies across the farm and food value chains can accelerate their speed to value for customers, bring greater transparency to consumers, and deliver increased opportunity for farmers.</p><p>Carbon Farming: Bayer is a leading provider of solutions and platforms that support farmers in removing carbon from the atmosphere and reduce their emissions. No-till farming enabled by herbicide tolerant traits and the use of cover crops can help improve soil health, reduce soil erosion, and cut carbon emissions. As an added benefit, Bayer's Carbon Initiative opens new revenue streams to farmers by connecting them to the global carbon markets.</p><p>Rodrigo Santos added: 'Bayer is well positioned to lead in the regenerative agriculture space due to our emphasis in digital transformation, commitment to innovation and strong partnerships.

But what about the climate-conscious farmers who had hoped that the \"Green Deal\" would benefit them, their land and the environment? An investigation by our reporter Hans von der Brelie in Auersthal, a small village in the far-eastern reaches of the Republic of Austria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Herbert Zetner gets up at four a.m. every day. It's still pitch dark outside. But like many organic farmers, Zetner must juggle two jobs. He works as an IT expert at a bank in Vienna until the early afternoon. Then he changes over from his office chair to the driver seat of his tractor. In the Marchfeld, a large alluvial plain near the Austrian capital, on this November day he is sowing gold-of-pleasure, also known as camelina or false flax.</p><p>The Marchfeld region is considered the \"granary of Austria\" but driving through the pretty villages with their imperial yellow house facades, you notice that many of the fields are quite narrow and they are laid out next to each other like different coloured hand towels. This is strip cropping. With this method organic farmers are striving to heal the wounds that former monocultures with their huge fields have inflicted on the landscape.</p><p>Conventional agriculture wreaked havoc on the Marchfeld: Over-fertilisation, overexploitation of groundwater reserves and a dearth of hedgerows have led to a massive loss of species and soil erosion, extending to desertification. The plain overheated, it dried out - and in order to continue supplying Vienna with vegetables, many farmers promptly resorted to spraying toxic substances and artificial fertilisers.</p><p>However, a change in thinking is now manifest, even in the Zetner family. \"I used to spray myself with poison, I was constantly ill,\" says Herbert. When his father passed away, Herbert and his brother took over the farm and transitioned to organic farming. Instead of fungicides and chemical fertilisers, Zetner uses a home-made hay tea made from fermented grasses.</p><p>Organic farming often means more work, says Zetner: \"Previously, with conventional farming, we needed close to 500 hours for our 74 hectares of fields and forest. Now, with regenerative agriculture, we need 1500 hours. This means we have three times the effort!\". Nevertheless, Herbert seems happy with himself and the world. \"Organic used to be considered exotic, but people now realise that organic is normal,\" he sums up.</p><p>Herbert grows 24 different crops. Gold-of-pleasure (camelina), oats, spelt, barley, rye, chickpeas, caraway seeds, Turkish melissa (lemon balm) ... the list is long! The part-time farmer practises regenerative agriculture and has been officially certified as an organic farmer for five years.</p><p>An EU-wide research project is currently underway to find out how CO2 from the air can be better captured in the soil. Carbon capture cropping slows down climate change; and farmers, including Herbert Zetner, are happy about fertile humus. He proudly shows me a small plant that he has pulled up out of the loose soil: \"Here you can see the soil clinging to the roots. This means a super interaction of the plant with the soil. The humus is well penetrated by the roots and finely crumbled. That's what I like!</p><p>Humus formation works with strip cropping and catch cropping (several crops are cultivated with and next to each other); a counter-model to monocultures and giant fields. To put the brakes on climate change and the extinction of species, the European Commission had planned to require all farmers to leave four per cent of their land fallow. However, protests by conventional farmers led to this being overturned this spring (2024).Consequently, my question to Zetner: \"Fallow land, crop rotation and flower strips - should these be mandatory in the European Union or voluntary?\" As he steers the seed drill over the field, Herbert Zetner says in his deliberate, thoughtful tone: \"I think it should be mandatory.</p><p>Today Herbert is sowing the winter seed. His fields should always be green, regardless of the season. This is also good for the CO2 balance. He wants more than fine words from the EU, he also wants a higher organic premium and financial compensation for his many hours of organic labour: \"Farmers who pay attention to humus formation want to do something for nature. This should also be financially worthwhile. I capture CO2! I do a lot of good things! This should be recognised by the EU!</p><p>International authorities in the field of biodiversity research, such as Professor Franz Essl from the University of Vienna, agree. To slow down climate change the extinction of species, soil erosion and desertification, agriculture would have to change its cultivation methods. This requires financial incentives, says Essl: \"Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is something agriculture can do. If the soil is cultivated differently, more humus remains in the soil and this should be of greater value to society than it has been in the past.</p><p>The global expert's recommendations for European agricultural policy are clear: Rewetting drained wetlands, fallow land management (i.e. regularly setting aside some fields), windbreak hedges, building up humus. etc. The EU Commission should not cave in to the powerful big farmer lobby, \"but rather they should stay on track\", says Essl.</p><p>In a recently published special report, the European Court of Auditors also scrutinised the EU's previous \"action plans\" to promote organic farming and severely reprimanded the European Commission: An overall strategy is lacking. Money is still being distributed on the basis of the watering pot principle. And if the European Union wants to achieve its self-imposed target of 25 per cent of agricultural land under organic cultivation by 2030, not only does it need better marketing strategies for organic products, it also needs binding and \"measurable targets\".</p><p>Source: Euronews</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["However, a change in thinking is now manifest, even in the Zetner family. \"I used to spray myself with poison, I was constantly ill,\" says Herbert.

His family has farmed the land just 20 kilometres from Rome for generations, raising goats, growing wheat, and harvesting fruit and vegetables in harmony with nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now semi-retired, he worries about the future of small-scale farming in Italy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The climate has changed a lot in the last decade. Fifty-year-old oak trees are withering and my livestock are suffering. There has been a collapse in sheep fertility and poultry mortality because of the heat, he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Onorati isn't the only one. Farmers across Europe - particularly in the drought-prone south - are experiencing similar devastation and many smallholder farmers have gone out of business. Between 2003 and 2016, the number of farms in the EU-27 declined by 32 per cent, from 15 million to 10 million.</p><p>In the past two years alone, an additional 10 per cent of European farms have closed, largely due to drought and extreme weather, which have decimated crops and livelihoods.</p><p>If this trend continues, by 2040, Europe may only have 3.9 million farms left, with industrial farms consolidating more power. This would spell disaster for the environment, as the delicate balance between climate, farming and the food system becomes increasingly threatened.</p><p>To reverse this trend, policymakers must support the nature-based farming practices that Onorati and many regenerative farmers within the Climate Farmers community uphold. With the Common Agricultural Policy set for negotiation next year, now is the time to rethink farming policy.</p><p>Industrial farming is accelerating climate breakdown</p><p>The ecological impact of large-scale farming is significant. Export-driven farms operate in monocultures - growing single crops - that deplete soil quality over time and rely heavily on pesticides and fertilisers to maximise productivity. This focus on short-term, maximum output threatens an already fragile environmental ecosystem.</p><p>Across most of Europe, our soils are so depleted that they're basically dead, says Philippe Birker, founder of Climate Farmers, a social enterprise scaling up regenerative farming across Europe. When rain comes, the soil doesn't soak up water and this is called soil erosion. It is also why we have so much flooding damage right now.</p><p>Based on the science of agroecology, more people in the farming community are turning to regenerative practices, not only to minimise environmental impacts but to build weather-resilient farms in response to an increasingly unpredictable climate.</p><p>One of the amazing benefits of regenerative agriculture is that it increases soil water storage capacity. Healthy soil can absorb water and store that water to release in times of drought, explains Birker.</p><p>Agroecology offers a hopeful alternative for smallholder farmers by focusing on seed diversity, community integration and curricular systems. Although this approach may not prioritise growth, it promotes long-term sustainability as Europe transitions to a net-zero future.</p><p>Reducing dependence on external imports</p><p>Fortunately, Onorati grew up learning agroecological farming practices from his nomadic grandparents and parents, alongside the rural farming communities in southern Italy.</p><p>My grandparents had few resources and learned to work with nature without compromising productivity. Over time, this mixed farming-livestock system has proven its value, Onorati explains.</p><p>We've also adapted our crops to climate changes, constantly working to make our farm less dependent on the external market - farmers can regain their power by becoming more independent from the mainstream system.</p><p>Like Onorati, Birker champions regenerative farming, providing evidence that these practices work, giving small-scale farmers the confidence to adapt their operations to their environment.</p><p>Early members of the Climate Farmers community are already drawing attention from neighbouring farms for their simple but innovative methods.</p><p>Conventional farmers can't believe that you can have green grass in June in southern Portugal without an irrigation system but simply by grazing cows, Birker says, highlighting the regenerative effects of manure on soil quality.</p><p>We need more model farms like this for farmers to relate to. What works in southern Portugal does not work in northern England; it's very context-specific, which makes scaling much harder, he adds.</p><p>Cost of inaction: Drought, flooding and extreme heat</p><p>Onorati's experience with poor livestock fertility reflects the broader crisis facing European farmers as they contend with the increasingly extreme effects of climate change, which vary across the region.</p><p>Over the past two years alone, southern Europe has endured severe droughts and heat stress. However, the situation has become unprecedented in the 2024 harvest, with drought now affecting both southeastern and northern regions.</p><p>The latest data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, shows how temperatures continue to increase as carbon floods the atmosphere.</p><p>The average temperature in September 2024, for instance, was 1.54\\xB0C above the pre-industrial level - the 14th month in 15 months for which the global average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. The 2024 summer in Europe was the hottest on record.</p><p>Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of C3S, noted the widespread impacts of these heat extremes and record temperatures: Prolonged high temperatures damage entire ecosystems and stifle agricultural productivity. It also forces farmers to rely on intensive irrigation, putting immense pressure on already scarce water resources.</p><p>For farmers like Onorati, whose resources are limited, these conditions pose an existential threat. As Burgess pointed out, more nature-based solutions-like agroecological farming-are becoming crucial.</p><p>Farmers need to work with current climate conditions, adapting their practices to be more sustainable and resilient as we move toward net-zero industries in the coming decades he said.</p><p>Fluctuations in rainfall are also playing a role. There were varying degrees of rainfall over the last European summer, with 35 per cent of European rivers notably or exceptionally low, especially in the southeast of Europe, while much of central Europe saw exceptionally high average river flows for this time of year. This, combined with the 'dead soil' Birker mentioned, suggests devastating future consequences if farming systems do not change.</p><p>To support the industry, C3S offers access to historical climate data specifically for agricultural applications, as used by the UN-supported FAO Geospatial Platform. This data allows farmers to evaluate the effects of climate conditions, such as the impact of temperature and rainfall on crop yields and the influence of humidity variation on disease resistance.</p><p>The data can also help local farmers anticipate risks from extreme weather events by analysing historical patterns for specific regions. Governments can also use this information to study past weather trends in key agricultural areas, assisting in yield forecasting and agricultural policy development.</p><p>But will farmers and consumers change their ways?</p><p>To scale up ecological farming practices, consumers need to support farmers to drive demand and make these farming models economically viable. However with high inflation, eroding purchasing power and rising living costs - are European consumers ready to make this change? Are farmers willing to risk everything in the transition?</p><p>Arnaud Petit, Executive Director of the International Grains Council, argues that the main driver for EU farmers to develop their businesses will remain market demand rather than public support. This is even more relevant in periods of uncertainty regarding the policy environment in the EU.</p><p>Currently, larger-scale farming operations can often produce food at lower costs, using chemicals like pesticides to boost productivity and reduce losses. But this, according to Birker, is a false economy. The prices we see in supermarkets are not reflecting the actual cost of the product. This is a policy issue that we're experiencing.</p><p>In the long-term, Onorati believes that by working with nature rather than against it, agroecological practices will help stabilise prices by insulating farmers from market fluctuations and helping lower agricultural production costs.</p><p>If supported by appropriate public policies and financial resources, small and medium-sized agroecological farms can produce at decreasing costs. This allows them to offer consumers more stable prices and generally lower prices in relation to the quality of the product.</p><p>Measuring and pricing the ecosystem</p><p>Scaling up this new type of agriculture will remain a challenge as long as the market does not clearly value specific farming practices.</p><p>The solution proposed by Climate Farmers lies in the measurement and pricing of ecosystem services. After spending two years devising a Carbon Credits Methodology, Birker aims to take this concept further.</p><p>Companies don't know what the damage to biodiversity is and they don't feel the responsibility to pay for it. If there was a wider market for ecosystem services, we could measure biodiversity increase with eDNA technology and soil water storage capacity increase with satellite technology quite easily, Birker explains.</p><p>If farmers proved that they achieved these ecosystem services, they would get more subsidies. From this, we would see a large-scale transition towards regenerative agriculture because, suddenly, farmers would have a business case.</p><p>For this to happen, the public sector needs to step in, valuing the role of smallholder farmers in preserving environmental stability, Europe's food system and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p>We all have an interest in supporting farmers to make that happen, Birker concludes.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["This focus on short-term, maximum output threatens an already fragile environmental ecosystem. Across most of Europe, our soils are so depleted that they're basically dead, says Philippe Birker, founder of Climate Farmers, a social enterprise scaling up regenerative farming across Europe. When rain comes, the soil doesn't soak up water and this is called soil erosion. It is also why we have so much flooding damage right now. Based on the science of agroecology, more people in the farming community are turning to regenerative practices, not only to minimise environmental impacts but to build weather-resilient farms in response to an increasingly unpredictable climate. One of the amazing benefits of regenerative agriculture is that it increases soil water storage capacity. Healthy soil can absorb water and store that water to release in times of drought, explains Birker. Agroecology offers a hopeful alternative for smallholder farmers by focusing on seed diversity, community integration and curricular systems. Although this approach may not prioritise growth, it promotes long-term sustainability as Europe transitions to a net-zero future.

Nature is life. And yet we are waging a war against it. A war where there can be no winner. Every year, we see temperatures climbing higher. Every day, we lose more species. Every minute, we dump a garbage truck of plastic waste into our oceans, rivers and lakes.</p><p>Make no mistake. This is what an existential crisis looks like. No country, rich or poor, is immune to the devastation inflicted by climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution. These environmental crises are intertwined. They know no borders. And they are devastating ecosystems and livelihoods, threatening human health and undermining sustainable development.</p><p>The drivers of this destruction are embedded in outdated economic models, fuelling unsustainable production and consumption patterns. They are multiplied by inequalities - in wealth and power. And with each passing day, we are edging closer to tipping points that could fuel further hunger, displacement, and even armed conflicts. We have already altered 75 per cent of the Earth's land surface and 66 per cent of its ocean environments.</p><p>Biodiversity is humanity's ally. We must move from plundering it to preserving it. As I have said time and again, making peace with nature is the defining task of the twenty-first century.</p><p>That is the spirit of today's Declaration of the World Coalition for Peace with Nature: A call for action to enhance national and international efforts towards a balanced and harmonious relationship with nature - protecting nature and conserving, restoring and sustainably using and sharing our global biodiversity. A call to recognize the vital knowledge, innovations and practices of Indigenous people, people of African descent, farmers and local communities. A call for life.</p><p>Last month, UN Member States adopted the Pact for the Future. The Pact recognizes the need to accelerate efforts to restore, protect, conserve and sustainably use the environment. It emphasizes the importance of halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, and other terrestrial and marine ecosystems that act as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases.</p><p>This means conserving biodiversity, while ensuring social and environmental safeguards - in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.</p><p>When the Framework was adopted two years ago in Montreal, the world made bold commitments to living in harmony with nature by mid-century. Its goals and targets require robust monitoring, reporting, and review arrangements to track progress, as well as a resource mobilization package to increase finance for biodiversity from all sources - mobilizing at least $200 billion per year by 2030.</p><p>But we must now turn these promises into action in four vital ways.</p><p>First - at the national level, all countries must finally present clear, ambitious and detailed plans to align with the Framework's targets. These national plans should be developed in coordination with nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans - with positive outcomes in the Sustainable Development Goals. We must shift to nature-positive business models and production: renewable energies and sustainable supply chains, zero-waste policies and circular economies, regenerative agriculture and sustainable farming practices. These must become the default for Governments and businesses alike.</p><p>Second - we must agree on a strengthened monitoring and transparency framework. This is not only vital for accountability but also about enabling course corrections and driving ambition.</p><p>Third - finance promises must be kept and support to developing countries accelerated. We cannot afford to leave Cali without new pledges to adequately capitalize the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund, and without commitments to mobilize other sources of public and private finance to deliver the Framework - in full.</p><p>And we must bring the private sector on board. Those profiting from nature cannot treat it like a free, infinite resource. They must step up and contribute to its protection and restoration. By operationalizing the mechanism on the sharing of benefits from the use of Digital Sequence Information on Genetic Resources, we will give them one clear avenue to do so, bringing more equity and inclusivity.</p><p>Finally - in the spirit of this COP de la gente, we must engage all parts of society, in particular Indigenous Peoples, people of African descent, and local communities.</p><p>Too often, they have been on the sidelines of global environmental policy. Too often, environmental defenders have been threatened and killed. Indigenous Peoples, people of African descent, and local communities are guardians of our nature. Their traditional knowledge is a living library of biodiversity conservation. They must be protected. And they must be part of every biodiversity conversation.</p><p>The establishment of a permanent subsidiary body within the Convention on Biological Diversity would mark a significant step forward, ensuring Indigenous voices are heard at every stage of the process. Peace with nature means peace for those who protect it. We must defend the people who defend nature.</p><p>Across all these areas, we know progress is possible. Many countries around the world are stepping up to lead the way. Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Malaysia are leading by example by ramping up efforts to curb deforestation. The Congo Basin is intensifying efforts to increase protected area coverage. The European Union's Nature Restoration Law is a step towardx halting and reversing biodiversity loss.</p><p>Mobilizing all countries - each with different levels of wealth and capacities - is challenging. But swift global cooperation can provide the defence we so desperately need - against wildfires, floods, extreme weather, and pandemics.</p><p>Last year's Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction demonstrated our determination for every hectare of the planet. We need the same determination later in the year as countries come together to conclude negotiations on a landmark treaty to tackle plastic pollution. Let us be inspired and lifted by these examples.</p><p>We are in Cali to accelerate progress, commit resources, and elevate the role of Indigenous Peoples, people of African descent, and local communities. We can - and we must - save the ecosystems that sustain us and keep our climate goals within reach.</p><p>The alternative is unthinkable. The survival of our planet - and our own - is on the line. Let us choose wisely. Let us choose life. Let us make peace with nature.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["When the Framework was adopted two years ago in Montreal, the world made bold commitments to living in harmony with nature by mid-century.

The country's power, heating, and transport sectors rely heavily on natural gas, and the energy intensity of Armenia's gross domestic product (GDP) is higher than the global average. Natural gas represents up to 63 percent of Armenia's total energy supply, one of the world's largest shares, and all of it is imported, mostly from the Russian Federation, creating a high vulnerability to external shocks. The high share of natural gas puts Armenia below the global average in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, at 3.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per capita in 2019, driven by the energy sector (two third of emissions) followed by the agriculture sector.</p><p>Decarbonization provides energy security at zero or even negative costs, when considering the full economic costs of fossil fuels, and acts as an insurance against the uncertainty around future gas prices. Energy security risks provide a clear incentive for Armenia to develop domestic renewable resources. As gas has historically been imported at relatively low costs (the current price of $180 per 1,000 standard cubic meters is substantially below international gas price benchmarks), an increase in natural gas prices to meet international benchmarks would immediately make the low-carbon transition a no-regret decision. A scenario in which Armenia diversifies its gas imports and pays international gas prices would lead to a higher energy system cost than a decarbonization scenario in which Armenia transitions from a gas-powered to a solar-powered economy and reduces emissions to its target of 2.07 tCO2e per capita by 2050.</p><p>Decarbonization would also improve air quality and reverse severe land and forest degradation. Armenia's high reliance on natural gas and the high energy intensity of its GDP contribute to air pollution, with the annual costs of damage to health from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution reaching as much as 10.6 percent of GDP. Land degradation is also high, aggravated by high deforestation rates (70 percent of Armenia's forests are degraded), driven by mining and illegal logging, and by rural populations' high reliance on firewood for heating. Action to decarbonize the energy sector-particularly transport and heating-will have significant positive spillovers in terms of reducing air pollution. Together with actions to reduce emissions from deforestation and land degradation, decarbonizing the energy sector will reduce PM2.5 concentration by almost 8 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 2060, or about 25 percent of 2020 concentrations. This corresponds to a 75 percent reduction in mortality from air pollution attributed to fossil fuels and a 2 percent reduction in mortality due to windblown dust by 2060. Meanwhile, energy decarbonization, sequestration, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and other decarbonization efforts can help reduce deforestation and enrich landscapes, with spillovers including increasing the economic contribution and adaptation capacity of ecosystem services.</p><p>Armenia's pre-existing water stress underlines the urgency of investments in climate adaptation. The country is already water-stressed. In the Ararat Valley, groundwater abstraction for commercial fish farming and irrigation exceeds annual recharging. To satisfy demand for irrigation, authorized releases from Lake Sevan largely exceed historical natural outflow. The water supply system suffers from significant water losses in both irrigation (20-67 percent) and municipal water supplies, where losses represent 70 percent of supply, on average. Climate change will exacerbate these trends and reduce water availability for irrigation (with unmet water demand above 50 percent in some basins in 2050) and agriculture yields. A dry/hot future could lead to a 37 percent decline in yields for rainfed crops, 25 percent decline for irrigated crops, and 20 percent decline for cattle, goat, and sheep production around 2050. Climate change will also worsen land degradation, resulting in $363 million in foregone agricultural production, which is more than double the current impacts of degradation. It could also increase the intensity of floods, which already cost the country 0.8-2.3 percent of GDP annually in asset damages (figure S1a).</p><p>Investing in climate adaptation also brings benefits in terms of food security and avoided increases in poverty. Climate adaptation can eliminate future water deficits for the agriculture sector and increase both agriculture yields and food security by enabling a prompt response to climate or economic shocks. Increased resilience and productivity in the agriculture sector and food security are strong foundations for expanding the fast-growing domestic food processing industry, which is a significant contributor to job creation and export revenues. It can also help the country avoid a 2.7 percentage point increase in poverty in 2030 due to climate shocks, compared to a reference scenario with current gas prices (figure S1b). Land degradation hotspots and the highest climate change impacts on unmet water demand for irrigation are in provinces (marzes) with high poverty. Well-targeted adaptation policies can reverse these regional disparities and reduce poverty while increasing resilience. Similarly, policies can be targeted towards women, who tend to be more vulnerable to climate shocks due to lower access to land and dwelling ownership.</p><p>Smart climate action can have a positive effect on growth. Analysis based on a computable general equilibrium model shows that decarbonization can be achieved with minimal short-term impact on GDP and an acceleration of growth after 2040, while adaptation would have a positive impact on GDP (figure S2). Under the net zero scenario (NZS), the economy contracts in the short to mid-term due to high levels of investment, peaking at -3.6 percent in the 2040s, compared to the REF scenario, and at -1.7 percent when compared to a reference scenario with international gas prices (REF-IGP scenario). Growth accelerates after 2040, with GDP almost catching up with the REF scenario and 2 percent higher than the REF-IGP scenario in 2060. The benefits of reducing air pollution increase GDP by another 1 percent per year by 2060, while the benefits of adaptation increase it by at least another 0.5 percent per year between 2030 and 2060.</p><p>Climate action presents opportunities for Armenia for greener, more productive, and more sustainable growth, driven by a more innovative private sector. The country's long-term vision, set out in the Armenia Transformation Strategy 2050, is to shift to a knowledge-intensive, innovative, and green economic model, illustrated by the developing success of the information technology services sector, which accounted for $1.1 billion in exports in 2023. The environmental services sector can thrive on the backbone of a robust services sector driven by information and communications technology and provide a significant opportunity to increase the share of value added-for example, through the solar photovoltaic (PV) value chain. Investing in CSA and developing high-value horticulture and other agricultural value chains offers potential to increase export diversification while supporting rural economies and enhancing domestic food security. Achieving this vision is closely tied to the private sector's ability to adapt and innovate in response to the global sustainability shift, and a strategic regulatory environment for job-creating export sectors with growing potential, such as high-demand critical rare minerals, or textiles and apparel, where the country has a competitive advantage due to its lower GHG emissions compared to major producers. Increasing integration with European Union (EU), other regional, and global markets and institutions would support such opportunities.</p><p>Achieving these opportunities will require investments and a concerted package of policy actions. This includes investment and policy needs for mitigation (priority 1) and adaptation (priority 2), as well as enabling macrofiscal and institutional reforms that can facilitate the transition and support the financing of these investments (priority 3).</p><p>Policy priority 1 (mitigation): Achieve decarbonization objectives and energy security by strengthening the electricity grid to scale up solar energy, increasing energy efficiency in buildings, and electrifying heating and transport.</p><p>To achieve its 2050 emission target of 2.07 tCO2e per capita, Armenia needs to raise its near-term ambition and rapidly accelerate policy implementation. Its latest nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in 2021,1 set an economywide target of reducing GHG emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, while its Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy, adopted in December 2023, reaffirms the government's ambition to reduce per capita GHGs to 2.07 tCO2e by 2050. Modeling results for this report suggest that, in the absence of additional reforms, GHG emissions from Armenia's energy-related activities and industrial processes and product use would remain 62 percent lower than 1990 levels in 2030, well below the NDC target of 40 percent reduction (figure S3). But under the REF scenario, it would not achieve the long-term GHG emissions target for 2050, announced in its NDC. To reach this ambitious target, Armenia needs to set a 2030 target of reducing GHGs by at least 65 percent compared to 1990 levels, and substantially increase the ambition of its near-term climate mitigation policies (figure S3).</p><p>Armenia will need to invest $3 billion in the electricity sector to transition from a natural gas-based to a solar-powered economy. The energy system APS and NZS illustrate how the country can leverage its power sector to decarbonize the economy through electrification. Solar PV investments would lead the way, reaching 1 and 4 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and 2040, respectively under the APS, or 1.7 and 5.2 GW, respectively, under the NZS. To absorb these quantities of solar power, Armenia would need substantial parallel investments in international grid interconnections, domestic grid reinforcement, and energy storage. Battery storage solutions would be crucial in the near-term, reaching 1.8 GW by 2030 under the APS, or 3.1 GW under the NZS. Hydropower will play a modest role in decarbonizing the energy sector, as production capacity could only increase marginally, while electricity demand for heating and transport would increase rapidly under the NZS. Nuclear contributes about 11 percent of power generation by 2060, or 4.3 terawatt hours (TWh), down as a share from about 35 percent (2.6 TWh) today.</p><p>The transition entails risks of stranded assets in gas distribution and gas-fired power generation. Carbon pricing is likely to encourage customers to shift to electricity for heating and cooking. The low-pressure parts of the gas distribution network, which have seen substantial investment over the past decades, are therefore at risk of becoming stranded assets if Armenia cannot produce zero-carbon gases, such as hydrogen and renewable methane, that are cheap enough for the small consumers that make up the bulk of consumption. The government can closely monitor how demand for gas in the distribution network develops and, in parallel, invest in pilots for developing low-carbon gases to assess their economic viability. If the economics of gas consumption look likely to become unviable, the government can plan for a gradual, managed phase-out to mitigate fiscal contingent liabilities. The risk of stranded assets in thermal power generation could also be significant, but modeling in this Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) suggests that the value of dispatchable gas-fired generation is likely to increase substantially in the market, so gas power plants may retain or increase profitability, even with lower use.</p><p>Investing an additional $200 million to electrify road transport and expand public transport could substantially reduce transport sector emissions and urban air pollution. Decarbonizing transport in Armenia is a challenge, given that much of its road transport is fueled by natural gas imported at prices below international benchmarks. Transitioning away from fossil fuels and maximizing the potential of transport technologies required to achieve net zero would require more systematic and comprehensive transport sector planning, effective motorization management, and the expansion of charging infrastructure. Stricter emission standards for new and secondhand vehicle imports, regulatory requirements targeting the early electrification of company fleets and other high-use vehicles, and public financial support and regulations on electric vehicle charging infrastructure deployment would promote the adoption of electric and other low-emission vehicles, reducing overall energy demand thanks to the higher efficiency of these vehicles. Promoting a modal shift away from individual motorized transport, investing in a gradual rise of urban public transport and active mobility, and improving rail and logistics performance would help facilitate a sustainable and cost-efficient transition that addresses other transport-related externalities beyond emissions.</p><p>Investing an incremental $2.8 billion to scale up energy efficiency and electrification programs in the industry, building, and digital sectors could significantly reduce energy demand by 2040. Armenia has major unexploited energy efficiency potential, particularly in the building sector, which could pay for itself, reducing the overall cost of the energy transition to the economy. Strategic initiatives and reforms, including a governmental action plan on energy saving and renewable energy (RE), are already underway. But the residential energy efficiency and sustainable heating markets have been historically difficult to develop at scale, with limited financial resources available and low awareness of these. As a priority, developing and implementing a national program of energy efficiency in buildings would provide a foundation for the subsequent rollout to other sectors. Modeling done for this report suggests that energy efficiency measures in the building sector-such as improved thermal insulation standards of new buildings and extensive renovation of existing buildings-could cut final energy demand for heating and cooling by 2 and 36 percent by 2030 and 2040, respectively.</p><p>Policy priority 2 (adaptation): Boost agriculture productivity, food security, and resilience through water efficiency and conservation, early warning systems in agriculture, and strengthening critical infrastructure.</p><p>Investing around $1 billion in water efficiency, storage, and water resource management would support sustainability and growth in the agriculture sector. With access to water potentially declining at critical periods when demand is high, it will be increasingly important to manage competing needs, including for irrigation, energy (hydropower, cooling of nuclear and thermal generation), and industry (mining). In this context, more efficient water resource use-alongside more storage and macro-level management and planning-is vital. While the need for water storage is clear, a new masterplan would need to determine the location, size, and timing of new reservoirs. An ambitious adaptation portfolio that includes 15 new reservoirs (to increase total storage capacity by 7 percent) and investments to modernize and rehabilitate irrigation systems and increase efficiently irrigated land by 66 percent compared to the REF scenario would cost $1 billion (about 0.2 percent of GDP per year) and bring $2.6-3 billion in direct benefits, depending on the climate change scenario (figure S4). At the macro level, these investments would increase GDP by 0.5-1 percent per year after 2030, reducing the negative impact of climate change on GDP by 30 percent under the most severe scenario and completely reversing the impacts under more moderate scenarios.</p><p>Policies and institutional reforms would strengthen water resource management and boost adaptation. The following priority actions will ensure sustainable resource management in a context of uncertainty about future climate change impacts and transboundary water availability:</p><p>- Allocating more resources to support hydrological, agrometeorological, climate, and meteorological monitoring using geographic information systems</p><p>- Providing incentives and trainings for farmers to use efficient irrigation systems</p><p>- Developing and implementing an adequate tariff methodology for water supply</p><p>- Undertaking a comprehensive re-evaluation of the volume of usable groundwater resources in the Ararat Artesian Basin, ensuring illegal water users (who mainly extract water for municipal and irrigation purposes) obtain water use permits, and revising water use permits based on the updated assessment of the volume of usable groundwater resources.</p><p>Investing $190 million to support a broad roll-out of CSA and early warning systems can play a key role in supporting strengthened climate adaptation while boosting economic growth, food security, and livelihoods for rural populations. Relatively few of Armenia's 300,000 farmers have awareness of CSA technologies and practices, despite substantial public funding (mostly subsidies) in the agricultural sector. Promoting innovation in climate-resilient crop production, energy and water-saving technologies, waste management, circularity, and regenerative agriculture will allow the country to respond to climate threats. Establishing a food security monitoring and early warning system and facilitating sustainable market linkages in the agrifood value chains through programs that support farmer integration and modernization, the widescale adoption of food quality and food safety standards, and value chain logistics will also help.</p><p>Targeted investments in the range of $790 million to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure, emergency service facilities, and land restoration could also bring significant positive economic and social returns. This can go a long way in reducing flood damages and losses. For example, this report estimates that investing $41 million in strengthening the resilience of schools and hospitals to severe flood risks can avoid losses to the budget worth two to four times the initial investment cost,2 while investing $119 million to increase flood resilience on 13.6 km of primary roads, 3.8 km of secondary roads, and 75.8 km of tertiary roads would bring benefits worth up to 2.5 times the cost.3 Investing $45 million would allow the country to rehabilitate, strengthen and/or rebuild 40 critical emergency response facilities (approximately 63 percent of available facilities) that are exposed to floods, earthquakes, and other major disasters. Finally, a land restoration portfolio investing $610 million across 5 percent of the country's total area would bring benefits four times higher by increasing crop production and reducing cultivation costs.</p><p>Policy priority 3 (enabling reforms and institutions): Accelerate growth through fiscal and institutional reforms to support private sector transitions and protect the most vulnerable through social protection.</p><p>A resilient low-carbon transition will require $8 billion in additional adaptation and mitigation investments compared to the REF scenario by 2060, representing 2.5 percent of GDP per year, on average. This includes $2.4 billion by 2035 (1.8 percent of GDP per year) and 5.5 billion between 2035 and 2060 (2.6 percent of GDP per year). Many of these investments are to decarbonize the economy, particularly in the electricity and transport sectors (table S1). Although most can be privately funded, public investments will be required in the transport and water sectors, and to some extent, the residential and agriculture sectors.</p><p>Building on the country's strong track record of attracting private capital in the energy sector, Armenia could prioritize reforms to mobilize private capital for climate mitigation. Between 2007 and 2019, the World Bank estimates that 30 percent of all energy investments in Armenia (about $750 million) was public or publicly guaranteed (0.5 percent of GDP per year on average), while 70 percent (about $1,750 million) was private capital. For certain subsectors-such as onshore wind, solar PV, and hydro-the policy gap is small and may only require certain de-risking interventions, such as off-take guarantees, to mobilize private investments. In others, such as public transport and residential energy efficiency, policy support may have to include structural sector reforms to improve the level of commercialization, as well as financial support to close the residual viability gap. In a third category of subsectors, which includes energy storage, public support for demonstration and scale-up could help create the conditions for scalable private investment. Overall, when including private road transport and freight, discounted investment volumes in highly commercialized sectors add up to about $3.4 billion, or 48 percent of the total discounted investment needs until 2060 for mitigation.</p><p>Armenia's private sector also has a triple role to play in supporting adaptation by providing finance, adapting its own operations, and offering goods and services to help others adapt. This is particularly clear in the water sector. First, banks can collaborate with international financial institutions (IFIs) and the government to fund water efficiency, supported by international donors and blended finance. Investment mechanisms vary-and include private, public-private partnership (PPP), or public funding-depending on the purpose of the infrastructure. Second, the government can encourage companies to enhance their operations through time-bound, targeted subsidies or tax breaks. For large water users, this could include incentives to build reservoirs, upgrade water transport infrastructure to decrease water losses, and adopt efficient technologies; for small users, such as farmers, it could include incentives to implement drip irrigation or CSA. Finally, the widespread adoption of sustainable practices could foster a local market for related goods and services, with firms supplying farmers with locally produced and imported pipes, automated systems, and other equipment, as well as providing maintenance and training services. Armenia can use this opportunity to develop sectors such as PV-based irrigation and an Internet of Things for higher-efficiency and value-added agriculture.</p><p>A policy package that combines planning, fiscal policy, sectoral reforms and institutional reforms will be needed to incentivize the transition, mobilize the funds required for these investments, and ensure that vulnerable populations do not suffer from the transition.</p><p>Getting the prices right and protecting vulnerable households</p><p>Among other pricing instruments and environmental taxes, a carbon tax can play a pivotal role in supporting the achievement of climate commitments, incentivizing private investment, and generating revenues for public investment and to compensate vulnerable households. Introducing carbon pricing through a carbon tax is an effective way to spur the private investments needed to reach net zero emissions. Upstream carbon taxes can enable the taxation of the whole economy, including the informal sector, at low administrative cost, with few evasion opportunities due to physical infrastructure and emissions traces, reducing compliance costs and corruption opportunities. Recycling carbon tax revenues into targeted cash transfers can help offset losses and alleviate the impact of energy, transport, and other price increases on the poorest.</p><p>To afford the energy transition, lower-income households will need government support, especially for transport and heating services. In the simulations done for this report, using carbon tax revenues to compensate poor households could ensure low-carbon transition and energy prices have a minimal impact on poverty, increasing the poverty rate by 0.5 percentage points in 2030 compared to the REF scenario, and slightly reducing the poverty gap and inequality. More generally, to minimize poverty impacts and avoid negative impacts on vulnerable households, the government can accompany the transition with targeted social protection (SP) measures. Government support for building energy efficiency would also reduce the impact of decarbonization policies on the affordability of housing and business premises. Targeted government incentives could also promote electric mobility among lower-income groups.</p><p>Boosting private sector innovation and investments</p><p>Government reforms can help the private sector adapt and innovate in response to the global sustainability shift, which is key to a successful transition. Educating businesses on energy efficiency, promoting green audits, exploring the green market potential, and supporting labor mobility, up-skilling, education, and training will help ensure a workforce that is ready for the demands of the green economy. In the medium term, creating a supportive environment for innovative startups, investing in research and technology, and incentivizing green technology adoption are essential. Strengthening local supply chains, upgrading infrastructure to meet green standards, and expanding green financing will further Armenia's competitive edge in the green global economy.</p><p>Climate-focused PPPs can be used to leverage private investment in low-carbon and resilient infrastructure. Although PPPs allow for risk-sharing between public and private partners in critical sectors, without a strong institutional and legal framework, they can add fiscal risks and costs. And while Armenia has a legal PPP framework-based on a law adopted in 2019 and revised in 2021 (World Bank 2022c; CIVITTA 2022)-it needs a stronger institutional framework to mitigate fiscal risks and ensure effective risk-sharing. Armenia has PPPs in RE (Masrik-1 solar PV), water, and transport (South-Caucasian Railways and Armenia International Airports) but needs to increase institutional capacity, particularly in planning and project management to increase the predictability of project delivery (CIVITTA 2022).5 Emphasizing climate resilience in PPP parameters, terms, and conditions, and attracting green financing are also crucial. Armenia is enhancing its PPP framework to better manage liabilities and maintain fiscal sustainability. For projects with high economic but low financial viability, the government might consider hybrid PPP models, which include viability gap funding to ensure feasibility.</p><p>International debt financing will be needed to enable private investment at scale, and this has implications for project development and risk allocations. To date, financing for solar and hydropower projects has primarily come from international financiers (as sovereign or commercial financing), due to their ability to support larger-scale energy projects. This trend is expected to continue, with most financing for future projects likely to come from international banks and IFIs, in line with what is observed globally. But foreign direct investment in private external financing in general declined significantly in the decade to 2021, while access to domestic finance in Armenia is moderate and masks important disparities (World Bank forthcoming, a, 2024b; IMF 2023). Armenian banks are well positioned to provide at least a portion of the debt required for large projects at a cost-effective rate. But for projects to be bankable for this kind of debt financing, companies will need to adopt international best practices for project structuring, environmental and social risk management, and financial risk allocation.</p><p>Strengthening the institutional and policy environment</p><p>To deliver its climate commitments, Armenia needs to undertake a series of institutional and policy reforms. This includes adopting a national climate law;6 ensuring a strong center-of-government approach to coordinate across policy documents and state agencies; reforming public finance management to leverage the potential of public investments; and ensuring a whole-of-economy approach to climate resilience and green transition. A series of sectoral reforms will also help it deliver on adaptation and decarbonization (table S2).</p><p>Transitioning to a green economy requires consistency and coordination across sectors, with the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank playing a central role. Coordinated sectoral and macroeconomic policies and actions that are consistent with the magnitude of existing and expected challenges are vital for achieving development objectives with financing and implementation capacity. Promising interventions include investing in key clean energy technologies with consistent cost declines, undertaking climate budget tagging and climate-informed budgeting, adopting a green taxonomy and sustainable finance framework, introducing central bank policies to reduce the value of polluting collateral, and enhancing climate-related financial risk disclosure.</p><p>Integrating a sector-by-sector understanding of climate risk, adaptation plans, and investment needs into the budget process will help accelerate adaptation investments. This includes improving data collection and processing systems, expanding and upgrading hydrometeorological observation networks, and strengthening data collection institutions. While Armenia has made progress with climate risk policies and institutional arrangements, undertaking a rigorous sector risk analysis and developing a risk management strategy that includes prioritized investments would be useful. Integrating this with the budget process and medium-term expenditure framework would help ensure fiscal sustainability.</p><p>Table S2 summarizes priority actions to remove key bottlenecks that slow down Armenia's resilient, low-carbon transition.

Investing $190 million to support a broad roll-out of CSA and early warning systems can play a key role in supporting strengthened climate adaptation while boosting economic growth, food security, and livelihoods for rural populations. Relatively few of Armenia's 300,000 farmers have awareness of CSA technologies and practices, despite substantial public funding (mostly subsidies) in the agricultural sector. Promoting innovation in climate-resilient crop production, energy and water-saving technologies, waste management, circularity, and regenerative agriculture will allow the country to respond to climate threats. Establishing a food security monitoring and early warning system and facilitating sustainable market linkages in the agrifood value chains through programs that support farmer integration and modernization, the widescale adoption of food quality and food safety standards, and value chain logistics will also help. Targeted investments in the range of $790 million to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure, emergency service facilities, and land restoration could also bring significant positive economic and social returns. This can go a long way in reducing flood damages and losses. For example, this report estimates that investing $41 million in strengthening the resilience of schools and hospitals to severe flood risks can avoid losses to the budget worth two to four times the initial investment cost,2 while investing $119 million to increase flood resilience on 13. 6 km of primary roads, 3."]}, {"relevance_score": 32, "title": "World: The EU nature restoration law would improve our food security - full stop", "published": "2023-07-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nature restoration and food security are not opposites - in fact, they are interdependent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Globally, 26% of the total damage and losses from climate-related disasters affect the agricultural sector directly, according to a study by the World Resources Institute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is why, as companies whose bottom lines depend on nature, we are deeply concerned that the EU's Nature Restoration Law was rejected by the European Parliament's ENVI committee last month.</p><p>A significant step in the right direction</p><p>The European Commission's proposed nature Restoration Law would be a significant step in the right direction.</p><p>This law is a comprehensive strategy aiming to restore degraded ecosystems across the continent, with specific targets set for restoring habitats that are particularly suited for carbon capture and enhancing resilience to natural disasters.</p><p>For companies like Nestl\\xE9 and Danone, and the farmers who supply us, this legislation could mean a shift towards more sustainable practices that contribute to ecosystem restoration and climate change mitigation, thereby ensuring the sustainability and resilience of supply chains.</p><p>And the Nature Restoration Law gives us a critical opportunity for the entire food production sector to move in this direction, farmers and corporations alike.</p><p>Farmers and food and drinks producers are at the frontline of the climate and biodiversity crisis.</p><p>Milk production, for instance, is already feeling the severe impact of climate change: dairy cows have difficulties with extreme heat, and higher temperatures often lead to lower yields.</p><p>Climate events and heat also impact the grass and crops on which cows depend: in 2022, in Italy, water shortages and drought led to a drop of as much as 45% in corn and animal feed yields.</p><p>Dairy farmers in France faced similar challenges maintaining milk production as temperatures soared and pastures were scorched.</p><p>Europe is not impervious to food price hike shocks</p><p>Like all food companies, we are heavily reliant on nature and its well-being for the procurement of our agricultural raw materials.

So that they will continue to stay on the land to produce the great quality coffee that they do best.</p><p>Could you share the challenges and opportunities when Nestl\\xE9 applies the regenerative agriculture model - one of the solutions to help transform the food system in Vietnam?</p><p>One of the biggest challenges with asking farmers to maybe change their ideas, change the practices that they've heard from their grandfathers and their fathers, and to do something different to maybe use less fertiliser, maybe to use fewer pesticides, to take on different ways of making the soil health better. It is that you're asking them to take the leap of faith, you're asking them to trust you that really what you are telling them or encouraging them to do is going to be a benefit.</p><p>So one of the things that we do to try to do as much as possible is to create pilot farms so that we can show them how there is a benefit. And the other thing that we do is we train the trainers. So we get groups of 50 to 100 farmers and they elect the farmer leaders and then we train that leader so that they are helping us make sure that the messages make sense.</p><p>The other thing when I've been to the Central Highlands we have an army of economists who are the heroes really, we're helping to work with this. Often these agronomists are coming from the farming families themselves. So they really know that we work with farm workers to make all things make sense.</p><p>What are the potential and advantages of Vietnam's agricultural sector in transitioning to a sustainable food system and becoming a regional food innovation hub?</p><p>What this is really all about, is making sure farming is a good profession to join. You know that if you inherit your family farm, it makes sense for you and your family to stay on the land. So the more that we can help with improving the productivity of farms in a regenerative way, meaning a way that is good for the soil, good for the planet, then you're going to have a double benefit. You're going to have a benefit to that farmer, because you're going to have a more productive enterprise a more productive farm. But most importantly, these are efforts that are going to be good for the planet. We're facing a climate emergency. And it's really important that we play our role as the world's biggest food company, in helping agriculture to change and transform itself and become stronger so that we can make a difference and we can deal with the climate emergency.</p><p>What are Nestl\\xE9's expectations and the key message that the company wants to deliver to the side event?</p><p>Nestle is committed to being net zero by 2050, meaning that we want to reduce our carbon.

These past four years, the Administration has created a bold new playbook that has turned tackling the climate crisis into an enormous economic opportunity - both at home and abroad. After spearheading the most significant domestic climate and conservation action in history and leading global efforts to tackle the climate crisis, today President Biden is traveling to Manaus, Brazil, where he will meet with Indigenous and other leaders and become the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Amazon rainforest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President has leveraged our Nation's leadership on domestic climate and conservation action to help accelerate global efforts to combat and reverse deforestation and deploy nature-based solutions that reduce emissions, enhance biodiversity, and build resilience to a changing climate. As part of advancing this ambitious climate and conservation agenda, the Administration is investing in Amazon conservation efforts, sustainable land management, and wildfire prevention, while also strengthening our Nation's collaboration with Brazil, support for Indigenous communities, and efforts to combat illegal deforestation in the Amazon and around the world.</p><p>Today, as part of his historic trip to the Amazon, President Biden will announce that the United States has fulfilled his historic pledge to increase U.S. international climate finance to over $11 billion a year by 2024 - making the United States the largest bilateral provider of climate finance in the world. This represents a more than six-fold increase from the $1.5 billion in climate finance the U.S. provided in FY21, underscoring the success of President Biden's whole-of-government effort to scaling-up U.S. climate finance over the last four years. This also includes achieving for the second year in a row his pledge to scale-up U.S. adaptation finance six-fold to over $3 billion per year to help vulnerable countries around the world build resilience to the impacts of climate change, as part of implementing the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE). This also included achieving record-levels of climate investments through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and U.S. Export Import Bank (EXIM) - with DFC reaching $3.71 billion in FY24 and EXIM increasing its investments to a record $1.6 billion in FY24.</p><p>President Biden will also sign a U.S. proclamation designating November 17th as International Conservation Day. The proclamation recognizes that conservation is critical to protecting the livelihoods of the people who depend on our world's natural wonders, conserving our ecosystems and wildlife, ensuring our lands and waters can be enjoyed for generations to come, and helping avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p>Central to today's trip is President Biden's commitment to conserving our forests and combatting global deforestation. Over the past four years, the Administration has led efforts to conserve more than 45 million acres of lands and waters; safeguard mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands here at home; strengthen reforestation partnerships across the country to support local economies; combat global deforestation; and deploy nature-based solutions that reduce emissions, enhance biodiversity, and build resilience in the face of increasing climate threats. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new efforts to accelerate global action to conserve lands and waters, protect biodiversity, and tackle the climate crisis, including:</p><p>Announcing $50 Million for the Amazon Fund. The United States is announcing $50 million for the Amazon Fund, which will bring U.S. total contributions to the Amazon Fund to $100 million, subject to Congressional notification.</p><p>Launching the Brazil Restoration &amp; Bioeconomy Finance Coalition. The United States, BTG Pactual, and over 12 partners are announcing the launch of the Brazil Restoration and Bioeconomy Finance Coalition. This Coalition intends to mobilize at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and bioeconomy-related projects by 2030, supporting the conservation and restoration of at least 5.5 million hectares during this period, and contributing to 1.5 gigatons of emissions reductions and removals through 2050. At least $500 million is expected to be invested in projects that support Indigenous peoples and local communities in the Brazilian Amazon.</p><p>Announcing a New DFC Investment in the Largest Reforestation Projects in the Amazon. DFC is providing a $37.5 million loan to Mombak Gestora de Recursos Ltda., to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil, which will sequester carbon and enable biodiversity conservation. Mombak has designed an innovative and large-scale approach to generating high-quality Verified Emission Reduction (VER) credits by acquiring large tracts of degraded grassland in the Brazilian state of Par\\xE1 and surrounding regions, which it will plant with native tree species. This activity is expected to sequester approximately 5 million metric tons of CO2 over 50 years while preserving biodiversity in the Amazon region.</p><p>Announcing Support for the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. The United States today announced its support for President Lula's bold vision of creating the TFFF - a pathbreaking new $125 billion fund that reflects both the urgency and the scale of the challenge of conserving the world's most important forests. TFFF will attract substantial private capital and make a meaningful contribution to tropical forest conservation. The United States is announcing support to help finalize the necessary technical and analytical work needed to design and setup the Facility.</p><p>These announcements supplement additional efforts the United States is taking to support climate resilience and biodiversity in critical ecosystems like the Amazon and others around the world, including:</p><p>Scaling Finance to Restore and Conserve These Important Landscapes</p><p>Leveraging Demand for High-Integrity Forest Carbon Credits. The Lowering Emissions through Advancing Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, co-founded by the United States as a coalition of private sector and government buyers, recently announced a $180 million agreement on high-integrity forest carbon credits with the Brazilian state of Par\\xE1. Revenues from the transaction of credits generated at the scale of the entire state, at the pathbreaking price of $15/tonne of avoided emissions, will support the conservation of the Amazon Rainforest. The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon. Next steps include full consultations with stakeholders, program validation and verification of results under the ART-TREES standard. Agreements with additional Amazon region states are expected in the coming months, starting with Acre, with significant demand-side interest for high-integrity credits from Brazilian states.</p><p>New Cooperation Framework Agreement Between DFC and BNDES. Last month, DFC and Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ\\xF4mico e Social (BNDES), the Brazilian Development Bank, signed a cooperation framework agreement to enhance and deepen co-investment opportunities in Brazil in climate-related sectors. This new partnership hopes to expand support for conservation and restoration investments at scale in the Amazon's arch of reforestation and other important biodiversity-rich biomes.</p><p>Launching a Nature-Based Solutions Investment Lab. Instituto Itausa, BB Asset, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Instituto Clima e Sociedade are partnering with USAID to structure a nature-based solutions (NbS) Investment Lab with $2 million from USAID. The lab will foster an enabling environment to unlock private investment in NbS projects by creating interaction and collaboration among different sources of funds, sources of capital, and NbS stakeholders to create innovative financial instruments and transactions; identifying and designing appropriate business models, standardized projects and assessment of impacts of NbS projects in Brazil; and addressing regulatory challenges and advocate for policy enhancements.</p><p>Launching Alliances for the Amazon. This initiative will build on an existing partnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) that created a collective action platform to join private sector and civil society organizations to develop and identify innovative solutions for sustainable development and conservation of the Brazilian Amazon. In its prior phase with USAID support, the Partnership accelerated 123 biodiversity-supportive businesses, leveraged $7.5 million in private funding, and supported conservation of 39 million hectares. The new AFA partnership will expand USAID-CIAT's ground-breaking TerraBio scientific methodology for measuring biodiversity impact for Amazon-based impact investment projects.</p><p>USAID will Provide $2.6 Million to the Rainforest Wealth Project, led by IMAFLORA in collaboration with Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), which seeks to establish scalable economic models to conserve standing forests, meet legal requirements, enhance local community welfare, and achieve responsible market standards. The project aims to expand the Origens Brasil network to facilitate fair trade for community-produced goods, increasing corporate participation and commitment within the network.

Due to the rashes, she had to take steroids for years. Her unusual condition triggered an interest in macrobiotic foods and later organic food. Although she was careful with her diet, she still had rashes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2016, Pavida had to call an ambulance because she experienced vertigo and low blood pressure. Although test results for her lung and heart were normal, she believed that something was wrong. When someone recommended she take a food intolerance test, Pavida followed the advice.</p><p>As a result of the test, Pavida discovered she suffers from food intolerance which causes a physical reaction. These foods include normal items such as oranges, guavas, egg whites, kimchi, kombucha, ice cream, bread and pizza. The list of items she is intolerant of includes yeast, which makes her avoid seasoning in her diet. The doctor advised Pavida to replace manufactured seasoning with natural ingredients such as lemon, salt, and natural sugar instead of refined sugar.</p><p>The doctor told her that eating foods with a short shelf life helps people have a longer lifespan, while eating foods with a long shelf life leads to a shorter lifespan.</p><p>'Natural food cannot last long. The doctor told me that if I wanted to recover, I had to eat freshly cooked food.'</p><p>The food intolerance test results indicated that Pavida could drink organic coconut water, which happened to be her favourite beverage. She drank it often and established a connection with the owner of some organic coconut farms. During a visit to one of these farms, she was surprised to see a pile of leftover coconuts.</p><p>'Coconuts aged six months and one week sell well since the coconut is soft and the water is sweet. However, coconuts that are six months and two weeks old are too hard, so farmers keep only the coconut water and throw away the shells. I wanted to find a use for the leftover coconut, so I asked the doctor if I could make yoghurt with coconut to consume myself, and the doctor encouraged me to do so.'</p><p>After consulting her doctor and receiving a list of probiotic bacteria in the Bifidobacterium group, Pavida chose six strains listed in Announcement No.346 of the Ministry of Public Health. She made a homemade probiotic fermented coconut yoghurt called Bicogurt from the leftover coconuts, coconut water, coconut sugar and six chosen probiotic bacteria. The yoghurt is available in three formulas - Strong, which boosts the immune system; In The Mood, which improves the neurotransmitter and anti-inflammatory system; and Vegan Lemon Curd, which is a probiotic coconut dessert.</p><p>The story of Bicogurt and how to use leftover coconuts is displayed at Thailand Creative  and  Design Center (TCDC) as part of the 'Waste To Health Showcase', which was originally presented at Bangkok Design Week (BKKDW) in February. The first exhibition was a bit different from the current showcase as it offered samples of Bicogurt. Pavida said many people became customers after BKKDW.</p><p>'My goal is to show visitors that there are many ways to manage food waste. You do not have to be a manufacturer to handle food waste. Any ordinary person can do this. There is an abundance of information about organic food sources. I decided to exhibit at 'Waste To Health Showcase' at TCDC because I believe that visitors who come to TCDC are my target customers. The details of making Bicogurt takes time to understand and visitors at TCDC can learn about it, making the exhibition useful for them,' explained Pavida.</p><p>In addition to promoting managing food waste, Pavida added information about regenerative agriculture. She explained that regenerative agriculture is important because many studies abroad have found that nutrition in today's rice is lower than in the past due to unhealthy soil. Therefore, it is necessary to regenerate the soil.</p><p>'Regenerative agriculture is related to the circular economy since farmers use leftover products like coconut husk to cover the top of the soil. This helps to retain moisture in the soil. Charcoal from coconut shells is mixed with soil to improve its quality, increase airflow and retain moisture. If the soil becomes fertile, fungi, bacteria, worms, Glomerida and other small creatures can live in the soil. These creatures help to improve the ecosystem. Regenerative agriculture takes time to establish, but once the system is in place, farmers will spend less than on chemical farming,' Pavida said.</p><p>Bicogurt does not only help Pavida improve her health and earn money, it also helps farmers to earn an income of over 50,000 baht a year from leftover coconuts. In the past, the farmers lost space of 200m\u00b2 each year as dumping grounds for leftover coconuts. After working with Pavida since June 2020, the farmers do not have to waste any space on the farm.</p><p>'Since there are no more leftover coconuts, we were able to cut 125kg of methane gas per year. Although farmers initially said 125kg is not much, we should help the environment as much as we can. Now, farmers understand the importance of reducing greenhouse gas,' said Pavida.</p><p>In order to use more leftover coconuts, Pavida has created additional products. She worked with a chef to create a plant-based dish, Calamari Never Dies, which uses thick coconut meat as a substitute for calamari. Pavida said the recipe will provide healthy fat and fibre with fewer calories and tastes similar to calamari. She also created recipes for organic sauces and organised a taste-testing event at TCDC Common last Sunday.</p><p>'I believe organic sauces are blue ocean products. I hope that the recipes will reach local communities. It is exciting to see sauces made from local ingredients so that consumers will have more choices,' she said.</p><p>After two years of Bicogurt, positive feedback makes Pavida proud. One of the most impressive cases was Ann, who suffered from bad breath for a decade. Ann was told that incomplete defecation caused toxins to accumulate in the intestines. Ann had consulted medical doctors and traditional Chinese and Thai doctors, but her bad breath could not be cured. After she took Bicogurt daily for three months, it helped her bad breath disappear.</p><p>Pavida said: 'I am proud to provide knowledge I gained from my sickness. I felt like paying it forward since I received information about the doctor and food intolerance test from someone else. I then created Bicogurt which became a business and solved the problem of leftover coconuts for farmers. I am happy to help people improve their bowel movements and people who have cancer can now enjoy vegan lemon curd as dessert since some of them were advised to not consume refined sugar.

Here's a closer look at some of the countries in the region that are currently standing out in terms of investment potential.</p><p>Indonesia, the largest economy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), is a standout for its significant economic size and growth trajectory. With a GDP that accounted for more than one-third of the ASEAN member nations' combined GDP in 2020, Indonesia's market is robust and diverse, offering opportunities in various sectors, from manufacturing to digital services.</p><p>Thailand, the second-largest ASEAN economy, has shown resilience and growth in several industries, including automotive, electronics, and agriculture. The country's strategic location and developed infrastructure make it an attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).</p><p>Malaysia has been a consistent performer in attracting FDI, thanks to its stable political environment, well-developed infrastructure, and skilled workforce. The country's focus on high-technology industries and a growing digital economy has made it a top choice for investors looking at Southeast Asia.</p><p>Singapore, though small in size, is a global financial hub with a highly developed and successful free-market economy. It has a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries.</p><p>Vietnam is another emerging star in the region, with its rapidly growing economy, ongoing reforms, and commitment to liberalizing its economy. The country has become a manufacturing hub for electronics and textiles, with FDI inflows hitting record highs.</p><p>The Philippines, with its large and young population, is also gaining attention as an investment destination, particularly in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector and remittances-driven domestic consumption.</p><p>Each of these countries offers distinct advantages and challenges, and the key to successful investment lies in understanding the local market dynamics, regulatory environments, and cultural nuances. Investors are advised to conduct comprehensive due diligence and consider partnering with local entities to navigate the complexities of the Southeast Asian market effectively.</p><p>For a more detailed analysis of the investment opportunities in these countries, accessing comprehensive market research reports and economic overviews can provide deeper insights and strategic guidance.</p><p>Southeast Asia's High Growth Potential Sectors: A Comprehensive Overview<br/></p><p>Southeast Asia is a region of immense economic potential, with several sectors poised for significant growth. Drawing from recent market analyses and forecasts, here's an exploration of the sectors that are expected to drive the region's economy forward.</p><p>E-commerce stands out as one of the most explosive sectors in Southeast Asia. With a projected growth of 261% between 2016 and 2021, the digital marketplace is thriving, fueled by increasing internet penetration and a young, tech-savvy population. This sector's expansion is supported by the rise of local giants as well as the entry of global players, making it a highly competitive and innovative space.</p><p>Digital financial services are also on the rise, as fintech companies are revolutionizing the way consumers access financial products. From mobile payments to digital banking, Southeast Asia is embracing these services, which cater to its large unbanked population and growing middle class.</p><p>The online travel sector is another area with high growth potential. As the region's middle class expands and disposable incomes rise, more people are traveling for leisure and business. This has spurred growth in online booking platforms and travel-related services, catering to a more connected and mobile population.</p><p>Digital entertainment, including streaming services and online gaming, is rapidly gaining traction. With one of the world's youngest populations, Southeast Asia is a prime market for digital content providers. The region's consumers are increasingly turning to digital platforms for entertainment, making it a promising sector for investment.</p><p>Agriculture technology (agritech) and biotechnology are sectors where innovation is ripe, with startups and established companies alike exploring ways to increase efficiency and productivity in the region's vital agricultural sector.</p><p>Cybersecurity is another critical sector, as the digital transformation of economies heightens the need for robust security solutions. Southeast Asia, with its growing digital infrastructure, is becoming a significant market for cybersecurity products and services.</p><p>Renewable energy and sustainable technologies are also key growth areas, as the region seeks to balance economic development with environmental sustainability. Investments in green technologies, such as solar and wind power, are expected to increase, driven by government incentives and a global shift towards cleaner energy sources.</p><p>Accessing Investment Opportunities in Southeast Asia's Renewable Energy Sector</p><p>Southeast Asia is rapidly becoming a focal point for renewable energy investments, with a growing emphasis on sustainable development. For investors looking to enter this vibrant market, there are several pathways to consider.</p><p>Firstly, understanding the regional landscape is crucial. The ASEAN region is actively seeking to scale up investment in renewable power to meet sustainability goals. However, the development of renewable power is currently hindered by inadequate policy and investment frameworks. To overcome these challenges, decision-makers are prioritizing the attraction of lower-cost capital from international investors.</p><p>Investors can look into various opportunities such as renewable power projects, transmission infrastructure, biofuels, energy efficiency initiatives, hydrogen production, and electromobility. These sectors are expected to require over USD 6 trillion in cumulative investments by 2050, offering substantial long-term prospects.</p><p>To access these opportunities, investors can engage in several strategies:</p><p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Many Southeast Asian governments encourage PPPs to facilitate infrastructure development, including renewable energy projects. Investors can collaborate with local governments to finance and manage these projects.<br/>Green Bonds and Funds: Green bonds are a growing trend in the region, providing a way to invest in environmentally friendly projects. Additionally, several green funds are dedicated to renewable energy investments in Southeast Asia.<br/>Direct Investment: Investors can directly fund renewable energy startups or established companies looking to expand their operations. This can be done through equity investments or venture capital funding.<br/>International and Regional Development Banks: Organizations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) support renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia. Investors can participate in these projects through co-financing opportunities or by engaging in programs designed to facilitate private investment.<br/>Market Research and Networking: Staying informed through market research reports and engaging with industry networks can provide insights into emerging opportunities and connect investors with potential projects.<br/>Government Incentives: Many Southeast Asian countries offer incentives for renewable energy investments, such as tax breaks, feed-in tariffs, and grants. Investors should explore these incentives to enhance the viability of their investments.</p><p>Southeast Asia presents a diverse array of investment opportunities across various high-growth sectors. From digital marketplaces to sustainable technologies, the region is at the forefront of economic innovation. Investors looking to capitalize on these trends will find a dynamic environment ripe for strategic investments. For those interested in exploring these sectors further, detailed market research and analysis can provide deeper insights and help identify specific opportunities within each country.</p><p>It's important for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and consider the political, economic, and regulatory environments of each country. Partnering with local entities and consulting with legal and financial experts can also help navigate the complexities of the Southeast Asian renewable energy sector.</p><p>About the author  <br/>About the author<br/><br/>Related Posts<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thailand-business-news.com/author/ntrang\"/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thailand-business-news.com/author/ntrang\">Nguyen Trang</url></p><p>Nguyen Trang is a journalist based in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Campbell at the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence Ceremony", "published": "2024-10-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">MS MORGENTHAU: Good afternoon, everybody. This is a day that we have been waiting for a long time. Welcome to the 25th Annual Ceremony for the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today, both in person in the historic Benjamin Franklin Reception Room and virtually on our livestream from around the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Award for Corporate Excellence has reached a milestone: 25 years of honoring U.S. companies that create positive impact around the globe. I'm honored to be here with you to recognize six American companies, large and small, for their meaningful contributions to the categories of Innovation to Strengthen Communities, Women's Economic Security, and Climate Resilience. To our six winning companies, I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude and respect. I think everyone would agree that you exemplify the very best of American values in your overseas operations. (Applause.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the world we are facing complex challenges that governments cannot tackle alone, such as climate change, gender inequality, and digital divides. Now more than ever it is critical that we leverage the strength, determination, and innovation of the U.S. business community to reach our shared goals. Your work inspires us all and proves that through public-private partnership and responsible business practices, no task is too daunting.</p><p>And with that, it is my true honor and pleasure to begin the ceremony by welcoming Acting Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs Amy Holman. (Applause.)</p><p>MS HOLMAN: Thank you very much, Sarah, and thank you all for coming today, and congratulations to awardees. It's so much fun to be here today, to be welcoming you all. This is the best day in EB's calendar, and so we're delighted to have you all here to share in the success of our six American companies who exemplify what we try in the Bureau of Business and Economic Affairs to do every day, is to support our U.S. businesses overseas to do good things and to make us all proud here at home.</p><p>So I'm really, really delighted that we're here celebrating our prosperity, part of our work in the bureau. It's also my great delight to welcome our Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell. Kurt is amazing. He's worked all over the government. He's done DOD, he's done the White House, he's been here twice before, and now he's the deputy secretary. And we're so thrilled to have him with all of his experience and all of his great thinking on China. So it's my great pleasure to - and please join me in welcoming the 22nd Deputy Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kurt Campbell. (Applause.)</p><p>DEPUTY SECRETARY CAMPBELL: So, guys, this is such - first, to welcome everyone, it's great to see friends, family, everyone. Welcome to the Ben Franklin Room. This is the nicest place at the State Department. We don't all live like this, but we occasionally get to come up here for events. So as you're here, be sure to look out over the venue. It's a lovely day. These days come infrequently in Washington, so enjoy this.</p><p>So this is a true story. A couple of weeks ago - so one of the great things about being the deputy is that you get to step in at the last minute, and so I was meeting this family, and they had told their children how exciting it was they were going to meet the Secretary of State. And so it was the deputy instead, and so one of the daughters was crying hysterically. (Laughter.) So no crying among any of the companies today.</p><p>No, I will tell you those who've not met these companies - and we're going to be introduced to them in a moment - I will tell you they are so inspirational. To see the good that they have done globally in so many different arenas is just really heartwarming.</p><p>I will also say it's exciting for me. I was actually here 25 years ago when the secretary then, Albright, launched these awards. I don't think we would have ever imagined 25 years later the number of companies that we've honored, the work that has been done, the remarkable support that these awards have achieved. So I just - I want to say how grateful we are that you're all here. I'm sorry that it's not the Secretary. I'll do my best. It's not my favorite thing either, like, to just constantly go around disappointing people, but still. (Laughter.) Welcome most warmly to the State Department, okay?</p><p>So I want to thank Acting Secretary Holman - I just say Secretary Holman when - all this acting stuff. I'm grateful to you, as well as Under Secretary Fernandez, who leads the bureau. Special Representative Morgenthau - thank you, Sarah, for everything - and the entire team at the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. And they drive so much of our outreach to the business community. Their dedication to boosting economic opportunities for U.S. companies overseas, promoting workers' rights around the world, and creating jobs back home is what we are all about.</p><p>To our guests - we have guests from Congress and across the federal government, the diplomatic corps, and the private sector - thank you for joining us today and to render honors to these people who have served with such distinction.</p><p>In 1999, Secretary Madeleine Albright established the State Department's Award for Corporate Excellence. It was a recognition that the private sector is probably the essential partner in so much of our diplomatic work, and we see this now more than ever in technology, in all the arenas in which we work. It underscored that when businesses operate by the highest standards - investing in local communities, upholding labor and environmental rights - that's good not only for a company's bottom line but for our partners and for our values and interests.</p><p>Over 25 years, ACE has highlighted more than 70 businesses that epitomize what Secretary Albright called then the genius and generosity of American free enterprise. As global challenges have evolved over the past quarter century, from the climate crisis to cyber threats, the need for robust public-private cooperation has grown exponentially, and the role of industry in addressing these critical issues, whether that's spurring the clean energy transition or training workers for the economy of the future - this has become increasingly important.</p><p>Today we honor our 2024 cohort, six extraordinary companies across three award categories, that are advancing sustainability, equity, and opportunity in the countries where they are operating. And I will say I've met all of them. They are remarkable. You can tell right off the bat that they are making a difference.</p><p>Our first award category is Innovation to Strengthen Communities. In West Africa, Koster Keunen, a 172-year-old Connecticut and Netherlands-based company, has trained nearly 30,000 beekeepers to harvest beeswax, a honey byproduct previously overlooked in the local economy that can be manufactured into products from lip balm to candles. I myself am a beekeeper, so I'm excited by this. I just normally get rid of the beeswax. Now I know what to do. Koster Keunen has also bolstered regional food security in concert with beekeeping practices that prioritize biodiversity and conservation, increased bee productions and pollinations rates, raised the agricultural yields of key crops like mangoes and cashews by as much as 30 percent.</p><p>In Colombia, Microsoft, in collaboration with local educational institutions, NGOs, and telecom companies, has extended high-speed internet to more than 600,000 people in remote parts of the country. You just have to understand what a difference that has made in people's lives. Microsoft has also equipped marginalized communities with digital literacy skills, lifting 10,000 people out of poverty and enabling an estimated 31,000 people to find jobs in the tech economy - again, an absolute remarkable achievement.</p><p>Our second category is Women's Economy Security. As outlined last year in the department's first-ever Strategy for Global Women's Economic Security, the United States considers the full and equal economic participation of women not only a moral imperative but a strategic one. Women's economic inclusion promotes stability, development, and harmony in communities. It's estimated that closing gender gaps in the workforce could add up to $28 trillion to global GDP over a decade. In this collective effort, we're fortunate to have committed private sector partners that we're going to recognize today.</p><p>In Ethiopia, California leather goods company Parker Clay has for a decade employed a majority-women workforce of local artisans, most of whom are survivors of human trafficking. That's incredible. In addition to a good job and good pay, Parker Clay has - also offers access to vital services such as on-site day care. This means that its employees can put food on the table and ensure that their children can attend school. And it means that they can become financially secure, able to breathe a bit easier, plan a bit farther, and sleep a bit more soundly.</p><p>In India, the Bank of America is working to realize gender parity across its ranks. The company has implemented inclusive recruitment strategies and female mentorship programs, initiatives that have brought their workforce to - from 24 to 35 percent over the past decade - that's remarkable - amid a nationwide decline in Indian women's economic participation. You've really stood out.</p><p>In recent years, Bank of America has also provided over 300,000 women and girls with the education, the health care, and the sanitation infrastructure necessary for entry to and success in the formal economy.</p><p>Our third and final category is Climate Resilience. Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the United States has quadrupled climate financing to the developing nations, helping more than half a billion people manage the destabilizing effects of climate change.</p><p>In the Philippines, Florida-based Rizome Bamboo produces a more sustainable alternative to traditional carbon-intensive materials like steel and wood. And it's promoting the construction of environmentally conscious bamboo-based homes globally. In partnership with USAID and local indigenous tribes, Rizome is also helping to plant 1,500-hectare reforestation program that would establish a bamboo industry in Mindanao, an arena in the Philippines that desperately needs jobs.</p><p>In Suriname, our final awardee, Colorado's Newmont Corporation, has introduced highest environmental standards into the country's goldmining sector. Newmont has significantly reduced the potential for mercury pollution, water contamination, and deforestation by training small-scale miners in more sustainable mining methods. The corporation also instituted an advisory council but with community leaders from the African-descent Pamaka tribe, who advised Newmont on how to best contribute to local development needs, from portable water systems to small business loans.</p><p>So you get a sense of what these companies are about. And I want all of you to join in giving a warm round of applause to all of our awardees. (Applause.)</p><p>And as I pass it back to Special Representative Morgenthau, I do want to just acknowledge it's good to be recognized for one day. But the truth is what you're doing is global on a yearly basis, and we recognize, acknowledge, and thank you for your work, and we hope that it long continues. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Well, I think you'll all have just seen and witnessed Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell, and he is hardly the B team. Those remarks and your leadership is exemplary. Having seen firsthand and been with him in the field, it is hard to keep up with him. But truly, his public service and commitment for so many years is exemplary, and we are very fortunate to have him at the department. (Applause.)</p><p>Deputy Secretary, I understand that you may have to depart a little bit early, so I just wanted to acknowledge and again thank you. As we celebrate the 25th anniversary, we reflect on the incredible journey and achievements of U.S. companies who have been awarded the ACE over the years. Your work around the world continues to inspire us all.</p><p>While we could elaborate extensively on the accomplishments of these companies, it is perhaps best to let their work speak for itself. At this time, please turn your attention to the screen for a brief montage that illustrates the truly inspiring stories of our awardees.</p><p>(A video is played.) (Applause.)</p><p>And now the moment that we've all been waiting for. We can begin with the presentations of the 2024 Awards for Corporate Excellence. The first category is Innovation to Strengthen Communities. We are proud to be recognizing two companies whose work has generated tangible positive impact in Colombia and Togo.</p><p>Microsoft in Colombia is this year's first winner, nominated by the U.S. Embassy Bogot\\xE1. Microsoft Colombia has harnessed their technological tools and digital capacity to strengthen communities by connecting them to the internet and to the world, helping refine their workers' skills and generating economic growth. We are delighted to have here today U.S. Charg\\xE9 d'Affaires to Colombia Francisco Palmieri - thank you for being here - who very kindly made a congratulatory video for Microsoft. Please turn your attention to the screen:</p><p>MR PALMIERI: (Via video) Secretary Blinken and distinguished guests, it is my distinct honor to congratulate Microsoft Colombia Incorporated for winning the Secretary's Award for Corporate Excellence in the category of Innovation to Strengthen Communities. This prestigious award is a testament to the remarkable impact that Microsoft has made in driving positive change in communities across Colombia.</p><p>Microsoft Colombia has partnered with NGOs, universities, small businesses, and national and local governments to expand internet connectivity, build digital skills, and foster economic inclusion for Colombia's most vulnerable and underserved communities. Their work helps promote peace, diminish Colombia's digital divide, and reduce economic and social inequalities.</p><p>Thank you, Microsoft, for your commitment to making Colombia and the world a better place. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Charg\\xE9 Palmieri, for being here with us today.</p><p>It is now my honor to present Microsoft Colombia Inc. with the 2024 Secretary of State Award for Innovation to Strengthen Communities. Please join me in welcoming the general manger of Microsoft Colombia, Daniel Verswyvel, to the stage to accept the award and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MR VERSWYVEL: Hello, all. Thank you, Assistant Secretary Holman and Special Representative Morgenthau. Members of the diplomatic services, honored guests, and colleagues, it's really an immense pride and a deep gratitude that I accept this prestigious Secretary of State Award for Corporate Excellence on behalf of Microsoft Colombia.</p><p>To be recognized for the impact we're making through our connectivity and skilling programs is a profound honor. This represents not only a milestone for our team, but a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and shared commitment to building a brighter future for all Colombians.</p><p>At Microsoft, we believe in a world where technology is a force of good, a tool that can transform lives, fuel economies, and reduce inequalities. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization to achieve more. And it is not only a vision, it is a responsibility as well. And we deeply feel this responsibility in Microsoft Colombia, where the need for connectivity and digital skills is a great pivot to unlocking the potential for so many.</p><p>The world we live in is increasingly defined by digital experiences. It shapes the way we work, we learn, we communicate, and live in society. But we know that for too many these opportunities remain a challenge. This is why we are relentless in our commitment to bridging the digital divide, and we recognize that access alone is not enough. It must be coupled with knowledge, with skills, and tools necessary for individuals to truly thrive and better their opportunities. Through initiatives like Airband we brough high-speed internet to some of the most remote and underserved communities in Colombia, giving people the chance to participate in the digital economy, to connect with their supply chains, establish their businesses, access government and healthcare services, and so much more.</p><p>Our skilling programs have gone hand in hand, equipping thousands with the capabilities they need to acquire the abilities to secure better jobs and create brighter futures for themselves, their families, and their communities. We have witnessed the power of this transformation. Communities once isolated are now connected. Individuals once without prospects are now building careers and future of their own design. This award is a reminder of what's possible and when we unite around common purpose. But it's also a challenge: a challenge to continue and to deepen our commitment to expand the impact and work.</p><p>As we stand here today, I want to emphasize that this honor belongs to every person and every organization that we have partnered with, every community that has embraced these opportunities and every organization that shares her vision for an inclusive and equitable future. We know no single organization and no single person has the power to make real widespread change, but together we are providing the technology that hopefully can be a catalyst for a long-lasting transformation.</p><p>Thank you for this remarkable recognition, and we - we're excited also of the road ahead and knowing that the best way to predict the future is really to create it together.</p><p>Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you for those remarks. We would now like to recognize our second winner in the category of Innovation to Strengthen Communities, Koster Keunen, for their work in Togo empowering local beekeepers and farmers and forging the path for millions of dollars to exports for an innovative product. We now have a congratulatory video from U.S. Charg\\xE9 d'affaires to Togo Ronald E. Hawkins:</p><p>MR HAWKINS: (Via video) Hello. My name is Ron Hawkins, and I'm the charg\\xE9 d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Lom\\xE9, Togo. It is my great pleasure to extend heartfelt congratulations to Koster Keunen for being honored with the Award for Corporate Excellence and Innovation to Strengthen Communities. To John, Silvan, and the whole team at Koster Keunen, you have empowered tens of thousands of beekeepers throughout West Africa. Thank you for demonstrating the best of American values in Togo. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Charg\\xE9 Hawkins. Please join me in welcoming the President of Koster Keunen, John Koster, to accept the 2024 Award for Innovation to Strengthen Communities and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MR KOSTER: Yeah, thank you, Acting Assistant Secretary Holman and Special Representative Morgenthau. It is an incredible honor to be here today in Washington, D.C. with my partners and my family accepting the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence. I want to thank the U.S. Ambassador to Togo Elizabeth Fitzsimmons and Deputy Chief Ronald Hawkins who we just saw and the Administrator for the Small Business Administration Isabel Guzman for the nomination and their support. We're deeply honored by this recognition from the U.S. Department of State, and we extend our sincere thanks to Secretary Blinken and the entire selection committee.</p><p>For over 170 years across five generations, Koster Keunen has been a global leader in manufacturing and refining natural waxes and ingredients. Our mission is to create sustainable and innovative solutions that benefit both people and planet, and today we stand before you as a testament to the power of business to drive positive change in the world. Our journey in West Africa began in 2019 where we saw an opportunity in beeswax, a by-product of honey production that was often overlooked and undervalued. Local beekeepers, despite their work and dedication, struggled to access modern techniques and export markets for the wax, limiting their income and potential.</p><p>We thought we could make a difference. We launched our sustainability program that we like to call One Hive. It's an initiative designed to empower beekeepers and transform the beeswax industry in West Africa. Through training, education, and the provision of modern beekeeping equipment like Kenyan Top Bar hives and proper bee suits, we equipped beekeepers with the tools and the training they needed to succeed. We introduced sustainable beekeeping practices, ensuring the long-term health of bee populations and their vital role in our ecosystem, as well as sustainable and reoccurring income for the beekeepers and their villages and communities.</p><p>And through a new program we initiated using blockchain technology, this allowed us to trace the beeswax from the hive to the final product, guaranteeing transparency and traceability. By eliminating intermediates and connecting beekeepers directly to global markets, we ensure that beekeepers receive a fair price for their labor, empowering them to reinvest in their families and communities.</p><p>The impact has been profound. Over 28,000 beekeepers across eight West African countries have seen their incomes rise and their livelihoods improve. Communities have been strengthened and families have been empowered, and the environment has benefited with forest preserves and biodiversity protected. This award is a tribute to the incredible people of West Africa whose reliance, resilience, and determination inspire us every day. It's also a testament to the power of collaboration. We're grateful to our partners on the ground, the U.S. Government for its support, and to our customers around the world who share our commitment to sustainability and community development.</p><p>At Koster Keunen, we believe that business can be a force for good. We are proud to be a part of a global movement as working to create a more just and sustainable world. This award strengthens our resolve to continue innovating, to continue empowering and strengthening communities, and to continue making a positive impact in our world.</p><p>Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: We now move to our next award category, Women's Economic Security. Women's Economic Security is a category that not only reflects our shared commitment to creating an inclusive economy but also demonstrates the immense power that women can have on their communities. Empowering women economically benefits all communities and helps us move towards a more just and equitable world. I say that when women win, we all win.</p><p>And I did want to recognize again that this was the 25th anniversary of the ACE Awards which was started by Secretary Madeleine Albright, and we are very honored to have her daughter here with us, Alice Albright, who has been carrying on in her mother's tradition of service and heads up the Millennial Challenge Corporation which the State Department works with closely.</p><p>The first company that we recognize in this category is Bank of America in India. Their commitment to ensuring women are part of the workforce and are given the same skills and opportunities as others is a priority of the bank's country head, Kaku Nakhate. Please join me in watching a brief congratulatory video from U.S. Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti:</p><p>AMBASSADOR GARCETTI: (Via video) Greetings from New Delhi. I'm Eric Garcetti, United States Ambassador to India. And on behalf of the U.S. mission here in India, I want to congratulate Bank of America in India for earning the Secretary's Award for Corporate Excellence in Women's Economic Security.</p><p>Bank of America in India through its president and India country director Kaku Nakhate, together with all of its employees, is leading the promotion of women as employees and entrepreneurs. As Kaku herself often says, Gender parity in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, but it also makes businesses more profitable and impactful.</p><p>Through its corporate social responsibility programs, Bank of America in India is also improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and girls throughout this great country. With companies like Bank of America in India and great leaders like Kaku and her team, India is striving to increase the percentage of women in its workforce, working towards its true potential as a global economic power befitting the world's largest democracy.</p><p>Congratulations and thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Ambassador Garcetti. I'd also like to thank our consul general in Mumbai, Michael Hankey, for being here with us today. And it is my privilege to invite president and country head of Bank of America in India, who can just be known as Kaku. So thank you so much for being here.</p><p>MS NAKHATE: Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>Good afternoon. Assistant Secretary Amy Holman, Special Representative Sarah Morgenthau, of course all the distinguished guests here, and my dear friends - it's my great honor to receive this prestigious ACE Award on behalf of Bank of America India, which is currently celebrating 60 years in India. I would like to thank all the secretaries right from State - Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, U.S. Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti, and of course my dear friend, Consul General Mike Hankey - for recognizing our work in India.</p><p>I'd like to thank Brian Moynihan, our CEO, the - and the entire global leadership for their constant support. Brian has always advocated responsible growth at Bank of America. Acting responsibly is one of our core values and guides how we invest in our communities and help them thrive. For Bank of America. India is a priority market. It's the second largest contributor to our APAC earnings, with over 15 percent share in revenues and more than 23 percent share in profit. This award really belongs to all my teammates across in India.</p><p>Over the last decade, we have deployed roughly 2 percent of our profits in India, amounting to $70 million, working with 30 partners supporting education and skills development, jobs and livelihood creation, environmental sustainability, water and sanitation, and arts and culture. Over the years we have transformed the lives of about 6 million individuals, including women and girls, which gives us great satisfaction. The important role that women can play in the world's GDP development is today recognized wholeheartedly, and you would all agree with me on that.</p><p>Today, nearly half of the workforce in the world is women, while India, only 37 are in the workforce. Unfortunately, they only contribute 18 percent of India's GDP, despite accounting for 48 percent of the overall population. The World Bank estimates that the loss due to gender inequality in the world is around 172 trillion, approximately 1.7 times the global GDP. So in India, if women's contribution to GDP just increased from 18 to 25 percent by 2030, we would add 1.5 trillion to take our economy to 6.5 trillion, a significant 30 percent gain.</p><p>Hence, we decided to apply a gender lens to program models centered around empowering women who we believe will create transgenerational impact in the society. We also focus on adolescent girls, because India accounts for 10 percent of the adolescent population in the world. Lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure has adversely impacted the cohort of girls for years. Our support to partners like Gramalaya, Shelter, MHT, and Vatsalya ensured a toilet in a girl's home, thus enhancing her esteem within the family. In the same cluster, schools were provided with toilets. The idea was the basic need and retaining girls in school. To date, our partners have built 19,000 toilets.</p><p>Our program with Quest Alliance provides STEM and life skills to adolescent students. With UWA, we created smart classrooms and government-run schools, enabling blended learning, using tablets, enhancing STEM learning. We plan to introduce coding in classrooms very soon. Our vocational training programs with partners like Generation and Enable India, who work with individuals with disabilities, help deliver skills to enable employment in sectors like health care services, retail, and technology.</p><p>We support even rural programs with PRADAN and development alternatives that create local income generation opportunities for women, often on the back of community-owned renewables and energy micro-grids and irrigation systems. As a result, 50,000 women farmers and entrepreneurs have seen their income rise significantly, by 70 percent, over a two-year period. The intersectionality of our philanthropic programs hits multiple Sustainable Development Goals, providing access to clean energy, water, sanitation, elevating poverty, and improving, of course, the gender equality.</p><p>We work closely with CSMVS and MAP museum to help conserve India's rich cultural heritage. We supported AmCham in creating a DNI committee across American companies to focus on gender diversity, LGBTQ inclusion, and individuals with disabilities.</p><p>So on behalf of Bank of America, I once again would like to thank all of you and express our sincere appreciation to the State Department for this ACE Award. This will inspire us further to create more opportunities for women empowerment, which will help to make a difference in the society. And today, I learned genius and generosity is all that we need to work for.</p><p>So thank you once again for giving us this award. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Kaku, thank you. The next award in the Women's Economic Security category goes to Parker Clay, nominated by the U.S. embassy in Ethiopia. Parker Clay truly embodies the spirit of uplifting communities by helping women who were once victims of exploitation to become economically empowered individuals. We now have a congratulatory video from U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia Ervin Massinga:</p><p>AMBASSADOR MASSINGA: (Via video) Good day. As ambassador to Ethiopia, I am honored to congratulate Parker Clay for winning the Award for Corporate Excellence in Women's Economic Security. I'm proud to see their incredible work being celebrated. Parker Clay's commitment to ethical business and social impact in Ethiopia is transforming lives and empowering local communities. We nominated Parker Clay for creating sustainable jobs and fostering local craftsmanship, and because Parker Clay is not just building their brand - they're building a better future for Ethiopia. Parker Clay empowers Ethiopian women, helping them to harness traditional skills and local materials to create world-class products, while combating human trafficking. Parker Clay ensures its workers earn wages that support their families and provide them with the tools to uplift their communities on their own terms. Congratulations again to Brittany, Ian, and the entire Parker Clay team for this well-deserved award.</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: (Applause.) Thank you, Ambassador Massinga. And I am now proud to invite the cofounder and creative director of Parker Clay, Brittany Bentley, to the stage to accept the 2024 award for Women's Economic Security and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MS BENTLEY: Leading with heart doesn't just change the outcome; it redirects the course of our world. It's 2015 and I'm seven months pregnant sitting on a small gray sofa. My husband, Ian, and I are in California, living in a friend's one-bedroom apartment with our five kids. That's when I get the news our youngest daughter, Sayla, needs a brain surgery for a rare brain tumor.</p><p>My mind races back to just three years earlier. Ian and I sold everything, left California, and moved to Ethiopia on one-way tickets. Adopting two girls, brought us to Ethiopia, but once there, we saw that creating sustainable jobs for women, especially mothers, could strengthen entire communities. What began as a job training program quickly grew into something much bigger: empowering women through trade and launching a startup deeply rooted in the place that became our home.</p><p>Suddenly, our daughter was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, and it felt like that dream was slipping away. We knew we had to leave and move back to the west coast to get her the care she needed - back to sitting on that sofa and hearing the news. As a mom, I'm heartbroken, feeling helpless and desperate as I watched my youngest suffer. How do I carry the weight of that and continue building Parker Clay?</p><p>I thought about Marta back in Ethiopia. Struggling with her vision loss, she joined Parker Clay and found not just a job but recognition and care. After receiving her glasses through our team's support, her world - for the first time, she said, My world has transformed. I not only see, I feel seen. And Saleh and Bertukan met at Parker Clay, started a family, and are now thriving with the help of our day care program. Their child is nurtured nearby while they work and save for a better future.</p><p>And there are so many more lives in Ethiopia that we can directly impact, yet at the same time, my family in California is counting on me too. I feel so conflicted, but every time I think of the strength and resilience of the mothers there, I'm reminded that I'm far more capable than I was taught.</p><p>It's at that moment that Ian and I make one of the most important decisions of our lives: to go all in on our business, not just as our own venture but for the lives of the women whose stories were too often left untold. We chose purpose over comfort because the impact we were striving for was far greater than our fears.</p><p>Now, over a decade later, I stand before you with deep pride. Two of our daughters are here today, the one I was pregnant with - (applause) - and Sayla, who is thriving after three brain surgeries, reminding us that the hardest moments also defined us. (Applause.) That commitment to build a business with heart, driven by impact, was the best decision we ever made. We put people first, and that choice didn't just change lives, it changed the way we see the world. Imagine what we could all achieve if we led businesses with heart and built them with purpose.</p><p>Today, our team of 200 artisans - 80 percent women - shows that compassion and business go hand in hand. As Ethiopia's largest exporter of finished leather goods and a top-ranking B Corp, Parker Clay sets the standard for quality and impact in ethical manufacturing. Now we're extending this excellence to other global brands and redefining success, not just by profits but by lives transformed, like Marta's, Saleh's, and Bertukan's.</p><p>Through this journey I've learned that success isn't just measured in profits or growth - though, of course, those matter - but also in the lives we impact along the way. For me, this started with my own family and extends across oceans to Ethiopia. Parker Clay isn't just a business. It's proof that when we lead with heart, we change the world, one life at a time.</p><p>And speaking of leadership, I want to thank Secretary Blinken for this honor and recognition; U.S. Ambassador of Ethiopia Mr. Massinga; Minister of Industry Atu Melaku; Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed; and, of course, our entire community, who have joined forces in creating this impact together. Your faith in us is a continued inspiration. I invite you to join us, because together we have the power to transform lives, one woman at a time. Thank you, or in Ethiopia, we say amesegnalehu. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: That was pretty amazing. I just need to take a quick pause. We are a little - very structured here at the State Department, but your mother is a badass. (Applause.)</p><p>We now move to the final category of this year's Secretary Award for Corporate Excellence, Climate Resilience. Our first award in this category goes to Newmont Corporation, nominated by the U.S. embassy in Suriname. Their community collaboration and use of tools to eliminate mercury pollution sets the standard for responsible mining practices in Suriname. We are grateful to have U.S. Ambassador to Suriname Robert Faucher here with us today. The ambassador very kindly made a congratulatory video for Newmont Corporation, and I invite you to turn to the screen:</p><p>AMBASSADOR FAUCHER: (Via video) Good morning. It is my honor to congratulate Newmont Mining for winning one of this year's Awards for Corporate Excellence. Newmont has operated in Suriname for over a decade, and during that time has been an outstanding example of corporate responsibility and environmental stewardship. Newmont has shown that running a successful company and protecting the environment are mutually reinforcing. Newmont's work has enriched the lives of countless Surinamese, while ensuring future generations can enjoy Suriname's natural beauty and biodiversity. Thank you, Newmont, for your leadership and for your commitment to a greener and more prosperous future. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Ambassador Faucher, and this time, please join me in welcoming the senior director of external relations for Newmont Suriname, Shirley Sowma-Sumter, to accept the 2024 ACE Award for Climate Resilience and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MS SOWMA-SUMTER: Good afternoon, everyone. Acting Secretary - Assistant Secretary Amy Holman, Special Representative Sarah Morgenthau, the honorable Ambassador of Suriname to the U.S. Mr. Schalkwijk, and the honorable Ambassador of the U.S. to Suriname Mr. Faucher, distinguished guests, and all who are joining us today, it is with deep gratitude and appreciation that I accept this prestigious ACE Award on behalf of Newmont and our incredible team at Merian, Suriname.</p><p>Our workforce at the Merian, Suriname of nearly 1,400 teammates have come together to make an impact, and it's a privilege to be recognized for our efforts. Since we began operating in Suriname in 2016, we have lived following Newmont's purpose, which is to create value and to improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. And in alignment with our purpose, we have always recognized the critical needs of the local communities we operate in, particularly when it comes to infrastructure and economic opportunities, challenges that may have grown more urgent in the face of climate change.</p><p>Over the years, we have launched numerous initiatives aimed at reducing deforestation, rehabilitating the land, and improving water efficiency. But beyond environmental stewardship, our local programs have delivered tangible and life-changing benefits to these communities. We are deeply committed to enhancing the quality of life for our neighbors. Whether it's working hand in hand with small and artisanal small-scale miners to mitigate their environmental impact, or supporting and fostering new opportunities for local businesses within our value chain, we believe that sustainable growth starts with partnership and collaboration.</p><p>Newmont plays a significant role in supporting and advancing Suriname - Suriname's green development goals, and we will continue to increase our impact in this area in close collaboration with our stakeholders. This unwavering dedication to our purpose has remained constant over the years, driving socioeconomic development in the communities we are privileged to serve.</p><p>I'm grateful for everyone who has helped us along the way, from our dedicated employees and our partner, Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V., the state-owned oil company. And without their unwavering commitment, we would not be here today. I'm especially grateful to Ambassador Robert Faucher for nominating Newmont's work in Suriname. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>And on behalf of Newmont, a 103-year-old American company with 40,000 employees operating in nine countries, and the team of Newmont in Suriname, we look forward to continuing our partnership with the Government of Suriname and surrounding communities in pursuit of even greater achievements in the future.</p><p>For those of you tuned in on the webcast from Suriname, I cannot wait to bring this award back home and celebrate with all of you. Thank you once again for this incredible honor. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you very much. Last but not least, the final award in the category of Climate Resilience goes to Rizome, nominated by U.S. Embassy Manilla. Rizome's innovative projection of bamboo to provide a more sustainable alternative construction material exemplifies the American private sector's ingenuity and ability to adapt to the climate crisis. We are delighted to have U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson here with us today. The ambassador very kindly made a congratulatory video for Rizome. Please turn your attention:</p><p>AMBASSADOR CARLSON: (Via video) Congratulations to Rizome for winning the Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence for Climate Resilience. I recently visited Rizome's impressive facility in Mindanao, where they are combining American innovation and Filipino expertise to turn renewable and fast-growing giant bamboo, the miracle timber, into sustainable building materials that are as strong as steel and tough as concrete. Rizome's investment promotes green construction while contributing to the U.S.-Philippine economic relationship as partners in prosperity. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: Thank you, Ambassador Carlson. It's my honor to present Rizome with a 2024 ACE Award for Climate Resilience. Please join me in welcoming founder and chief product officer David Sands to accept this year's final award and offer remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>MR SANDS: Well, thank you, Acting Assistant Secretary Holman, Special Representative Morgenthau, and distinguished guests. It's an honor to be here representing our entire Rizome team. I especially want to thank Ambassador MaryKay Carlson, whose staff nominated us. Thank you as well, Ambassador Carlson, for visiting our operations in Mindanao.</p><p>Thank you to USAID Philippines and their staff, who helped fund one of our first reforestation programs. Thank you to One Tree Planted, who helped support that effort as well. And thank you to Climate Impact Partners, who is funding our current planting program of about 17,000 acres.</p><p>Thank you to our investors and our chairman, Fred Murrell, who believed in our vision. Thank you to the entire Rizome team now implementing that vision, especially our CEO Russell Smith, who has shared that vision with me for over a decade and tirelessly implements it. Thank you to our manufacturing teams headed by Chris Ua-o and Ruel Rivalde and our planting teams headed by Eileen Gamo.</p><p>I'm joined here today by our CFO Chara Panagopoulos, who has seen us through from the beginning; by our partner Cito Lorenzo, former secretary of agriculture for the Philippines, a tireless advocate for the well-being of the rural communities of the Philippines and for the health of the planet; and by my brother Bill and his wife Julie, who have really supported me through the decades in this adventure with bamboo. And again, to Fred, we basically grew up together, and he's a former chairman of two Fortune 500 companies and brings that expertise to the work we're doing.</p><p>My work with bamboo started in the 1990s with the creation of Bamboo Living, making homes out of structural bamboo as an alternative to wood to reduce deforestation. As the impact of climate change increased, we looked to bamboo as a solution. We founded Rizome as a climate solution. It seemed so obvious - noninvasive tropical timber bamboos are, after all, the fastest growing woody plants on the planet. If you look at the Guinness Book of Records, they say 35 inches a day. I haven't seen that yet, but we - at least a foot a day. And then they feed on carbon dioxide. The annual harvest stimulates further growth with bamboo plants, and the plants can live for a century or more.</p><p>But nobody was doing what, to me, was so obviously needed to be done. So we started Rizome to do the obvious. Where I grew up in Florida, I played in a bamboo plant that is well over 120 years old. It was growing at Chairman Fred's family home, and his mother played in that same clump as a child.</p><p>So what are we doing at Rizome? By reforesting land that was deforested decades ago, we are creating an engine for the rapid removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, 10 times faster than trees. We're creating an engine that can scale quickly to gigaton levels of impact. We're one of the top solutions, according to climate - the Carbon Removal XPRIZE, and they did not include avoided emissions, which is half of our impact.</p><p>We use only land that is not being used for agriculture to avoid impacting food security. With the help of Cito and others who are using regenerative agriculture techniques, we are doing that without the need for commercial fertilizers and pesticides.</p><p>The wonderful thing we are finding as we implement our strategy is the broad positive social and environmental impacts beyond climate. With our projects in Mindanao, we're addressing every one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in some way, including the former insurgents are now a supplier to us. Our planting partners are indigenous tribal members, and our planting program and our nursery are run by indigenous women. We're helping the tribes reforest their deforested lands of their ancestral domains and create multigenerational livelihoods for their communities by the annual harvest of the bamboo, and then long-term community-held assets in the bamboo plants.</p><p>Bamboo is actually a superfood, containing all the essential amino acids and is high in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It can be a tool for addressing global malnutrition and assuring food security. Our primary focus at Rizome is carbon, the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the long-term storage - excuse me, I get choked up - the long-term storage of that carbon to keep it getting - from getting back into the atmosphere. The bamboo building materials are making a really - real storage mechanism for the CO2 that's captured by the bamboo plants. The tropical bamboo, timber bamboos, they have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than steel and a greater compressive strength than concrete with a fraction of the weight.</p><p>Bamboo is an amazing structural material. We're working with Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, the architects for the Burj Khalifa, on the first high-rise that will incorporate structural bamboo. The IEA projected that the square footage of buildings on Earth will double in the next 40 years. Wood, steel, and concrete are responsible for 25 percent of human emissions currently. We need to build differently. Engineered timber bamboo offers an alternative - rapid renewability and long-term storage of carbon.</p><p>The IPCC says we need to - at least 10 gigatons of removal a year by 2050. And tropical bamboo, with the support of the State Department and others, can deliver that level of impact. Free enterprise - it's one of the great gifts of this wonderful country. We can save our climate and make money doing it. It's no longer business as usual. It's business as a climate solution and community upliftment. And that's everybody's business.</p><p>God bless the United States of America. God bless this beautiful planet and all of us who share it. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS MORGENTHAU: David, that was amazing. Thank you so much for your remarks. And I think it really says we can - to all of you businesses, the work that's being done, good business and doing business really do go hand in hand. But the work that's being done around the world really is amazing. I am really thrilled to join everybody in congratulating all of the 2024 Secretary of State's Awards for Corporate Excellence recipients. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>And finally, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose Fernandez. Under Secretary Fernandez stands at the center of the department's effort to support American businesses and American workers at home and abroad. Under his leadership, we have championed American companies around the world and made meaningful connections with the U.S. private sector to assist them in addressing critical global challenges, including in climate change, inequality, supply chain disruptions, food and energy security, mineral security, and other key areas.</p><p>As someone who has worked tirelessly supporting U.S. businesses and advancing U.S. commercial diplomacy, Under Secretary Fernandez has been involved in many ACE ceremonies, and it is now my great pleasure to welcome him to the podium to offer closing remarks. (Applause.)</p><p>UNDER SECRETARY FERNANDEZ: Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It's great to be here. Thank you - thank you Special Representative Morgenthau, thank you, Sarah. Amy, good to see you. Thank you all for the kind introduction, and thanks to all of you for being here today and for those of you who are watching on livestream.</p><p>I'd like to just first of all congratulate the six winners. After many years of seeing companies of all types receive this honor - this is our 25th year of having this award, and I'm really excited to be here for the 25th anniversary. But I do have a complaint. I have a complaint, which is at every - I've now done six of these. At each one of them, I tend to close the ceremonies. I am the grim reaper; I end the festivities.</p><p>This is a wonderful - a wonderful - moment for us at the State Department. It's a great opportunity for us to honor companies that have done well and have really highlighted and stuck by the principles that we all hold dear. So please join me to - for one last round of applause for the six winners. (Applause.)</p><p>The companies that we are honoring today showcase the best in American innovation and values. They demonstrate that businesses can flourish while being corporate role models. The shared values of protecting our planet, of helping our workers, of helping our local communities are at the forefront of the operations of all of these companies around the world.</p><p>You will have heard my colleague, Deputy Secretary Campbell, say that the global challenges that we all face cannot be solved by governments alone. This job makes you humble. But that's why the partnership between U.S. companies and the State Department is so crucial to advance our foreign policy. We know - we know that American companies are among the best and most innovative in the world, and we know that they are among the best equipped to contribute creative solutions.</p><p>The tools and the resources of the private sector, coupled with their commitment to doing well while serving the public good, is exactly - exactly - why American companies, I think, are the - this is an easy job in many ways, because American companies are the world's business partner of choice, and that's why we are honoring them today. We want - every year, we want to see more and more of them.</p><p>Here at the State Department, we work every day to promote a friendly environment for businesses operating abroad. When we work with the private sector, we learn how to combine our tools and try to outmaneuver the competition, and at the same time share our values in every corner of the globe. And whether it's protecting economic freedom for women in Ethiopia or keeping our planet safe in Suriname, American companies like the ones that we have recognized this afternoon have a track record of addressing critical issues and innovative solutions in local communities and keeping our principles at the forefront of all that they do.</p><p>This is why Sarah's office and why the Office of Commercial and Business Affairs and our government agency colleagues, many of whom I see in the audience, from ambassadors who've come all the way from the Philippines, from Suriname, and elsewhere, to honor their companies - that's why our government agency colleagues, that's where - at the State Department we work hard to connect U.S. businesses to foreign markets and to help highlight U.S. companies as the partners of choice.</p><p>Last March, a few months ago, I proudly joined other members of the administration in the rollout of something we're calling the second U.S. National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct. This is a set of government commitments to promote responsible business practices for our companies. We've also enhanced the U.S. National Contact Point for the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises to act as a contact point to receive comments and complaints about the conduct of our companies. So we've enhanced this National Contact Point to work with businesses, to work with NGOs, to work with labor unions to encourage responsible business conduct among U.S. companies operating overseas.</p><p>So the challenges that we face are complex. I'm confident that through innovative and principled solutions and our continued partnership, no challenge is impossible to overcome.</p><p>So to everyone here and to all those who are joining on our livestream, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to recognize the good work of these remarkable American companies. And so please join me one last time - one last time - in extending our sincere gratitude. (Applause.)</p><p>Thank you and congratulations. (Applause.)</p><p>Source: U.S. Department of State</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["So what are we doing at Rizome?

The Fit for 55 legislative package precisely defines the actions required to achieve the 2030 target.</p><p>The Commission vowed to mobilise 1 trillion over a ten-year period to help Europe transition and to ensure that no member state is left behind in the process. This money will be taken from the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan, the EU budget as well as grants from public and private investors.</p><p>But, according to Brussels, the EU will still need to invest 1.5 trillion per year between 2031 and 2050 if the bloc is to reach its ultimate goal. One milestone is for the member states to slash their emissions by 55 per cent of 1990 levels before 2030.</p><p>Who is making progress?</p><p>Preliminary calculations made by the Agora Energiewende think tank in early January suggest CO2 emissions across Germany have already dropped by 73 million metric tonnes, compared to 2022's figures - the lowest levels seen since the 1950s.</p><p>In addition, the think tank reported that renewable energy sources accounted for more than half of the country's energy production in 2022 while electricity production using black coal has also dropped to 8.9% from 12.8%.</p><p>Despite these wins in Germany, some industrial sectors and businesses, as well as the farming community, feel that complying with the EU's environmental regulations is too difficult in the wake of inflation and rising energy prices as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This has in turn fuelled climate-sceptic parties predominately on the right in their calls for a pause in environmental legislation who argue that the net-zero transition away from fossil fuels is too costly.</p><p>In the face of political headwinds, the EU has vowed to charge on towards its goal but, with the European elections on the horizon, it has become evident that public support is key for the future survival of the Green Deal.</p><p>\"When you want to build public support, start with the obvious win-win solutions\" advised Prime Minister Mitsotakis, \"and be very careful with agriculture, because agriculture on its own is a very, very complex topic. It's very difficult to decarbonise. And, we need to be very sensitive when it comes to reactions from our farmers.\"</p><p>Balancing transition against targets and energy security</p><p>Maksym Timchenko, the CEO of DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy investor, also weighed in: We are in a situation where we have to balance coal mining and coal power generation, playing a crucial role in national security, at the moment.</p><p>\"We have thousands of coal miners working in Ukraine, at the moment. On the other side, Ukraine is committed to following all standards and regulations coming from Europe. So, for us, it's extremely important that it's done in a fair way for the next ten years</p><p>According to Prime Minister Mitsotakis, the future of energy security is clear. \"In the short term, we want to be an energy provider for at least the Balkans, by building strong interconnections, pipelines, floating storage and regasification units in northern Greece, leverage our unique, geographic potential, possibly even, if necessary, export gas up to Ukraine because, if you actually look at the map, the distance is not that far,\" he said.</p><p>Part of our medium- to long-term plan is to really make a breakthrough when it comes to offshore wind.

Last year it had launched a music album, 'N\\xE2ng Niu Lm Thi\\xEAn Nhi\\xEAn \\xD5i,' by M Anh. This year is an important milestone in the NESCAF\\xC9 Plan programme as regenerative agriculture is the focus of its long-term plan for until 2030. Since 2011 the global programme has been implemented in Vietnam to bring sustainable values to coffee farmers and the community. It also demonstrates Nestl\\xE9's commitment to creating shared value for the coffee value chain. In the past 12 years the programme has had significant socio-economic and environmental impacts, including by replanting 63,000 hectares of ageing coffee trees, distributing over 63 million high-quality seedlings to farmers and helping reduce the use of water by 40-60 per cent and chemical fertilisers and pesticides by 20 per cent. It has organised more than 330,000 training sessions on sustainable coffee cultivation and helped more than 22,000 farmer households achieve the international 4C (Common Code for the Coffee Community) certification and farmers increase their income by 30-100 per cent. - VNS"]}, {"relevance_score": 27, "title": "World: World Food Forum: New technologies help manage soil and water in a climate-change context", "published": "2023-10-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Innovations to re-carbonize soils, improve soil health and enhance water use efficiency take centre stage at the Science and Innovation Forum</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experts and policymakers came together at the World Food Forum's Science and Innovation Forum on Thursday to highlight how new technologies for soil and water management can help to tackle and adapt to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) the event showcased field examples, strategies and management options in integrated soil and water management that have a direct impact on the livelihoods of small- and medium-holder farmers and their communities.</p><p>We need to develop and strengthen integrated information systems to address pressing multisectoral challenges, which should be available to all - especially to farmers who are the custodians of our natural resources, as well as their final controllers,'' FAO Director-General QU Dongyu told participants.

Agriculture is at the heart of human civilization. And so, as Agriculture Ministers, your task is not simply that of handling one sector of the economy. You shoulder a big responsibility for the future of humanity. Globally, agriculture provides livelihood for over two point five billion people. In the Global South, agriculture accounts for almost 30 percent of GDP, and over 60 percent of jobs. And today, this sector faces several challenges. The supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic have been worsened by the impact of geo-political tensions. Climate Change is causing extreme weather event more and more frequently. These challenges are felt most by the Global South.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Friends,</p><p>I want to share with you what India is doing in this most vital sector. Our policy is a fusion of</p><p>'back to basics' and 'march to future'. We are promoting Natural Farming as well as Technology-enabled Farming. Farmers all over India are taking up natural farming now. They are not using synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Their focus is on rejuvenating the mother earth, protecting soil health, producing 'per drop, more crop', and promoting organic fertilizers and pest management solutions. At the same time, our farmers are proactively using technology to boost productivity. They are generating and using solar power on their farms. They are using Soil Health Cards to optimize crop selection, and drones to spray nutrients and monitor their crops. I believe this ''fusion approach'' is the best way to address several issues in agriculture.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>As you know, the year 2023 is being celebrated as the International Year of Millets. You will find a reflection of this on your plates in Hyderabad, with many dishes based on millets, or Shri Anna, as we call it in India. These superfoods are not only healthy to consume, but they also help raise the incomes of our farmers by using less water, needing less fertilizer, and being more pest-resistant. Of course, Millets are not new. They have been cultivated for thousands of years. But markets and marketing had influenced our choices so much that we forgot the value of traditionally grown food crops. Let us embrace Shri Anna Millets as the food of our choice. As part of our own commitment, India is developing an Institute of Millets Research as a Centre of Excellence - for sharing best practices, research and technologies in millets.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>I urge you to deliberate on how to undertake collective action to achieve global food security. We must find ways to build sustainable and inclusive food systems, focussed on marginal farmers. We must find ways to strengthen global fertilizer supply chains. At the same time, adopt agricultural practices for better soil health, crop health and yield. Traditional practices from different parts of the world may inspire us to develop alternatives for regenerative agriculture. We need to empower our farmers with innovation and digital technology. We must also make solutions affordable for small and marginal farmers in the Global South. There is also an urgent need to reduce agricultural and food waste, and instead, invest in creating wealth from waste.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>India's G20 priorities in agriculture focus on healing our 'One Earth', creating harmony within our 'One Family' and giving hope for a bright 'One Future'.

He reveals delicate white threads in the black soil - mycelium mushrooms, evidence of healthy soil - and enthusiastically explains how they provide vital nutrients to the plant's roots in a symbiotic relationship. By eliminating tilling, he's encouraged these underground networks to develop. They act as organic fertilizers and safeguards against fungal pathogens, reducing the need for fertilizer and fungicide.</p><p>On the farm, diverse species of crops and other plants that attract beneficial insects are planted close together. Tomatoes and carrots grow alongside a variety of greens, and nearby blackberry bushes form a natural protective windbreak. Cereal rye, which is green all winter, covers the fields in the offseason. Shadden said this \"companion planting\" means the farm produces more harvests on a smaller area of land. Besides irrigation, its only input is natural compost produced on-site.</p><p>Food security and independence</p><p>The farm is the cornerstone of the Meskwaki Food Sovereignty Initiative, launched in 2012 to preserve traditional Meskwaki agricultural practices, reducing the 1,400-member community's dependence on outside food sources and government support.</p><p>Stephanie BadSoldier Snow, a Meskwaki farmer, helped found the initiative and believes conventional farmers could draw inspiration from Indigenous perspectives on agriculture. \"Our ecological practices traditionally were designed to preserve and to mitigate the overuse and depletion of resources,\" said Snow, adding the value of these methods is often overlooked.</p><p>Standard practice in Iowa's conventional agriculture involves repeatedly tilling the land before planting, applying fertilizers and other products that pollute waterways through runoff, and growing vast monocultures.</p><p>Outside the settlement, Iowan farmer Robb Ewoldt grows corn and soybeans near the Mississippi River. He believes the conventional agriculture system that dominates Iowa needs to change. \"Our weather patterns are changing. There's no denying it,\" he said. \"We're seeing differences in the amount of rainfall we get. The extremes seem to be more extreme.\" In response, he's implemented no-till methods and cover crops - which reduce damage to his soil and prevent erosion in the offseason -across his farm over the past 15 years.</p><p>Financing agricultural change</p><p>Convincing farmers to drastically alter their current lucrative practices to follow in his footsteps will be a struggle, he believes. \"It's going to be kind of tough,\" Ewoldt said. \"Farmers have a lot of money and ... when farmers have money, it's hard to get anybody to change.\"</p><p>But tougher times appear to be on the horizon. In 2018, the US Fourth National Climate Assessment predicted yields and crop quality from conventional agriculture will decline over the next several decades due to climate variability and increased heat in the Midwest. The assessment recommended investment in changing practices.</p><p>Ewoldt sits on the Iowa Soybean Association, which recently launched a Soil and Water Outcomes Fund with the backing of major corporations to pay farmers who \"produce positive environmental outcomes\" like carbon sequestration. So far, however, the incentives are small, as are the benefits offered by federal government cost share programs. Ewoldt said for many farmers those incentives may not outweigh the costs of retrofitting a planter to function in a no-till field, or buying cover crop seeds every year.</p><p>Linking climate change to agricultural finance and safety nets for farmers is also crucial, because many benefits are realized only in the medium to longer term. Increases in yields from improved soil health, for example, can take years to accrue.</p><p>Last summer, Meskwaki farmers endured monthslong severe droughts only to be doused with heavy rainfall that couldn't penetrate the dry soil. Seasonal fluctuation is also making it difficult to know when to plant crops. The farmers at Red Earth Gardens are planting more natural windbreaks to protect plants and continue to grow ancient heirloom varieties of corn, beans and squash well-adapted to the region.</p><p>Snow feels confident about the future of their approach to agriculture, particularly given her people's history of forced relocation.</p><p>\"To be pushed out of a land and livelihood that you fully understood and were comfortable with and had to continue to adapt, each time that we were moved, that's what resilience is,\" she said.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Among the vast monocrop fields in central Iowa, the Indigenous community practices regenerative agriculture.
