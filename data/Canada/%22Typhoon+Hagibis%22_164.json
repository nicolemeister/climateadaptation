It was blistering hot and humid.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:<br/>Medvedev is labouring right now.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Russian Daniil Medvedev, second in the world, was struggling. After two medical timeouts because of heat, he and the umpire had this exchange.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 1:<br/>Daniil, are you okay?<br/><br/>DANIIL MEDVEDEV (RUSSIAN PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER):<br/>I'm not ok\u2026 But what can I do? I'm a fighter, I will finish the match, but I can die. If I die, is ITF going to take responsibility?<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:<br/>Wow, Medvedev just saying that conditions, right? Terrible. Feels terrible.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER:<br/>Ah! Medical! Medical! Medical!<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>He wasn't the only athlete wilting.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 1:<br/>Hot humid weather plays havoc with a marathon.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The marathon and race walking had to be relocated out of Tokyo and still hot.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 2:<br/>It's much warmer than expected.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Spain's tennis star Paula Mendoza had to withdraw because of severe heat stroke. Holding another Olympics in Midsummer is tempting more scorching competitions, and Europe is warming faster than other continents. But it's not just Olympics, fires, floods, melting is forcing us to confront. How is climate change impacting sport, and can sport adapt?<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>We are seeing more heat waves now than we ever have before, 15 years\u2026<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>We asked Madeleine Orr, a sports ecologist at the University of Toronto. She recently wrote Warming Up: How Climate Change is Changing Sport.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>The problem becomes if you're not able to sweat, you're not able to cool down, your inner organs are going to start to get pretty warm as well and that's where we start to see major catastrophic incidents of heat stroke for example. So the big bad is heat.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The signs are everywhere.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 3:<br/>More than hot enough to cause serious harm to human health.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 4:<br/>Temperatures are now set to climb even higher.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 2:<br/>Now, July is on track to be the hottest month in recorded history.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Extreme weather is disrupting world competition. A super typhoon forced World Cup rugby to cancel games for the first time ever.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 5:<br/>Typhoon Hagibis is heading towards Japan. It's predicted to have very significant widespread impact.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Pakistan's historic flood swapped most soccer fields except one, mercifully on higher ground.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>It became the medical distribution site. It became where they serve food to the community because people know where the soccer field is, but it also was the place that was dry.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Wildfires last summer dispersed red smoke thousands of kilometres forcing pro sport to cancel games. Under the smoke, there was no community sport either.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>That's the challenge, is if you live near a wildfire you're probably not competing. It just shuts it down and, and those kids definitely are feeling it.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>In summer or winter, heat is a weapon. World Cup ski events in the Alps were cancelled nine times this year because of snowless slopes.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>We are seeing a 35-day drop on both sides of the Atlantic in the skiable days, roughly 300 athletes wrote a letter to Federation of skiing last year asking for more action on this.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The climate is becoming a ferocious opponent. Just ask the athletes. Olympians warned in June of health risks even with specialized heat training, releasing a major report, Rings of Fire.<br/><br/>JAMIE FARNDALE (BRITISH RUGBY SEVENS PLAYER):<br/>If we are competing in these hotter, hotter conditions and yeah it's definitely, definitely scary.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 3:<br/>You're going to have athletes who are barely alive and unable to perform at their best.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 6:<br/>Laurence Vincent Lapointe of Canada picking up the silver.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Laurence Vincent Lapointe, who won silver and bronze, knows all about too much heat.<br/><br/>LAURENCE VINCENT LAPOINTE (CANADIAN CANOEIST):<br/>This was exactly what never give up means.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Her victories in Tokyo even more precious after a heat related collapse, she told us she's never forgotten it.<br/><br/>LAURENCE VINCENT LAPOINTE (CANADIAN CANOEIST):<br/>I had an hour and a half to recover from my first, my first race of day on to my next race. Suddenly, like I said, I cannot move. I'm laying down in the shade because there's nothing to do. I'm just like feeling too, too sick to move. I had to jump into a nice bath. After that, they had to like lay me down in a AC room with electrolyte water and lots of protein bars and just like pressure sleeves on my legs, legs in the air and everything and everyone was, everyone was worried, me included.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The heat and humidity almost ended the dream she'd had since childhood.<br/><br/>LAURENCE VINCENT LAPOINTE (CANADIAN CANOEIST):<br/>So the problem is most people think of what it was like when they were young, right? When I was a kid, you know, you had to drink a bit, and you had to put your sunscreen and you were fine. But nowadays, if you don't drink like three times as much, and you don't do this and that like very, very specific things for cooling yourself in between races then you, you can drop.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Madeleine Orr is urging athletes to advocate for change using their power and influence as flag bearers for their country and for climate action, including breaking ties with some sponsors.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>Athletes are competing for teams that might be sponsored by an entity that doesn't necessarily want to talk about climate change. So for example, if you're competing on Team Canada, just sponsored at the moment by Petro-Can and RBC, two brands obviously connected to funding fossil fuels and producing fossil fuels. It can feel a bit tricky of figuring out right, like how exactly what I approach some of these issues.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Of course, you're talking in the year that the Edmonton boilers went to the Stanley Cup.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>Yes.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>That's not a popular opinion.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>It's not. It's not. And here's the thing, right? It's really tricky because you're now having to if you walk away from fossil fuels to say, okay, well, what are we going to replace it with.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The Olympics have always been about faster, higher, stronger and now hotter. Athletes need protection from the ravages of our changing climate.<br/><br/>ADRIENNE ARSENAULT (CBC-TV):<br/>So Susan, I understand, Paris promised the greenest Olympic Games ever. But I gather already the running into trouble.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Yeah. I mean, part of their sustainability plan was no air conditioning in the athletes' village, instead in floor cooling. But there was so much pushback. They've had to order 2,500 AC units. Teams can pay for them, and Canada will be taking advantage of that.<br/><br/>ADRIENNE ARSENAULT (CBC-TV):<br/>What was curious is like how does sport actually adapt to climate change?<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Well, Madeleine Orr in our story, she says the number one thing is every sport is a heat and air quality policy like we have rules around storms or lightning, and she says change the coaching culture don't push through when it's blistering hot because heat can kill.<br/><br/>ADRIENNE ARSENAULT (CBC-TV):<br/>Alright, good advice. Susan Ormiston. Thank you.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>You're welcome.<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-NA24071520</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CGV-Y3W1-F0BD-C0J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

We need time to train,\" he added. \"We need the resources to enable our players to train and help them improve. We need our players to be playing rugby consistently for Canada and we need them playing rugby consistently elsewhere in preparation to play for Canada \u2026 And then we need the coaching to go with it.</p><p>\"But these are all very important factors that we need to address.\"</p><p>Jones succeeded New Zealand's Mark Anscombe, who was fired in August 2017 after the Canadian men lost to the U.S. in its first crack at qualifying for the 2019 World Cup. Canada subsequently lost to Uruguay in another two-legged qualifying series but eventually made it to Japan under Jones via a four-team repechage tournament.</p><p>Canada lost to Italy, New Zealand and South Africa by a combined score of 177-14 at the 2019 World Cup. A final game against Namibia was called off due to typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>Seventh-ranked Argentina, by finishing in the top three of its pool at the current World Cup, is one of 12 automatic entries for the 2027 tournament. Canada, ranked 23rd in the world, will have to battle No. 17 Uruguay, No. 18 U.S. and No. 22 Chile among others to get out of the Americas.</p><p>In addition to dealing with the pandemic, Jones has had to work within the modest resources of a governing body under new leadership while it attempts to reinvent itself in the wake of a damning March 2022 independent review into its high-performance programs.</p><p>Jones has also been frustrated in getting games for Canada, with World Rugby dragging its heels in arranging fixtures in recent months.</p><p>\"It hasn't been straightforward, but we're making some steps and going about this in a very systematic way to try and rebuild this thing and get this team where we want it to be,\" said Bombrys.</p><p>Rugby Canada says Jones has widened the depth of the Canadian talent pool, saying there are \"now over 90 players in high performance daily training environments.\"</p><p>The governing body also says Jones helped restart the Pacific Pride academy \u2014 which Rugby Canada had closed earlier due to financial issues \u2014 and brought in former players Sean White, Phil Mack and Hubert Buydens to serve as coaches in its high performance programs. </p><p>\u201cKingsley brings a wealth of experience, technical knowledge and commitment to the role of head coach,\u201d Stephen Aboud, Rugby Canada director of high performance, said in a statement. \u201cA tireless, passionate, and energetic approach underlined by a constant need for technical improvement are essential in the preparation and build up to the Rugby World Cup qualifiers in two years.</p><p>\"Rugby Canada\u2019s goal is clear, Rugby World Cup qualification, and Kingsley\u2019s appointment ensures the stability and familiarity required to build with confidence towards achieving this goal.\u201d </p><p>Jones, a flanker who won 10 caps for Wales between 1996 and 1998 and captained his country once, previously worked in high performance with the Welsh Rugby Union.</p><p>Earlier this year, he served as an assistant coach for the renowned Barbarians all-star side against a World XV at London's Twickenham. </p><p>He coached Russia from 2011 to 2014.</p><p>At club level, he coached the Newport Gwent Dragons in Wales and the Sale Sharks and Doncaster in England. He was also an assistant coach with London Welsh. During Jones' tenure, Sale won the Premiership title and the European Challenge Cup.</p><p>A flanker, he played club rugby in Wales for Ebbw Vale and Pontypridd, before moving to England's Gloucester, Worcester and Doncaster.</p><p>\u201cI am excited for the opportunity to continue building with this team,\" Jones said in a statement. \"A lot of the dedicated, hard-working young players we\u2019ve worked with over the last six years are now 26, 27, and reaching their prime, and I\u2019m excited to see them fulfil their potential.\u201d </p><p>Jones comes from a rugby family.

The two teams were to have met at the 2019 World Cup in Japan but the game in Kamaishi was called off due to Typhoon Hagibis. </p><p>The European games are the first for the full Canadian senior side since July when it beat No. 26 Belgium 45-0 in Halifax and lost 57-34 to No. 16 Spain in Ottawa.</p><p>Jones took a developmental side to Brazil last month for the Americas Rugby Trophy where Canada 'A' lost 36-25 to Chile XV and beat Brazil 'A' 31-14.</p><p>The Netherlands finished last in the Rugby Europe Championship, which served as a World Cup qualifier. The Dutch finished sixth at 1-9-0 with the lone win by way over disqualification over Russia.</p><p>The Dutch served notice in the fourth minute, winning a scrum penalty against prop Liam Murray. Another Canadian penalty for offside two minutes later allowed the Netherlands to kick for goal but Lydon was wide.</p><p>Canada regrouped and pulled ahead 3-0 on a 10th-minute Coats penalty when the Dutch were dinged for offside. Lydon tied it up four minutes later with a long-range penalty.</p><p>While the Dutch scrum was solid, the Canadians began to make inroads in open play, hammering away at the Dutch defence. But Lydon converted another penalty for a 6-3 lead in the 20th minute.</p><p>The Canadian backs broke through in the 23rd minute with a line break by Coats setting up a try under the posts by Braude and a 10-6 lead.</p><p>The Dutch hurt their cause with handling errors when they did win possession. Another Coats penalty upped the lead to 13-6 in the 33rd minute.</p><p>The Dutch backs answered in the 35th minute, slicing through the Canadian defence with Limmen touching down in the corner. Lydon's conversion tied it at 13-13.</p><p>Canada kicked for the corner after a Dutch penalty late in the half. But the attack ended in a knock-on at the Dutch try-line.</p><p>There was some bad blood in the second half with French referee Benoit Rousselet sending a Dutch player to the sin-bin in the 50th minute.</p><p>The Canadians quickly took advantage with Stevens, on the back of two Dutch penalties, scoring at the back of a driving maul for a 20-13 lead. Another try-scoring opportunity minutes later ended in an errant Canadian pass. </p><p>A Rumball try in the 61st minute padded the lead with the Canadian scrum, minutes later, winning a penalty in front of its own posts to extinguish a Dutch threat. Larsen then bulled his way over in the 71st as the Canadian forwards battered the Dutch.</p><p>Wagemaker ended Canada's 21-point run with a converted try off a driving mail in the 75th minute. Coats continued his perfect kicking day with a 78th-minute penalty before Wierenga scored in the corner with time running out.</p><p>Callum Botchar, Matthew Klimchuk, Conor Young and Josiah Morra won their first 15s caps for Canada.</p><p>Saturday's game marked a return for wing Andrew Coe, who last played for the 15s team at the 2019 World Cup. The 26-year-old, part of Canadas sevens squad at the Tokyo Olympics, helped Rugby New York win the MLR championship this season.</p><p>Rumball and Ben LeSage served as Canada co-captains.</p><p>The two coaches are no strangers. Kingsley Jones and Dutch coach Lyn Jones both played for Wales and worked together at the Dragons, a Welsh club side.

Tottori, in the southwest, hit 25.8 C (78 F) on the same day, the highest in 140 years, according to climatologist Maximiliano Herrera. Tottori\u2019s temperatures usually hover around 12 C (54 F) in March.</p><p>With thermometers already shooting upward and fossil fuel use that feeds climate change still creeping up around the world, Japan is set for another sweltering summer and is at growing risk of flooding and landslides. The nation is scrambling to protect communities from warming and has pledged to slash emissions, but in the short term the worsening weather remains a threat.</p><p>\u201cThe risks from climate change are right before us,\u201d said Yasuaki Hijioka, deputy director of the Center for Climate Change Adaptation at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo. </p><p>\u201cYou can in principle try escaping from a flood. But heat affects such a wide area, there is almost no escape. Everyone is affected.\u201d</p><p>Japan is already prone to natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons. Secure infrastructure has kept people safe for the most part. But climate change means communities are often caught off guard because the systems were engineered for the weather conditions of the past.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re pushing the electrical grid that was designed for the 20th century into a new century of warming and heat extremes, then you are going to have to consider whether your energy system and your health care system are really designed for a warming planet,\u201d said Kim Cobb, director of The Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. </p><p>More people are getting sick because of heat stroke. </p><p>           Last year, more than 200 temperature records were broken in cities across the nation, sending energy grid to near-capacity and over 71,000 people to hospital for heatstroke through the months of May to September. Patients were mostly elderly but a fair number of children and middle-aged adults were also hospitalized, according to government figures. Eighty people died. </p><p>The warming weather can also hold more moisture, adding flooding and landslides to the summer forecast, something that Japan has also seen with growing frequency.</p><p>In 2019, bullet trains were partially submerged in flooding from Typhoon Hagibis. Homes and highways were caught in landslides. Flooded tunnels trapped people and cars. Dams couldn't withstand the surprisingly heavy rainfall. </p><p>Hijioka\u2019s research is focused on flood management, such as diverting water from swelling rivers upstream into rice paddies and ponds to drain to avert flooding.</p><p>To prevent deaths from heatstroke, a proposed law would designate certain buildings in communities, such as air-conditioned libraries, as shelters. That kind of law on the national level is new in Japan. </p><p>Despite the country's advanced economy, some people cannot afford air conditioning, especially in areas not accustomed to the heat. Schools in northern Japan, such as in Nagano, have installed air conditioning because of the extreme heat in recent years. </p><p>\"More people have been dying from heatstroke than from river flooding in Japan,\u201d said Hijioka. \u201cWe need to view climate change as a natural disaster.\u201d </p><p>Michio Kawamiya, director of the Research Center for Environmental Modeling and Application, and his team research Japan\u2019s higher temperatures and how they affect people.</p><p>Among their findings: Since 1953, cherry blossoms have bloomed on average one day sooner every decade. Maple leaves have changed color 2.8 days slower per decade. The risk of typhoons has gone up and the amount of snowfall has declined, even as the threat of heavy snowfall remains.</p><p>Japan has made some headway in curbing the amount of fossil fuels it spews, but it's still the world's sixth-highest emitter. After the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the country shut down nuclear generation, and, fatefully for the climate, invested in new coal plants as well as imported oil and gas to keep its grid running. Nuclear plants have gradually restarted since then.</p><p>On the positive side, its excellent public mass-transit transportation has kept gas-guzzling cars off roads, lowering the country's carbon footprint. Some Japanese people have been turning their air conditioning off to save energy, but that has health implications, as it comes precisely at a time when heat has been reaching dangerously high levels. </p><p>The country has already worked so hard to conserve energy by reducing demand that doing more has often been compared to \u201cwringing water out of a totally dry rag,\u201d Kawamiya said in an interview at his office in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo. </p><p>Still, critics say Japan could be doing more to boost renewable energy use, such as solar and wind power. The government plans for renewables to make up over a third of the country's power supply by 2030 and to phase out coal use sometime in the 2040s.</p><p>Japan is also part of the Group of Seven leading economies that pledged to be largely free of fossil fuels for electricity by 2035.</p><p>Since Fukushima, Japan has kept most of the nation\u2019s 50-some nuclear reactors offline, in response to public opinion that\u2019s turned against the technology. Nuclear power is considered a clean energy as it doesn\u2019t emit greenhouse gases, but it does produce radioactive waste.</p><p>About 10 reactors are up and running, 24 reactors are being decommissioned. What Japan will eventually decide on nuclear power remains unclear. </p><p>Hijioka, who believes Japan lags in the shift toward renewable energy, said he was frustrated by policymakers who he said have dragged their feet on dealing with climate change, but are pushing a return to nuclear. </p><p>Despite its potential to curb planet-warming emissions, skepticism remains among some climate experts about turning to nuclear power due to costs and timescales of projects compared to how quickly and cheaply an equivalent amount of renewable energy can come online. There are also concerns among the public.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s utterly irresponsible, when we think about the next generation,\" Hijioka said. \"We may be old, and we may die so it might not matter. But what about our children?\u201d </p><p>___</p><p>Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\">https://twitter.com/yurikageyama</url></p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Please move to safety while it's still light outside,' he added. <br/>The JMA has warned the region could face 'unprecedented' danger from high winds, storm surges and torrential rain. <br/>'Maximum caution is required,' Ryuta Kurora, headof the JMA's forecast unit said on Saturday. <br/>'It's a very dangerous typhoon.'  <br/>'The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse,' Kurora told reporters, also warning of flooding and landslides. <br/>National broadcaster NHK, which collates local warnings, said more than four million people across Kyushu were issued evacuation warnings, with officials in Kagoshima and Miyazaki saying over 15,000 people were in local shelters by Sunday afternoon. <br/>The evacuation warnings call on people to move to shelters or alternative accommodation that can withstand extreme weather. <br/>But they are not mandatory, and during past extreme weather events authorities have struggled to convince residents to take shelter quickly enough. <br/>Kurora urged people to evacuate before the worst of the storm arrived and warned that even in sturdy buildings residents would need to take precautions. <br/>'Please move into sturdy buildings before violent winds start to blow and stay away from windows even inside sturdy buildings,' he told a late-night press conference. <br/>- 'Highest caution possible' - <br/>By Sunday morning, bullet train operations in the area were halted, and NHK said hundreds of flights had been cancelled. <br/>'The southern part of the Kyushu region may see the sort of violent wind, high waves and high tides that have never been experienced before,' the JMA said Sunday, urging residents to exercise 'the highest caution possible'. <br/>On the ground, an official in Kagoshima's Izumi city said conditions were deteriorating rapidly. <br/>'The wind has become extremely strong. Rain is falling hard too,' he told AFP. 'It's a total white-out outside. Visibility is almost zero.' <br/>On the coast in Kyushu's Minamata city, fishing boats tied up for safety bobbed on the waves, as spray from the sea and bands of rain sluiced the boardwalk. <br/>As of 1 pm (0400 GMT), the typhoon was located above tiny Yakushima island, packing gusts up to 234 kilometres (146 miles) per hour. <br/>It is expected to make landfall in Kyushu on Sunday evening, before turning northeast and sweeping up across Japan's main island through early Wednesday. <br/>Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods. <br/>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people. <br/>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka, killing 14 people. <br/>And in 2018, floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in western Japan during the country's annual rainy season. <br/>Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of stormsand causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense. <br/><url

There was no immediate confirmation of the figures from authorities. <br/>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who had been scheduled to leave Monday for the United Nations General Assembly, will delay his trip by a day to check on damage from the storm, his office confirmed. <br/>Officials from the Japan Meteorological Agency warned that in Miyazaki prefecture, where some areas saw more rainfall in 24 hours than they normally receive in all of September, river levels were high. <br/>'Even a tiny amount of additional rainfall could cause the water level to increase, so please remain vigilant about flooding and landslides,' Yoshiyuki Toyoguchi from the land ministry told reporters. <br/>Still, given the intensity of the storm, which came ashore packing gusts of up to 234 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, damage appeared relatively limited so far. <br/>'The typhoon has all but disappeared today and the rain and wind are also subsiding now,' an official in charge of crisis management in Miyazaki's Saito city told AFP. <br/>'But power is out in some placeswe're also hearing from many residents that electrical wires have been severed and trees have been toppled,' he said, declining to be named. <br/>'Flooding is affecting some areas as well,' he added, saying that officials 'believe there are still many details of the damage we're yet to grasp'. <br/>Rare 'special warnings' for Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, issued only when weather events seen every few decades are forecast, have been downgraded. <br/>But evacuation warnings of various levels remained in place for 9.6 million people on the last day of a holiday weekend in Japan. <br/>The warnings are not mandatory, and authorities have at times struggled to convince residents to leave their homes during extreme weather events. <br/>- 'I didn't feel safe at home' - <br/>In the town of Izumi in Kagoshima prefecture, 30-year-old Yasuta Yamaguchi spent the night in a local hotel to shelter from the storm. <br/>'I came to the hotel to shelter myself because it was windy and I thought it was dangerous,' he told AFP. <br/>'I didn't feel safe at home.' <br/>By Monday morning, nearly 313,000 households in Kyushu and neighbouring Chugoku region were without power, utilities said. Hundreds of flights had been cancelled, NHK said, and many train services throughout the affected regions were also halted. <br/>As of 11:00 am (0200 GMT), the typhoon was spiralling north-northeast near Kitakyushu, Kyushu island's northernmost city, with maximum gusts of around 162 kilometres per hour, according to the JMA. <br/>'The thick cloud and eye area around the typhoon's centre have already disappeared and it is weakening rapidly,' Ryuta Kurora, the headof the JMA's forecast unit, told reporters. <br/>'The typhoon is still weakening, and from 9:00 am (0000 GMT) it has been downgraded from a category strong and large typhoon to a large typhoon,' he said. <br/>Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods. <br/>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people. <br/>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka, and left 14 people dead in its wake. <br/>2018 was a particularly bad year, with floods and landslides killing more than 200 people in western Japan during the country's

And unfortunately, it goes through this cancellation.\"</p><p>The game at Complexe Sportif Claude-Robillard, which would have been the first-ever rugby international in Montreal, was to have been the opening match of the 23rd-ranked Canadian men's quadrennial leading to the 2023 World Cup in France.</p><p>A match against No. 12 Italy in Halifax on July 11 remains on the calendar, at least at this stage.</p><p>Canada has not played since its World Cup campaign in Japan was cut short last October due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>Citing the safety of all concerned, Rugby Canada said it supports the decision to cancel the Montreal game, saying it hoped to welcome the French Barbarians to Canada in the future.</p><p>The cancellation will hit Rugby Canada's bottom line. Home games do not come often and the gate revenue is welcome.</p><p>CEO Allen Vansen said earlier this month that he anticipates a virus-related decline of $4 million to $6 million this year in gross revenue, although that will be accompanied by a reduction in expenses given the pandemic has forced events to be called off.</p><p>In 2017, the most recent figures available, Rugby Canada had $16.2 million in revenue.</p><p>Cancellation of the French side's tour will also not help USA Rugby, which has filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>It also extends the virus-prompted inactivity for the Canadian men. Some 50 Canadians currently play in North America's Major League Rugby, which cancelled its 2020 season on March 19 after five rounds due to the pandemic.</p><p>After July, the Canadians are slated to play in the newly restructured America's Rugby Championship.</p><p>They open against the 16th-ranked Americans on Aug. 15 in Glendale, Colo., before returning home to face No. 26 Brazil in Calgary on Aug. 22 and No. 29 Chile in Winnipeg on Aug. 29. Canada then travels to South America for the final two ARC matches against Argentina XV - a Pumas reserve side - on Sept. 5 and No. 17 Uruguay on Sept. 12.</p><p>The summer test window was restructured this year by World Rugby and participating unions to accommodate the MLR competition schedule. The window was shifted from June to July and the ARC moved from February/March to August/September.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 10, 2020.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow @NeilMDavidson on Twitter</p><p>Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-3983115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMV-S1S1-F103-3483-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Red Deer Advocate</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

And unfortunately, it goes through this cancellation.\"</p><p>The game at Complexe Sportif Claude-Robillard, which would have been the first-ever rugby international in Montreal, was to have been the opening match of the 23rd-ranked Canadian men's quadrennial leading to the 2023 World Cup in France.</p><p>A match against No. 12 Italy in Halifax on July 11 remains on the calendar, at least at this stage.</p><p>Canada has not played since its World Cup campaign in Japan was cut short last October due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>Citing the safety of all concerned, Rugby Canada said it supports the decision to cancel the Montreal game, saying it hoped to welcome the French Barbarians to Canada in the future.</p><p>The cancellation will hit Rugby Canada's bottom line. Home games do not come often and the gate revenue is welcome.</p><p>CEO Allen Vansen said earlier this month that he anticipates a virus-related decline of $4 million to $6 million this year in gross revenue, although that will be accompanied by a reduction in expenses given the pandemic has forced events to be called off.</p><p>In 2017, the most recent figures available, Rugby Canada had $16.2 million in revenue.</p><p>Cancellation of the French side's tour will also not help USA Rugby, which has filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>It also extends the virus-prompted inactivity for the Canadian men. Some 50 Canadians currently play in North America's Major League Rugby, which cancelled its 2020 season on March 19 after five rounds due to the pandemic.</p><p>After July, the Canadians are slated to play in the newly restructured America's Rugby Championship.</p><p>They open against the 16th-ranked Americans on Aug. 15 in Glendale, Colo., before returning home to face No. 26 Brazil in Calgary on Aug. 22 and No. 29 Chile in Winnipeg on Aug. 29. Canada then travels to South America for the final two ARC matches against Argentina XV - a Pumas reserve side - on Sept. 5 and No. 17 Uruguay on Sept. 12.</p><p>The summer test window was restructured this year by World Rugby and participating unions to accommodate the MLR competition schedule. The window was shifted from June to July and the ARC moved from February/March to August/September.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 10, 2020.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow @NeilMDavidson on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-ae7002feb6304751a424e26b9a4fc529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMV-4TD1-JBVR-352N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><timeReceived>01:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That quarter followed a hike in the sales tax from five percent to eight percent and the latest slump also appears to have been affected by a rise in consumption tax to 10 percent that came into effect on October 1.Private consumption was hard hit, dropping by 2.9 percent -- the first fall in five quarters.Expenditure on factories and equipment decreased 3.7 percent despite investment getting a boost from cashless-payment systems that allow consumers to alleviate the consumption tax hike.- 'Bleak prospects' -Economists are now carefully watching to see what impact the new virus will have on the world's third-largest economy, as it hits Japanese companies' manufacturing activities and tourism.Japan has only a \"bleak\" prospect of returning to growth in the first quarter of this year, said Minami.Private consumption would likely pick up from the October-December quarter but how much it will recover in the coming months would depend on the spread of the virus, he said.\"Also, exports might struggle as delays of parts shipments from China could disrupt supply chains,\" he said.He added it was \"possible\" that the economy will shrink for a second consecutive quarter, the technical definition of a recession.Health minister Katsunobu Kato on Sunday urged the public to avoid crowds and \"non-essential gatherings\", including Japan's notoriously packed commuter trains, to prevent the virus from spreading.However, Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi Trust, predicted the new coronavirus outbreak would not impede recovery in the first quarter of 2020.\"External demand should continue to grow in Q1 2020 despite the outbreak of the coronavirus, which we forecast to have only a small impact on Japan's inbound tourism industry, which constitutes only 0.8 percent of real GDP,\" he said in a commentary ahead of the data release.\"Going forward, we should see positive growth in Q1 2020 and beyond. </p><p>Domestic consumption should recover as the impact of the higher consumption tax abates,\" he said.\"In addition, with the Tokyo Olympics just a few months away, we will undoubtedly see a significant positive economic impact of the Games for the Japanese economy.\"Japan's government is to allocate 15.3 billion yen ($139 million) to fight the economic impact of the virus, including measures to enhance airport inspections and testing capacity. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO100903158191240155275776100237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y79-SX81-JCMN-Y3M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><timeReceived>4:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002ZHR</classCode><className>PT SUPER MITORY UTAMA TBK</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D1FR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001680</classCode><className>TAX INCREASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>TAX LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

It marked Portugal's first ever win over Canada in five meetings.</p><p>\"The players didn't deserve to lose that way,\" said Jones. \"They worked so hard and the replacements did so well as well \u2026 It was a tough one to take.\"</p><p>Tougher because there was no video replay on the day to review the winning try, with Pinto touching down a kick in the end zone. Canada also rued two missed conversions.</p><p>The two-game European tour follows Canada's failure to qualify for the 2023 World Cup after losing two-legged aggregate series against the 18th-ranked U.S. Eagles and No. 26 Chile in September and October, respectively.</p><p>A win Saturday and the Canadians can at least point to three victories out of their six fall fixtures.</p><p>Thomas played in Australia for the Perth Spirit, GPS Club and Brisbane City before moving to Japan to play for the Canon Eagles, Kamaishi Seawaves and Super Rugby's Sunwolves.</p><p>He made his Super Rugby debut for the Japanese team in February 2020 against the Queensland Reds only to see the season cancelled weeks later because of the pandemic.</p><p>He loved his time in Japan, citing the people and the food. At six foot four and 253 pounds, he also attracted attention.</p><p>\"I actually had hair back then. I had blond hair so I stood out even more,\" said Thomas, whose head is now shaved.</p><p>Thomas' Australian grandmother married a Canadian. But when her husband died, she moved the family back to Perth when Thomas's father was six.</p><p>\"From a young age it was a just a dream to come to Canada,\" said Thomas.</p><p>His father currently works in Indonesia while his mother, a New Zealander, lives in Perth.</p><p>Thomas says while his father has had difficulties getting to watch his matches, he managed to catch his son make his debut against England at Twickenham in July.</p><p>\"He was very proud,\" said Thomas. \"I just hope he can come over and see some footie (in person) soon, because it's been tough not having him around.\" </p><p>Thomas, who has toured B.C. with his girlfriend in recent months, roomed with former Canadian international DTH van der Merwe for a time on the road with the Giltinis.</p><p>Despite the recent setbacks, Thomas sees \"lot of potential\" in the Canadian squad.</p><p>\"The more game time these boys get together, the better they're going to be. It was disappointing not being qualified (for the World Cup) but we just need to accept what's happened and focus on the next steps,\" he said.</p><p>The Belgians, playing their third test of the year, are coming off a 23-21 loss to the Netherlands in May in a Rugby Europe Championship playoff. That relegated the team known as the Black Devils to the second-tier Rugby Europe Trophy.</p><p>A win and the Belgians will climb at least two places in the rankings. A loss would drop Canada to its lowest-ever ranking with defeat, depending on the margin and other results.</p><p>The Belgians are fielding a young squad, however, with 11 potential debutants among the matchday squad.</p><p>The two teams have met just once before with Canada winning 43-12 in Brussels in November 2010.</p><p>Jones has made four personnel and one positional change. Thomas, prop Tyler Rowland, scrum half Jason Higgins and wing Isaac Olson slot into the starting 15 while Brock Webster shifts from wing to fullback, Olson earns his first cap while Higgins makes his first start.</p><p>The hope is Canada's fitness will pay off as the match progresses.</p><p>Thomas scored two tries off the bench against Portugal, showing his power in bulling his way across the try-line.</p><p>\"He's a big boy \u2026 We need that power ball-carrier,\" Jones said of Thomas, who can play both lock and No. 8.</p><p>Life on the road can be challenging. After being assigned a \"mud-bath\" field with no markings for a practice session this week, the Canadians found a well-appointed soccer field which they did not have permission to use. </p><p>When the groundskeeper arrived and objected, Jones got him onside by gifting him his T-shirt and everyone left happy.</p><p>The Canadians subsequently found another rugby field to train on in Waterloo, the site of the famous 1815 battle south of Brussels.</p><p>Canada:</p><p>Cole Keith, Sussex, N.B., Toronto Arrows (MLR); Andrew Quattrin, Holland Landing, Ont., Toronto Arrows (MLR); Tyler Rowland, Mississauga, Ont., Toronto Arrows (MLR); Conor Keys, Stittsville, Ont., Rugby ATL (MLR); Kyle Baillie, Summerside, P.E.I., Toronto Arrows (MLR); Lucas Rumball (capt.), Toronto, Toronto Arrows (MLR); Michael Smith, White Rock, B.C., San Diego Legion (MLR); Corey Thomas, Perth, Australia, L.A.

Please stay calm and protect yourself,' blared a message in Japanese and English at one venue. <br/> 'Taking action in a panic may lead to danger.' <br/> Tokyo 2020 says it has contingency plans for various natural disasters,'prioritising the safety of spectators and people involved', though they declined to offer further details. <br/> The risks are real, said Toshiyasu Nagao, an expert on earthquake prediction studies with Tokai University's Institute of Oceanic Research and Development. <br/> 'It would be no surprise if a big earthquake hit directly beneath the capital tomorrow,' he told AFP. <br/> 'And it's not just in Tokyo, the risks of an earthquake are everywhere in Japan.' <br/> - 'A little nerve-wracking' - <br/> Seven earthquakes of magnitude six or higher have hit Japan so far this year, including a 7.3-magnitude quake in February, and a March jolt that sparked a tsunami advisory. <br/>Japan is also haunted by the 2011 quake which triggered a tsunami that killed more than 18,500 people and caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster. <br/> Tokyo's government says the city's permanent Olympic venues feature the latest technology in case of disaster. <br/> The $340 million Ariake volleyball arena, for example, has shock-absorbing giant rubber cushions to keep it safe even during violent shaking, and is certified for use as a shelter. <br/> Waterfront facilities, including the Olympic Village, are built on embankments or protected by sea walls that can withstand a tsunami of almost two metres (6.5 feet) \u2014 the maximum height predicted inside Tokyo Bay, the city says. <br/> In some ways, the pandemic has made potential disaster response less complicated as almost all fans will be barred from the Games, making the prospect of mass spectator evacuations unlikely. <br/> But some 70,000 athletes, media and officials will still be in Tokyo for the Olympics and Paralympics, and controlling infection risks during an emergency response could be difficult. <br/> Japaneseauthorities have already updated their emergency policies, limiting space at shelters to avoid crowding and stocking up on masks and disinfectant. <br/> 'Evacuation management can directly contradict infection control measures,' warned Sakiko Kanbara, professor of disaster nursing at University of Kochi. <br/> 'We have to be aware that a disaster in ordinary times is quite different from one in a pandemic.' <br/> Still, emergency preparation is so deeply embedded in Japanese life that Tokyo even has several disaster simulation centres where visitors can experience artificial jolts and practice evacuation. <br/> On a recent visit to the Ikebukuro Life Safety Learning Centre, English teacher Mike Diakakis said he had found a quake in Tokyo earlier this year 'a little nerve-wracking'. <br/> 'You don't really think about it until you've experienced it,' he said. <br/><url

The system, part of its Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) constellation, was deployed from the International Space Station July 3, 2019. The satellite continues to deliver precise, unique datasets that translate into highly reliable weather intelligence for a broad range of customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are delighted that the satellite continues to gather and downlink reliable and high-definition data that can be utilized by commercial and public organizations to gain clearer insights into weather conditions and propensities across multiple geographies,\" said Brian Sanders, chief operating officer for OMS. \"The length of service life for satellites without propulsion systems-particularly those launched from the space station-which are typically around six months, so we are ecstatic with the performance of IOD-1 GEMS.\"</p><p>The IOD-1 GEMS satellite gathers global readings, at altitudes ranging from the surface up to the troposphere, approximately two and one-half times each day. The information gathered often fills gaps between government-operated satellites. During its first year of operation, IOD-1 captured images of Super Typhoon Hagibis and numerous other weather systems over oceans and land that were not observed by other orbiting radiometers. The data transmitted from IOD-1 GEMS has been validated by numerous organizations and labs, and utilized in datasets that have already been purchased by the U.S. Air Force and other public agencies.</p><p>\"It is highly unusual for a demonstration platform to deliver commercially viable data,\" continued Sanders. \"The fact that we have paying customers is a testament to the quality of the design as well as a strong indicator that markets are thirsty for reliable data at much higher refresh rates than previously possible.\"</p><p>IOD-1 GEMS was launched through the In-Orbit Demonstration Programme managed by the U.K.'s Satellite Applications Catapult and funded by Innovate U.K. The GEMS constellation is planned to grow to some 16 satellites, providing sub-hourly revisits of the entire planet. With additional launches planned for mid-2021, OMS is planning to fulfill demand for its weather data across markets including insurance, transportation, agriculture, and governments.</p><p>About Orbital Micro Systems</p><p>Orbital Micro Systems (OMS) specializes in the development and delivery of remote sensing technologies for space, air, and land applications. With broad expertise in applied science, weather science and earth observation, instrumentation development, data science, space operations, and program delivery, OMS is positioned to deliver innovation to many markets, including aerospace, agriculture, IoT, and the public sector.

The Programme helps service providers to accelerate to a 'proof of concept' stage by providing an in-orbit testbed and a range of operations and business support services to explore the commercial potential of the mission. IOD-1 GEMS was the first In-Orbit Demonstration programme mission, supported by Innovate UK funding, to be deployed from the International Space Station in July 2019. IOD-1 GEMS is in partnership with Orbital Micro Systems and will be followed by IOD-5 TARS in partnership with Kepler Communications, and IOD-3 AMBER in partnership with Horizon Technologies.</p><p>The Satellite Applications Catapult is an independent innovation and technology company, created by Innovate UK to drive economic growth through the exploitation of space. We work with businesses of all sizes to realise their potential from space infrastructure and its applications.

Rugby Canada says the two remaining spots will remain unfilled pending fitness tests as players return from injury.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The July tests mark the first games for the Canadian men since October 2019 at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.</p><p>The 23rd-ranked Canadians will face No. 6 Wales on July 3 at Principality Stadium in Cardiff and No. 3 England on July 10 at Twickenham Stadium in suburban London. Jones is using the matches as preparation for World Cup qualifying matches in the fall.</p><p>The travelling roster represents a changing of the guard with the touring squad features 25 players from Major League Rugby clubs, including nine from the Toronto Arrows. There are three players from Rugby Canada's national development academy and two from clubs in France.</p><p>Jones has selected 11 uncapped players: Foster DeWitt, Liam Murray, Reegan O'Gorman, Tyler Rowland, Michael Smith, Ross Braude, Fraser Hurst, Spencer Jones, Lachlan Kratz, Quinn Ngawati and Isaac Olsen.</p><p>Ngawati is a former member of the Toronto Wolfpack rugby league team.</p><p>\"I think we have to start the cycle again,\" said Jones. \"Unfortunately there are a couple of senior boys we would have selected obviously but are unavailable due to other commitments and a couple of injuries. But what an exciting opportunity for those younger guys.\"</p><p>Former Canada captain Tyler Ardron and fellow forward Evan Olmstead, who both play in France, are among a group of nine players deemed unavailable for selection due to injuries and club commitments among other reasons. Others like Shane O'Leary have not seen much action recently.</p><p>Rugby Canada says 18 players in the national sevens program were not considered because of their Olympic preparation.</p><p>It's rare that Canada gets to play Tier 1 nations outside of the World Cup these days. Wales is the defending Six Nations champion while England was runner-up at the 2019 World Cup.</p><p>Both sides will be missing top players who will be touring South Africa with the British and Irish Lions. England has 12 players on the 37-man Lions squad while Wales has 10.</p><p>England coach Eddie Jones named 21 uncapped players to his training squad in preparation for the July tests.</p><p>Kingsley Jones had originally named a 40-man extended roster that featured 29 MLR players including 13 from the Arrows.</p><p>The upcoming Wales match will mark 632 days since Canada closed out its World Cup campaign in a 66-7 loss to eventual World Cup champion South Africa on Oct. 8, 2019, in Kobe, Japan. A subsequent World Cup match against Namibia was cancelled due to typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>Canada was originally set to host England in Toronto this summer but pandemic-related travel restrictions have shifted the game and others to Europe.</p><p>England will play the U.S. Eagles on July 4 prior to facing Canada.</p><p>England ran in 12 tries, blanking Canada 70-0 when the two met at Twickenham in November 2004. The Welsh scored nine tries en route to a 61-26 win over the Canadians in Cardiff in November 2006</p><p>But Canada scored a historic 26-24 upset of Wales in November 1993 at Cardiff Arms Park thanks to a last-ditch try by Al Charron and conversion by Gareth Rees.</p><p>The Canadian men lost 37-6 to England A in the 2011 Churchill Cup.</p><p>Kingsley Jones is a former Wales captain. Canada senior assistant coach Rob Howley won 59 caps for Wales as a player and was part of the Wales coaching staff between 2008 and 2019.</p><p>Jones, whose CV includes a stint in the Russia national team coaching setup, has never coached against his homeland. He coached against England at Twickenham in 2010, when he and France's Philippe Saint-Andre served as co-coaches of the Barbarians.</p><p>The Canadian men have held one high-performance camp, last November in Langford, B.C., since closing out the World Cup.</p><p>Canada Touring Party</p><p>Forwards:</p><p>Lucas Albornoz, Burnaby, B.C., Houston SaberCats (MLR); Foster Dewitt, Courtenay, B.C., Rugby Canada National Development Academy; Matt Heaton, Godmanchester, Que., Rugby ATL (MLR); Eric Howard, Ottawa, NOLA Gold (MLR); Jake Ilnicki, Williams Lake, B.C., Seattle Seawolves (MLR); Cole Keith, Sussex, N.B., Toronto Arrows (MLR); Conor Keys, Stittsville, Ont., Rugby ATL (MLR); Josh Larson, Parksville, B.C., New England Free Jacks (MLR); Liam Murray, Langley, B.C., Houston SaberCats (MLR); Reegan O'Gorman, Vancouver, Austin Gilgronis (MLR); Andrew Quattrin, Holland Landing, Ont., Toronto Arrows (MLR); Tyler Rowland Mississauga, Ont.,Toronto Arrows (MLR); Lucas Rumball, Scarborough, Ont.

Canada, which won the last-chance repechage last time out, could also end up in this group.</p><p>\"I think they're all looking pretty tough, aren't they,\" Canada coach Kingsley Jones said of the groups.</p><p>Jones has to consider both the skill and physicality of the opposition, given the sometimes short turnaround at the World Cup.</p><p>Group A is similar to Canada's pool at the 2019 tournament in Japan with mercurial France replacing the powerful Springboks. The Canadian men (0-3-0) finished last in the pool (on point difference) behind tough opposition in New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia. Canada's final match against Namibia was called off due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The 2023 World Cup is scheduled to run Sept. 8 to Oct. 21 in nine stadiums.</p><p>Twelve teams have already qualified, by virtue of finishing in the top three of their pools at the 2019 tournament: South Africa, New Zealand, England, Wales, Ireland, France, Australia, Japan, Scotland, Argentina, Fiji and Italy.</p><p>Eight more countries will join them via regional qualifiers, including the Americas.</p><p>Qualifying for 2023 has seen various permutations in the region. Canadian officials had been led to believe it would involve results in the Americas Rugby Championship &amp; - which involves Canada, the U.S, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and an Argentina reserve side &amp; - over the next two years.</p><p>But the most recent Americas qualifying road map tweaks the traditional format.</p><p>Canada will face the 16th-ranked Americans home and away with the winner facing a South American tournament victor, likely No. 18 Uruguay, in the two-legged Americas 1 Playoff to determine who goes to the World Cup as Americas 1.</p><p>The Canada-U.S. loser will face a South American tournament runner-up, likely No. 26 Brazil or No. 29 Chile, in the Americas 2 Qualifier with the winner advancing to the Americas 2 Playoff against the Americas 1 Playoff loser. The winner of that series moves on as Americas 2 while the loser goes the final qualification tournament.</p><p>Jones hopes that process can start in the fall of 2021, allowing the teams that qualify more time to prepare for the World Cup.</p><p>The 12 teams already qualified were seeded for the draw based on World Rugby's rankings as of Jan. 1, 2020 &amp; - in deference to the COVID-caused havoc on the international schedule &amp; - and placed in the first three four-country pots. Americas 1 was in pot 4 and Americas 2 in pot 5.</p><p>World Rugby has said in the future, seedings used for the draw will come much closer to the tournament itself.</p><p>Due to the pandemic, the Canadians have not played since their final outing at the 2019 World Cup &amp; - a 66-7 loss to South Africa on Oct. 8.</p><p>In the past, Americas qualifying has pitted Canada against the U.S. with the winner securing a World Cup berth and the loser facing a South American team for the second direct berth. The loser of that match has previously had a third shot via a last-chance repechage tournament.</p><p>Before the 2019 event, Canada had always secured its Americas berth at the first stage of qualifying.</p><p>But last time out, the Canadians lost qualifying series to the U.S. and Uruguay before winning the repechage tournament that also featured Germany, Hong Kong and Kenya.</p><p>The loss to the Americans cost Mark Anscombe his job as Canada coach in August 2017, with Jones taking over.</p><p>Monday's draw was held in a largely empty Palais Brongniart, with French president Emmanuel Macron, wearing a mask, delivered welcoming words while physically distanced from the draw host.</p><p>World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont delivered his message remotely.</p><p>\"Rugby World Cup 2023 will be great for rugby, but not only for rugby.

Both have been placed in the draw's fourth pot along with Europe 1 and 2.</p><p>\"Americas 1, Americas 2, we've got to find out which one of those slots we'll be. But it will be very interesting to see,\" Jones said.</p><p>Chances are both will have some tough company. An Americas qualifier could land with three teams currently ranked in the top seven in the world.</p><p>The 12 teams already qualified, by virtue of finishing in the top three of their pools at the 2019 tournament, are defending champions South Africa, as well as New Zealand, England, Wales, Ireland, France, Australia, Japan, Scotland, Argentina, Fiji and Italy. </p><p>Eight more countries will join them via regional qualifiers.</p><p>The 12 already in have been seeded based on World Rugby's rankings as of Jan. 1, 2020 \u2014 in deference to the COVID-caused havoc on the international schedule \u2014 and placed in the first three four-country pots.</p><p>The final pot consists of Africa 1, Oceania 1, Asia/Pacific 1 and the repechage qualifier winner.</p><p>There has been movement up and down the rankings since January, although Canada has been grounded by the pandemic.</p><p>For example, Wales currently stands ninth but finds itself in the top pot while No. 10 Japan is in Pot 2. No. 7 Scotland and No. 8 Argentina, which recently scored a first-ever win over the third-ranked All Blacks, are in Pot 3.</p><p>\"I'm not sure whether being Americas 1 or 2 is going to be that much different, on form, by the time we get to 2023,\" said Jones.</p><p>Due to the pandemic, the 23rd-ranked Canadian men have not played since their final outing at the 2019 World Cup in Japan \u2014 a 66-7 loss to South Africa. Canada's final match in the tournament was called off due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The Canadian men (0-3-0) finished fourth in their group behind New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia.</p><p>Canada's qualifying will finish by October or November 2022.</p><p>In the past, Americas qualifying has pitted Canada against the U.S. with the winner securing a World Cup berth and the loser facing a South American team for the second direct berth. The loser of that match has previously had a third shot via a last-chance repechage tournament.</p><p>Before the 2019 event, Canada had always secured its Americas berth at the first stage of qualifying. </p><p>But last time out, the Canadians lost the qualifying series to the U.S. and Uruguay before winning the last-chance repechage tournament that also featured Germany, Hong Kong and Kenya.</p><p>The loss to the Americans cost Mark Anscombe his job as Canada coach in August 2017, with Jones taking over.</p><p>Qualifying for 2023 has seen various permutations in the region. Canadian officials had been led to believe it would involve results in the Americas Rugby Championship \u2014 which involves Canada, the U.S, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and an Argentina reserve side \u2014 over the next two years.</p><p>The latest qualifying map in the region has the Rugby Americas North 2021 champion facing the Sudamerica Rugby 2021 titleholder in the two-legged Americas 1 Playoff. The winner becomes Americas 1 while the loser heads to the Americas 2 Playoff.</p><p>The runners-up from the Rugby Americas and Sudamerica tournaments will meet in the two-legged Americas 2 Qualifier with the victor facing off against the Americas 1 Playoff loser in the two-legged Americas 2 Playoff. The winner becomes Americas 2 in the World Cup field while the loser heads to the final world qualification tournament.</p><p>Whatever the format, the Canadians will face competition from the 16th-ranked Americans and No. 18 Uruguay, with No. 26 Brazil and No. 29 Chile looking to get into the mix.</p><p>The Canadian men have made every World Cup field since the tournament debuted in 1987. But the team has only got out of the preliminary round once, in 1991 when it lost 29-13 to New Zealand in the quarterfinals.</p><p>The Canadians are coming off a high-performance camp last month, carried out under pandemic protocols in Langford B.C.</p><p>\"It was a huge success,\" said Jones, who brought in some 36 players. \"We had no dramas \u2026 There was a lot of planning in everything we did, from meal arrangements to training environment.\" </p><p>\"The planning paid off and it went seamlessly,\" he added.</p><p>Two scrimmages went without injury. The roster was largely domestic-based due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, with Jones estimating another dozen elite Canadian players are spread around the globe.</p><p>\"It was such an invaluable thing for us to be able to have time with the players for the first time in a year,\" said Jones.</p><p>The camp also marked the first opportunity for new senior assistant coach Rob Howley, a former Wales coach and scrum half, to work with the Canadian players in person.</p><p>\"It was fabulous,\" said Jones. \"I think the players really enjoyed it. A new voice, obviously a very experienced voice \u2026 He's gone home (to Wales) really excited by what he saw.\"</p><p>Jones likely won't get his player back together until the test window in July, which could include a rare match with England.

On Friday morning, organisers said they would cancel Saturday's entire programme at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, pushing qualifiers to the following day.\"The FIA (governing body) and Formula One support this decision in the interest of safety of the spectators, competitors and everyone at the Suzuka circuit,\" an FIA statement said.The decision means the teams and drivers will have just Friday's two practice sessions in which to prepare for Sunday morning's qualifying session. </p><p>And the mega-storm has also forced Rugby World Cup organisers to cancel two Saturday fixtures: England-France in Yokohama outside Tokyo, and New Zealand-Italy in Toyota City.The organisers said it had been a \"very difficult decision\", but Italy, who still had a mathematical chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals, were livid.Captain Sergio Parisse fumed that the game would have been played if the All Blacks had needed the points, though New Zealand denied any preferential treatment.The storm could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday.Scotland need to beat the hosts in Yokohama on Sunday to have a chance of reaching the quarter-finals. But if the match is cancelled they will be going home.Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed potential damage to the venue and transport links.- Officials on alert -Japanese officials said they were on alert, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordering officials to \"take every possible measure to ensure people's safety\", Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. The storm is expected to cause transport chaos over a holiday weekend in Japan, with many forced to cancel travel plans.Japan's two main airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, cancelled hundreds of domestic flights.And the operator of the main bullet train service linking Tokyo and western cities said it would suspend all services between the capital and Nagoya on Saturday.A major overground train company in the capital also said it would gradually halt operations from early morning and other cancellations were expected.Japan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.Hagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba, east of the capital.More than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.Local officials equipped with satellite phones will be dispatched across the region to ensure communities can seek help during and after the storm. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031570774001057251763700177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7T-BNJ1-F03R-N4YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><timeReceived>6:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Government figures from Sunday night were lower, though updates were expected on Monday. While Hagibis, one of the most powerful storms to hit the Tokyo area in decades, packed wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres per hours (134 miles per hour), it was the heavy rains that caused most damage, with 21 rivers bursting their banks.In central Nagano, a levee breach sent water from the Chikuma river gushing into residential neighbourhoods, flooding homes up to the second floor.Military and fire department helicopters winched survivors from roofs and balconies in several locations, but in Fukushima one operation went tragically awry when a woman died after falling while being rescued.- 'Saving lives top priority' -Elsewhere, rescuers used boats during an hours-long operation to retrieve hundreds of people trapped in a retirement home in Kawagoe, northwest of Tokyo, when floodwaters inundated the building.One elderly woman wearing an orange life vest was carried from a boat on the back of a rescuer. </p><p>Others were hoisted into wheelchairs and pushed along a muddy shore after arriving by boat. Rescue efforts were continuing on Monday morning, with local television showing soldiers rowing a rubber rescue dingy through floodwaters in Fukushima, while elsewhere workers removed dirt with a digger.The death toll mounted throughout the day Sunday as bodies were recovered from flooded homes and cars, buildings caught in landslides, and swollen rivers.The dead included a municipal worker whose car was overcome by floodwaters and at least five Chinese crew members aboard a boat that sank in Tokyo Bay on Saturday night. \"Twelve crew were on board. Five Chinese have been found dead,\" a coastguard official told AFP.He said four other crew, from China, Myanmar and Vietnam, had been rescued and search operations resumed at daybreak for the remaining three members.\"We plan to dispatch 11 boats, two helicopters and a dozen divers to the site. We are trying our best,\" he added.- Japan dedicates rugby win to victims -On Monday morning, some 57,500 households remained without power, with 120,000 experiencing water outages. The disaster left tens of thousands of people in shelters, with many unsure when they would be able to return home.\"Everything from my house was washed away before my eyes, I wasn't sure if it was a dream or real,\" a woman in Nagoya told national broadcaster NHK.\"I feel lucky I'm still alive.\"The storm brought travel chaos over the holiday weekend, grounding flights and halting commuter and bullet train services.By Monday, most subway trains had resumed service, along with many bullet train lines, and flights had also restarted. The storm also brought havoc to the sporting world, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of three Rugby World Cup matches.But a crucial decider pitting Japan against Scotland went ahead, with the hosts dedicating their win to the victims of the disaster.\"To everyone that's suffering from the typhoon, this game was for you guys,\" said Japan captain Michael Leitch. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031571018754803251764500074</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8C-WJK1-JCMN-Y29C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><timeReceived>2:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

AIR Worldwide is a Verisk business.</p><p>According to AIR, Typhoon Hagibis made landfall with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of about 145 km/h (90 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane, on the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday, October 12, near Shizuoka on the Izu Peninsula. The storm delivered high winds and record-breaking precipitation to a large portion of Honshu from Mie Prefecture in the west to Iwate in the north. Storm surge raised sea levels by more than 1 meter above mean sea level along parts of the coast. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its Level 5, or highest level, special warning for heavy rain; unprecedented rainfall followed. A wide swath of Honshu just outside the Tokyo metro area received between 250 mm and 500+ mm (10 and 20+ inches) of rain; the resort town of Hakone, where 939.5 mm (37 inches) of precipitation was recorded, broke the calendar-day rainfall record for all of Japan. Hakone's rainfall represents the second-heaviest 24-hour rainfall ever recorded in Japan--25 inches (635 mm) of the 37 inches fell in just 12 hours. Many regions received between 30% and 40% of their yearly rainfall in just two days, with more than 100 stations breaking daily rainfall records at those locations. As a result of the large swath of unprecedented rainfall in Honshu, numerous rivers--the Abukuma, Arakawa, Chikuma, Kuji, Naka, Shinano, Tone, and Watarase rivers among them--experienced severe and devastating flooding.</p><p>According to AIR, of the ~540 river gauging stations on Honshu island, more than 85 exceeded their 100-year return period peak flows, with more than 100 exceeding their historical records. In addition, shortly before Hagibis made landfall, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the region--parts of which were in the early stages of recovery from Typhoon Faxai, which struck just one month prior. Much of central and eastern Japan experienced severe flooding and landslides; power outages and travel disruption were widespread.</p><p>Because of the intense rainfall within a short time period, much of the floodwater has a high mud content and includes a large amount of debris; this could potentially increase the costs of repair and cleanup and drive up business interruption losses--especially for commercial and industrial properties. In addition, Hagibis impacted some of the same region damaged by Typhoon Faxai a few weeks earlier. Additional damage caused by Hagibis to properties that were damaged by Faxai but were not repaired would further complicate claims settlements.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates include:</p><p>* Insured damage to property (residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural/mutual), structures and their contents, as well as extra expenses and debris removal, and automobile from wind, storm surge, and inland flood.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates do not include:</p><p>* Landslide</p><p>* Losses from tornado or earthquake</p><p>* Losses to land</p><p>* Losses to infrastructure</p><p>* Losses to CAR/EAR, marine hull, or marine cargo lines of business</p><p>* Business interruption losses</p><p>* Loss adjustment expenses</p><p>* Demand surge--the increase in costs of materials, services, and labor due to increased demand following a catastrophic event; demand surge can be applied by AIR software users who want to account for this variable</p><p>About AIR Worldwide AIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.

The expected rainfall, in particular, has raised fears, with the JMA warning that high tides ahead of a full moon increase the risk of flooding. It has issued warnings for strong wind, high waves, landslides and serious flooding for large areas of Honshu.Non-compulsory evacuation orders have been issued to some 600,000 people in eastern Japan already, according to public broadcaster NHK.- Power outages - With the centre of the storm still hundreds of kilometres away in the Pacific, torrential rain was falling and tornado-like gusts of wind ripped into several homes in Chiba, east of the capital, destroying one.Five people were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.The JMA has forecast half a metre (nearly 20 inches) of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region.Television footage showed gigantic waves smashing into coastal breakwaters and residents living near a river in Tokyo piling up sandbags in front of their houses.Others have nailed wooden boards to the frames of windows. </p><p>By 9:00am local time (0000GMT) 11,600 households in Chiba had already lost power. The region was badly hit by another powerful typhoon in September. Automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.- Rugby, F1 disrupted -The storm has also thrown two major sporting events into disarray, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and forcing the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.The storm could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links. Scotland face elimination if the game is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \"disappointing\".The storm is also causing transport chaos over a long weekend in Japan.Japanese airlines have cancelled more than 1,660 domestic flights and some 260 international flights on Saturday, NHK said.Many bullet train lines from the capital will be suspended, along with both overground and some subway lines serving the Tokyo area.The storm will even force the first-ever all-day typhoon closure of Tokyo's Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks, with doors shut from Saturday until at least noon on Sunday. Japan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.Hagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba.More than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031570845947941251762900045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X80-6PV1-F03R-N3NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><timeReceived>2:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

He was sent to hospital but confirmed dead,\" Hiroki Yashiro, a spokesman at Ichihara Fire Department, in Chiba, told AFP.Hours of torrential rain prompted the JMA to issue their top-level emergency warning for heavy rain for parts of Tokyo and surrounding areas, issued only when disasters are expected. Hagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated \"very strong\" to hit the main island of Honshu since 1991, when the category system was introduced, a JMA official said.By mid-afternoon, 3.25 million people were under non-mandatory evacuation orders, and more than 13,500 people had moved to shelters, including some whose homes were damaged by a powerful typhoon that hit the region last month.\"I evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. </p><p>I'm so worried about my house,\" a 93-year-old man told national broadcaster NHK as he sheltered at a centre in Tateyama in Chiba east of Tokyo.Hagibis is an unusually large storm, expected to bring \"brutal winds and violent seas\" to large swathes of the country, the weather agency said.- Power outages - With the centre of the storm still hundreds of kilometres away in the Pacific, torrential rain was falling and tornado-like gusts of wind ripped into several homes in Chiba, destroying one.Five people including a three-year-old boy were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.In Gotemba, west of Tokyo, the fire department said it had rescued one man who fell into a swollen canal but was still searching for a second.The JMA has forecast half a metre of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region, but many rivers were close to breaching their banks by Saturday afternoon.Local authorities warned they would release water from the Shiroyama dam, southwest of Tokyo, possibly starting at 5pm, warning people living near downstream to be on alert. Thousands of homes in Tokyo and the surrounding areas lost power, though in some cases only briefly, with crews working to reconnect people as quickly as possible.Automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have shut down their factories, and many supermarkets and convenience stores in the capital closed, a day after residents shopping for typhoon supplies emptied the shelves.- Rugby, F1 disrupted -The storm has forced the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers scheduled for Saturday and the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches: England-France and New Zealand-Italy.It could also jeopardise a key match-up between Scotland and Japan on Sunday. Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that game until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links. Scotland face elimination if the match is axed and have warned they could take legal action if the game is cancelled. World Rugby called the threat \"disappointing\".The storm is also causing transport chaos over a long weekend in Japan.By early afternoon, all departing flights from Tokyo's Haneda and Narita airports were grounded, with bullet trains and local trains halting some or all services.Even Tokyo's Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks shut up shop in their first ever all-day typhoon closure.Japan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.Hagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after Typhoon Faxai hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031570867574774251762500117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X81-BV41-JCMN-Y4CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><timeReceived>8:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

(\"Watford\" or the \"Company\") reported a net loss of $16.9 million, after $1.2 million of preference dividends, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $95.3 million, after payment of $4.9 million of preference dividends, in the same period in 2018. Book value per diluted common share was $43.49 at December 31, 2019, an increase of 10.9% from December 31, 2018. The quarterly results included:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Net loss available to common shareholders of $16.9 million, or $(0.79) per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $95.3 million, or $(4.20) per diluted common share, for the 2018 fourth quarter;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Combined ratio of 128.3%, comprised of a 100.9% loss ratio, a 22.3% acquisition expense ratio and a 5.1% general and administrative expense ratio, compared to a combined ratio of 115.4% for the prior year fourth quarter, comprised of a 87.9% loss ratio, a 23.4% acquisition expense ratio and a 4.1% general and administrative expense ratio;</p><p>* Net interest income of $29.8 million, a 1.4% yield on average net assets, for the 2019 fourth quarter, compared to net interest income of $30.0 million and a 1.5% yield on average net assets for the 2018 fourth quarter;</p><p>* Net investment income of $32.1 million, a 1.5% return on average net assets, for the 2019 fourth quarter, compared to a net investment loss of $61.1 million and a (3.0)% return on average net assets for the 2018 fourth quarter;</p><p>* The Company repurchased 2,789,405 common shares at an average price of $26.89 per share, fully utilizing the Company's previously announced $75 million share repurchase program.</p><p>* In addition, the Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding common shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.</p><p>Commenting on the 2019 fourth quarter financial results, John Rathgeber, CEO of Watford, said:</p><p>\"As reported in our press release of January 28, 2020, our results for the 2019 fourth quarter were negatively impacted by prior year loss reserve strengthening of $24 million and current accident year loss reserve strengthening of approximately $4 million. The reserve increase primarily relates to two large casualty reinsurance contracts, one of which is in run-off, and one of which has been renewed at progressively smaller participations over the past several years.</p><p>While painful in the short term, this was the prudent and responsible course of action based on the level of ceding company reported losses compared to actuarial projections. Our response to the data was decisive and we feel confident about the overall level of our net loss reserves, which stand at $1.1 billion.</p><p>Our investment income was quite strong, both for the quarter and the year. The net investment income return on net invested assets was 1.5% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 6.0% for the full year. The ratio of net invested assets to equity was 2.5:1 as of December 31, 2019, which points to the return on equity potential of the business going forward.</p><p>We fully utilized our $75 million share repurchase program during the 2019 fourth quarter. The Board has authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $50 million. The exact timing and magnitude of further share repurchases is dependent on a number of factors, but will likely be deployed at a slower pace than our prior program in order to pursue opportunities in an improving insurance market.</p><p>Our ultimate objective is to steadily grow book value per share over time. By this measure, we are pleased to report 3.4% quarterly growth in book value per diluted common share, which stands at $43.49 as of December 31, 2019. For the 2019 full year, the increase in book value per diluted common share was 10.9%.</p><p>As we enter the new year, we are optimistic about the prospects for further book value growth due to the overall positive insurance rate environment, the composition of our in-force insurance and reinsurance portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet, the earnings power of our fixed-income investment portfolio, and the potential material accretive benefit of our new share repurchase program.\"</p><p>Underwriting</p><p>The following table summarizes the Company's underwriting results on a consolidated basis: //st</p><p>Three Months Ended December 31,</p><p>Year Ended December 31,</p><p>2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change</p><p>($ in thousands) Gross $ 156,254 $ 160,937 (2.9 )% $ 754,881 $ 735,015 2.7 % premiums written Net premiums 112,353 132,360 (15.1 )% 532,862 604,175 (11.8 )% written Net premiums 133,446 146,973 (9.2 )% 556,690 578,862 (3.8 )% earned Underwriting (37,819 ) (22,660 ) (66.9 )% (54,076 ) (25,840 ) (109.3 )% income (loss) (1) % Point % Point Change Change Loss ratio 100.9 % 87.9 % 13.0 % 81.4 % 76.2 % 5.2 % Acquisition 22.3 % 23.4 % (1.1 )% 22.8 % 24.4 % (1.6 )% expense ratio General &amp; 5.1 % 4.1 % 1.0 % 5.5 % 3.9 % 1.6 % administrative expense ratio Combined ratio 128.3 % 115.4 % 12.9 % 109.7 % 104.5 % 5.2 % Adjusted 126.4 % 114.2 % 12.2 % 107.3 % 103.3 % 4.0 % combined ratio (2)</p><p>(1) Underwriting income (loss) is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is calculated as net premiums earned, less loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses.

The decrease in premiums reflected a reduction in reinsurance premiums, offset in part by an increase of new and renewal business bound in insurance programs and coinsurance in the 2019 fourth quarter.</p><p>Net premiums earned in the 2019 fourth quarter were 9.2% lower than the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease in premiums reflected prior period reduced participations in casualty reinsurance and other specialty reinsurance, offset in part by increased writings in insurance programs and coinsurance.</p><p>The loss ratio was 100.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter compared to 87.9% in the 2018 fourth quarter. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we experienced $5.0 million in catastrophe losses, primarily due to Typhoon Hagibis in Japan. The increase in the loss ratio reflects 18.1 points of prior year and 2.9 points of current year loss reserve strengthening, primarily in the casualty reinsurance line of business. Casualty reinsurance prior year loss reserves were strengthened by $24.0 million, primarily due to a higher than anticipated level of reported losses on one professional lines quota share treaty program and one non-renewed multi-line quota share treaty.

Top of his immediate priorities will be ensuring a huge scandal in the English Premiership doesn't spill over into the international squad. Saracens players will make up at least a third of England's starting team during the Six Nations while the north London club reels from a salary-cap saga that will see it relegated from the country's top division at the end of this season. Players from rival teams might harbour some resentment and ill-feeling toward their Saracens counterparts, which could affect the atmosphere in the England squad when they link up for international duty, so Jones is planning clear-the-air talks over a beer before the tournament. \"If players are angry about it, then say it, get it out,\" Jones says. </p><p>\"We've got players from potentially 12 different clubs. That's 12 different ideas of what's right and what's wrong.\" Also not helping matters is the broken arm suffered by Billy Vunipola that has ruled out the powerful No. 8 from the whole Six Nations. Jones didn't select a genuine No. 8 in his 34-man squad, so the back row that was so effective at the World Cup will be reshuffled. There are eight uncapped players, with back-rower Ben Earl the most likely to be the first getting into the 23. England has a tough start, with away matches against France and Scotland followed by home games against Ireland and Wales, but is the team to beat after reaching the World Cup final less than three months ago.</p><p>NEW FACE: Jacob Umaga. His father played for Samoa and his uncle was a captain of the All Blacks. So what is Jacob Umaga doing in the England squad? Well, he was actually born here, after his parents moved to England in 1995 so that father Mike could play rugby league for Halifax in the north of the country. Jacob's heritage suggested he'd always become a rugby player and he was at the Leicester Tigers academy before joining Wasps in 2016. Having played for England Under-18s and Under-20s, he made his English Premiership debut this season and, after just four starts, is in the senior national squad as the third-choice flyhalf behind Owen Farrell and George Ford. The 21-year-old Umaga is a goalkicker who is also comfortable at centre and fullback, so offers Eddie Jones the kind of versatility which makes him an option on the bench. Because, except for injuries, he is unlikely to be getting ahead of Farrell or Ford anytime soon despite his famous surname.</p><p>QUOTE: \"My aim is to make England the greatest rugby team the world has ever seen. That's my mindset.\" England coach Eddie Jones.</p><p>ODDS: 4-5</p><p>- By Steve Douglas</p><p>FRANCE</p><p>COACH: Fabien Galthie</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 4th</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2002, '04, '06, '07, '10</p><p>OUTLOOK: The general view was that Fabien Galthi\u00e9 was pulling the strings behind the scenes during the Rugby World Cup before officially replacing the ineffective Jacques Brunel after the tournament. Working in Brunel's shadow, Galthi\u00e9 was widely credited with improving the flagging fitness, lack of sharpness, and low confidence in the side. Now the former standout scrumhalf - he won 64 test caps with Les Tricolors - has a chance to stamp his identity on a team which looks to be on the way up following years of misery under Brunel and predecessors Guy Noves and Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9. Galthie's clearly looking long-term because he's selected seven uncapped players in his squad of 28. Just four players have 30 test caps or more, and only centre Ga\u00ebl Fickou has 50. Several thirtysomethings have been shown the exit, and some a little harshly such as fullback Maxime M\u00e9dard, winger Yoann Huget and flyhalf Camille Lopez, who were among France's best players in the World Cup quarterfinal loss to Wales. No. 8 Louis Picamoles and captain Guilhem Guiardo retired, leaving Galthi\u00e9 to shape his side around 20-year-old flyhalf Romain Ntamack, a rising star who impressed at times during the World Cup with some slick passing, tactical maturity and cool penalty kicking. Galthi\u00e9 has shown he is ready to take risks, naming the relatively inexperienced back-rower Charles Ollivon as his new captain, despite the fact he has only 11 caps. He made made new additions to the backroom staff, too, with former hooker Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez the general manager and Shaun Edwards the defence coach adding steel and experience. Galthi\u00e9's approach is a refreshing change from the diehard conservatism shown by Brunel and, at times, Noves. Now it's down to the players to justify Galthi\u00e9's faith in them, although a first Six Nations title since the 2010 Grand Slam looks beyond them. They could not have a more demanding first match than Rugby World Cup runner-up England.</p><p>NEW FACE: Although Matthieu Jalibert has been capped, his international career lasted 30 minutes before he sustained a serious knee injury being tackled by Ireland's Bundee Aki. That was in 2018 and, after almost one year without playing, the 21-year-old flyhalf is keen to make up for lost time. Only one problem: He's competing for a starting place with another slick young gun in Ntamack. It's a nice dilemma to have for new coach Fabien Galthi\u00e9, who has been impressed with Jalibert's performances this season for Union Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles, the leader of France's Top 14. Jalibert has shone with the precision of his kicking game. In a recent win against Pau he set up two tries for winger Santiago Cordero with different types of kicks.</p><p>QUOTE: \"A successful championship is a championship that is won.\" France coach Fabien Galthi\u00e9.</p><p>ODDS: 6-1</p><p>- By Jerome Pugmire</p><p>IRELAND</p><p>COACH: Andy Farrell</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 3rd</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2009, '14, '15, '18</p><p>OUTLOOK: Second favourite looks right, thanks to a good schedule. Ireland start at home against Scotland and Wales, has two weeks to plot how to topple favourite England at Twickenham, then another two weeks to recover before welcoming Italy, followed by a finish against France in Paris. The same schedule earned Ireland the championship in 2014, ahead of England on points difference. That was Joe Schmidt's first Six Nations. With the trophy-laden Schmidt gone, former assistant Andy Farrell has been quick to make his mark. With a more relaxed attitude, he turned over a couple of available training days to the squad to rest before it jetted off to Portugal for a warm-weather training camp. The first-time head coach has also decided to name his match teams on Tuesdays, two days earlier than previously; he wants his players to have time to get their minds and the game plan right. His first squad is also radical, with 12 Rugby World Cup players out, and six newcomers in. However, the XV that opens against Scotland won't likely depart much from the World Cup. The pack could feature hooker Rob Herring and new No. 8 Caelan Doris. But the backline will be very familiar, pivoting around new captain Jonathan Sexton. The flyhalf has proved his leadership abilities at Leinster and has the squad's respect. The only question regards his durability: Sexton is recovering from tearing right knee ligaments nearly two month ago. In the absence of the injured Joey Carbery and excluded Jack Carty, Sexton's backup is expected to be the uncapped Billy Burns, a former England Under-20 standoff whose strength is clever kicks.</p><p>NEW FACE: Bigger doesn't mean better, but Caelan Doris has been making his size count this season. Likened to New Zealand captain Kieran Read, Doris has been pushing his 1.94-meter, 106-kilo frame around so impressively for Leinster that Ireland couldn't deny him. That's no surprise. He shone at the under-20s world championship in 2017 and captained Ireland in 2018. What also might not surprise is if he's the starting No. 8 against Scotland on the Six Nations opening weekend. The skills are all there. Doris has a willingness to carry, an ability to break the line, make meters with ball in hand, and offload with panache. Then there's a high successful tackle rate, turnovers won at the breakdown, and a lineout option. The competition in the squad is tough. There's incumbent CJ Stander and another new cap, Max Deegan, another Leinster product. Ireland doesn't have to worry about No. 8.</p><p>QUOTE: \"The key is to make sure we don't get too ahead of ourselves, we want to stand for something - we want to stand for what we said we would stand for.\" Ireland coach Andy Farrell.</p><p>ODDS: 4-1</p><p>- By Foster Niumata</p><p>ITALY</p><p>COACH: Franco Smith</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 6th</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: 4th 2007, '13</p><p>OUTLOOK: One win would make the campaign a success. Italy hasn't won in the championship since 2015 against Scotland. The last home win was in 2013. Conor O'Shea quit as coach after the Rugby World Cup without winning a Six Nations match. Franco Smith received the job on an interim basis in November. The Italian federation is continuing its coach search, but Smith wants to prove himself. The former Springboks inside back coached Treviso from 2007-13 before returning to the Cheetahs. When he left Italy in 2013 after more than a decade there, he hoped he could return when he was a better coach. He's a better coach and keen to take this chance. He's impressed by the calibre of players and their skillsets. He hopes in the limited time he has, to get them to be the best they can be, and that he can work with the club coaches. Smith and Sergio Parisse agreed the former captain will be available only for the last game, against England in Rome. It will be Parisse's swansong, his 19th season in an Italyjersey, but Smith says Parisse is not playing for a send-off but to contribute to a notable Italy performance. \"He deserves a send-off but its not a send-off game, it's a game where we hope he can still make a difference,\" Smith says. He adds they are moving on, looking for new leaders, and identified seven, including new captain Luca Bigi, the Treviso hooker.</p><p>NEW FACE: Danilo Fischetti would already be capped for Italy but for Typhoon Hagibis. Injuries and suspensions depleted Italy's stock of props at the Rugby World Cup in October, so Fischetti and Zebre teammate Giosue Zilocchi were summoned to Japan. Zilocchi already had two caps and was part of the World Cup training camp but Fischetti was uncapped and starting only his second season at Zebre. The duo were expected to appear in Italy's last pool match against New Zealand, but the biggest typhoon to hit Japan in 60 years arrived and the match was cancelled. The loosehead also went to Chicago in 2018 for a test against Ireland but didn't get in. Third time might be the charm for Fischetti in this championship after featuring for Italy in under-20 wins over Wales, Argentina, and Scotland. He turns 22 on Sunday.</p><p>QUOTE: \"We want to be the best version of ourselves.\" Italy coach Franco Smith.</p><p>ODDS: 500-1</p><p>- By Foster Niumata</p><p>SCOTLAND</p><p>COACH: Gregor Townsend</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 5th</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: 3rd 2001, '06, '13, '18</p><p>OUTLOOK: More realistic. The optimism that swirled around Murrayfield a year ago has evaporated. Glasgow and Edinburgh haven't reached the European Champions Cup quarterfinals, and there's no recent positive test results to believe in momentum: The Rugby World Cup ended in another pool stage exit to no surprise. Scotland isn't a title contender for the Six Nations like it believed it was a year ago. Instead, it'll be back to fighting with Italy to avoid the wooden spoon. That makes their third-round match in Rome one of the games of the tournament. The other could be the second-round visit by England, against which Scotland will try and lift the Calcutta Cup on a third straight occasion for the first time since 1972. Gregor Townsend is still in charge after the World Cup but seemingly no closer to fixing the team's defensive woes, and feeble mentality away from Murrayfield. They have conceded at least 10 tries in every tournament since 2014, and not beaten anybody on the road apart from Italy in 10 years. Not until those eternal problems are fixed will Scotland become a team to be truly feared. Following the international retirements of Greig Laidlaw and John Barclay and the decline of Stuart McInally at the World Cup, Stuart Hogg asked to be captain and proved he deserved it. Hogg is easily the team's most experienced player, and the first regular fullback-captain since Gavin Hastings. Six uncapped players made the squad, plus there were recalls for Edinburgh prop Rory Sutherland (last appeared in 2016), clubmate and centre Matt Scott (2017) and Worcester back-rower Cornell du Preez (2018). Centers Huw Jones and Rory Hutchinson are back after missing the World Cup but star flyhalf Finn Russell has been dropped for \"breaching team protocol.\" The Scots will have to hit the ground running, very fast: The campaign starts in Ireland, where they have won only once in 20 years.</p><p>NEW FACE: At 1.95 metres and 102 kilograms, Ratu Tagive looks a handful on the wing. But it took him until this season, at age 28, to prove it. Tagive was signed in late 2016 by Glasgow, then coached by Gregor Townsend, on the recommendation of scouts and former wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, as an injury replacement for Italy wing Leonardo Sarto. Tagive made his debut in February 2017. But a limited skillset, restrictions on foreign players, and a bad Achilles injury meant he's appeared only 10 times. At one point, he went almost two years between games. But he persevered. Born and raised in Sydney to parents of Fijian and African-American descent, Tagive played rugby league until he quit in 2012. He started playing rugby in 2014, a highlights video earning him trainings with the ACT Brumbies and Australia Sevens. Luck brought him to the attention of Glasgow, and he has been reacquainted with Townsend after qualifying for Scotland on residency. \"Ratu has worked really hard at his game,\" the national coach says.</p><p>QUOTE: \"At times when we've been beaten, we've beaten ourselves. We've coughed up ball cheaply, we've conceded two or three early tries and our game plan's kind of gone out the window. We've learned from that.\" Scotland captain Stuart Hogg.</p><p>ODDS: 25-1</p><p>- By Foster Niumata</p><p>WALES</p><p>COACH: Wayne Pivac</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 1st</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2005, '08, '12, '13, '19</p><p>OUTLOOK: The post-Warren Gatland era really gets going for Wales in this Six Nations, and new coach Wayne Pivac has a tough act to follow after the team's 12 years of remarkable success under his fellow New Zealander. Pivac takes over a side that is the reigning Six Nations champion, a Rugby World Cup semifinalist and one of the hardest international teams to beat. Throw in the fact that the players are used to a rigid, well-drilled game plan under Gatland, and it feels like things can only go downhill for Pivac, at least in the early stages of his tenure as he looks to implement his own style. Two positives for Pivac come in the shape of No. 8 Taulupe Faletau and scrumhalf Rhys Webb, who are back in the squad after injury and ineligibility led to them missing the World Cup in Japan. And then there is the familiar and comforting sight of Alun Wyn Jones, the 34-year-old warrior who remains as captain heading into his 14th Six Nations campaign. Pivac has mostly gone across the English border to bring in five uncapped players, the most exciting of which look to be winger Louis Rees-Zammit and big lock Will Rowlands.</p><p>NEW FACE: Louis Rees-Zammit. It was quite the few days for Louis Rees-Zammit. On Monday last week, the 18-year-old winger signed his first senior contract at Gloucester after a record-setting start to his professional career. Forty-eight hours later, he was getting called up by Wales for the Six Nations. \"I'm always a great believer that if you're good enough, you're old enough,\" says Wales coach Wayne Pivac, who adds: \"All the coaches know he has raw talent that you can't coach.\" That was made clear in April when, playing for Gloucester's reserve team against Bristol just a few months after leaving college, he ran back a restart for an 80-meter try. In his first full season in Gloucester's senior team, Rees-Zammit has 10 tries in 13 games, including becoming the youngest player to score a hat trick of tries in the English Premiership. He's a smooth, silky runner, with plenty of pace and power to go with it. He turns 19 the day after Wales plays Italy on the opening weekend. Don't bet against him having an international try to his name by then.</p><p>QUOTE: \"Last year's group won the championship.

It has urged people to take precautions to avoid potentially life-threatening danger.

And it has form against the two-time champion, after producing the so-called Miracle of Brighton to upset the Springboks in 2015.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scotland goes home.</p><p>Winger Kenki Fukuoka scored a try in the first half and touched down again three minutes after the break as Japan secured a four-try bonus point with almost half a game to play at a Yokohama stadium packed with 72,000 people almost entirely wearing red-and-white striped shirts.</p><p>The game that almost didn't happen because of Typhoon Hagibis then become a classic. Japan led 21-7 at halftime with three tries after conceding early when Scottish flyhalf Finn Russell strolled through some weak defence in the seventh minute.</p><p>It had barely restarted when Fukuoka stripped the ball from Chris Harris and ran away to extend the lead to 28-7.</p><p>That's when Scotland threw caution to the wind. Two tries in six minutes to front-rowers Willem Nel and Zander Fagerson narrowed the gap to seven points and set up a tension-filled last 25 minutes.</p><p>Both teams threw everything into attack and defended grimly. The Scots repelled 22 phases from Japan on the hour before a relieving penalty.</p><p>Three minutes from fulltime, Matsushima accidentally carried the ball back over his line, giving Scotland a five-yard scrum and a chance to equalize. But the Japanese defended their line, won back possession and wound down the clock.</p><p>___</p><p>8:45 p.m.</p><p>Japan is leading Scotland 21-7 in the last of the 40 pool games and is potentially 40 minutes away from reaching the quarterfinals for the first time.</p><p>Scotland needs a win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages and took an early lead when flyhalf Finn Russell beat two defenders in a solo run from close range and touched down near the posts.</p><p>Japan responded with three tries, using its speed to attack Scotland out wide</p><p>After opting against a penalty attempt within range, Yu Tamura didn't have the distance to land a long-range effort before Japan decided to go ball-in-hand to score.</p><p>From halfway, Japan spread the ball left to find both speedsters in space. Kenki Fukuoka almost got around his opposite but lost his footing in the tackle and somehow managed a one-handed offload on his inside to Kotaro Matsushima, who sprinted away to score.</p><p>A jinking run from Matsushima was the spark for Japan's second try, with prop Keita Inagaki diving over under the crossbar following a string of inside passes</p><p>Tamura missed another penalty attempt from near the right touchline but again it resulted in a try another minute later.</p><p>After a Scottish 22-meter restart, Japan spread the ball left, where Tim Lafaele grubbered a kick through for Fukuoka to grab one-handed and stumbled over to score.</p><p>Tamura converted from the sideline right on halftime.</p><p>___</p><p>7:45 p.m.</p><p>The game that caused so much angst for organizers has finally kicked off at the Rugby World Cup. Players from Japan and Scotland lined up on the field in Yokohama and, for a minute, the 72,000-strong crowd went silent.</p><p>That was to pay respects for the dead and injured from the ferocious typhoon which hit Japan overnight and which almost caused the last of the 40 pool-stage games to be cancelled.</p><p>Scotland needs to beat Japan to have a chance of progressing to the quarterfinals. Japan needs to avoid defeat to advance to the knockout stage for the first time.</p><p>___</p><p>7:40 p.m.</p><p>Canada's players have been helping locals to clean up the damage in the town of Kamaishi following the impact of Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>After Canada's final Rugby World Cup match against Namibia in Pool B was called off on safety grounds, the players and management took to the streets to help with the clean-up operation in Kamaishi - up north - following widespread damage.</p><p>\"In times like this there are a lot more important things than rugby and when we got here we saw people's houses absolutely destroyed, water (rising) up the walls,\" Canada flyhalf Peter Nelson said. \"We're just trying to our very small part and help them in any way we can.\"</p><p>Rugby World Cup organizers released video footage of Canada's players grabbing shovels and brooms to help sweep debris off the roads and from inside people's homes, as well as clearing away large chunks of soggy mud.</p><p>\"We felt for the people of Kamaishi,\" lock Josh Larsen said. \"About 15 of us came down, (we're) happy to help.\"</p><p>___</p><p>7:10 p.m.</p><p>Wales will play France in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals after labouring past Uruguay 35-13 to top Pool D.</p><p>The Welsh swept a pool for the first time since 1987.</p><p>Their victory left Australia to play England in another quarterfinal.</p><p>Coach Warren Gatland gave 11 Wales players their first starts in the tournament and said he'd consider them for the quarterfinals team if they impressed, but few impressed in a dominating display plagued by unforced errors.</p><p>In the face of Uruguay's scrambling, scrappy defence, Wales could score only four legitimate tries and received a penalty try.</p><p>Two more tries were ruled out on video review, and three others were bombed. Winger Hallam Amos had three ruled out, all of them his own fault.</p><p>The fumbling and bumbling meant Uruguay was in the match at halftime, trailing only 7-6. While the Teros never looked like winning, they managed to humble the Welsh by scoring their only try while down to 14 men.</p><p>___</p><p>6:10 p.m.</p><p>Wales was labouring to lead Uruguay 7-6 at halftime of their Pool D match in Kumamoto.</p><p>Wales is trying to top the pool to line up a quarterfinal against France and not England, and struggling to find separation from the Lelos.</p><p>Uruguay was putting up great defence right up to and over the offside line, but an almost brand new Wales side from that which overcame Fiji on Wednesday wasn't helping itself with unforced errors.</p><p>Wales dropped the ball frequently, and had two tries disallowed for a foot in touch and a forward pass.</p><p>Its only try came after sustained pressure inside the Uruguay 22, and after Uruguay conceded five penalties. Prop Nicky Smith burrowed over in the 17th minute after 14 phases and Leigh Halfpenny converted.</p><p>Uruguay replied with two Felipe Berchesi penalties to make Wales worried at the break.</p><p>___</p><p>4:45 p.m.</p><p>Tonga has beaten the United States 31-19 to avoid finishing last in Pool C, helped by a farewell try from retiring captain Siale Piutau.</p><p>Piutau scored Tonga's third try with just under 20 minutes to go. Fullback Telusa Veainu skipped in to dive on a chip through after the final gong to seal victory.</p><p>U.S. flanker Tony Lamborn's score up against the post with three minutes to go closed the gap to five points and made it interesting. Tonga went back down the other end and Veainu sealed it.</p><p>The Tongans leave Japan with a win and avoid a sixth straight loss at Rugby World Cups, which would have been a Tonga record.</p><p>The U.S. didn't avoid a 10th straight defeat, which equals its worst run at the Rugby World Cup.</p><p>Before kickoff, the U.S. and Tongan players stood in silence with heads bowed in a moment's silence for those affected by Typhoon Hagibis. The powerful typhoon ripped through parts of Japan's eastern Pacific coast on Saturday, bringing damaging winds, torrential rain and flooding, leaving at least 19 people dead and more than a dozen missing.</p><p>Tonga should have won by more in Osaka and left at least five tries out there at Hanazono Rugby Stadium, four of them missed in the first half.</p><p>They got four tries anyway through loosehead prop Sigfried Fisi'ihoi, centres Malietoa Hingano and Piutau, and fullback Veainu.</p><p>The U.S. led 12-7 at halftime through a quick double by replacement back Mike Te'o despite conceding twice as many meters as the Tongans and missing 31 tackles in the first 40.</p><p>___</p><p>3:40 p.m.</p><p>The United States leads Tonga 12-7 at halftime in Osaka as the Rugby World Cup returns after Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>Replacement back Mike Te'o scored two tries in four minutes for the Americans, who had been 7-0 down.</p><p>The players earlier stood in silence with heads bowed in a moment's silence for those affected by Typhoon Hagibis. The powerful typhoon ripped through parts of Japan's eastern Pacific coast on Saturday, leaving at least seven people dead and 15 missing.</p><p>Tonga loosehead prop Sigfried Fisi'ihoi rammed his way over for the lead for Tonga in the 17th minute at Hanazono Rugby Stadium.</p><p>Tonga should have had another four tries in the first half.</p><p>The Tongans wasted two breaks to within a couple of meters of the U.S. line by scrumhalf Sonatane Takulua. Fullback Telusa Veainu ruined a third chance inside the first 13 minutes when his pass went astray with a two-man overlap waiting to score.</p><p>Fisi'ihoi missed out on a second when he dropped the ball as he charged for the line just before halftime. U.S. scrumhalf Ruben De Haas was tackling him but he still should have held on.</p><p>The U.S. was slow to get going but struck twice in four minutes through Te'o, who was on the field as an injury replacement for captain Blaine Scully.</p><p>Teo's first was created by a one-hand offload from No. 8 Cam Dolan. He sped away and went round behind the posts. His second soon after came from a big overlap on the right and an over-the-top pass by fullback Mike Hooley.</p><p>Both teams are eliminated from contention at the World Cup and seeking their first win of the tournament.</p><p>___</p><p>2:55 p.m.</p><p>Ireland coach Joe Schmidt says Jordan Larmour's versatility sometimes works against him, but that he is very much in contention for a starting spot in next weekend's quarterfinal against either New Zealand or South Africa.</p><p>Larmour started at fullback in the 45-7 win over Samoa in their final Pool A match on Saturday, scoring one try and creating another for flyhalf Jonathan Sexton with a smart pass. His versatility was also on display earlier in the tournament, when he came on in the second half against Japan in a midfield role, and he can also play on the wing.</p><p>\"Jordan's putting his hand up and that's one thing we really like about him. He puts his hand up no matter where he ends up,\" Schmidt said. \"His flexibility and his enthusiasm ... he's irrepressible. The accuracy of his inside offload to Johnny for the try was top notch.\"</p><p>The only problem is: Where does he play?</p><p>Schmidt acknowledges it's a bit of a Catch 22 situation concerning the 22-year-old Larmour, who has 17 test caps.</p><p>\"He's a youngster who we try to have involved, we're just not sure where sometimes, and sometimes he is a little bit maverick and he wanders around because he's not quite sure which position he's playing in,\" Schmidt said. \"But part of that is probably our fault because we keep swapping him around. But we keep swapping him around because he's so versatile - and because his skill set and enthusiasm allow him to survive wherever we put him.\"</p><p>___</p><p>2:48 p.m.</p><p>The Rugby World Cup is underway again after Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The United States is playing Tonga in Osaka in the first of three games on Sunday to finish the pool stage.</p><p>An earlier game between Canada and Namibia was cancelled because of the effects of the typhoon in Kamaishi, up north, but the U.S.-Tonga, Wales-Uruguay and Japan-Scotland matches will go ahead after organizers carried out safety inspections on the stadiums and surrounding infrastructure in the morning.</p><p>The typhoon left at least seven dead and 15 missing and the U.S. and Tonga teams and crowd at Hanazono Rugby Stadium observed a moment's silence for those affected. Players lined up and bowed their heads and the crowd stood in silence.</p><p>Hagibis roared up the eastern coast of Japan and through the Tokyo region on Saturday, unleashing heavy rains and strong winds and causing flooding.</p><p>Two games were cancelled on Saturday, although one also went ahead: Ireland vs. Samoa in Fukuoka in southwestern Japan, which was unscathed by Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The U.S. vs. Tonga and Wales vs. Uruguay games aren't decisive for the quarterfinals but Japan vs. Scotland at Yokohama near Tokyo is. The tournament host is seeking to become the first Asian team to make the last eight of a Rugby World Cup.</p><p>___</p><p>1:10 p.m.</p><p>Ireland centre Bundee Aki will have a disciplinary hearing in Tokyo on Monday night and is in danger of missing the rest of the Rugby World Cup after his red card for a dangerous tackle against Samoa.</p><p>Players have received three-game bans for similar offences at this World Cup and that would mean Aki won't play again at the tournament.</p><p>The New Zealand-born Aki was red-carded in the first half of Saturday's final Pool A game for the Irish for hitting his shoulder into the head of Samoa flyhalf Ulupano Seuteni in a tackle. Ireland won 47-5 to confirm its place in the quarterfinals.</p><p>Aki started three of Ireland's four pool games. The only game he missed was the 19-12 upset by Japan, Ireland's only loss of the pool stage.</p><p>Ireland will play either defending champion New Zealand or South Africa in the quarterfinals.</p><p>___</p><p>12:45 p.m.</p><p>The three Rugby World Cup games going ahead on Sunday will hold a moment's silence for people affected by Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The powerful typhoon struck Japan on Saturday, causing extensive damage in eastern parts of the country, including the Tokyo region. It left at least seven people dead and 15 missing, authorities say, and caused the cancellation of three World Cup games over the weekend.</p><p>World Rugby says there will be a moment's silence at United States-Tonga in Osaka, Wales-Uruguay in Kumamoto, and Japan-Scotland in Yokohama.</p><p>The governing body says \"the reaction of the rugby family has been incredible with messages of support, solidarity and sympathy across social media.\"</p><p>World Rugby cancelled two games scheduled for Saturday ahead of the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis and called off a third game on Sunday morning because of the damage. The Namibia-Canada game in Kamaishi, on the northeastern coast, couldn't go ahead on Sunday because of flooding and landslides near the stadium.</p><p>Canada and Namibia were both hoping for a first win of this World Cup in their last game.</p><p>Canada coach Kingsley Jones said there was \"disappointment, but (we) understand the reasons.\"</p><p>The Kamaishi stadium was built on the site where two schools sat before they were washed away on March 11, 2011, when the town was devastated by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 1,000 people.</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>The Japan-Scotland match is a go.</p><p>World Rugby and Rugby World Cup organizers gave the decisive Pool A match the green light after checking Yokohama Stadium and transport infrastructure in the wake of the deadly Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The game is scheduled for 7:45 p.m. local time.</p><p>The winner will advance to the quarterfinals.

The cancellations are unprecedented in Rugby World Cup tournaments.</p><p>\"Our message to fans is to exercise due caution today as the country recovers from the storm and to keep monitoring official Rugby World Cup social and digital channels for further updates,\" World Rugby said in a statement.</p><p>Scotland needs a win over unbeaten Japan to have any chance of reaching the quarterfinals.

Another person was unaccounted for in Fukushima, farther north, which is still reeling from damage by Typhoon Hagibis earlier this month.</p><p>The death toll from the flooding included nine people in Chiba and one in Fukushima.</p><p>While rains and floodwaters subsided, parts of Chiba were still inundated. About 4,700 homes were out of running water and some train services were delayed or suspended.</p><p>In Midori district in Chiba, mudslides crushed three houses, killing three people who were buried underneath them. Another mudslide hit a house in nearby Ichihara city, killing a woman. In Nagara and Chonan towns, four people drowned when their vehicles were submerged.</p><p>\"There was enormous noise and impact, 'boom' like an earthquake, so I went outside. Then look what happened. I was terrified,\" said a Midori resident who lives near a crushed home. \"Rain was even more intense than the typhoons.\"</p><p>In Fukushima, a woman was found dead in a park in Soma city after a report that a car was washed away. A passenger was still missing.</p><p>Rain also washed out Friday's second round of the PGA Tour's first tournament held in Japan, the Zozo Championship in Inzai city. Saturday's second round allowed no spectators.</p><p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency task force meeting Saturday morning and called for \"the utmost effort in rescue and relief operations.\" He also urged quicks repairs of electricity, water and other essential services to help restore the lives of the disaster-hit residents.</p><p>The Prime Minister's Office said the average rainfall for the entire month had fallen in just half a day Friday.</p><p>The downpour came from a low-pressure system above Japan's main island of Honshu that moved northward later Friday. Power was restored Saturday at most of the 6,000 Chiba households that had lost electricity. About 390 people remained at shelters Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Typhoon Hagibis caused widespread flooding and left more than 80 people dead or presumed dead across Japan. An earlier typhoon in September had devastated Chiba, where more than 50,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and 100 others flooded. Friday's downpour flooded more than 150 homes and damaged several others.</p><p>Yoshiki Takeuchi, an office worker who lives in a riverside house in Chiba's Sodegaura city, said he had just finished temporary repairs to his roof after tiles were blown off by the September typhoon when Friday's rains hit hard.</p><p>\"I wasn't ready for another disaster like this.

And in Japan right now, that has moved rugby from the sidelines into the mainstream.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In many ways, Japan's victory over Scotland was for a nation, not just rugby,\" World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont said of Japan's progress into the World Cup quarterfinals at the end of a weekend when a destructive typhoon hit the tournament's host country and left dozens dead.</p><p>The first Rugby World Cup staged in Asia is being hailed as a success even before kickoff in the knockout rounds. The tournament is three weekends down, and three to go.</p><p>\"Never has a nation been so unified behind a (Rugby World Cup) tournament and never have we seen so many people greeting the teams at training sessions, hotels and public events,\" Beaumont said as he reviewed the 40-game group stage that began with Japan beating Russia in Tokyo on Sept. 20.</p><p>World Rugby said more than 1.8 million tickets had been sold across all 48 matches, with another 864,000 fans attending dedicated fan zones set up in the major cities.</p><p>Broadcast figures have also surpassed expectations with a live peak television audience in Japan of an estimated 50 million tuning in to local Japanese network NHK's broadcast of the hosts thrilling 28-21 victory over Scotland at Yokohama to secure Japan's first-ever quarterfinal place last Sunday night.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday and left devastation in parts of the country, and forced the first ever cancellation of games - two on Saturday, and one on Sunday - at rugby's showpiece event.</p><p>\"Our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with those who have been affected by Typhoon Hagibis,\" Beaumont said. \"We stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan.</p><p>\"We owe a huge debt of gratitude to our friends in the Japan 2019 organizing committee, in the host cities, match venues and the brilliant staff and volunteers working in the most difficult circumstances to make Sunday's matches happen for the teams and our remarkable fans, who have shown such understanding.\"</p><p>Despite the best efforts of local organizers to prepare the stadiums in the aftermath of the typhoon, the match between Canada and Namibia in the city of Kamaishi was cancelled at 6 a.m. local time on Sunday.</p><p>Encapsulating the spirit of the tournament and providing perhaps one of its most enduring images was the sight of both teams helping the local community with the clean-up effort. The Canadian players and support staff swept and shovelled debris on a day when they'd been expecting to finish off their tournament, hoping to give something back to the people who'd been hosting them along the way.</p><p>Baseball, soccer and sumo are sports that have the biggest following in Japan, although rugby has a long history in the country, a healthy domestic competition and seemingly a growing popularity.</p><p>\"The Japanese people are the heartbeat of the tournament and have welcomed the teams and fans with open arms,\" Beaumont said in a statement. \"From full and vibrant stadiums and fan zones, to record social media, the fans, teams and the people of Japan have shared truly unforgettable moments of friendship, celebration and hospitality.\"</p><p>___</p><p>More AP Rugby World Cup: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup\">https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\">https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-5f0e173e9f604c678c3946d2c90a39a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8N-D041-JBVR-33CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><timeReceived>01:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
