This World Cup has also been unlucky in that the typhoons have continued later into October than is normally the case.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, given the inherent risks in hosting the tournament at this time of year, and that World Rugby and the organising committee have had near on a decade to plan for this, their supposedly \"robust contingency plans\" appear to have consisted of saying another mass.</p><p>Relocating matches to other venues or deferring them for 24 or 48 hours are options which appear to have been ruled out entirely, on the basis that this would be logistically too difficult. Yet if any country on the planet could relocate or defer games it is surely Japan. </p><h>'Ridiculous' </h><p>To begin with, as Joe Schmidt highlighted, the first losers are Italy, for whom a game against the All Blacks might have been a last match in charge for coach Conor O'Shea, and ditto as captain for Sergio Parisse.</p><p>Parisse most likely spoke for many others when observing: \"It is difficult to know that we won't have the chance to play a match against one of the great teams. If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.</p><p>\"It is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn't like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn't news that typhoons hit Japan.</p><p>\"Sure everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team. We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team. The alternative is Plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.\"</p><p>Similarly, it could be argued that England may well have beaten France anyway before their Pool C decider was cancelled and declared a 0-0 draw. But not only is this also highly unsatisfactory, it has ramifications deep into the tournament. Eddie Jones quipped that the Typhoon Gods are smiling on him as he relocated his squad away from the eye of the storm back to the training base in the southern coastal island of Miyazaki. </p><p>However, it means that his players avoid the risk of injury this weekend and now have a 15-day gap between their final pool game against Argentina and a quarter-final, potentially against Australia.</p><p>Privately France will not feel too bothered either as they are also avoiding the risk of injuries against England while now having a 13-day turnaround before their quarter-final, most likely against Wales.</p><p>South Africa were already due a helpful 12-day turnaround between beating Canada and their quarter-final, while the All Blacks will now enjoy a free weekend and a 13-day build-up to their quarter-final.</p><p>Even all of this would be thoroughly eclipsed were Japan's Pool A finale in Yokohama on Sunday against Scotland to be cancelled, a decision which the organisers said will be made on the morning of the match after the full extent of the damage of Super Typhoon Hagibis is assessed.</p><p>Were this game to be cancelled, of course, it would ensure that Japan qualify as pool winners, and presuming Ireland pick up at least a bonus point against Samoa tomorrow, Scotland would be eliminated. This would also consign Ireland to a quarter-final against New Zealand on Saturday week even if they beat Samoa with a bonus point, as Japan would also finish on 16 points and have the better head-to-head record. </p><h>Incandescent </h><p>As with Parisse and the Italians, the Scots clearly believe that if the shoe had been on the other foot and Japan had needed a win to progress, every effort would have been made to afford the hosts an opportunity.</p><p>The Scotland camp is incandescent about the prospect of World Rugby not relocating or deferring the game. A Scottish Rugby spokesperson said: \"We are in regular dialogue with World Rugby at all levels to work to ensure our fixture against Japan on Sunday can be played as planned. Public safety is the clear priority.</p><p>\"With potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\"</p><p>Gregor Townsend had risked being hoist by his own petard when asked about the possibility of the Ireland-Samoa game being cancelled when Typhoon Hagibis was first forecast to hit Fukuoka at the weekend. \"Well, it it's cancelled, it's cancelled. The rules are the rules.\"</p><p>The Scottish head coach has now, understandably, changed his tune slightly, and at a hastily arranged press conference commented: \"We believe the game hasn't been cancelled because the weather forecast is much improved for Sunday.\"</p><p>Expressing the hope that an alternative venue could also be arranged, even if behind closed doors, Townsend added: \"What do we need? We need officials, we need players. The way I read the rules was that you can't change days but you could change venues and contingencies would be in place.</p><p>\"I've since been told there is force majeure (measures in the rules) and things can change because of exceptional circumstances. If that means Monday because it takes a day for things to be put back in order then who knows? But right now I think they're planning on it going ahead on Sunday.\"</p><p>Yet this World Cup has proved to be inflexible compared to almost all other major sporting events, despite the tournament director Alan Gilpin admitting that the vagaries of Japan's weather was \"a real hot topic for us\" - and that was September last year. That will seem laughable for the tens of thousands of fans who've booked expensive trips to take in this weekend and, in the event of their teams' games being cancelled, will only have their overpriced tickets refunded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4047110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7R-Y4S1-JC8Y-81WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The announcement denied the Azzurri any chance of claiming a place in the quarter-finals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crucial clash between hosts Japan and Scotland could still go ahead as planned on Sunday in Yokohama, but it will not be moved or put back a day, despite the outcome deciding qualification from Pool A. Tournament officials confirmed the four teams affected by the cancellations would be awarded two points each - with the games declared no-score draws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was confusion, anger and upheaval for teams, officials and supporters as news spread about this unheard-of disruption to a World Cup.</p><p>It is the first time in the 32-year history of the event that matches have been cancelled. Both Engthat land v France and New Zealand v Italy were due to take place on Saturday in Toyota, which lies right in the path of Hagibis. The typhoon is set to rage through central and eastern areas of Japan, with winds forecast to reach 160mph.</p><p>Scotland have every chance of defeating Japan and potentially denying the hosts a first quarterfinal place.</p><p>The Scottish Rugby Union demanded guidance from World Rugby about plans for their game in the event of damage to Yokohama Stadium and the surrounding area. There was speculation the fixture could be played behind closed doors if there are concerns about safety but organisers were adamant that if it doesn't go ahead as planned on Sunday, the match would be cancelled and deemed a 0-0 draw.</p><p>Head coach Gregor Townsend has urged that everything possible is done to to ensure it goes ahead.</p><p>'We believe the game hasn't been cancelled because the weather forecast is much improved for Sunday.</p><p>'It looks like the game will be played and that's what we have to keep faith with. (World Rugby) have made the call with a lot of certainty and a lot of confidence the game will go ahead on Sunday night.</p><p>'We have to have faith in the organisers that the game will be played even if it's behind closed doors or at a different venue.' New Zealand must wait to discover if they will face Ireland, Japan or Scotland in the last eight but their head coach Steve Hansen, unsurprisingly, backed the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds.</p><p>'Of course it is frustrating but we can't control the weather,' he said. 'Do we charge on and put people's lives at risk or do we make a decision to make sure people are safe? It's a no-brainer. There's a lot of sympathy for Italy but the right decision has been made.' No one expected Italy to topple world champions New Zealand and replace them in the quarterfinals, but they were incensed at being denied the chance to try.</p><p>Conor O'Shea, Italy's outgoing head coach, said: 'No one's mentioned the fact that we still had a chance to qualify.' England reacted to the dramatic developments by hurriedly vacating their hotel in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo. Eddie Jones and his squad flew south to the city of Miyazaki.</p><p>This was where the squad held a pre-tournament training camp and their head coach expressed satisfaction about having the chance to recharge and prepare for a likely quarter-final against Australia in Oita next Saturday.</p><p>'Someone is smiling on us - the typhoon Gods maybe,' he said. 'We are not concerned. We are excited. Who would have thought we would have two relatively easy games, one tough game and then two weeks to prepare for a quarter-final?' The former head coach of Japan added: 'I've been here for about 30 typhoons and there's a reason why everything shuts down when they come, because they can be very dangerous. This one is supposed to be a big typhoon, so I don't see any other option.' World Cup organisers insisted they had only very reluctantly decided to call off matches, in the interests of safety.</p><p>Officials were at pains to explain that there had been 'exhaustive' attempts made to implement contingency plans, that fans missing out on matches they had paid to see would receive refunds, and there were no regrets about bringing the event to the Far East. 'The last three weeks vindicates hosting a World Cup in Japan,' said tournament director Alan Gilpin.</p><p>Satellite images of the extreme weather event displayed at World Rugby's press conference on Thursday reveal it is the size of Japan and shows no sign of deviating in its path.</p><p>It dwarfs Typhoon Faxai which brought Tokyo to a standstill, leaving a million homes without power and killing three people.</p><p>SO, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? AS two World Cup matches are called off, Sportsmail answers the key questions...</p><p>their game is off, Scotland are out. Italy are out due to the cancellation of their game against New Zealand.</p><p>HOW BAD IS THE TYPHOON? SUPER TYPHOON HAGIBIS is expected to be the worst of the year with 160mph winds causing havoc in and around Tokyo over the weekend. It is the 19th storm of the season. The 15th, 'Faxai', killed three people and caused \u00a3400m of damage. Hagibis is about 1,000 miles wider and could bring 'freak waves' in the Pacific Ocean. Everyone in Tokyo, Toyota and affected areas has been told to stay inside this weekend.</p><p>WHY WERE MATCHES NOT MOVED? ORGANISERS said looked 'extensively' at shifting the games - possibly to Oita the southern island of Kyushu 750 miles from the capital - but the challenge was too great. Flights and trains may not run and the stadium in Yokohama holds 72,000, with the Oita one closer to 40,000.</p><p>WILL FANS BE REFUNDED? YES, for their ticket. But World Rugby not help them with hotel or transport costs - telling supporters to go to their travel insurers.</p><p>WHAT ABOUT SCOTLAND v JAPAN? THE intention is still to play it on Sunday in Yokohama when it is expected that the typhoon will have cleared. But there is no predicting the damage the storm will do, so the venue will be assessed on Sunday morning and a decision taken no later than six hours before kick-off.</p><p>WHAT HAVE THE TEAMS DONE? ENGLAND have left Tokyo and travelled to Miyazaki, where they had a pretournament training camp. France were south in Kumamoto and would have up to Tokyo for the match, but have to Oita instead where they will meet Wales, in all likelihood, a week on Sunday. Kiwis and Italy are near Toyota so will take shelter. Italy There are no plans for it to be postponed or moved.</p><p>HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE POOLS? IF a pool match is cancelled, rules state it will be a 0-0 draw with both teams</p><p>'Powerful storm is the size of Japan'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tournament of turbulence: World Cup officials outline the scale and path of Typhoon Hagibis above), which meant France and Yoann Huget (below) were on the move, while New Zealand coach Steve Hansen and captain Kieran Read faced the press (right) GETTY IMAGES s AGES</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-153746095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-MBK1-JCBW-N44B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFE3</classCode><className>SPORTS FANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The heartbreak turned into anger.</p><p>Parisse (right) momentarily snapped at a reporter who asked about his cap haul -'I don't care about records,' he said -and went on to criticise the governing body.</p><p>'We know there are typhoons in this part of the world so where is the plan B? 'I don't understand the decision. It's really wrong. It's not like it's 15 days of typhoons. It's one day. Why couldn't we play on Friday? Or Sunday? Or move?' Italy still had an chance of reaching the quarter-finals if they had beaten New Zealand.</p><p>'They think this game has no big influence,' added Parisse. 'Of course safety is the priority, but maybe they say: \"New Zealand versus Italy -eight million times New Zealand are gonna win\". Maybe one time in eight million that will be different but we don't have an opportunity to try. This is why we play.</p><p>'Some people are saying Italy should be happy to get a draw. That's bull. If England must win against France to qualify, would they say \"draw\" and send England back home? I don't think so. Ireland? No. New Zealand? No. I promise you that. When you realise it's maybe your last ever game or think how much effort you've made to be here, it's tough.' Younger players, who will probably get another chance in four years, gathered around the media session to hear what Parisse and Conor O'Shea had to say. The head coach paid a heartfelt tribute.</p><p>'What a way to finish,' said an impassioned O'Shea, his voice tremoring at times. 'We've been preparing for this since June 2.</p><p>Sacrificing family life for four months. For it to end like this -it's hard. It's difficult to speak about.</p><p>'I saw the reaction at the end of training and it was horrible. You've got guys who have given their lives to Italian rugby and they've finished on a training pitch in Toyota. Win or lose, these guys have always come back for more.</p><p>'One hundred per cent, these are the guys that kept Italian rugby alive. They went through all the pain and kept on coming back for more. They're unbelievable men and I find it really hard for them.' The question now is 'What next?' Italy are due to fly home on Monday but yesterday afternoon they had no idea whether they were meant to check out of their hotel.</p><p>In the longer term, Parisse has some thinking to do. He wants to return for a farewell Test in Rome during the Six Nations but, as Typhoon Hagibis has showed, anything can happen. 'I don't want to finish like this,' said Parisse, 36, who will be remembered as one of the great rugby players. 'I don't want to finish because some guys in a room make a decision. I don't want to say I finished my career because of a typhoon.</p><p>'I'm honest, I've given everything I can give to the Italianjersey over 17 years. Physically and mentally. I don't have the same physical energy as when I was 25 years old. When you see the young guys in this team, they deserve to play and take my place. . 'There was a big chance this would be my last game. I wanted to play with Leo and Ale. We grew up playing together. We played great rugby, average rugby and not-so-great rugby but we're all really proud. This was like the final for us. The last one.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-153746089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-MBK1-JCBW-N449-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Ireland may have avoided Typhoon Hagibis, but there are enough 'uncontrollables' out there to drive Schmidt mad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not just the very real prospect of the Japan v Scotland game being cancelled and thus removing the opportunity to top the group and earn an eight-day turnaround for a quarter-final against South Africa. There's also the state of the relaid Fukuoka pitch.</p><p>At their captain's run yesterday, Schmidt could be seen pointedly stamping on the surface in the middle of the pitch and calling over Ger Carmody and scrum coach Greg Feek, while a clip also emerged of Chris Farrell being able to lift some of the turf and place a rugby ball underneath it.</p><p>This has prompted World Rugby to release a statement in response to Irish media queries about this vexed subject.</p><p>\"We are confident in the integrity of the new Fukuoka pitch for Ireland v Samoa,\" it began. It also pointed to the significant wear caused by the France versus USA match after heavy rainfall caused by Typhoon 17. The primary driver was player welfare.</p><p>\"The tournament has dedicated nurseries where back-up turf is meticulously prepared in line with Rugby World Cup standards. While the look of the turf may not be perfect as would be expected with a very recent installation, we are confident that the pitch will perform superbly.\" </p><h>Fast underfoot </h><p>Clearly this confidence is not shared within the Irish camp. Criticised for the way it churned up during both the previous games at the venue, the Irish players said the pitch felt firm and fast underfoot, but it is in a poor state and with rain forecast the scrums could cause some serious damage. </p><p>Feek said: \"Well, you guys are pretty smart individuals, you would have seen the pitch yourselves. Obviously they told us and both teams know about it, we know they they had to relay the pitch. We went out there and just had an inspection and we have been given all the assurances by World Rugby that it's safe to play on and that's all we can ask for.</p><p>\"The referee will be aware of it, so that's the key. All the communication is there.\"</p><p>All of which adds to the feeling that Ireland will need another strong start, which is something they've managed to do thus far, leading Scotland by 19-3 after 25 minutes, Japan 12-3 by the 21st minute and Russia 14-0 after 14 minutes. As the match and the pitch wears on, it may become increasingly difficult to score. </p><p>Even if Ireland beat Samoa with a bonus point, anything less than a Scottish win in the group stage finale against Japan in Yokohama tomorrow would consign Ireland to a quarter-final against the All Blacks.</p><p>A cancellation due to the effects of Typhoon Hagibis, and an ensuing 0-0 draw, or an actual draw on the pitch would be enough for Japan to top Pool A. So Ireland would need a favour from their Celtic rivals if the game goes ahead. But that's looking unlikely.</p><p>Ireland are back in familiar territory in that they could do with a statement performance, in addition to the victory they require to nail down a quarter-final place.</p><p>After the back-to-back warm-up wins over Wales, which do not look all that bad now, and the emphatic nature of the 27-3 victory over Scotland, self-belief has been dented. As a test of the physicality that may well lie in wait, this could also be a useful source of preparation for the quarter-finals. The genuine fear within that is the possibility of Ireland emerging with some physical, as well as mental, damage. </p><p>The stakes have also been raised by the selection of what amounts to a first-choice Irish pack, as well as the record equalling Conor Murray-Johnny Sexton halfback partnership. They need to establish foundations akin to the display against Scotland for Ireland to carry real belief. </p><p>The same kind of set-piece security and ruthless efficiency in the Samoan territory would instil this Irish squad with the requisite self-confidence for a potential monumental quarter-final. It would be every bit as reassuring if Murray and Sexton also emerged in good form and health, while the return of Robbie Henshaw for his overdue first game of the tournament could be like a new signing. </p><p>Alongside Bundee Aki, whose Samoan heritage must make this a special game for him, a big-tackling, hard-carrying and dynamic performance from Henshaw would be a major boost for the entire squad.</p><p>And then there's Jordan Larmour. For all the negativity to date, all the outside backs have looked in prime nick, and in veering off the playbook and inventing that final try against Russia, Larmour showed what kind of attacking dimension he can bring to this team. With that pitch in mind, the feeling persists that this might be an ugly one, but these things are relative. The less ugly and physically damaging the better. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4048176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7Y-XD31-DYS1-005K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DHVB</classCode><className>SPORTS OFFICIATING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC601</classCode><className>SAMOA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

There's a sudden familiarity with it and sooner rather than later, travel agents will be promoting Hokkaido and Okinawa instead of Ibiza and Poznan. This fascination with all that is Japanese has nothing to do with the ancient tea ceremonies, Japanese literature or its imperial <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.history.No\">www.history.No</url>. \"It's the rugby, stupid.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan beat Ireland last month and despite setbacks, Ireland are still in the World Cup and will be playing the quarter-final today against New Zealand.</p><p>Meanwhile Typhoon Hagibis has struck and satellite images showed that it was larger than Japan itself. Torrential rain caused flooding throughout the country. In Toyko, the Sumida river overflowed and cars were submerged totally in some towns. The death toll tragically is around 80 but thousands are stranded, wet, cold, with no electricity and many with homes that have been washed away. But the Irish fans are still there and so our love affair with the Land of the Rising Sun shows no sign of abating.</p><p>Such natural disasters are called \"acts of God\" to distinguish them from man-made disasters like the Omagh bombings, the Bhopal gas leak, Chernobyl and others.</p><p>Research suggests that man-made disasters are more likely to disturb the human equilibrium and cause mental health problems than are naturally occurring events like earthquakes, mudslides and hurricanes. This is surprising since the unpredictability of natural disasters and the sense of helplessness against the elements could lead to an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness and helplessness. On the other hand, man-made disasters at least have a known cause and perhaps there is some hope that such catastrophes can be prevented. So the reality that natural disasters are more traumatic is counter-intuitive.</p><p>Yet the needs of communities trying to cope are broadly similar. These mainly include getting accurate information about what is happening, receiving practical assistance such as food supplies, medicines, clothes and being kept warm. And safety is a priority whether it be from radioactive emissions or a violent tornado.</p><p>Repeated studies show that reaching out for general support from others can be a major factor in responding positively, and being allowed, and able, to help others when we have been brought to safety also assists emotionally. If people are displaced, these newly formed connections will help build a new social bond.</p><p>Myriad psychiatrists or counsellors on site are of little or no assistance in the acute phase, although in the later stages, after the initial shock wears off, their availability for those who need help is important. For individuals, having a daily routine in an ongoing disaster, such as a typhoon, helps bring order to chaos.</p><p>But humans are resilient and, contrary to popular opinion, most do not develop post-traumatic stress disorder. However, for some there is trauma after the storm. While more than 70pc are resilient and do not need any mental health assistance, what about the remaining 30pc? There is now firm evidence that providing for the financial needs of those affected by natural disasters reduces the frequency of mental health problems significantly. For this reason, economists have an interest in natural disasters and the factors that ameliorate the impact of \"acts of God\". Confronted with a major disaster the question can properly be asked: \"How could a God, that brings us the beauty of nature, cause humans to suffer as a consequence of nature?\" Philosophers and theologians struggle to provide a convincing answer. And this is where God and economics connect. If money is one factor that affects the struggle of victims of natural disasters, what other factors play a role, positive or negative? A recent study by Jeanet Bentzen, from the University of Copenhagen, was published in 'The Economic Journal' on October 10, the day before Hagibis struck. It showed that after a major natural disaster, people turn to God. The findings of an increase in religiousness are very surprising, since one would anticipate that the questioning of a good God would do the opposite. The results were based on data from historical as well as recent disasters. For example, more people converted to religion in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake than in the whole of New Zealand that year. Bentzen found that people were more religious in areas at high risk of earthquakes or tsunamis, and this was even higher if there was a risk of both. Volcanic areas also have inhabitants who were more religious, and this extends to spatial areas within 1,000km but not further.</p><p>Most surprisingly, the heightened religiousness in all of the areas identified lasted six to 12 years, and it was also transmitted to the next generation.</p><p>Bentzen speculated that it was the unpredictability of many natural disasters that drove the inhabitants to religion, since it was not identified in places where typhoons and hurricanes were common, as these can largely be predicted.</p><p>As Karl Marx said, \"religion is the opium of the people\". He may be correct. This study shows clearly that there is a positive role for religious coping along with the multitude of adaptive coping strategies extolled by psychologists.</p><p>Again, in the area of trauma and stress, here is another finding that is counter-intuitive. We may not understand why a good God has allowed bad things to happen, but we certainly believe He is there to help us manage them. As Bentzen explained: \"Religious coping provides a stable reason why people believe in God. Coping, therefore, may be one reason why religion has not vanished as some scholars have theorised.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Saved: Residents are rescued in Marumori town, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, following Typhoon Hagibis.

They can only hope and pray.</p><p>Certainly they could have done nothing more against Russia. Their second-string team wrapped up a bonus point inside 46 minutes and go on to register their biggest World Cup victory since their 89-0 thrashing of Ivory Coast in 1995.</p><p>Gavin Hastings racked up 44 points in that game and was present to see his son Adam Hastings (left) score 26 points, including two tries, while his half-back partner George Horne registered a hat-trick of tries.</p><p>For a team that had proved such obdurate opponents for Ireland and Japan, Russia were sliced apart by Scotland with surprising ease.</p><p>Maybe it was a game too far for Russia playing against what head coach Lyn Jones described as \"super-sonic rugby\" of Tier One <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.level.No\">www.level.No</url> player inflicted as much damage as Darcy Graham, the sole survivor from the side that beat Samoa 34-0 last week.</p><p>The wing beat eight defenders and made 151 metres before he was wisely replaced by Townsend on 47 minutes. How Scotland will need his dancing feet against Japan.</p><p>\"What the players have done since the Ireland game is all you can ask of them,\" Townsend said.</p><p>\"To beat Samoa 34-0, they've always been a difficult opponent for us and are a very good side.\"</p><p>Now their fate is in the lap of the gods.

Argentina lock Tomas Lavanini became the fifth player to be sent off at this World Cup - a tournament record - when he caught Farrell's son, Owen, with a dangerous high shot during England's win in Tokyo.</p><p>Match officials have come in for criticism for inconsistently implementing new protocols, but Farrell insists technique is key.</p><p>'The ones that I see that are getting people into trouble, and some of our guys have been in trouble as well because decision making is defence,' said the Ireland defence coach.</p><p>'That's what people don't realise. It's all about the decision before the actual contact itself. Decisionmaking makes that actual contact miles easier, and then going through the process of the actual tackle. 'Chris Farrell got a bang with an elbow in his head and came off with an HIA (against Japan). His head was to the side and when your head's to the side or your head's down, you're not able to see  exactly what's in front of you at the moment that matters, and then you're not able to be in control of what happens to your head at that stage. 'It's a difficult one because it's about decision making and the process after that. The funny thing is, what people don't realise [is that] it's super-important to almost lead with your head.</p><p>'If I lead with my head and get it through, then my head's out of the way and that's what we need to be coaching kids.' Farrell's defence has been one of the few consistent aspects of Ireland's performances at this World Cup, with just 22 points conceded across three games. He confirmed that Jordi Murphy, Joey Carbery, Robbie Henshaw and Chris Farrell are all in the mix for selection against Samoa on Saturday. Meanwhile, World Rugby is monitoring the progress of Typhoon Hagibis, which could hit Japan this weekend and thus hinder Ireland's World Cup clash with Samoa.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-153646303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X74-PR01-JCBW-N3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 8, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DAU3</classCode><className>CONCUSSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DHVB</classCode><className>SPORTS OFFICIATING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000C451</classCode><className>BRAIN INJURIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC601</classCode><className>SAMOA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The narrow alleyways and tiny bars of the Golden Gai had to be seen to be believed, and likewise, after a month-long build up to Halloween, the 100,000 or so in costumes who descended upon the famous Shibuya Crossing.

Ireland's World Cup campaign in its tracks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Typhoon Hagibis has formed in the Western Pacific Ocean off the south coast of Japan, with forecasts suggesting it could hit the island of Kyushu this weekend.</p><p>Ireland face Samoa in the Kyushu city of Fukuoka on Saturday, where Joe Schmidt's men need a bonus-point victory to seal a place in the quarter-finals.</p><p>Regulations dictate that any games cancelled at the World Cup due to weather problems are registered as scoreless draws.</p><p>That scenario would allow Scotland the chance to leapfrog Ireland into second place, should Gregor Townsend's men see off both Russia on Wednesday and hosts Japan on Sunday.</p><p>However, Ireland defence coach Andy Farrell said he expected the game would be rescheduled or moved rather than cancelled.</p><p>\"The boys haven't even spoken about it, really,\" said Schmidt's assistant, who will take over as head coach after the World Cup.</p><p>\"We just go from day to day and get on with our preparations.</p><p>\"World Rugby has been in touch with us and are as keen as we are to play the game.</p><p>\"I believe there is a contingency plan in place but we just get on with our day job.</p><p>\"The weather forecast changes the whole time anyway so we probably won't know until 48 hours or so before.\"</p><p>Previous predictions of typhoons hitting Japan and disrupting the tournament have so far proved wide of the mark.</p><p>Typhoon Mitag had threatened France's clash with the USA in Fukuoka last week, but the match was completed without issue.</p><p>A statement on the Rugby World Cup website read: \"The latest modelling from our weather information experts and the Japan Meteorological Agency, indicates that the typhoon is tracking in a north-westerly direction and could bring high winds and heavy rain to southern Japan on 12 and 13 October.</p><p>\"While it is too early to determine the exact trajectory and impact, if any, of the typhoon at this early stage, as per previous typhoon warnings, we have a robust contingency programme in place in the event adverse weather looks likely to impact fixtures.</p><p>\"We will continue to closely monitor this developing situation in partnership with our weather information experts, local authorities, transport providers and the teams, and will provide a further update tomorrow.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Ireland are this week based a stone's throw away from Disneyland Tokyo, leading to a slightly bizarre commute aboard the 'Mickey Mouse train' to their team hotel which blasts out such Disney classics as Under the Sea and A Whole New World as you rattle over the tracks past the Magical Kingdom and other Disney landmarks. Joe Schmidt's squad were based near Universal Studios in Kobe and spent a day at that theme park.</p><p>Reports from the camp were distinctly underwhelming, however. The Japanese love a good queue and Universal Studios proved no different. The players are sure to give Walt's gaff a visit this week. Will this weary Irish press corps make it to Space Mountain? There is always hope. With the Disney theme in mind, prepare for a barrage of puns across the Irish sports coverage this <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.week.No\">www.week.No</url> Mickey Mouse performances, will it be a fairytale finish? You have been warned.</p><p>JINGLING AND JANGLING OUR WAY AROUND JAPAN It's almost become white noise at this stage but it's impossible to ignore the plethora of jingles, bells and noises in Japan's busy streets. Every convenience store emits a little Super Mario-esque ditty when you stroll through the automatic doors. The same goes at any set of traffic lights or train station platform. The subway line at Yokohama had a particularly memorable little tune when the train back to our digs arrived yesterday. It seemed oddly familiar. You know you've been on tour too long when a subway jingle begins to sound a bit like the theme tune to the Lyrics Board.</p><p>NEW LAYER TO THE SCOTTISH TAPESTRY OF TRAGEDY Nobody does sporting tragedy quite like the Scots. Having dined out on the moral indignity of Craig Joubert's late refereeing blunder at the last World Cup, which cost them a place in the semi-finals, Scotland arrived in Japan in bullish form. It began with Stuart Hogg (below) stating their intention to win the tournament always a naive move. The inflated confidence of their players is mystifying. Lest we forget, this group has just a solitary Pro12 title (Glasgow in 2015) to crow about. They've won nowt on the international stage. They were up in arms in the week leading up to the Japan game with their CEO Mark Dodson threatening legal action if the crunch encounter was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis. An unedifying move when locals lost their lives and homes. Perspective is everything. The Scots had plenty of time to think about it on the flight home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-153882758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-GFT1-DYTY-C0CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"409\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"companies\"><classificationItem><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

And now Japan continue to make things difficult after condemning us to a Rugby World Cup quarter-final... against the mighty All Blacks.</p><p>Japan sent Scotland home and booked their own place in the quarter-final, yesterday, in an epic contest that almost never was.</p><p>The severity of super typhoon Hagibis, the worst storm to hit the country in more than 60 years, which saw millions of people being evacuated from their homes, threatened to have the encounter called off. But in the end it was an edgeof-theseat affair, and the victory for Japan puts Ireland in the unenviable position of having to face the All Blacks in our next match, in Tokyo on Saturday, while Japan will line out against South Africa on Sunday.</p><p>Ireland will be hoping to repeat the magic of 2016 when they defeated the Kiwis for the first time in 111 years by 40-29 in Chicago, as well as November last year when they beat them in Dublin 16-9. New Zealand-born Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will learn, in the coming days, if centre Bundi Aki will be available for selection, after receiving a red card for a high tackle against Samoa on Saturday.</p><p>Ireland's hopes of making their first ever semi-final will be significantly boosted if the disciplinary committee decides not to impose a ban on the influential player.</p><p>The Japan-Scotland match only got the go-ahead hours before kick-off. The city had been in lockdown, with people being urged to stay indoors and public transport grinding to a halt.</p><p>A cancellation would have meant a 0-0 draw being recorded and the game not being rearranged, as per tournament rules. This would have denied Scotland a chance to progress to the next stage of the tournament, with only a win against the host nation enough to get them over the line.</p><p>And they had threatened legal action in the event that they would be denied a chance to fight for a place in the quarter-final.</p><p>The row over the potential cancellation was seen as insensitive in Japan, where the death toll from the typhoon hit 33 yesterday.</p><p>The host nation continued their run of strong performances and blitzed the Scots, marching into a commanding early lead.</p><p>However, Scotland battled back and played their part in the memorable encounter.</p><p>They looked like they were going to pull-off a breathtaking comeback but fell just short of the line, and ultimately lost 28-21.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@dailymail.ie\">news@dailymail.ie</email></p><p>IRELAND'S DATE WITH DESTINY SEE PAGES 54-55</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Celebrating: Isileli Nakajima of JapanRevenge match: All Blacks will want to make amends for Dublin beating</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-153823018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8D-HR31-DYTY-C45B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"410\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

However, authorities warned that rivers in eastern Japan could still overflow and inflict more damage.</p><p>Prime minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting and offered his support to all those affected by the disaster - the second destructive storm to hit Japan in the space of a month.</p><p>The government said 27,000 members of the self-defence forces and emergency workers had been sent to Nagano prefecture and other affected areas to help with the rescue effort.</p><p>TV footage showed military helicopters airlifting stranded people from homes that had been flooded by river water. Some families, including those with small children, had been forced to seek safety on their roofs.</p><p>One clip showed a helicopter hovering over a flooded area in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma river had broken and unleashed sheets of water across residential areas. The helicopter plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.</p><h>Flooding </h><p>Aerial footage showed tractors at work trying to control the flooding.

Taking risks with driver safety given the expected arrival of Typhoon Hagibis seemed unthinkable.</p><p>Suzuka was where the accident that ultimately led to the death of Jules Bianchi occurred five years ago. The sense of loss and sadness has not diminished in time. Since he died F1 has made greater strides towards safety, but recent events have served as salutary reminders that the sport remains dangerous enough without taking chances with the weather.</p><p>In 2014 Bianchi crashed under the safety car at dusk in heavy rain that was the precursor to the arrival of Typhoon Phanfone. He had come off at the Dunlop curve and struck a recovery vehicle tending to another car. The Frenchman was hospitalised but died from his injuries nine months later.</p><p>Bianchi was the first on-track driver fatality in F1 since Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed at Imola in 1994. None of his contemporaries had experienced the death of a fellow driver in F1 before.</p><p>The impact remains acute. \"I can't believe it has been that long, it feels so recent, so fresh,\" said Lewis Hamilton in Japan. \"I remember that day, the poor weather we had, sitting in the pit lane wondering what happened, and of course what followed. It still feels fresh, it is such a sad thought. I like to think his spirit stays alive within the sport, within the drivers today.\"</p><p>With Hagibis threatening F1, the FIA and Suzuka were rightly taking no chances. Since Bianchi's accident F1 has pursued even greater driver safety. Much of it has gone unnoticed, such as the chassis around the cockpit increasing in strength by 300 per cent since 2014. </p><p>More publicly the introduction of the halo device has, despite objections, repeatedly proved its worth. Not least when Fernando Alonso's airborne car struck the halo of Charles Leclerc last year at Spa.</p><p>In August, however, the death of Anthoine Hubert in an F2 race at the Belgian Grand Prix was a reminder that danger cannot be regulated out of the sport. Juan Manuel Correa who struck Hubert's car in the accident has had extensive surgery after suffering spinal injuries and broken legs. </p><p>The drivers already know these risks, but everyone involved sees no sense in increasing them unnecessarily.</p><p>\"It's a shame for the fans but it's a fully respectable decision - safety is first,\" said Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto in Suzuka. </p><p>A view echoed by Haas's Guenther Steiner. \"I think it was the right decision from the organisers; safety is first.\" </p><p>Qualifying is now set to take place on Sunday at 2am UK time, four hours before the race. However, if the weather remains too severe to run qualifying, the grid will be dictated by the times set in second practice on Friday. </p><p>Mercedes can win the constructors' title if they outscore Ferrari by 14 points and had brought small upgrades to Japan. They have not been defeated here since 2014.</p><p>Valtteri Bottas was quickest in the first session, and when the teams attempted quick times in P2 was once again on top. In the order that may yet represent the front of the grid, he was one-tenth clear of Hamilton, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen two-tenths back in third. </p><p>- Guardian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4048079</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7Y-XD31-DYS1-006C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000008</classCode><className>ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000755</classCode><className>FORMULA ONE RACING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000140</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPUD</classCode><className>TRAFFIC FATALITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002184</classCode><className>ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000C43N</classCode><className>BONE FRACTURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX002101</classCode><className>MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000140</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPUD</classCode><className>TRAFFIC FATALITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002184</classCode><className>ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DIK7</classCode><className>FERNANDO ALONSO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DKEI</classCode><className>LEWIS HAMILTON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Nobody is suggesting spectators should be exposed to 100mph winds on the way to stadiums. For World Rugby to make that the central issue was misleading. The crux was whether they should have been more flexible and inventive to obey the old showbiz mantra: the show must go on.</p><p>In his address yesterday, Alan Gilpin, the tournament director, said he and his colleagues had been \"intensively working\" on a solution, adding: \"However, the risks are just too challenging to enable to us to deliver a fair and consistent contingency approach for all teams and participants.\"</p><p>This explanation sidesteps two possible solutions. If Japan-Scotland goes ahead on Sunday, some of the heat will be taken out of the debate raging here in Tokyo, but New Zealand-Italy and England-France have already been lost.</p><p>In all cases the organisers have rejected two opportunities: 1. To reschedule games for Monday or Tuesday next week and 2. To move them to cities unlikely to be affected by Typhoon Hagibis - though predicting its course is hard.</p><p>Two games have been lost and a third will be condemned or saved on Sunday morning. If Japan v Scotland is also cancelled the big weekend losers will be Italy and Scotland. The big winners will be New Zealand, France and England, who will all have to play one game fewer.</p><p>Japan would be the biggest gainers of all. A cancellation would guarantee them passage to a quarter-final and also shave a match off their schedule.</p><p>Many justifications have been advanced. Many are logistical - the problem of shifting teams, fans and broadcasters around a country where infrastructure damage is predicted. Another is the difficulty in moving back into stadiums that have already been decommissioned as rugby venues.</p><p>Nobody could claim it would have been easy, but there are big holes in the argument. First, the authorities seem to be saying there is no wiggle room in the schedule on Monday and Tuesday, despite them saying months ago that flexibility was built in. A five-day turnaround is hardly ideal. But ask Scotland whether they would rather go home without playing again or have five days to prepare for the All Blacks.</p><p>The biggest contributing factor in the success of Rugby World Cups is the physical commitment of the players, who, in today's musclebound culture, take extraordinary risks to lay on the spectacle.</p><p>That investment should be honoured. World Rugby say Scotland could not be given a second chance that was denied to Italy; the answer to which is - rearrange New Zealand-Italy as well, once the winds have ceased.</p><p>People want a whole World Cup, not one with bits missing and questions unresolved.

Scotland beat Russia 61-0, their biggest win in 15 years, and earned the bonus point they needed just five minutes into the second half. That means that they now have 10 points in the pool, which puts them one behind Ireland, and four behind Japan, who they need to beat in Yokohama on Sunday. It'll have to be a handsome victory, too, because if Japan pick up a bonus point for losing by seven points or less, Scotland will need one too, for scoring four tries or more. Assuming that is, they get to play at all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Super Typhoon Hagibis is forecast to hit the Tokyo area this weekend. World Rugby had not announced their contingency plans as of last night and it was not clear whether, when, or where the match would go ahead.</p><p>The Russians will be gone by then. They looked utterly spent, and turned in their worst game yet. They started to run out of steam around 10 minutes in, when Adam Hastings scored the first try by slipping through their midfield with a cute dummy and a sidestep. Two minutes after the restart, Hastings chipped the ball ahead, chased it down himself, then hacked it on again beyond the Russian tryline. Their fullback, Vasily Artemyev, should have beaten him to it, but lost his footing and fell over sideways.</p><p>The third try was even worse. Russia won a lineout deep in their own 22, and their scrumhalf, Dmitry Petrov, shot a long flat pass straight towards George Horne, who caught the ball and dived over the line while the Russians stood around staring at each other. They did manage to hold off the Scottish maul when they rolled forward in the final minutes of the half, but Scotland soon picked up that vital fourth try when Darcy Graham beat three tacklers with a sidewinding run that covered half the length of pitch. Horne finished it off for him. </p><h>Turkey shoot </h><p>It turned into a turkey shoot. There was a fifth by Gordon Turner, peeling off a maul, a sixth by Tommy Seymour, chasing down Blair Kinghorn's grubber, and a seventh for Horne, who completed his hat-trick by finishing off a fine free-flowing counterattack from the halfway line. John Barclay got the eighth, and Stuart McInally the ninth and last.</p><p>By then Russia had pretty much given up tackling. It was more satisfying, perhaps, that the Scots have now played 192 minutes without conceding a single point, which is a World Cup record. They'll want to stretch it the best part of another 80 minutes yet. - Guardian</p><p>SCOTLAND: Kinghorn, Seymour, Taylor, P. Horne, Graham, Hastings, G.

They would tell you, with an almost audible sense of relief, that the black man preferred soccer, and when I asked one of the blazered brigade why the township kids were never encouraged to play rugby, he changed the subject.</p><p>Kolisi, born to teenage parents on the wrong side of the tracks, would have been outlawed as a Springbok under white rule. The chance he would never have got had he been born a generation earlier came in the form of a scholarship to one Cape Town's private schools with a track record for producing international players.</p><p>The old Afrikaner habit died so hard and the face of the Springboks changed so slowly that until as recently as five years ago, the rugby club in Soweto had no empathy with the national team.</p><p>\"It's not a true South African team,\" secretary Zola Ntlokoma said at the time. \"It's not a reflection of the nation. I support the All Blacks instead.\"</p><p>Kolisi has changed all that which explains why winning this World Cup in such emphatic fashion against England in Yokohama will be a greater force of good throughout his troubled homeland than the winner of any previous World Cup.</p><p>That is saying quite something given the history of Springbok captains and South African presidents: Francois Pienaar and Mandela in 1995, John Smit and Thabo Mbeki in 2007, now, glory be, Kolisi and Cyril Ramaphosa.</p><p>\"Siya has more responsibilities than I had or Francois had because he represents more people,\" Smit said. \"That's why this will be a far greater moment even than 1995. It will change the trajectory of our country.''</p><p>Where their first World Cup-winning team had one black player, the late Chester Williams, the starting line-up in Yokohama on Saturday night had six, including both try scorers, Cheslin Kolbe and Makazole Mapimpi, another township boy who, unlike Kolisi, made it without a private education.</p><p>And to think that Williams accused a fellow Springbok, James Small, of racially abusing him during a domestic match. Worse still, the white Transvaal lock Geo Cronje was removed from the putative Springbok squad for the 2003 World Cup after allegedly refusing to share a room with his black team-mate, Quinton Davids.</p><p>How inspiring that in his moment of personal triumph, when asked if he ever dreamt of winning the biggest prize, Kolisi remembered where he came from.</p><p>\"As a kid,\" he said. \"All I thought about was getting my next meal\u00e2 \u00a6\"</p><p>[readmore]961501[/readmore]</p><p>[h2]Best and worst of RWC 2019[/h2]</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Best matches:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan 28 Scotland 21; Wales 29 Australia 25; France 23, Argentina 21.</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Worst match:&lt;/strong&gt; South Africa 19 Wales 16.</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Best performances:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 South Africa (v England, final); 2 England (v New Zealand, semi-final); 3 Japan (v Ireland, pool stage)</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Worst performances:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 Ireland (v Japan); 2 France (v Tonga); 3 Scotland (v Ireland).</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Biggest upsets:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 Uruguay 30 Fiji 27; 2 Japan 19 Ireland 12; 3 England 19 New Zealand 7.</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Best tries:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 TJ Perenara (New Zealand v Namibia); 2 Ketai Inagaki (Japan v Scotland); 3 Josh Adams (Wales v Fiji); 4 Charles Ollivon (France v Wales).</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Best gestures&lt;/strong&gt; 1 Canadian players in Kamaishi armed with shovels and brushes cleaning up the mess the morning after Typhoon Hagibis had blown through, claiming 84 lives.

Steve Hansen's All Blacks haven't lost a World Cup match since 2007, although Saturday's 'draw' with Italy in a postponement due to Typhoon Hagibis technically ended their 17-game winning run at the tournament.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And while Ireland went through the first 111 years of matches between the sides without tasting victory, they've now won two of the last three.</p><p>Stockdale had yet to make his debut for the first, in Soldier Field in 2016, but was the try-scoring hero in Dublin a little under a year ago.</p><p>The Ulster wing is not getting ahead of himself but believes the men in green can approach the game in a more confident mindset.</p><p>\"Obviously having gotten over that hump of being able to beat them in Chicago and then back in Dublin, it's a massive positive,\" he said. \"But this is a World Cup, anything can happen. New Zealand have been going very well so it'll be interesting to see.</p><p>\"It's about getting the recovery. They're going to be well rested and for us it's going to be making sure that we're back on the pitch on Tuesday, doing everything we can to be as fresh as possible.\"</p><p>Ireland were much improved in beating Samoa 47-5 on Saturday, finally putting the surprise pool loss to Japan behind them and even overcoming a first-half red card for centre Bundee Aki.</p><p>The fear for Ireland now is that a disciplinary panel could rule him out of the quarter-final.</p><p>CONTINUED ON PAGE 46 CONTINUED FROM BACK PAGE Stockdale, who was the victim of a high tackle in the first-half that brought a yellow card for Seilala Lam, felt his team-mate was unfortunate to be dismissed for making contact with the head of Ulupano Seuteni.</p><p>\"I was checking my teeth when I got up but they're all there,\" he laughed of his own collision.</p><p>\"I thought there wasn't an awful lot of difference between Bundee's tackle and the tackle on me. \"That's not a comment on anyone's technique or anything like that, it's more on the inconsistency between cards that we've seen in this World Cup. It's disappointing for Bundee but he'll bounce back.\"</p><p>Aki will face a hearing this morning to determine his World Cup fate, where a ban could rule him out for the rest of the tournament. Should it come to pass, Stockdale believes the Connacht man will be a big loss.</p><p>\"Bundee's was such a reactionary thing because the ball bounced and he was going from either carrying or making a tackle and he just was really unfortunate. That's rugby.</p><p>\"Obviously his robustness and his physicality is massive for us and if he wasn't available, it would be a big loss.</p><p>\"But we've a lot of very, very good centres. Chris Farrell, Garry (Ringrose), Robbie (Henshaw), there's three class centres to pick from if Bundee doesn't make it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Confident mindset: Jacob Stockdale</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-153826746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8D-HR31-DYTY-C3PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

It was a lot of work, the forwards particularly really muscled up well and had to work really hard. That's a little bit attritional but it's something they enjoy doing anyway. Well, they do at the time anyway, probably in the morning, they feel the effects of it.</p><p>\"So, for us, it would be really important to recover well and it probably just squeezed up our preparation, whereas either of the opponents that we'll have, they'll watch (the Japan-Scotland) game, see the result, know who they're playing but in the meantime they'll be ready to hit the ground running. We might need another day or so to recover.\"</p><p>Of course, it all depends on how you use your newly freed-up time and as you would expect from the defending champions, Steve Hansen put his All Blacks to work before Hagibis intervened.</p><p>\"Having a week off is not a bad thing,\" Hansen declared. \"We're quite excited by that fact. It's allowed us to work really hard Friday.</p><p>\"GPS numbers were equivalent or just above what a normal Test match would be so we don't feel like we've lost any opportunity to get ourselves where we need to be.\"</p><p>On Saturday, the All Blacks hunkered down in the safety of their Tokyo hotel, as skipper Kieran Read explained on Sunday. They seem content with the cards they were dealt. As do Ireland. Horses for courses, then, and for a change, everybody's happy.</p><p>[readmore]957047[/readmore]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRKNEW-957162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRKNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8K-B0G1-F0BB-S062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><timeReceived>09:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The permutations are numerous in a group where all three could finish level on 15 points but they can also be rendered moot if Ireland rediscover their form and pull rank on the Samoans at the Hakatanomori Stadium tomorrow.</p><p>Being in control of their own destiny has been a key message for Ireland's players all week, the head coach said yesterday after he confirmed his selection to face Samoa.</p><p>\"That's exactly what we chatted about right at the start,\" Schmidt said. \"For us, the next 48 hours' build-up is our full focus.</p><p>[quote]We can't really afford to be distracted by any other matches that may or may not be played.[/quote]</p><p>\"We've just got to make sure we get our preparation right and then the performance on the back of that preparation is as good as we can make it, to make sure that whatever destiny we do manage to attain it is including another game and we get to stay on for another week whether it's to play the All Blacks or whether it's to play South Africa.\"</p><p>Samoa's physicality has been a focal point for their performances and opposition video analysts alike throughout this tournament.</p><p>Given the physical toll Ireland's final pool match of 2015 against France exacted, when Schmidt lost the services of Johnny Sexton, Paul O'Connell and Peter O'Mahony to injury for the quarter-final against Argentina, it has to be feared that tomorrow's match has the capacity to be just as attritional.</p><p>[readmore]956224[/readmore]</p><p>\"Any games does, I guess,\" Schmidt countered. \"I do think the French and ourselves were unbeaten in the pool last time and so it was very much who was going to get the top spot in the pool so that was very competitive as well.
