GoGreenRoutes aims to answer this question.</p><p>Funds of over  11m have been earmarked for the project's look at nature-based solutions to make urban life more sustainable. Aims include fostering a positive human-nature relationship. Creating 'green' corridors and stimulating sustainable physical activity are among the project's components. GoGreenRoutes is co-ordinated by Maynooth University.</p><p>The  5m Recetas (Re-imagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces) project may have been inspired by the extraordinary circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic when it was seen that people needed time in nature for its healing benefits.</p><p>Recetas will address loneliness, a health condition known to shorten one's lifespan, and which may be as dangerous to one's health as smoking or obesity.</p><p>Its findings could inspire the investments in nature-based solutions and green infrastructure needed to address rapid urbanisation and its adverse consequences on environmental systems in cities. Such investments can be harnessed for health and wellbeing even in times of health emergencies. Recetas is co-ordinated by the Institute for Global Health in Barcelona.</p><p>The findings of these projects may also help rural dwellers better appreciate the health powers of birdsong, breezes, and bushes.</p><p>Professor Jill Litt of at the Barcelona's Institute for Global Health was inspired by how urban gardens promoted physical activity or healthy eating, but were also a gateway to feeling better generally, and helped people make new acquaintances and ease anxieties.</p><p>She believes the aesthetic, physical and social aspects of such activities amplify people's senses, have an emotional effect, and improve their overall wellbeing.</p><p>Tadhg MacIntyre of GoGreenRoutes, an environmental psychologist at Maynooth University, said the covid-19 pandemic and widespread lockdowns offered new insights into why people use green space and what they gain from it.</p><p>He said their motives were typically social interaction and mental wellbeing rather than physical activity, or the chance to just sit under a tree, to enjoy being in nature and feeling its restorative powers.</p><p>GoGreenRoutes got underway at the height of the pandemic, in September 2020, and will run to next August.</p><p>It includes building or renovating parks and green spaces in Burgas on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, Limerick, Lahti in Finland, Tallinn in Estonia, Umea in Sweden, and Paris.</p><p>In Limerick, the project updated the Castletroy Greenway for cycling and walking in the city suburbs.</p><p>Time spent in nature benefits the mental and physical health of people, but also represents a gain for the environment itself, according to Dr MacIntyre, because the more people interact regularly with nature, the more they care for it and are likely to make lifestyle changes to reduce their environmental footprint.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Time spent in nature benefits the mental and physical health of people, but also represents a gain for the environment itself</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B55-MD71-DYRW-V0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

It has far-reaching consequences for land use, especially farming, but also marine development.</p><p>Its effective deployment is critical to restoring vast tracts of Ireland s wetlands and to putting a floor on biodiversity loss. Accelerating species decline is all too often leading to extinction of plant life, wild birds and mammals, not to mention pollinators and degradation of soils due to intensive agriculture.</p><p>After much disagreement and delay exacerbated by misinformation in advance of the European elections, the law was signed off by environment ministers who were at pains to point out its  flexibilities , ie voluntary aspects.</p><p>Farmers coalesced with far-right groupings in condemning the law, which was adopted last year but fell into limbo, as some member states lost their nerve   chiefly because of claims it was mandatory and would impose additional costs on food production. But there is a bigger picture beyond those concerns. When in a healthy condition, peatlands store carbon, wetlands hold flood water, and dune systems serve as protective barriers against flooding and coastal erosion.</p><p>Considering the interlinked climate and biodiversity crises, it is vital that these habitats are restored to full health to provide  nature-based solutions . In Ireland, 85 per cent of internationally important and protected habitats are in poor condition. As they degrade, they become uninhabitable and their ecosystem services (direct and indirect contributions to human wellbeing) are greatly diminished.</p><p>There were indications that another go at getting the law across the line would be attempted but there was surprise a vote came so soon. This was helped by significant work by Minister for Environment Eamon Ryan and Minister for Heritage Malcolm Noonan in building a sufficiently strong consensus in advance of the meeting.</p><p>Ireland and other member states have to draft national restoration plans and detail how they plan to reach proposed targets.</p><p>There remains huge uncertainty about how this law is going to be interpreted at member state level, and anger in rural communities. In the Irish context no national impact assessment has been carried out, while the IFA says there is no indication of how it will impact on food production and food security. A properly funded, EU-wide, voluntary scheme should have been pursued, it believes.</p><p>For the nature restoration law to be effective, the Government will need genuine consultation with all stakeholders, particularly farmers, backed by new supports and collaboration to help nudge existing restoration measures at farm level to the level required.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21059004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8V-4661-DYS1-02HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 18, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp;

That applies especially to Europe, the world s fastest-warming continent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recent studies show the complex interaction of factors contributing to this wildfire spread, highlighting a lack of preparedness for a worsening scenario, unless temperatures are forced down by co-ordinated human interventions. Ravaging fires in Greece, where a 25m wall of fire reached its capital Athens last week, and fires across vast areas of California and Canada, have not only become deadly threats to communities but increasingly cause global- scale air pollution.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, wildfires have become a new contributor to the parlous cycle generating carbon emissions, raising atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and exacerbating global warming. Uncontrollable burning is at unprecedented levels because of a combination of extreme heat and prolonged heatwaves and droughts. The evidence shows the ferocity and frequency of fires are being exacerbated by human-induced climate change.</p><h>Unusually high </h><p>Wildfires in Canada and Amazonia last year were at least three times more likely due to climate change, and contributed to high levels of CO2 emissions globally, according to last week s State of Wildfires<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>report. </p><p>For the first time, the report takes stock of extreme wildfires, focusing on the 2023- 2024 fire season (March 2023-February 2024). It explains their causes and assesses whether events could have been predicted. It also evaluates how risk of similar events will change in future under different climate change scenarios, and underlines the merits of climate attribution research. </p><p>It was compiled by climate scientists at the University of East Anglia (UAE), the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, the UK Met Office and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</p><p>It finds that emissions from wildfires globally were 16 per cent above average, totalling 8.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Emissions from fires in the Canadian boreal forests were more than nine times the average of the past two decades, and contributed almost a quarter of the emissions. An unusually high number of fires were also seen in northern parts of South America, particularly in Brazil s Amazonas state and in neighbouring areas of Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela. This led to the Amazon region experiencing among the worst air quality ratings on the planet. Meanwhile, wildfires in the Arctic have become common and more extensive.</p><p>Wildfires are killing people, destroying properties and infrastructure, causing mass evacuations, threatening livelihoods and damaging vital ecosystems, noted Dr Matthew Jones of UEA.  Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense as the climate warms, and both society and the environment are suffering from the consequences. </p><h>Destructive flooding </h><p>The loss of carbon stocks from boreal forests in Canada and tropical forests in South America has lasting implications for the Earth s climate. Forests take decades to centuries to recover from fire disturbance, meaning that extreme fire years such as 2023-24 result in a lasting deficit in carbon storage for many years to come.</p><p>Climate models suggest the toll from extreme wildfires will increase by the end of the century, particularly in future scenarios where greenhouse gas emissions remain high. These projections are yet another indication of the urgent need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and manage vegetation to reduce the risk and impacts of increasingly severe wildfires on society and ecosystems.</p><p>Several factors control fire, including weather conditions influenced by climate change, the density of vegetation on the landscape influenced by climate and land management, and ignition opportunities influenced by people and lightning. The critical lesson is the need to cut emissions (to reduce temperatures) while scaling up adaptation measures in preparation for unavoidable impacts. At least the EU s Civil Protection Mechanism is showing its worth at an immediate, practical level. It pools resources such as planes and firefighters which are deployed when a government needs help in the event of a natural disaster.</p><p>In Ireland s case, the biggest threat from extreme weather events is likely to be destructive flooding, but all it takes is a drought of a few weeks to make land vulnerable to wildfires. We are not adequately prepared on either front, and have yet to deploy nature- based solutions at a level that can eliminate much of the climate risk facing the country. Indications are that Europe and the world are equally ill-equipped.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21218742</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CS8-8KJ1-DYS1-001R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 20, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

He said its focus seems to be primarily on slowing the volume and flow of water to the culverts in and around Carrigtwohill by natural methods.</p><p>\"This is fine but will in no way succeed in stopping a repeat of the events of Storm Babet. The culverts will have to accommodate increased capacity in conjunction with the proposed measures,\" Mr Barry said.</p><p>\"Also, the study area doesn't include large areas of land to the north and east of Carrigtwohill.\"</p><p>He is also concerned Slatty Pond will not have the capacity to act as a storage area for extreme rainfall run-off.</p><p>Fianna Fail councillor Sheila O'Callaghan said there is a reason the town got its name. She said it refers to two hills overlooking the town which \"have a funnelling effect\" into the urban area.

It underlined that while much of the focus remains on reducing emissions, Ireland is not doing enough to adapt its communities to address the damage that climate change is already causing   and the damage it will do in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of the focus for policymakers has been on mitigation action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and not on adapting society to our changing climate, which also needs urgent attention. Climate adaptation, that is preparing for, and adjusting to, the now inevitable impacts of climate change, continues to be under-resourced and ignored. It is the  Cinderella  of Irish climate policy.</p><p>It is notable that only about 14 per cent of the nearly 4,000 actions set out across the 31 recently adopted local authority climate action plans specifically relate to adaptation, despite local authorities having significant power and responsibility in preparing communities for climate impacts.</p><p>In particular, preparing the built environment for the changes that we are already seeing in the climate is crucial to communities across Ireland, be that to prepare towns and cities for flooding, storm surges and erosion, or our homes for heatwaves. The planning system is an important instrument for managing risks associated with flooding, heatwaves, air quality and our buildings.</p><p>As part of its commitments to address this, the Government recently published Ireland s second National Adaptation Framework (NAF). The new framework needs to embed climate adaptation considerations across government decision-making in a much more meaningful and urgent way if we are to protect current and future infrastructure from the impacts of climate change.</p><p>There has been some success to date in the development and delivery of sectoral adaptation plans, such as in agriculture and flood-risk management, where the Minister for Agriculture and Minister of State for the Office of Public Works respectively have clear responsibility for the area. However, it has been less successful in other areas, including communication networks, where a range of regulators and private sector organisations, such as mobile phone network operators, operate with less government oversight.</p><p>There is a danger that the need to prepare our built environment for future climate impacts could be lost in the ever increasing layers of spatial plans and policies that the planning system has to address. For example, the Planning and Development Bill will add even more layers of policy with which adaptation action and policy must align. </p><p>The distance that adaptation policy still has to travel can be seen in the Climate Change Advisory Council s annual adaptation scorecards, which highlight the limited progress Ireland has made in preparing our electricity networks for future climate impacts.</p><h>Far from clear </h><p>This confirms that significant attention must be paid, now, to how adaptation and resilience is considered in the forthcoming national, regional and local renewable electricity strategies. The planning system will be a key part of delivering these strategies and this infrastructure, but how a planning sectoral adaptation plan and an already underperforming electricity networks sector will interact is far from clear.</p><p>As for the projected increase in temperatures and heatwaves, there is limited understanding of what this means for overheating homes and commercial buildings. Advances in building standards and technology have been important for climate mitigation, notably by increasing the energy efficiency of new and retrofitted homes. However, this also poses a risk of delivering increasingly uncomfortable or unsafe temperatures as our climate continues to change, with Irish homes typically being built to keep heat in, not let heat out.</p><p>Public understanding of all of the climate risks we face needs to be significantly increased, or schemes that are designed to address climate adaptation such as flooding, sea-level rise or heatwaves will fall at the first hurdle. Similarly, adapting to climate change is not going to be all about building hard walls   we need a comprehensive national policy on deploying  nature-based solutions as well.</p><p>It s not yet clear if the new National Adaptation Framework or the next round of sectoral adaptation plans can cut through this complicated sphere and really transform our thinking, but we must realise the stable climate that society has based all our planning and building policies on can no longer be taken for granted. </p><p>Dr Se\u00e1n O Leary is senior planner with the Irish Planning Institute and has previously advised on government climate adaptation policy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21204933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPS-G8N1-DYS1-019M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 13, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>Business &amp;

Alongside this reduction, a new movement has emerged to put agriculture at the heart of  water quality improvement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The EUR 60 million five-year Farming for Water project is a European Innovation Partnership (EIP), the largest one ever carried out in Ireland. The project will support up to 15,000 farmers in the provision of rainwater management plans, earthen bunds and tree planting among a range of other measures designed to help improve water quality.</p><p> With around 80 per cent of Ireland s agricultural area consisting of grassland, the role of the livestock sector in managing the natural environment and water quality is clear,  says Conor Mulvihill, director of Dairy Industry Ireland, the Ibec industry body that represents primary and secondary dairy processors, including the specialised nutrition sector.</p><p> While there is significant work to be done to further improve water quality, data from the European Environment Agency shows that Ireland currently has the highest water quality among major dairy producers across Europe,  he adds.  Department of Agriculture data shows that Irish farmers have delivered a staggering 30 per cent reduction in their use of chemical nitrogen in just two years. </p><p>He says that achieving good water quality requires targeted action across all relevant sectors, such as agriculture, urban wastewater, domestic septic tanks and forestry.  This highlights the need for a transparent and joined-up approach to addressing challenges. Adopting a proactive approach on a local catchment level is key to enhancing water quality in the period ahead. The dairy sector is committed to playing its part, working with local farm families on local bespoke solutions. </p><p>He believes Ireland is starting from a good base in terms of water quality.  We are very lucky in that regard. The results of the EPA Water Quality in 2022 Indicator Report highlighted that about 83 per cent of our rivers are of high, good or moderate biological quality, a slight rise on previous reports; 60 per cent of rivers sampled showed high or good nitrate quality; and 72 per cent showed high or good phosphorous quality. </p><p>He notes the success of the industry-driven Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme (ASSAP) water quality programme in this regard.  Since 2017, the programme has grown to include over 45 advisers nationally, over half of which are funded by dairy processors. More than 5,000 assessments have been completed across 190 priority areas for action, with great farmer engagement and very encouraging results for water quality. It was clear that we needed to scale up this to a national level movement and this spring saw the launch of the Farming for Water project supported by the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO), Teagasc and Dairy Industry Ireland. </p><p> Mulvihill says the programme includes innovations like results-based payments, a research hub and nature-based solutions.  The programme utilises the ASSAP assessment approach, bringing a joined-up approach to delivering relevant, bespoke on-farm advice and incentivising the implementation of measures,  he adds.</p><p> We know this work is critical, as challenges in relation to water quality are leading to considerable policy uncertainty regarding the future of the nitrates derogation, which is crucial to underpinning the economic and social sustainability of Ireland s outdoor, grass-based production system. This uncertainty is impacting on the ability of the sector and farm families to plan for the future. Addressing this with urgency is critical to secure the future direction of the Irish dairy and the wider agriculture sector.</p><p> With regard to the future of Ireland s nitrates derogation, it should be clearly noted that no country has complied with the Nitrates Directive, so why threaten the viability of our globally recognised grass-based industry with its removal?  he asks.</p><p>Noting a 2023 EY report which showed that the Irish dairy sector had grown to become the country s biggest native industry with a value of EUR 17.6 billion, Mulvihill says:  Ireland has proven it can be a global leader in high-quality sustainable nutrition with a low environmental footprint   while delivering social and economic sustainability to every parish in the country. </p><p>And further growth will be necessary.  The United Nations has estimated that we need to produce more food in the next 25 years than has ever been produced in human history. Dairy demand is projected to grow by 29 per cent by 2050 to meet future nutritional needs. We firmly believe as an industry that we can balance our environmental, social and economic sustainability commitments to meet this demand, instead of production leaking to other countries with multiples of the environmental footprint of Irish agriculture.

Underneath a pontoon where the river Lagan meets the lough, within sight of the Titanic visitor experience and the busy port of Belfast, hangs the oyster nursery. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Snug in their protective cages, the native molluscs can grow and reproduce in safety here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When we lift up the cages, they re covered in life,  says Dr Nick Baker Horne, marine conservation manager with Ulster Wildlife. </p><p> Lots of baby crabs, which is great fun as you lift the oysters out and have the crabs crawling all around. </p><p> You have sometimes other oysters, sea squirts, tube worms, sometimes little fish, plenty of mussels growing on there, and you get to see, hands on, that these things are an ecosystem of their own.</p><p> Just by growing and living and making that shell, they create this really fantastic habitat, and it gives you an idea of what it could be like if we had these large oyster reefs out in Belfast Lough once more. </p><p>Native oysters   ostrea edulis   were once commonplace in Belfast Lough, but by 1903 over-extraction, which left the molluscs increasingly vulnerable to pollution and disease, had wiped out the population and the fishery closed.</p><p>The oysters were believed to be extinct in the lough until 2020, when researchers discovered 42 live oysters at six sites on the lough shore.</p><p> That was the first sign,  says Baker Horne.  That s where this project stemmed from. They were growing in the wild, so how could we help them?  Cages were used to protect the all-important oyster larvae from predators; the plan was to grow the oyster population to the size where they could be released into the lough.</p><p>The oyster nursery in Belfast harbour was installed last December, the first in Northern Ireland to be situated in a commercial shipping channel.</p><p>This autumn,  the plan is to create a seabed deployment,  says Simon Gibson, marine environment and biodiversity officer at Belfast Harbour Commissioners. </p><h>A natural reef This will involve  about 3,000-3,500 young, small oysters out on an old shell bed in the harbour estate, which is a really good base habitat for them, and the idea is that they will grow and create a natural reef there, and then any of the larvae being produced in the nursery will then have a place to settle, which would be the ideal conditions for them .</h><p>Native oysters bring many benefits: they boost biodiversity and filter seawater, improving water quality and reducing pollution.  The long-term vision is to have large populations of oysters back out in Belfast Lough,  says Baker Horne.  They could create huge habitats, real complex reefs, biogenic reefs, biological, living beings \u00a0 where thousands to millions of oysters could be together creating this really complex structure with so much biodiversity and so much abundance of life.</p><p> You can imagine the small little fish hiding away amongst that oyster reef, protecting itself from predators, and that kind of symbiosis and that biodiversity it creates is just fantastic.</p><p> That s what we always have at the back of our minds when we re measuring each oyster and getting covered in mud, we re thinking of that big picture of large, native oyster reefs full of life and fish and fantastic clean, clean water. </p><p>Native oysters are  ecosystem engineers  which are increasingly being viewed as a  nature conservation tool , says Dr Jos\u00e9 M Fari\u00f1as-Franco, lecturer in the department of natural resources and the environment and principal investigator in the Marine and Freshwater Research Centre at the Atlantic Technological University, Galway.</p><p>He has worked on the east coast of Scotland   where native oysters had also disappeared   and describes a  shifting mentality  there and in other parts of Europe around the ecological benefits of native oysters. In Ireland, he says,  we need more awareness of oysters being more than food . Native oysters and the beds they create are internationally recognised as threatened and declining species and habitats. Fari\u00f1as-Franco is involved in a project to document the last Irish native oyster beds off the Connemara coast, to use them as reference habitats in restoration projects elsewhere, potentially including Belfast Lough. </p><h> Baseline for restoration   It s a baseline for restoration, to know what an oyster reef should look like, because in lots of places in Europe, we don t know,  he says.  We re using the oyster beds in the west of Ireland as a benchmark to record what s in there, and this information is sorely needed in areas where oysters are long gone, to have success in bringing back an established oyster population and with it these lost ecosystems. </h><p>The hope is that the oysters will set an example for the future.  We primarily want to look at nature-based solutions to tackle issues within the harbour,  says Gibson.  Be it pollution, invasive species, carbon emissions, there s always a natural solution. </p><p> What we re trying to do is add more nature back out there, really grow nature, and that s something that really does give you hope,  says Baker Horne.  It s a really positive movement of restoring nature, rather than just trying to protect the last remnants of what we have. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21212084</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CRD-CTN1-DYS1-02J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 16, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

which has one-third of the world's most fertile land.</p><p>Farmers will learn more when Ms von der Leyen presents a \"Vision for Agriculture and Food\" within the next three months, describing how to ensure the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of EU farming - but, of course, \"within the boundaries of our planet\".</p><p>It all sounds more like the same for European farmers.</p><p>However, there is no such treatment for \"our partners around the world impacted by European legislation, in particular those linked to the European Green Deal $(the aforementioned green transition$)\".</p><p>\"We need to listen and respond better to their concerns\", she said.</p><p>Also to be looked after is the Green Party across Europe, who contributed 45 or so of Ms von der Leyen's 401 votes in a secret ballot of MEPs, well above the 360 votes she needed to be elected.</p><p>However, the more militant French Greens opposed her last week - partly for weakening the Green Deal, in their view.</p><p>There were 284 votes in opposition, 15 abstentions, and seven votes declared invalid.</p><p>It was 18 votes better than Ms von der Leyen's narrow election win in 2019.</p><p>The Greens were a big supporter then, and she responded with the Green Deal for climate neutrality by 2050.</p><p>She said last week that \"she is also very grateful to the Green group\" for their support.</p><p>One of the Greens' rewards is likely to be a strategy to slash industrial emissions, albeit sugar-coated in Ms von der Leyen's parliament speech as the \"Clean Industrial Deal\".</p><p>Farmers can at least hope that it takes the climate action spotlight away from them.</p><p>Maybe that hope explains the feeble response of Copa and Cogeca, representing EU farmers and agricultural coops, congratulating Ms von der Leyen and welcoming her description of agriculture as \"a strategic asset\".</p><p>Their tune may change if farmers are trampled underfoot in what Ms von der Leyen says is a global \"race\" to be the first to climate neutrality.</p><p>\"By leading by example at home, I want Europe to remain a leader in international climate negotiations,\" she said.</p><p>Only some sectors will be protected in that race.</p><p>Ms von der Leyen said: \"The 2035 climate neutrality target for cars ... will require a technology-neutral approach in which e-fuels have a role.\"</p><p>These carefully chosen words could keep her onside with both the Greens and the European People's Party which had campaigned for softer environmental regulations, greater support for industry and farms, and wants the EU's 2035 combustion car ban revised.</p><p>Now that Ms von der Leyen has the majority support of both EU leaders and the European Parliament, she will begin to assemble her new European Commission, which is unlikely to be in place before November.</p><p>With each proposed commissioner having to convince a majority in parliament, the 401 MEPs of her centre-right group who plied the centre-left, liberals, and Greens who backed her last week must be kept onside now and for the next five years.</p><p>That will be very difficult as she tries to drag Europe to 90% climate neutrality by 2040, all the while maintaining prosperity and competitiveness - perhaps an impossible task.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ursula von der Leyen will now begin to assemble her new European Commission</emphasis>.

According to researchers at Queen's University Belfast, the lough is in hypertrophic status - the worst category of waterway nutrient pollution. More than 80% of the bacterial DNA tested from algal mats belonged to potentially hazardous microbes, including E.coli, salmonella and 11 others that can cause human illness. The scientists tested samples from mats of algae at Toome Lock, Rea's Wood, Antrim Boathouse and Ram's Island in 2023. Their work has confirmed the lough's hypertrophic status - the worst category of waterway nutrient pollution They found the samples to be 'dominated' by bacteria associated with wildfowl or livestock faeces or human-effluent wastewater treatment. And they detected a large amount of toxins, including one that has not been discovered on the island of Ireland before. Antrim and District Angling Club has urged members not to consume their catches, to take extra care when handling fish and take all precautions to wash and sanitise after contact with water and fish. Dr Neil Reid from the Institute of Global Food Security at the school of biological sciences in QU, was the lead author of the report, said farmers had a key role in addressing the problem. \"Technological solutions to better use slurry, for example, through anaerobic biodigestion, as well as good on-farm wastewater management is needed urgently on most farms,\" he said. \"So-called 'nature-based solutions' such as planting vegetation and leaving buffer strips along waterways or creating drainage swales, willow plantations and reedbeds could dramatically reduce the environmental footprint of farming avoiding any conflict with the productivity and profitability of the agriculture sector.\" He called for government to support a \"just transition\" for the agricultural sector, through agri-environment subsidies. \"Recent national and local political change should foster optimism that the environment and opportunities for change now exist,\" he said. The study, published in the journal Environment International, found the hazardous algal bloom (HAB) that developed in 2023 was \"an unprecedented environmental perturbation to an internationally important ecosystem\", likely due to a combination of excess nutrient in the water, climate change and the effects of invasive species. It says \"significant investment\" would be needed in wastewater infrastructure and in-lake remediation strategies. A Lough Neagh action plan is in place to address the challenges facing the largest body of freshwater in these islands. It includes a research programme to test potential solutions to the blue-green algal crisis. Addressing its members, Antrim and District Angling Association said: \"In recent weeks the large build up of Blue-green algal bloom has taken over the lough and has amassed as far up as the Airplane Pool at the Castle Gardens. \"Dr Neil Reid from Queens University confirmed not only the highest levels of hypertrophic contamination ever recorded on the Island of Ireland, but also the discovery of never before found bacterias that are extremely harmful to both animals and humans. \"We are now advising all members NOT to consume fish caught from the Six Mile River for the foreseeable future. \"Members are also advised to be extra careful when handling fish and take all precautions when fishing to wash and sanitise after contact with water and fish. \"We regret what is happening on our waters and as a committee, we want you to know that we, along with other lough based angling clubs and together with the UAF, LNP, LNT and SMWT are working hard to bring as much influence to remedy the algae problem. \"We trust you are enjoying your fishing and encourage you all to move to catch and release until further notice.\" With the Crumlin River also choked with green sludge, the Crumlin and District Angling Association has said that the situation is 'much, much worse than last year', adding: \"The system is broken and needs fixing. We must protect our natural resources.\" A spokesman for the Six Mile Water Trust added: \"We should note the risk to health. This is what we have inherited from years of mismanagement of our environment. \"Who's to blame for this ecological disaster? No easy or quick fix. However lets start with our rivers, that feed **** into the lough on a daily basis.\" Last week, environmental activists from the Sl\u00ed Eile group confronted the owner of the Lough bed, English aristocrat Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, the Earl of Shaftesbury, on his way to a private meeting with Queen's academics, and poured water over him. A statement said: \"Activists confronted the Earl of Shaftesbury and doused him with water from Lough Neagh, following his secretive meeting with academics at QUB. \"Save Lough Neagh and Sl\u00ed Eile Activists then held a protest against the Earl's visit. \"As one of our campaign demands, we demand the return of the beds and banks of Lough Neagh to the people of this island. While it is in the hand of an aristocrat who profiteers from the dredging of Lough Neagh's finite glacial sand deposits, it complicates solutions to fully grapple with the vast array of problems that need to be addressed \"With a democratically owned and governed Lough, we can better explore granting Rights of Nature status and can more effectively regulate the pollution that enters through the deluge of waste being dumped into our rivers and streams. \"That QUB is meeting secretly with a colonial aristocrat away from public eyes while we see scenes of utter devastation around the shores of the Lough is cause for grave concern. Any discussions around this ecocide need public scrutiny, public input and public representation in all decision-making. Loughshore communities have been ignored for too long. \"The Earl got a taste of the poisonous waters of Lough Neagh, the same waters that are now filled with dead and dying wildlife. We hope this small taste of the toxic sludge he and his family have contributed towards creating will incentivise him to hand over to the people of Ireland what was never rightfully his in the first place.\"</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ANTRIM-anglingcluburgesmembersnottoconsumefishasexpertssayalgalbloomsposepublichealthrisk52938</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ANTRIM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CRG-4N81-F03F-K0CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">482562</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><timeReceived>1:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Tontine Rooms Holding Company  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Antrim Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"39125\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 16, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe, Northern Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Americas, Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001538</classCode><className>SEAWEED &amp;

Other bird types that the area has a special conservation link to are the Common Scoter, Red throated Diver, Fulmar, Manx Shearwater, gannet, Shag, Cormorant, Kittiwake, Black headed Gull, Herring Gull, Roseate Tern, Common Tern, Arctic Tern, Sandwich Tern, Mediterranean Gull, Puffin, Razorbill and Guillemot.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WICPEO-https://www.independent.ie/regionals/wicklow/wicklowdistrict/newprotectedareagoodnewsforwicklowsbirdsdeputystevenmatthews/a447098040.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WICPEO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5G-YX01-JCRS-G00V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304307</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wicklow People (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40443\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 23, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQOU</classCode><className>MARINE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001074</classCode><className>MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001840</classCode><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRM1</classCode><className>OFFSHORE ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DROD</classCode><className>RENEWABLE MARINE ENERGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQOU</classCode><className>MARINE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001074</classCode><className>MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRM1</classCode><className>OFFSHORE ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album Acrasia back in 2019. His latest single, If You Want A Good Dream, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on I Don't Want to Know - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, Sleeping with Ghosts. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>Daire Heffernan The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne</p><p>Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream.</p><p>Ahmed, With Love Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like Whatchimacallit deserve a wide audience. He's prolific, too. Another song - Wok To Blackrock - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>Baba Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, Sad Party, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of 1\u00ff\u00ff% Her - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring.</p><p>Tayne Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, Love, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, Good Vibrations, was a hoot. Ordinary Love, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, Saipan, will be huge. A big-screen</p><p>dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>Cara Loftus Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on The Last Duel, Disenchanted and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. An impressive</p><p>list, but Dubliner Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut Spilt Milk, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak.</p><p>First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama The Sparrow gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in The Listeners, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>Ella Lily Hyland Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in Fifteen-Love, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller Black Doves, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in Towards Zero - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica</p><p>Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama A Thousand Blows on Disney+.</p><p>Thaddea Graham The second season of Bad Sisters may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now.</p><p>Niamh Moriarty A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan</p><p>and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series Best Interests. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama September Says, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama Louise Lives Large, and is currently developing</p><p>a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences.</p><p>Sade Malone A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's Antigone, Marian Quinn's Twig was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's Sive at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series Hope Street, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025.</p><p>Peter Claffey Another Bad Sisters regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, a hugely anticipated prequel to Game of Thrones, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to</p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells. She has just launched a forest school, F\u00e1sta Go Fi\u00e1in (Grown Wild), in Cahersiveen, Co Kerry. It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (@stories_of_change_). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring. The autonomous nature of these crafts saves lives by taking humans out of harm's way and letting tech do this treacherous work. The continuous data collection Xocean vessels deliver assists our shift to renewable energy, aiding wind farm projects. Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured (EURO)30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful.</p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world.</p><p>Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A mustvisit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country. You can see them for yourself at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.retuned.ie\">www.retuned.ie</url>.</p><p>David Hartigan 'Every job is a climate job' is an adage exemplified by David Hartigan's centring of sustainability in his entrepreneurial pursuits. The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms. This entrepreneur-on-the-rise is moving to a bigger premises, where he'll install solar panels. The future looks bright.</p><p>Activists</p><p>Jenny Maguire In February 2024, Jenny Maguire was elected as the next president of Trinity College Dublin Students' Union in a landslide victory. An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued,\" she says, \"but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world\u2026\"</p><p>Sofiya Kalinova When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.</p><p>An Dream Dearg The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rightsbased Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish. Adelaide's activism goes beyond anti-racism; he has campaigned on the issues of housing, trans rights and Palestinian liberation to name but a few. Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights</p><p>and minority representation. She directs National Voter Registration Day, educating and empowering minorities to engage with the Irish political system. Fern\u00e1ndez trains migrants, asylum seekers and disabled groups, and mentors migrant women running in local elections. As leadership officer at the National Women's Council, she leads campaigns to promote women's leadership and representation, advancing inclusivity in Irish politics.</p><p>Manizha Khan Manizha Khan, formerly the dean of the dental school in Herat, Afghanistan, fled her home country with her family in 2021 and resettled in Cork. In addition to practising as a dentist, Dr Khan hosts My Life in a Suitcase on Radio UCC 98.3FM. Through this programme, she amplifies the voices of refugees, asylum seekers and their allies, fostering conversations on anti-war advocacy, anti-racism, inclusion, equality and respect. Dr Khan aspires to inspire hope and understanding, saying, \"I want people to learn that those seeking sanctuary at our doors have stories behind them.\"</p><p>James Stokes Having campaigned for his school to provide free sanitary products to people affected by period poverty, James Stokes has had a clear interest in combating society's inequalities from a young age. Stokes is a Traveller activist and aspiring politician who credits his grandfather - also an</p><p>activist - with inspiring him to stand up for what he believes in. Currently a student at Maynooth University and working as an education support worker, Stokes hopes to become a primary school teacher but also plans to continue working for change. \"I hope to continue being an activist that will stand up to the next government to demand a national Traveller mental health strategy,\" he says, adding he'd like to stand for election in the future.</p><p>Andrea Reilly Growing up in foster care is challenging, especially for children with disabilities. Andrea Reilly, who has fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and spent 18 years in care, uses her lived experience to inspire change. As an active member of the EPIC (Empowering People in Care) Youth Council, she advises EPIC and national stakeholders on issues impacting children and young people with disabilities in care. By sharing her story and engaging directly with decision makers, Reilly aims to inspire change and ensure better support for children with disabilities in care.</p><p>shion</p><p>Fa</p><p>Megan Williams Mayo-born jewellery designer Megan Williams got a lovely surprise this summer when she was sent a photograph of Zendaya wearing a pair of her freshwater pearl earrings. It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says. Now based in Lyon, Williams's focus for 2025 is to expand her stockists across France, Ireland and the UK, \"and to keep making beautiful things\".</p><p>Emmanuella Nkem Isede A fashion content creator since 2021, Emmanuella Nkem Isede is gaining a reputation for her big, bold and utterly singular styling. Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother.</p><p>\"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon. By day, he creates avantgarde pieces that are at the intersection of costume and haute couture. By night, he works with the legendary Susanne Bartsch, hosting and producing lavish parties. Mangru has produced two New York Fashion Week collections of his own, with a third coming in February. Meanwhile, his work is getting noticed by the people he has long admired, including Emmy award-winning costume designer Zaldy. The pair recently worked together</p><p>on the first-ever trans-inclusive Victoria's Secret show, with Mangru creating outfits for models including Valentina Sampaio and Gigi Hadid.</p><p>Ben Harte It was a big year for Meath-born production designer Ben Harte, who creates a world of his own through set design and fashion styling. During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plussize collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland. She's now signed by agencies in London, Milan and Paris and, after graduating from a bachelor's degree in spatial planning, she'll be dedicating the next year to modelling.</p><p>Arts</p><p>Rois\u00edn O'Donnell A slew of writers - from Elaine Feeney to Roddy Doyle - have heaped praise on the forthcoming debut novel Nesting by award-winning writer Rois\u00edn O'Donnell. Nesting is the story of a mother named Ciara Fay, who makes a split-second decision to leave the family home with her children and soon finds herself navigating the precarious housing system. O'Donnell's debut short story collection, Wild Quiet, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals The Stinging Fly and The Tangerine, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. Nesting will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. A Fix of Light is aimed at teens</p><p>aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing ( just look at the success of series Heartstopper), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world.</p><p>Anna Mullarkey Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play Safe House, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In Safe House - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from</p><p>Galway, composed the music for Safe House and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After Safe House completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>Allie O'Rourke Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show The Good Room and the film Scouting for Boys, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show Girl D**k Energy to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>Jessie Thompson This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show Crawler at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>Wendy Erskine Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel The Benefactors being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in The Benefactors, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, Sweet Home and Dance Move, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>Dave Tynan Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature Dublin Oldschool, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in Winter Papers and The Stinging Fly, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, We Used to Dance Here, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\". Sign us up.</p><p>Mike Rice Fans of the Northern Irish comedian Vittorio Angelone will be familiar with Mike Rice, a fellow comedian who's his co-star on their podcast Mike &amp; Vittorio's Guide to Parenting (key point: neither have children). With his first-ever Vicar Street show set for September next year, it looks like Rice is building towards bringing his comedy to the next level in 2025. Irreverent and with a gift for impressions, the Kilkenny native is gathering a large fanbase on social media, which Ireland's comics are finding a solid base from which to create a longterm career.</p><p>Fo od &amp;</p><p>drink</p><p>Anthony O'Toole Perched on the picturesque Carrig Rua Hill in north Wexford behind his parents' house, chef and food consultant Anthony O'Toole's tiny edible garden is home to over 500 varieties of organic heritage seeds and plants grown for flavour rather than yield. Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (@fattomato_)</p><p>Laura Chabal 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, Chabal is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French- Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year. The couple have been running the</p><p>Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin. O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota The Ib\u00edl\u00c8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00c8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00c8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his</p><p>partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg Estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination, which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p>Jennie Moran Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer</p><p>Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than (EURO)11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events</p><p>caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste.</p><p>Sebastian Skillings Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin</p><p>with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram</p><p>page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer.</p><p>John Kearns Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricksand-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus.</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-ofhouse half of the couple who secured</p><p>two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing</p><p>possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bech-bailey.com\">www.bech-bailey.com</url>.</p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under- 19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fasttracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria,</p><p>he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender</p><p>for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under- 23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Clockwise from left: artist and foodie Jennie Moran PHOTO: LOUIS HAUGH; singer Siobh\u00e1n Lynch, aka Baba; Cork five-piece Cliffords; and Dublin singer Daire HeffernanIrish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed, With LoveClockwise from top left: Dublin starlet Sade Malone; actor Ollie West; PHOTO: ELLIUS GRACE; Killiney teen Niamh Moriarty; Black Doves star Ella Lily Hyland; and Thaddea GrahamCircular fashion brand Aoife LifestyleClockwise from far left: Trinity SU president Jenny Maguire; Traveller activist James Stokes; councillor Darragh Adelaide; and lawyer Sofiya KalinovaClockwise: Production designer Ben Harte; designer and stylist John Mangru; and stylist Emmanuella Nkem IsedeClockwise from top: Musician Anna Mullarkey.

He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to Mr Claffey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Wasser</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells</p><p>Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells. She has just launched a forest school, F\u00e1sta Go Fi\u00e1in (Grown Wild) in Cahersiveen, Co Kerry. It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@stories_of_change_</emphasis>). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien</p><p>Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May</p><p>Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring. The autonomous nature of these crafts saves lives by taking humans out of harm's way and letting tech do this treacherous work. The continuous data collection Xocean vessels deliver assists our shift to renewable energy, aiding wind farm projects. Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured \u20ac30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful. </p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1</p><p>Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney</p><p>Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world. Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn</p><p>Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A must-visit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree</p><p>Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country. You can see them for yourself at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">retuned.ie</emphasis>.</p><p>David Hartigan</p><p>'Every job is a climate job' is an adage exemplified by David Hartigan's centring of sustainability in his entrepreneurial pursuits. The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms. This entrepreneur-on-the-rise is moving to a bigger premises, where he'll install solar panels. The future looks bright.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fionnuala Moran</emphasis></p><p>Activists</p><p>Jenny Maguire</p><p>In February 2024, Jenny Maguire was elected as the next president of Trinity College Dublin Students' Union in a landslide victory. An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. She says, \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued, but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world...\"</p><p>?Sofiya Kalinova</p><p>When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.?</p><p>An Dream Dearg</p><p>The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rights-based Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide</p><p>A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish. Adelaide's activism goes beyond anti-racism; he has campaigned on the issues of housing, trans rights and Palestinian liberation to name but a few. Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.?</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez</p><p>After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights and minority representation. She directs National Voter Registration Day, educating and empowering minorities to engage with the Irish political system. Fern\u00e1ndez trains migrants, asylum seekers and disabled groups, and mentors migrant women running in local elections. As leadership officer at the National Women's Council, she leads campaigns to promote women's leadership and representation, advancing inclusivity in Irish politics. \"I believe we create better policies when all members of society are fully represented in our local chambers and the Oireachtas,\" she says. \"I envision a D\u00e1il and local chambers that fully represent the diverse populations they are advocating for.\"</p><p>Manizha Khan</p><p>Manizha Khan, formerly the dean of the dental school in Herat, Afghanistan, fled her home country with her family in 2021 and resettled in Cork. In addition to practising as a dentist, Dr Khan hosts <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">My Life in a Suitcase</emphasis> on Radio UCC 98.3FM. Through this programme, she amplifies the voices of refugees, asylum seekers and their allies, fostering conversations on anti-war advocacy, anti-racism, inclusion, equality and respect. Dr Khan aspires to inspire hope and understanding, saying, \"I want people to learn that those seeking sanctuary at our doors have stories behind them.\"</p><p>James Stokes</p><p>Having campaigned for his school to provide free sanitary products to people affected by period poverty, James Stokes has had a clear interest in combating society's inequalities from a young age. Stokes is a Traveller activist and aspiring politician who credits his grandfather - also an activist - with inspiring him to stand up for what he believes in. Currently a student at Maynooth University and working as an education support worker, Stokes hopes to become a primary school teacher but also plans to continue working for change. \"I hope to continue being an activist that will stand up to the next government to demand a national Traveller mental health strategy,\" says Stokes, adding that he'd also like to stand for election in the future.</p><p>Andrea Reilly</p><p>Growing up in foster care is challenging, especially for children with disabilities. Andrea Reilly, who has fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and spent 18 years in care, uses her lived experience to inspire change. As an active member of the EPIC (Empowering People in Care) Youth Council, she advises EPIC and national stakeholders on issues impacting children and young people with disabilities in care. By sharing her story and engaging directly with decision makers, Reilly aims to inspire change and ensure better support for children with disabilities in care.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Niamh N\u00ed Hoireabhaird</emphasis></p><p>Fashion</p><p>Megan Williams</p><p>Mayo-born jewellery designer Megan Williams got a lovely surprise this summer when she was sent a photograph of Zendaya wearing a pair of her freshwater pearl earrings. It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says. Now based in Lyon, Williams's focus for 2025 is to expand her stockists across France, Ireland and the UK, \"and to keep making beautiful things\".</p><p>Emmanuella Nkem Isede</p><p>A fashion content creator since 2021, Emmanuella Nkem Isede is gaining a reputation for her big, bold and utterly singular styling. Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon. By day, he creates avant-garde pieces that are at the intersection of costume and haute couture. By night, he works with the legendary Susanne Bartsch, hosting and producing lavish parties. Mangru has produced two New York Fashion Week collections of his own, with a third coming in February. Meanwhile, his work is getting noticed by the people he has long admired, including Emmy award-winning costume designer Zaldy. The pair recently worked together on the first-ever trans-inclusive Victoria's Secret show, with Mangru creating outfits for models including Valentina Sampaio and Gigi Hadid.</p><p>Ben Harte</p><p>It was a big year for Meath-born production designer Ben Harte, who creates a world of his own through set design and fashion styling. During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland. She's now signed by agencies in London, Milan and Paris and, after graduating from a bachelor's degree in spatial planning, she'll be dedicating the next year to modelling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katie Byrne</emphasis></p><p>?Arts</p><p>?Rois\u00edn O'Donnell</p><p>A slew of writers - from Elaine Feeney to Roddy Doyle - have heaped praise on the forthcoming debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> by award-winning writer Rois\u00edn O'Donnell. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> is the story of a mother named Ciara Fay, who makes a split-second decision to leave the family home with her children and soon finds herself navigating the precarious housing system. O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winter Papers</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis>, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Used to Dance Here</emphasis>, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\". Sign us up.</p><p>?Mike Rice</p><p>Fans of the Northern Irish comedian Vittorio Angelone will be familiar with Mike Rice, a fellow comedian who's his co-star on their podcast <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mike &amp;amp; Vittorio's Guide to Parenting</emphasis> (key point: neither have children). With his first-ever Vicar Street show set for September next year, it looks like Rice is building towards bringing his comedy to the next level in 2025. Irreverent and with a gift for impressions, the Kilkenny native is gathering a large fanbase on social media, which Ireland's comics are finding a solid base from which to create a longterm career. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aoife Barry</emphasis></p><p>Food and Drink</p><p>Anthony O'Toole</p><p>Perched on the picturesque Carrig Rua Hill in north Wexford behind his parents' house, chef and food consultant Anthony O'Toole's tiny edible garden is home to over 500 varieties of organic heritage seeds and plants grown for flavour rather than yield.  Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@fattomato_</emphasis>)</p><p>Laura Chabal</p><p>Laura Chabal's 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, she is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French-Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year.  The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katy McGuinness</emphasis></p><p>Jennie Moran</p><p>Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste. </p><p>Sebastian Skillings</p><p>Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships.

He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to Mr Claffey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Wasser</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells</p><p>Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells. She has just launched a forest school, F\u00e1sta Go Fi\u00e1in (Grown Wild) in Cahersiveen, Co Kerry. It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@stories_of_change_</emphasis>). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien</p><p>Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May</p><p>Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring. The autonomous nature of these crafts saves lives by taking humans out of harm's way and letting tech do this treacherous work. The continuous data collection Xocean vessels deliver assists our shift to renewable energy, aiding wind farm projects. Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured \u20ac30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful. </p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1</p><p>Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney</p><p>Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world. Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn</p><p>Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A must-visit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree</p><p>Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country. You can see them for yourself at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">retuned.ie</emphasis>.</p><p>David Hartigan</p><p>'Every job is a climate job' is an adage exemplified by David Hartigan's centring of sustainability in his entrepreneurial pursuits. The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms. This entrepreneur-on-the-rise is moving to a bigger premises, where he'll install solar panels. The future looks bright.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fionnuala Moran</emphasis></p><p>Activists</p><p>Jenny Maguire</p><p>In February 2024, Jenny Maguire was elected as the next president of Trinity College Dublin Students' Union in a landslide victory. An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. She says, \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued, but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world...\"</p><p>?Sofiya Kalinova</p><p>When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.?</p><p>An Dream Dearg</p><p>The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rights-based Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide</p><p>A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish. Adelaide's activism goes beyond anti-racism; he has campaigned on the issues of housing, trans rights and Palestinian liberation to name but a few. Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.?</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez</p><p>After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights and minority representation. She directs National Voter Registration Day, educating and empowering minorities to engage with the Irish political system. Fern\u00e1ndez trains migrants, asylum seekers and disabled groups, and mentors migrant women running in local elections. As leadership officer at the National Women's Council, she leads campaigns to promote women's leadership and representation, advancing inclusivity in Irish politics. \"I believe we create better policies when all members of society are fully represented in our local chambers and the Oireachtas,\" she says. \"I envision a D\u00e1il and local chambers that fully represent the diverse populations they are advocating for.\"</p><p>Manizha Khan</p><p>Manizha Khan, formerly the dean of the dental school in Herat, Afghanistan, fled her home country with her family in 2021 and resettled in Cork. In addition to practising as a dentist, Dr Khan hosts <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">My Life in a Suitcase</emphasis> on Radio UCC 98.3FM. Through this programme, she amplifies the voices of refugees, asylum seekers and their allies, fostering conversations on anti-war advocacy, anti-racism, inclusion, equality and respect. Dr Khan aspires to inspire hope and understanding, saying, \"I want people to learn that those seeking sanctuary at our doors have stories behind them.\"</p><p>James Stokes</p><p>Having campaigned for his school to provide free sanitary products to people affected by period poverty, James Stokes has had a clear interest in combating society's inequalities from a young age. Stokes is a Traveller activist and aspiring politician who credits his grandfather - also an activist - with inspiring him to stand up for what he believes in. Currently a student at Maynooth University and working as an education support worker, Stokes hopes to become a primary school teacher but also plans to continue working for change. \"I hope to continue being an activist that will stand up to the next government to demand a national Traveller mental health strategy,\" says Stokes, adding that he'd also like to stand for election in the future.</p><p>Andrea Reilly</p><p>Growing up in foster care is challenging, especially for children with disabilities. Andrea Reilly, who has fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and spent 18 years in care, uses her lived experience to inspire change. As an active member of the EPIC (Empowering People in Care) Youth Council, she advises EPIC and national stakeholders on issues impacting children and young people with disabilities in care. By sharing her story and engaging directly with decision makers, Reilly aims to inspire change and ensure better support for children with disabilities in care.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Niamh N\u00ed Hoireabhaird</emphasis></p><p>Fashion</p><p>Megan Williams</p><p>Mayo-born jewellery designer Megan Williams got a lovely surprise this summer when she was sent a photograph of Zendaya wearing a pair of her freshwater pearl earrings. It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says. Now based in Lyon, Williams's focus for 2025 is to expand her stockists across France, Ireland and the UK, \"and to keep making beautiful things\".</p><p>Emmanuella Nkem Isede</p><p>A fashion content creator since 2021, Emmanuella Nkem Isede is gaining a reputation for her big, bold and utterly singular styling. Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon. By day, he creates avant-garde pieces that are at the intersection of costume and haute couture. By night, he works with the legendary Susanne Bartsch, hosting and producing lavish parties. Mangru has produced two New York Fashion Week collections of his own, with a third coming in February. Meanwhile, his work is getting noticed by the people he has long admired, including Emmy award-winning costume designer Zaldy. The pair recently worked together on the first-ever trans-inclusive Victoria's Secret show, with Mangru creating outfits for models including Valentina Sampaio and Gigi Hadid.</p><p>Ben Harte</p><p>It was a big year for Meath-born production designer Ben Harte, who creates a world of his own through set design and fashion styling. During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland. She's now signed by agencies in London, Milan and Paris and, after graduating from a bachelor's degree in spatial planning, she'll be dedicating the next year to modelling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katie Byrne</emphasis></p><p>?Arts</p><p>?Rois\u00edn O'Donnell</p><p>A slew of writers - from Elaine Feeney to Roddy Doyle - have heaped praise on the forthcoming debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> by award-winning writer Rois\u00edn O'Donnell. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> is the story of a mother named Ciara Fay, who makes a split-second decision to leave the family home with her children and soon finds herself navigating the precarious housing system. O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winter Papers</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis>, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Used to Dance Here</emphasis>, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\". Sign us up.</p><p>?Mike Rice</p><p>Fans of the Northern Irish comedian Vittorio Angelone will be familiar with Mike Rice, a fellow comedian who's his co-star on their podcast <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mike &amp;amp; Vittorio's Guide to Parenting</emphasis> (key point: neither have children). With his first-ever Vicar Street show set for September next year, it looks like Rice is building towards bringing his comedy to the next level in 2025. Irreverent and with a gift for impressions, the Kilkenny native is gathering a large fanbase on social media, which Ireland's comics are finding a solid base from which to create a longterm career. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aoife Barry</emphasis></p><p>Food and Drink</p><p>Anthony O'Toole</p><p>Perched on the picturesque Carrig Rua Hill in north Wexford behind his parents' house, chef and food consultant Anthony O'Toole's tiny edible garden is home to over 500 varieties of organic heritage seeds and plants grown for flavour rather than yield.  Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@fattomato_</emphasis>)</p><p>Laura Chabal</p><p>Laura Chabal's 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, she is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French-Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year.  The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katy McGuinness</emphasis></p><p>Jennie Moran</p><p>Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste. </p><p>Sebastian Skillings</p><p>Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KERMAN-https://www.independent.ie/life/theonestowatch2025irelandsrisingstarsandnewtalents/a2140604959.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KERMAN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DS1-W6S3-RRS7-73G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304298</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kerryman (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40445\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 28, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Business &amp;

He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to Mr Claffey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Wasser</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells</p><p>Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells.

It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@stories_of_change_</emphasis>). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien</p><p>Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May</p><p>Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring. The autonomous nature of these crafts saves lives by taking humans out of harm's way and letting tech do this treacherous work. The continuous data collection Xocean vessels deliver assists our shift to renewable energy, aiding wind farm projects. Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured \u20ac30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful. </p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1</p><p>Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney</p><p>Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world. Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn</p><p>Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A must-visit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree</p><p>Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country. You can see them for yourself at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">retuned.ie</emphasis>.</p><p>David Hartigan</p><p>'Every job is a climate job' is an adage exemplified by David Hartigan's centring of sustainability in his entrepreneurial pursuits. The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms.

An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. She says, \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued, but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world...\"</p><p>?Sofiya Kalinova</p><p>When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.?</p><p>An Dream Dearg</p><p>The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rights-based Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide</p><p>A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish. Adelaide's activism goes beyond anti-racism; he has campaigned on the issues of housing, trans rights and Palestinian liberation to name but a few. Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.?</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez</p><p>After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights and minority representation.

It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says.

Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon.

Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign.

O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winter Papers</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis>, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Used to Dance Here</emphasis>, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\".

Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@fattomato_</emphasis>)</p><p>Laura Chabal</p><p>Laura Chabal's 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, she is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French-Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year.  The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katy McGuinness</emphasis></p><p>Jennie Moran</p><p>Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste. </p><p>Sebastian Skillings</p><p>Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORKAN-https://www.independent.ie/life/theonestowatch2025irelandsrisingstarsandnewtalents/a2140604959.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORKAN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DS1-W6S3-RRS7-73BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corkman (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40452\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 28, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Business &amp;

He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to Mr Claffey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Wasser</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells</p><p>Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells. She has just launched a forest school, F\u00e1sta Go Fi\u00e1in (Grown Wild) in Cahersiveen, Co Kerry. It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@stories_of_change_</emphasis>). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien</p><p>Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May</p><p>Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring.

Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn</p><p>Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A must-visit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree</p><p>Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life.

An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. She says, \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued, but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world...\"</p><p>?Sofiya Kalinova</p><p>When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.?</p><p>An Dream Dearg</p><p>The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rights-based Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide</p><p>A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish.

It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says.

Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon.

During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland.

O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson.

Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east.

The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead.

She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks.

Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WICPEO-https://www.independent.ie/life/theonestowatch2025irelandsrisingstarsandnewtalents/a2140604959.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WICPEO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DS1-W6S3-RRS7-73KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304307</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wicklow People (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40443\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 28, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Business &amp;

However, several countries changed their position and the law was dropped from the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.agenda.No\">www.agenda.No</url> further meeting of the environment council is scheduled before the European elections in June, but Mr Ryan said the law could be stamped by any council.</p><p>A meeting of Ecofin, the council of economic and financial affairs ministers, is scheduled for April 12, and a council of foreign ministers meeting will take place later in the month.</p><p>Meanwhile, talks are under way to try to bring at least one of the U-turn countries back on board to give the law the necessary majority.</p><p>Mr Ryan said it would create serious problems if the law was jettisoned.</p><p>\"It completely undermines the European legislative process,\" he said.</p><p>\"You enter into negotiations, you conclude a deal and then one side abandons it.</p><p>\"How would any future deal be done when parliament might think, is it real or not?</p><p>\"Secondly, it's bad for nature and bad for farming.</p><p>\"We've a real opportunity to create new income streams, to protect nature and to support a new generation to go into farming and forestry, and this would undermine it.</p><p>\"It's also very bad for climate change because nature-based solutions are a cornerstone to what we need to do and if we don't start addressing that landuse element then everything else would be to no avail.</p><p>\"It's deeply worrying. It's not concluded yet, but it's not looking good,\" he said.</p><p>Most Irish MEPs voted for the law and it has the Government's backing.</p><p>However, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary oppose it. Hungary was initially supportive and its last-minute change of mind has precipitated the crisis.</p><p>Austria, Belgium, Finland and Poland are not helping by planning to abstain.</p><p>Mr Ryan said Ireland would still devise nature restoration programmes, using some of the (EURO)3.15bn climate and nature fund created last October.</p><p>However, he said the lack of EU-wide action was no small issue.</p><p>\"Withdrawing ambition on climate and nature protection is the last thing we need to be doing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-195275563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BNK-3591-JCBW-N0GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 29, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

As Bloom ventures into adulthood, nothing is considered too \"out-there\".</p><p>Louise Checa, a French-born landscape-architect-turned-garden-designer, has created a completely modular garden. That means her garden can be taken anywhere.</p><p>\"A garden is the expression of one's personality. I do hope that people pick up on that,\" Ms Checa said.</p><p>\"It's a very different way to approach gardening and this garden does reveal who I am.\"</p><p>However, the pragmatic nature of her design does not come at the cost of environmentalism \"If you look around you can see a birdhouse and a bug hotel,\" she said.</p><p>\"All of the plants are native Irish plants, and this garden uses timber made from eco-wood, which avoids chemicals being released into the soil over time\".</p><p>Sarah Buckley, the designer behind the Mind Yourself Garden, one of the winners of this year's Westland Horticulture Cultivating Talent Initiative, spoke about her garden's theme of escapism.</p><p>\"It's about engaging the mind,\" Ms</p><p>Buckley said of her design, which features plants of various textures.</p><p>\"When you're in the garden, it's a time to relax and a moment to mind yourself while you reconnect with nature, and in doing so enhance your mental health.\"</p><p>Landscape designer Nicola Haines has created a garden called Coming Home to Nature, which is sponsored by Fingal County Council.</p><p>\"We are trying to show that sustainable urban drainage systems need to be, and can be, incorporated,\" Ms Haines said.</p><p>\"Nature-based solutions are what people and households need, but most people don't know what they are.\"</p><p>The garden is unique in the way it peels back the layers of sustainability by showing several layers of earth and sediment and the benefits of sustainable drainage systems (SUDs) in realtime. \"The front of this garden is the how and the back is the why,\" she said.</p><p>Visitors to the festival are encouraged to walk, cycle or use public transport over the weekend.</p><p>The organisers suggest downloading a map and itinerary, bringing reusable water bottles and dressing appropriately for the conditions.</p><p>Met \u00c9ireann predicts the weather will be fair, with temperatures rising to 16C.</p><p>Bord Bia Bloom tickets are currently on sale on Ticketmaster.</p><p>\"A garden is the expression of one's personality.

His local village of Finchingfield - a picture-postcard hamlet based around a stone-cross war memorial on a green, next to a duck pond, overlooked by an old windmill and a 13th Century stone church - was constantly prone to serious flooding.</p><p>It has been, for as long as anybody who has been born or bred there can remember.</p><p>Indeed, the floods have been so high in the past that some residents have even been spotted surfing through the village.</p><p>When it floods, a number of homes in the village will flood, costing thousands in damages.</p><p>Granted, because of the size of the village, the flooding is on a very different scale to what has happened in places such as Midleton in East Cork, where during last year's Storm Babet more than 400 homes were damaged.</p><p>However, in October 2001, the area saw its worst flooding for decades, during what was described at the time as the first floods of Britain's \"new wet season\".</p><p>Finchingfield was one of a number of villages in Cambridgeshire and Essex to be cut off, as around 75mm of rain fell in one day alone, leaving thousands of hectares of land under water.</p><p>\"The village tended to flood a couple of times a year, with water covering the road alongside the pond and caus ing localised disruption,\" said Archie. \"Every decade or so, a more significant flood event would impact homes and businesses.</p><p>\"The most serious flood event in living memory was in October 2001, which affected around 30 properties.\"</p><p>Hundreds of homes across Cambridgeshire and Essex were flooded and around 100 people had to be rescued from their homes.</p><p>Of the 20 severe river flood warnings around Britain at the time, one related to the River Pant, which flows in a south-easterly direction and is fed by the river that runs through the village.</p><p>The areas affected by flooding already had high levels of ground water from a series of floods that hit the affected areas the year before.</p><p>The area's underground aquifers - naturally-occurring bodies of rock and/or sediment that hold underground water filtered down from the surface soil above ground - were full.</p><p>They had not emptied as they would be expected to and, as a result, rivers and streams in the area were already high by the time the rain storms arrived in 2001.</p><p>That year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had also reported that the intensity of rainfall in areas around the world was getting worse.</p><p>In its report on the science of climate change, it warned: \"Global warming is likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of droughts and floods.\"</p><p>The impact of this change may have already started to be felt in Finchingfield but, due to a variety of reasons, there was little anybody could do about it.</p><p>Because it only - officially - has 18 properties listed as flooding risks, the village has always been low down on the list of priorities for authorities more focused on shoring up flood defences in more populated areas.</p><p>Added to this, the historic village is in a conservation area, which makes it harder for homeowners to make any structural changes to mitigate against flooding.</p><p>So, in 2018, after seeing what was happening with beavers in Devon, Archie decided to introduce them onto his estate.</p><p>His first pair was released into the first fenced-off enclosure on his estate in March 2019.</p><p>The initial pilot project was a partnership between his family's estate and Brit-ain's Environment Agency, with support from the Essex and Suffolk Rivers Trust, Essex Wildlife Trust, and a beaver expert called Derek Gow.</p><p>It was part-funded by a variety of organisations, including the Anglian Eastern Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (RFCC) and Coca Cola, via the Rivers Trust and the World Wildlife Trust.</p><p>Initially, it cost \u00a345,000 to erect beaver fencing, eight timber 'leaky' dams - usually made of logs strapped together - and some field-edge rainwater capture ponds. The two Eurasian beavers were introduced into the 10-acre enclosure, which consists almost entirely of woodland, in 2019 and they have since bred. There is now a family of 11 beavers there.</p><p>Two more enclosures, which cover a much larger area of some 100 acres, were constructed and a pair of beavers introduced into each of them in early 2023.</p><p>The work, carried out mostly in 2022, cost \u00a3380,000, a bill met by a variety of organisations including the East Anglian RFCC, various water utility companies, the county council, and the Environment Agency.</p><p>The estate now has about a dozen beavers in three different enclosures, with the last two running along the valley of the Finchingfield Brook, which flows into the nearby village.</p><p>In total, there is about 2km of meandering river within the enclosures, surrounded by woodland, farmland, and grassland.</p><p>How it works on the Spains Hall Estate farm and just about everywhere else is pretty simple.</p><p>As soon as the beavers arrive in their vast enclosures, which are usually centred around existing streams or small rivers, they start diverting the flow of the water to slow it down.</p><p>They do this by building their famous so-called 'leaky dams' with mud, tree logs, branches, twigs, and rocks.</p><p>They gather up the materials from a 10m-20m radius around the area they want to live in and drag or carry it with their hand-like front feet to where they want to build their dam.</p><p>The beavers gnaw away at the trees, which usually have a diameter of between 5cm and 15cm, although they are known to fell trees with a diameter of 80cm.</p><p>Archie said they are so good at felling trees that \"you rarely see flattened beavers\".</p><p>\"Basically, they chew away at the tree and as they get to the centre of it, they stop and listen to it,\" he said.</p><p>\"They are listening for any signs that the tree may be about to fall.</p><p>\"The closer they get to felling it, the more times they stop what they are doing to listen out for any creaking sounds.\"</p><p>The tree logs, branches, and other materials are put together by the beavers in such a way that they are compacted tightly enough to reduce the flow of water sufficiently to build up a reservoir or pond, usually to a depth of around one metre.</p><p>However, they do leak, and if the water falls below a certain level, the beavers repair them.</p><p>They are constructed across existing water courses and in such a way that when the beavers have enough water in their pond, the rest of the water they don't need carries on its downward course.</p><p>Pools of very slow-moving water are then created over time.</p><p>This has the knock-on effect of reducing the speed of water flowing downstream and helps reduce or eliminate extreme or flash downstream peak flows.</p><p>As well as regulating the flow of water, the dams also act as a natural water-filtration system.</p><p>This is because sediment and other debris in the water gets trapped in the so-called leaky dams.</p><p>As they need depth of water to feel safe, if they don't live in a den built into a river bank, they will build what are known as lodges, which are large, dome-shaped structures made up of tree branches and twigs, rocks, and mud.</p><p>They start building these by erecting a sturdy base out of branches and logs, which they drive into the bed of the stream or river they are going to live in.</p><p>Then they start building on the base until the structure is anything from 2m to 12m high, depending on the size of the beaver colony involved, and up to around 10m wide. Once built, and with the lodge's underwater entrance in place, it forms a safe place away from predators for beavers to sleep, keep warm in winter, and raise their families.</p><p>The big question is: Has Archie's beaver scheme worked?</p><p>The honest answer is either \"probably\", as Archie states on his estate's website, or it is \"impossible\" to say at this stage.</p><p>Asked how he can quantify how different things are on the estate in a flooding context to how they were five years ago, he replied: \"It's impossible to say categorically whether the scheme is preventing flooding.</p><p>\"But the Environment Agency, which has been monitoring the estate since before the project began, reports significant impacts.</p><p>\"Locals who were in the village at the time of the 2001 flood told me that in January 2021, when we experienced a significant storm, they felt the village would have flooded more seriously without the upstream project.</p><p>\"We are still working with our research partners to assess the full impact of the beavers, but we are confident enough in the early findings to commit to building much larger enclosures where more beavers can create more wetland.</p><p>\"Essentially we now have water all year round, whereas previously the estate was dry in summer.</p><p>\"This has encouraged wildlife to return, including water shrews.\"</p><p>One key witness to the suc cess of the project has to be Alex Robinson.</p><p>She is the sub-postmistress of Finchingfield Post Office, and she swears by the beaver project.</p><p>She said that once every one or two years, flooding would be so bad that the centre of the village would be blocked off for up to two or three days.</p><p>\"I think it is a fabulous project,\" said Ms Robinson.</p><p>\"It does really seem to have solved the flooding problems.</p><p>\"I can't remember, since the beavers have been in there doing their stuff and flooding their areas, the village flooding in the centre as it used to do.\"</p><p>She and Jane Welsh, who manages the post office shop, have been living in the village for 14 years, and they remember big floods that went up into the Fox on the Green pub.</p><p>\"Every other year, the water would block the centre of the village,\" Jane said.</p><p>Alex added: \"There were even a few years when we couldn't get insurance against flooding.</p><p>\"That has changed recently because the underwriters have reviewed things.</p><p>\"Since the project started, we have had no major flooding although there have been much more storms.\"</p><p>Another important question is whether beavers would be welcome in Ireland, where they would have to be introduced.</p><p>Various bodies are in little doubt what the answer is.</p><p>In a December 2020 article entitled 'The Case for Beavers in Ireland', which was published by the Irish Wildlife Trust, P\u00e1draic Fogarty said: \"Yes.\"</p><p>The ecologist wrote: \"We should be bringing beavers into Ireland on account of the clear advantages they can bring to restoring our shattered ecology.</p><p>\"Let them be our allies in the fight to clean our waterways, reduce flooding, and lock up greenhouse gasses.</p><p>\"In my view, they would be of benefit, helping to restore naturalness to our collapsed river systems while - at very low cost - helping to alleviate the effects of water pollution.</p><p>\"On the novel landscapes of the soon-to-be-rehabilitated Midlands bogs, they would accelerate the re-wetting of peatland and so would be climate-action heroes.\"</p><p>Mary Bermingham, who runs Galway's Burren</p><p>Nature Sanctuary with her husband Roy, said: \"I've been following with excitement as beavers make their return across Britain.</p><p>\"These industrious creatures, once extinct since the 1600s, are now thriving in places like Knapdale Forest in Scotland and several sites in England.</p><p>\"Beavers are more than just adorable - they are 'agents of change'.</p><p>\"By felling trees and building dams, they create wetlands that support a wide range of wildlife, from amphibians to birds and mammals.</p><p>\"In addition to enhancing biodiversity, beavers also help mitigate flooding by regulating water flow.</p><p>\"This could be particularly valuable in places like Kinvara, which struggles with flooding issues.</p><p>\"Nature-based solutions, such as willow wetland areas have been proposed to address this problem, but beavers could accelerate these efforts by naturally engineering the landscape.</p><p>\"Although there's debate about whether beavers were ever native to Ireland, we've already introduced other non-native species like Pacific oysters and pheasants.</p><p>\"So why not give beavers a chance?</p><p>\"The benefits to biodiver-sity, water quality, and flood management are clear,\" she said.</p><p>\"Beavers could be key players in restoring our damaged ecosystems and helping manage climate challenges.</p><p>\"Let's embrace them as natural allies in shaping a healthier environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The 2014 flood which hit the village of Finchingfield next to the Spains Hall Estate, in Braintree, Essex, in England</emphasis>.

At this juncture, in the first half of 2024, it is the case like never before because of a multiplicity of exacerbating factors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Record temperatures have been increasing month on month and are now the highest at any time in human history. Meanwhile natural systems have never been under so much pressure, depriving the planet of a great many nature-based solutions to global warming, and climate-related extreme weather events increase in number and severity.</p><p>Add to this a lack of urgency in applying known solutions, and geopolitical uncertainty that is not helping the collective pursuit of sustainability that is in all our interests. Arguably, delay on key political decisions is the new form of climate denial, given what science is indicating, most notably the rapid approach of climate tipping points.</p><p>In this year of elections   at home, elsewhere in Europe, in the UK and in the United States   political upheaval and short-termism risk rowback on climate policies that are needed as catalysts for decarbonisation at scale, ie ratcheting up renewables while phasing out fossil fuels.</p><p>Worsening the prospects, mega fossil fuel companies are abandoning their emissions targets for the coming decades and even their commitments to reaching net-zero emissions, which is insidious given what faces the Earth immediately.</p><p>It is hard to find optimism within that cauldron where polarisation and misinformation are constantly distracting and fuelling the perception that climate action is synonymous with economic pain, when benefits can be quickly realised in the form of cheaper energy, improved wellbeing (especially in cities) and less environmental pollution.</p><p>In spite of all of this, there are strong indications that the clean energy revolution is progressing well globally. The Renewable Capacity Statistics 2024 released recently by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that 2023 set a new record for renewables deployment in the power sector by reaching a total capacity of 3,870 gigawatts (GW). </p><p>However, this growth is unevenly distributed across the world, indicating a trend far away from meeting the critical target of tripling renewable power by 2030, while many developing countries are being cut off unfairly from the benefits of the energy transition.</p><p>The 473GW of renewables expansion was led once again by Asia, with a 69 per cent share (326GW). This growth was driven by China. Africa had some growth but it paled in comparison, with an increase of 4.6 per cent, reaching a total capacity of just 62GW.</p><p> This extraordinary surge in renewable generation capacity shows that renewables are the only technology available to rapidly scale up the energy transition aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement,  IRENA director general Francesco La Camera said.</p><p>Nevertheless, the data also serves as a telltale sign that progress is not moving fast enough to contain global average temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees.</p><p>La Camera added:  Policy interventions and a global course correction are urgently needed to effectively overcome structural barriers and create local value in emerging market and developing economies, many of which are still left behind in this progress. </p><p> The patterns of concentration in both geography and technology threaten to intensify the decarbonisation divide and pose a significant risk to achieving the tripling target. </p><p>In the EU, enhanced policy focus, increased permitting of renewables projects and heightened energy security concerns have become the main catalysts for rapid growth, apart from the increasing cost competitiveness of renewables compared to fossil fuel alternatives.</p><p>IRENA s  1.5 degrees scenario  recommends a massive scaling up of financing and strong international collaboration to speed up the energy transition, putting developing countries as a key priority. Investments are needed in power grids, generation, flexibility and battery storage. The pathway towards tripled renewable power capacity by 2030 also requires a strengthening of institutions, policies and skills, it says.</p><p>The Republic is scaling up across all these headings, with some indications of this in the latest issue of Sustainable Ireland. But key policy gaps remain and need to be urgently addressed, such as legislation on marine protected areas that will in turn facilitate the process of designating where offshore wind projects will be located. </p><p>If such issues are addressed and complemented by targeted investment under the priority headings identified by IRENA, the State s clean energy revolution can gather sufficient momentum to make the Government s ambitious climate targets realisable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20850343</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BW9-P6R1-DYS1-00S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 25, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

The Dublin Bay Biosphere which includes key natural sites such as Ireland's Eye, Howth Head, North Bull Island, the Tolka Estuary and Dalkey Island is one of the few highly urbanised biospheres in the world and the only one to include a substantial area of a capital city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Catering for the needs of a growing urban population alongside a large natural bay with protected species including brent geese, the harbour porpoise and little terns is no mean feat.</p><p>Unesco biosphere designation doesn't bring new regulations, but the Dublin Bay Biodiversity Conservation and Research Strategy (2022-2026) aims to integrate policy actions from the three local authorities (Dublin City, Fingal and D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown) and other partners.</p><p>With heavier rainfall in recent years, reducing the levels of polluted surface water running into the Irish Sea in Dublin Bay is one of the biggest challenges, according to Roy O'Connor, senior engineer with Dublin City Council.</p><p>\"We have an old drainage system in Dublin and rainwater from roofs, roads, driveways, mixed with dog and bird faeces, pollute the seawater in Dublin Bay,\" says O'Connor.</p><p>He claims - perhaps contrary to public opinion - that the wastewater treatment plant in Ringsend has a \"negligible impact\" on the water quality in Dublin Bay.</p><p>A recent study found that 55 per cent of the poor water samples gathered were caused by dog foul, 25 per cent by human faecal matter and about 20 per cent by bird fouling.</p><p>\"Our challenge is to slow the flow of rainwater runoff entering our drainage system with nature-based solutions (such as permeable pavements, planters, roof gardens, water butts) and we need to ensure we tackle dog owner behaviours on our beaches and along our coastline, as dog foul is multiple times more polluting than human foul,\" O'Connor says.</p><h>Nature-based solutions </h><p>Colin Gallagher, senior engineer with Fingal County Council, says nature-based solutions will be important to clean waterways and to alleviate coastal erosion in Dublin Bay.</p><p>\"We need to try to push public developments away from large green spaces and towards areas that have ponds, reed beds and other surface water features. We need systems that treat and hold water,\" says Gallagher. Such measures will not only slow down watercourses - thus alleviating flooding - but they will also improve the water quality while providing amenity and biodiversity.</p><p>Mitigating the effects of sea level rise is another big concern for Dublin Bay. The coastal research group, led by Prof Iris M\u00f6ller at the Department of Geography in Trinity College Dublin, is monitoring sand and silt deposits in Dublin Bay to better understand the coastal dynamics so that nature-based solutions can complement engineered defences along the coastline.</p><p>\"The coastline is already being protected by natural features such as North Bull Island and the sand spit off the protective wall on Merrion Strand near Booterstown. These features reduce the wave energy that hits the shore. But, research is now showing that seagrass can hold this sand and silt in place through their root systems,\" M\u00f6ller<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>explains.</p><p>However, seagrass beds require unpolluted waters to thrive, and Coastwatch Ireland surveyors found evidence in 2022 that some areas of seagrass in Dublin Bay were declining due to invasive seaweeds and polluted freshwater streams feeding into the sea.</p><p>Lorraine Bull, Dublin City Council biodiversity officer, says baseline data is important to monitor the seagrass beds. \"There is a seagrass restoration project in Baldoyle Bay and we need to understand the potential for restoration of seagrass in other parts of Dublin Bay,\" says Bull.</p><p>The new visitor access management plan for North Bull Island Nature Reserve includes signage clearly indicating parts of the island which are strictly for wildlife only, other areas where dogs can be kept on short leads and sectors where dogs can be off their leads outside of the summer bathing season.</p><p>\"We have baseline surveys of the impact on ground-nesting birds in the dunes there, so the next step is to repeat these surveys to see if there are improvements. We also plan to look at the grey seal populations in Dublin Bay but really we need to develop ecosystem research to develop management strategies for different species and habitats at the same time,\" Bull says.</p><h>Poolbeg peninsula </h><p>The Dublin Port plans to build Ireland's largest container storage facility on the Poolbeg peninsula next to Sandymount beach and the proposed Dublin Array offshore wind farm on the Kish and Bray Banks, about 10km from the coastline of Dublin, will also undoubtedly have some future impacts on the Dublin Bay Biosphere.</p><p>Oonagh Duggan from Birdwatch Ireland says while there are special protection areas (SPAs) for migratory wintering waterbirds on the shoreline, including an SPA for terns in Dublin Port, more Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are needed in Dublin Bay.</p><p>\"The Fair Seas report Revitalising Our Seas highlights areas of interest for MPA in the greater Dublin Bay,\" she says. She also expresses concern that wind farms are proposed in important areas for birds, such as the Kish Bank.</p><p>The Old Irish Goat Society conservation grazing project on the heathlands of Howth Head is deemed one of the successful measures to sustainably manage gorse and bracken as a wildfire prevention measure. Plans are afoot to trial similar conservation grazing methods on Killiney Hill shortly.</p><h>Dublin Bay Biosphere What is it? </h><p>Dublin Bay is one of 738 biosphere reserves around the world as designated by Unesco.</p><p>Originally the international body designated North Bull Island as a biosphere in 1981 because of its rare and internationally important habitats and wildlife. In 2015, this designation was expanded to cover the whole of Dublin Bay.</p><p>The core zone of Dublin Bay Biosphere comprises of 50km2 of areas of high natural value. These include the Tolka and Baldoyle estuaries, Booterstown Marsh, Howth Head, North Bull Island, Dalkey Island and Ireland's Eye. The buffer zone comprises 82km2\u00a0 of public and private green space such as parks, greenbelts and golf courses which surround and adjoin the core zones. </p><p>The transition zone comprises 173km and forms the outer part of the Dublin Bay Biosphere, including residential areas, harbours, ports and industrial and commercial areas.</p><p>Once designated, those in charge of the biosphere must commit to actively managing the area to \"promote a balanced relationship between people and nature\".</p><p>The Dublin Bay Biosphere partnership includes representatives of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin Port Company.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.5028282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MM-5VX1-JC8Y-84BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 6, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

Exposure to the toxic algae carries severe health risks for humans and animals alike, ranging from skin irritation to potentially fatal neurological damage.</p><p>Last summer, farmers and pet owners were warned to keep their animals away from affected waters, with a number of dogs dying after coming in contact with the blooms.</p><p>According to the report, 100% of river stretches in Northern Ireland failed to meet 'good' overall status, and 12% were given either poor or bad overall status.</p><p>There were 450 river stretches here measured, and almost 70% failed to meet the requirements for good ecological status, with just two reaching high ecological status.</p><p>Six major rivers run into Lough Neagh, and all rivers surveyed were given a moderate chemical status, while none achieved high status. Toxic chemicals in the water from plastic and the presence of mercury in animal and plant life were common contributors to rivers failing to meet high status.</p><p>Agriculture and land management emerged as significant contributors to nutrient pollution, affecting nearly 300 of the Northern Ireland river stretches assessed. Other main pollutants come from sewage, urban runoff - or 'storm drain pollution' - and industrial activities. All are exacerbated by increasing water land temperatures, as well as more frequent severe weather events such as prolonged, heavy rain leading to flooding and periods of drought, as stated by the findings.</p><p>Mr Horton said that the data makes it clear that \"all rivers in Northern Ireland are in a desperate state and subjected to multiple cumulative pressures negatively impacting water quality\".</p><p>\"This report is an alarm bell to every local community, citizen, politician, landowner, and our business community that we need to take collective action now if we want to improve and protect this vital freshwater resource that we all depend on and avert a deepening environmental and ecological crisis,\" he said.</p><p>He continued: \"Despite the dire current state of our rivers, I remain optimistic because, as this report shows, almost all the pressures negatively impacting our rivers, loughs and groundwater are caused by human activities and it is therefore within our gift to reverse some of these impacts.</p><p>\"With the support of political representatives providing legislation and funding, as a society, we can work together to change behaviours and initiate catchment-scale, nature-based solutions to tackle the pressures polluting our freshwater resources.\"</p><p>The Department for Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs has been contacted for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Algae bloom: The shore of Lough Neagh at Ballyronan Marina last September AODHAN ROBERTS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-194507336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BF0-4VB1-JCBW-N1GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

That gives insects a chance to thrive.</p><p>\"Our farm is in ACRES, and rearing Dexters as a native Irish breed option was one of a list of actions we signed up for.</p><p>\"We also selected maintaining stone walls, and opted for the extensive grassland initiative whereby we don't spread more than 40kg of nitrogen per hectare to encourage flowering and grasses.</p><p>\"We also installed bat boxes, and we sowed one hectare of wild bird cover, including linseed and oats, to provide different types of seed for the birds over the winter.</p><p>\"Under ACRES, a farmer gets (EURO)200 per livestock unit for the Dexters. They are a small, hardy breed, and half the size of conventional breeds, so they aren't hard on the ground, they don't do much poaching, and they are relatively easy to maintain.</p><p>\"They are not quite as quiet as your Hereford or Angus cattle, but they do like to find a quiet corner to calve.</p><p>\"We bought them from two farms near Athlone, Co Westmeath, where they had a few surplus heifers for breeding, and we bought our own bull.</p><p>\"The Dexters are later maturing, at about 28 months, and the carcass is so small that there are only a small number of factories taking them.</p><p>\"We butchered one heifer a year ago for our own use, and it is lovely meat. Because they are grass-fed, the fat is a bit yellower than the conventional white fat that intensively fed animals have.\"</p><p>Keither got involved at at Ballyloughane - on a headland overlooking Galway Bay - through Galway City biodiversity officer Paula Kearney. Paula explains that she was looking for nature based solutions to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and support biodiversity.</p><p>\"We had previously managed Ballyloughane's land as a 'no mow' area under the All Ireland Pollinator Plan,\" she says.</p><p>\"However, even mowing just twice a year wasn't that effective, and was producing more green waste, and I was looking at different conservation grazing projects.</p><p>\"I contacted Joanne Masterson, Teagasc soils and environment advisor, who put me in contact with Keith.\"</p><p>The project is named 'Buaile B\u00f3', after the Irish word for a cattle enclosure. Already, celandine is flowering, along with willow, and Keith and</p><p>Paula have seen skylark, meadow pipits and snipe nesting in the grassland. \"The wet weather has really affected farmers very badly, stock can't be let out, but the Dexters are such a light breed that they can winter outside and really don't do so much damage,\" Keith says.</p><p>\"This field is slightly over a hectare, and they have been grazing here since February 19, and have done a really good job.</p><p>\"They have left tufts and clumps for pollinators and invertebrate species. And they have been a real attraction for people in Renmore and further afield, and we have had well over a thousand school children coming out to visit them.\"</p><p>Keith visits the herd several times a week, and Paula's team monitors them daily, while there is security at night.</p><p>\"We will take the Dexters back to the farm in early May, and return them here in September,\" he says. \"Depending on grass growth, we might be able to leave them here till Christmas.</p><p>Galway City Council ran a competition with schoolchildren to select names for the herd, and the mayor picked five nominations out of a hat: Coffee Cake, Ashley, Fern, Dovey and Mootilda.</p><p>\"Well, I still only know them by their tag numbers on my phone!,\" says Keith.</p><p>\"I think these Dexters like all the company they are getting and might not want to come home. The sea air and scenery is certainly much better than in Turloughmore!\"</p><p>Keith also has a day job, apart from farming, as dry stock advisor with Teagasc in Athenry. Having studied agricultural science at UCD, he has worked with Teagasc for nine years . \"I also present a weekly agricultural programme, Country Life, on Galway Bay FM radio,\" he says.</p><p>He also manages to find time for post-graduate studies, hoping to finish an MSc in agriculture innovation and entrepreneurship at University of Galway in August.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>'Dexters are a small, hardy breed, and half the size of conventional breeds, so they aren't hard on the ground, they don't do much poaching, and they are relatively easy to maintain'Keith Fahy with his Dexter herd at Ballyloughane, Renmore, Co Galway.

That stench of sewage seeping out from carpets, skirting boards and floor coverings. The sounds are always the same, too: the squelching of liquid under your feet as you walk from room to room.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the experiences are also always the same: \"It came so fast, we had no chance\u2026 We never had anything like this happen here before\u2026 It was like something surreal, like something out of a film.\"</p><p>Since I was appointed Minister for the Office of Public Works (OPW) in the summer of 2020, I've visited a number of communities, which are now bound by a common thread: they've all been flooded. These include Bandon, Kenmare, Clifden, Bantry, Enniscorthy, Cork City, Glanmire, Carlingford, Kilmallock, Listowel, Tralee, Skibbereen, Bridgetown, Rosslare and Midleton. They're miles apart from each other, but the stories of devastation and destruction visited upon each of them are so similar.</p><p>Thankfully, we have been lucky that lives weren't lost, given the magnitude and severity of some of these events. For example, after Storm Babet wreaked havoc in East Cork, costing millions of euro, it went on to do the same and tragically resulted in a number of fatalities in the UK.</p><p>Talking to the local authority personnel across the country and officials from the OPW who routinely have to go out to face the aftermath of such events, there is no doubt that the frequency and severity of these events is increasing rapidly. The climate is not changing, it has already changed.</p><p>While the frequency of these events has accelerated, the speed at which those same local authority and OPW teams including engineers, project managers and others are allowed to deliver protection schemes has in reality slowed.</p><p>The time it now takes to deliver a flood relief scheme that will protect people has been lengthened by years, and the ambition of some to extend that process even further is supported in some quarters.</p><p>We know from experience that completed flood relief schemes work and are effective at protecting communities. Just look at the places where schemes are in place including Clonmel, Ennis, Mallow, Bandon, Clonakilty and lots of others. Places such as Athlone and Clonlara will soon join that list. All of these were once synonymous with the news reports that dominated our bulletins, but no longer.</p><p>So if we know they work, why aren't we delivering them faster to other towns? The simple answer is we're not allowed. We require planning permission that is largely based on legislative requirements. The bottom line is that towns waiting for protection for years must sit and wait longer.</p><p>In seeking to obtain planning permission before any construction, the OPW and councils are often wrongly accused of being environmental vandals who seek to destroy our biodiversity and nature. In some cases, we need permission just to carry out the surveys needed for a planning application. The OPW and the councils very much value our biodiversity and our environment and we have strategies, policies and work practices for them within which we operate. But we also value the lives of our neighbours including those who worry about being drowned in bed. In short, we strive to prevent the catastrophic devastation wrecked on towns and villages.</p><p>We are sometimes accused of not adapting to new methods, including nature-based solutions, but anyone who looks at the Clonakilty flood relief scheme would see that this is not the case.</p><p>Nature-based solutions do have a role, but exclusive focus on these often fails to recognise where the water is actually coming from, and its hazard, such as a flashy, overcome stream on a mountain with a village directly underneath or a massive tidal surge driven by powerful onshore winds or by gales.</p><p>Our ambition is to keep the water out of people's homes and businesses. We will, and do, use all technologies, methodologies and international best practice to achieve that. While our designers, project managers and engineers survey the destruction of towns and villages with devastated families, we are more acutely aware of the importance of our work. It drives us on to try to deliver, in the face of the many challenges we face.</p><p>Ireland has some very difficult challenges facing it in terms of the communities that live alongside rivers or in proximity to the coast - and whether they will still be able to live there in 10 or 20 years.</p><p>As an island, we face threats from rainfall and from the sea.

Humanity will not limit global heating to safe levels or stem the ongoing loss of wildlife without them. From the boreal forest that stretches around northern Europe, Siberia, and Canada, to the Amazon, Earth's forests are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet, home to species found nowhere else.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet all too often, forests are worth more money dead than alive - despite promises from global leaders to halt deforestation. Their exploitation has pushed many plants, animals and fungi to the brink of extinction, while slowly degrading their ability to generate rainfall, sequester carbon and cool the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the race to create incentives to preserve forests rather than cut them down, the carbon-offsetting market has taken centre stage. Forest-offsetting schemes often sell credits on the basis that they will fund conservation schemes, protecting sections of forest that would otherwise be cut down - thereby preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.</p><p>Scientific research and journalistic investigations, however, indicate that many of these schemes are essentially \"hot air\" and failing to protect forests as promised. As some major firms reassess their use of forest credits, it raises questions about how we pay for and in-centivise the protection of these crucial ecosystems.</p><p>Here are five ways that experts have suggested we could tip the balance in favour of keeping forest ecosystems alive.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1: Pay countries to look after forests</emphasis></h><p>At Cop28 in Dubai, the Brazilian government put forward proposals for a multibillion-dollar global fund that would reward countries for conserving forests and penalise them for deforestation. Tasso Azevedo, a forest expert and adviser to president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said countries could be paid $ 30 a year for every hectare of forest they kept intact, while being penalised for every hectare lost.</p><p>\"Imagine you have a country that has 1,000 hectares of forest. If you maintain the forest, you will get $ 30,000, but if you clear cut 10 hectares, you get nothing,\" he told a side event at the summit.</p><p>In order to qualify for the Tropical Forests Forever fund, countries would have to meet three conditions: Keep deforestation below 0.5% a year; have forest loss trending downwards or keep it below 0.1%; and give the majority of funds to the people looking after the trees. The fund could be could be financed by putting a charge on fossil fuel sales, Azevedo said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2: Ban goods that harm forests</emphasis></h><p>Coffee, beef, rubber, soy and palm oil have driven the destruction of huge areas of forest - releasing vast carbon emissions along the way - and are often consumed in countries thousands of miles away from the Amazon or the Congo basin where they are produced.</p><p>To make sure European consumers are not driving further demand for forest loss, the EU has introduced strict regulations on high-risk products. From 2024, firms working in deforestation hotspots must certify that their goods have not harmed forests after a cutoff date of December 31, 2020. If countries like China and the US also introduced restrictions on deforestation-linked commodities, economic demand would probably fall sharply, lessening the incentive to further clear forests. However, this does not solve the problem of finding alternative livelihoods.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3: Introduce a global tax</emphasis></h><p>Barbados's prime minister, Mia Mottley, has been a strong advocate for an international tax that follows the \"the polluter pays\" principle to generate climate finance. This could also include funding nature-based solutions, such as forest protection, say experts.</p><p>By taxing oil and gas profits or the global financial system, Mottley argues that the huge sums required for the global energy transition and future climate resilience could be raised. Propon ents say that money should also go to protecting climate-critical ecosystems, without which global heating cannot be limited to 1.5C.</p><p>\"If we took 5% of oil and gas profits last year - oil and gas profits were $ 4tn - that would give us $ 200bn,\" Mottley said at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai earlier in December, as she discussed the need for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4: Swap a developing country's debt for spending on nature</emphasis></h><p>Many of the world's most nature-rich countries are also the most indebted, meaning that they struggle to pay for conservation. By refinancing debt at a lower interest rate in exchange for commitments on conservation, debt-for-nature swaps are growing in popularity and could be used to finance forest protection.</p><p>Earlier this year, Ecuador struck the largest deal of its kind, refinancing $ 1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Gabon has entered into a similar deal to unlock money for marine conservation.</p><p>At Cop28, Colombia - the host of next year's UN biodiversity summit, Cop16 - was a leading voice on calling for more action on debt relief in exchange for climate and nature finance. The country's president, Gustavo Petro, has said that biodiversity will be the basis of the country's economic wealth after it transitions away from fossil fuels, but his environment minister, Susana Muhamad, warned that debt was hindering the transformation.</p><p>\"For developing countries, the situation is critical, because many of our economies are highly indebted, especially after covid. We require fiscal space capacity for climate action to start making the real commitments,\" she said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Reform the carbon and biodiversity markets</emphasis></h><p>Despite deep flaws in the current system, world leaders and international institutions such as the World Bank have thrown their weight behind carbon markets as a tool for funding forest conservation globally. Supporters of carbon markets say that by purchasing high-quality credits, countries and companies could transfer some of the billions needed to keep forests standing as part of their efforts to offset their emissions. Cop28 negotiations on how to make this work ended in failure, however.</p><p>The sector is wrestling with human rights concerns, scientific evidence that many carbon credits are largely worthless, and lack of clarity about financial flows, but there are those who say it can still work. Among them is Johan Rock-str\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and chief scientist at Conservation International, which manages a number of carbon-offsetting projects.</p><p>\"On the one hand, the voluntary carbon markets on nature are not working, and there's reason to be deeply concerned about how they are misused as offsetting mechanisms for companies that are not following the scientific pathway on fossil fuel phase-out,\" said Rockstr\u00f6m \"On the other hand, we need nature-based solutions more than ever. We need finance more than ever, and we don't have another mechanism,\" he said.</p><p>n Guardian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Forests are worth more money dead than alive - despite promises from global leaders to halt deforestation.'</emphasis> Picture: Eamonn Coyle</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69XY-5GC1-DYRW-V2BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

We have 112 talented candidates who will run for the party in the local elections right across the country this June. They are on the doors. They are listening to people. They are already working hard to make a real difference to people's lives and livelihoods. And they will do more. Because the Greens don't do auction politics. We do action politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've been in Government for the past four years and in that time we have delivered more than any other small party in the history of this State. Perhaps nobody put it better than Michael</p><p>Healy Rae TD when he said last year that: 'The Greens are doing exactly what they said they would. They're even doing more than what they said they'd do.'</p><p>We've been at the forefront of the cost of living supports over the past two years, slashing public transport costs for the first time in 75 years, introducing the Leap Card throughout the country so that people everywhere can get even further travel discounts. We also spearheaded the energy credits that every household received to help offset some of the energy cost shocks caused by Mr Putin's illegal war on Ukraine.</p><p>Every week 1,000 more households are waking up in warmer homes with lower fuel bills thanks to the retrofitting grants the Greens introduced in Government. More than half of the retrofitting budget is targeted specifically at providing totally free retrofits for low-income or energy-risk homes.</p><p>We got rid of planning permission and abolished VAT on solar panels and now they are popping up on 100 new homes every day, allowing people to generate their own clean energy and halving their electricity bills. Good for the planet and good for the pocket.</p><p>My colleague Roderic O'Gorman is the first Children's Minister to halve the cost of childcare for hard-pressed young families.</p><p>We are the first political party in a century to turn the neglect of rural transport around. In rural Ireland, we are opening a new bus route every week. I was at Colbert Station in Limerick last week. There were packed buses heading to Hospital, Bruff and Mitchelstown. A massive 308million passengers chose public transport last year, up nearly 25% on the previous year. More than 3 million people took Local Link services. Since we came into Government, passenger numbers on these routes have gone up by over 300% on average. In many places it's multiples of this. In Kerry, it's 1,700% and in Galway it's 1,600%.</p><p>We're not just transforming connectivity on the ground, we're doing it digitally too. Since Ossian Smyth took charge of the National Broadband Plan, it has been rolling out at speed. Within the next three years, every home in rural Ireland will have access to gigabit broadband. During Covid, a lot of people returned to their hometowns to work. Roderic</p><p>O'Gorman introduced a new law giving workers the right to request remote working and we have created a network of remote working hubs across the country, breathing new life and business into rural towns and villages.</p><p>I think this progress is unstoppable because Irish people like it. Irish people get climate and understand the serious threat that it poses.</p><p>A national survey carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tells us that 85% of Irish people take climate seriously. Only a tiny proportion, maybe 4 to 5%, are climate deniers.</p><p>But they are very busy, disproportionately sowing an alternative politics based on fear and division, mostly online. This new politics seems to combine a fear of migrants with a denial of climate change.</p><p>It does not realise that climate change will be the greatest driver of migration as this century progresses. It does not speak to the traditional values of respect, decency and humanity that I grew up with and that I see going around the country.</p><p>It is this type of politics that likes to pit the Greens against farmers. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have said again and again that farmers are the frontline heroes in the climate challenge.</p><p>But respect won't put money in the bank. We have to reward farmers and farm families properly for their work, their expertise and their produce. We also have to provide viable, alternative income streams so that farmers and rural communities benefit financially and socially from adopting the nature-based solutions that will protect us all.</p><p>We are living in perilous times. War has returned to Europe. Gaza has seen untold suffering. Democracy is being destabilised throughout the world. These realities are all the more tragic because they are diverting us from the existential threat of climate change.</p><p>Each of the last ten months have been the warmest in recorded history. In Ireland, that has meant endless rain. Our fields are sodden. Our waterways are tipping over. Our food security is threatened.</p><p>It doesn't have to be this way. We can succumb to a climate of populism and protectionism or we can turn to a climate of hope.</p><p>I have seen over 30 years in public life that we can both protect the environment and maintain a strong economy, while at the same time lowering bills, improving our quality of life and ensuring a secure future for our children and their children. We can help the world by making our own homes and communities better. Let's keep going green.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-195815502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BVH-6TP1-JCBW-N42C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

These pronouncements from economic \"heavyweights\" should bring urgency to the mainstreaming of biodiversity into business, making \"green jobs\" part of the regular economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Businesses are working to reduce nature-related risks throughout their supply chain. Regulation around environmental social and governance criteria is tightening to prevent \"greenwashing\", where companies do not live up to the environmentally friendly image they have cultivated. The European Union taxonomy regulation, which lists environmentally sustainable activities, has established six environmental objectives including the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. One of the key limitations for mainstreaming biodiversity into business practice is the lack of trained people to take up jobs in the green economy.</p><p>A key new sector is the use of nature as infrastructure or nature-based solutions, where existing or restored ecosystems are used, designed or augmented to provide benefits such as protection from extreme weather, water filtration, flood control and pest control. The World Economic Forum estimates that the business opportunity created by using nature as infrastructure could total $160 billion and create four million jobs by 2030.</p><p>Specialists such as ecologists, environmental engineers and landscape designers are required to design and test nature-based solutions, but an understanding of nature-related issues also needs to be mainstreamed throughout the economy into the planning system, \"grey\" engineering solutions, government regulation and agriculture.</p><p>With almost full employment in Ireland, companies are faced with skills shortages across a range of areas, including green skills. There are solutions including training more graduates in zoology, botany, environmental science, ecology, biodiversity and conservation and combinations of traditional disciplines such as environmental science and engineering or statistics and sustainability. There are also opportunities for lifelong learning and upskilling within existing jobs. Skillnet Ireland has a climate-ready programme to prepare businesses for climate change.</p><p>The Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management has developed a \"green jobs for nature\" website with details of career options such as in advising, conservation, data and mapping, ecology, environmental education, media and communications, policy development, project management and research. The renewable energy sector needs knowledgeable ecologists and biodiversity specialists to help design minimal-impact wind and solar farms to ensure our renewable energy is truly \"green\".</p><h>Nature positivity in business </h><p>Younger workers are particularly concerned with environmental, social and governance commitments of the companies they work for; a report from KPMG earlier this year showing that a third of 18-24 year old UK workers have turned down job offers from companies which do not align with their values. Therefore the move towards nature positivity in business is not just good for the planet, it also helps ensure sustainability of the business model itself by maintaining a skilled and motivated workforce.</p><p>Biodiversity is a complex concept ranging from genetic diversity to species diversity to the diversity of functions within an ecosystem. Designing, protecting and restoring ecosystems rich in biodiversity requires a wide range of skills, some of which were previously considered overspecialised, but which are now in high demand. The ability to recognise habitats, plants and animals, understand their functions and what contributions they make to people are critical to how global economies will function and how we will live and work over the coming decades.</p><p>Yvonne Buckley is an ecologist at the Irish Research Council and laureate and professor of zoology at Trinity College Dublin</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.5035140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68T3-KHS1-DYS1-036F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 27, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Kevin O'Sullivan reports</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The loss of nature is a crisis running in parallel with climate disruption. Yet restoring biodiversity can bring a double dividend, helping to bring ecosystems back to a healthy state and countering many of the consequences of global warming. It has a critical role in making a sustainable world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a reality being faced up to by many businesses eager to play a meaningful role, including supporting the deployment of nature-based solutions. Out of this more holistic approach a new system of biodiversity credits is being established, which takes in a landmark initiative recently announced in Ireland.</p><p>Biodiversity credits are legal and financial instruments, serving as tradeable assets. Their value is primarily derived from their ability to facilitate absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and significantly bolster biodiversity. They are equivalent to an eco-friendly certificate that shows you have made a piece of land healthier for nature, allowing it to support more plants and animals as well as absorb carbon dioxide.</p><p>Irish speciality coffee group<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Coffeeangel is joining forces with the Dunsany Estate in Co Meath and cleantech company Bionua in an initiative that will see it commit 5 per cent of profits over the next five years to buying biodiversity credits. This is the first time such a deal has been completed in Ireland   and only the second time across Europe.</p><p>As with carbon credits, transparent and verified data is critical to credibility. This is where Bionua comes in. It deploys cutting-edge technology to monitor nature in real time. Driven by AI, it utilises a combination of satellite multispectral imaging and ground-based sensors to accurately quantify carbon sequestration and biodiversity above and below ground.</p><p>This enables corporate organisations and SMEs to work with landowners to produce biodiversity credits. The lands, under long-term stewardship agreements, are dedicated solely to enhancing biodiversity and capturing carbon, using entirely natural processes and adhering strictly to a policy of causing no harm.</p><p>The first year of this deal with Coffeeangel, which supplies coffee and brewing equipment, entails removal and storage of a minimum of 80,000 kgs of carbon from the atmosphere at Dunsany nature reserve, while also protecting and enhancing its ecosystem.</p><p>The estate dates from the 11th century and covers an area of 650 hectares. Some 300 hectares have been dedicated to rewilding, forming the core of its nature reserve.</p><p> When I embarked on my journey of rewilding the land, the objective was simple: bring back nature,  explains Lord Dunsany, the film director and writer Randal Plunkett.  The goal was quickly achieved with species returning and increased biodiversity. Then came the second goal, making rewilding a mainstream concept. </p><p>Although the public was listening, other rewilding initiatives were slow to get started, he adds. </p><p> Landowners were fearful to buy into the concept as there was no way to make it financially viable. We needed a model that was not solely built on Government subsidies,  he says.</p><p> I am very proud of this initiative and the model we have created with Bionua and Coffeeangel. I m especially proud that it is an Irish collaboration. We are, after all, the green nation, and today it feels a whole lot greener. </p><p>In 2014 livestock agriculture ceased on the estate, allowing fields and forests to undergo rewilding. Such efforts yielded notable results, including a 35 per cent increase in bird populations. That resurgence includes a return of the corncrake. </p><p>This year marked a significant milestone, with the return of the woodpecker, a species not seen in the area for more than a century. The red kite and snipe, both integral to the local ecosystem, have also re-established a presence. Insect populations, including vital pollinators such as bees and dragonflies, have doubled in the past five years.</p><p>In terms of mammalian diversity, there has been a decrease in non-native grey squirrels, coupled with a welcome return of the pine marten and increases in otter in the rivers of the estate. The reserve s flora are also flourishing, with an abundance of wildflowers and plant species.</p><p>Founder of Bionua William Butterly says:  Through our biodiversity credits we are giving companies the chance to make a real-world difference locally by supporting the rewilding of nature and, in so doing, combating biodiversity loss. </p><p>This offers companies not just a way of meeting sustainability goals but a way to showcase their commitment locally to their customers, stakeholders and the public. </p><p> This is the first sale of credits of many that we envisage from our partnership with Dunsany nature reserve which has the capacity to produce hundreds of credits per month for organisations whether they are large corporates or SMEs,  adds Butterly.</p><p>The credits offer an incentive to large landowners to generate income by preserving and enhancing the biodiversity of their lands, he notes. </p><p> By purchasing credits organisations can also take nature-positive action to contribute to conservation of ecosystems, protection of endangered species and promotion of overall biodiversity, while also meeting their environmental and sustainability objectives,  he says.</p><p>The biodiversity credits produced by Bionua are to the ISO 14064-2 standard and independently verified. Sustainability reporting obligations have increased for organisations with the introduction of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which requires organisations to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities that relate to biodiversity.</p><p>Coffeeangel chief executive Karl Purdy adds:  As pioneers of the Irish speciality coffee scene, we understand the environmental challenges that our industry faces and that we have a responsibility to tackle these. </p><p>The company had a long-standing commitment to sustainability    whether that is using renewable-sourced energy to run our shops, using locally produced, fully recyclable packaging or launching social initiatives like our #YourCupOurFuture programme , says Purdy.</p><p>He accepts that these steps are not enough, given what is facing the world and the threat to biodiversity in particular, but says the continued rewilding of Dunsany nature reserve over the next five years  will allow us to practically, tangibly and verifiably offset our carbon impact .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20850136</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BW9-P6R1-DYS1-00SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 25, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS8F</classCode><className>LAND CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

Only eight out of 188 countries/ regions have taken such a step following the 2022 UN National Biodiversity Conference (COP 15).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ireland's plan could, however, be viewed as little more than window dressing if the ideas aren't followed by actions. For instance, Ireland currently has a 40% rating on the Natural History Museum's Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII), a measurement of factors such as crop area and landscape- scale pressures used to gauge the health of a nation or region's ecosystem.</p><p>\"At 40%, Ireland's biodiversity intactness remains below regional and global averages,\" explains Gemma Corrigan, head of policy and advocacy with FHL. \"If the BE is 90% or more, the area has enough biodiversity to be a resilient and functioning ecosystem.</p><p>\"Under 90%, biodiversity loss means ecosystems may function less well and less reliably. If the BII is 30% or less, the area's biodiversity has been depleted and the ecosystem could be at risk of collapse.\"</p><p>FHL has collaborated with Finance Earth to launch the UK's first nature-based blended finance fund, backed by \u00a330m seed investment from DEFRA (UK's Department of Agriculture). That fund will invest in nature-based solutions and businesses that operate across the nature restoration supply chain.</p><p>Meanwhile, FHL also manages the Federated Hermes Sustainable Global Investment Grade Credit Fund with cornerstone investor CCLA, a sustainable investment pioneer. That fund seeks to deliver a total return with a reduced environmental footprint compared to the benchmark, which is measured using carbon, water, and waste footprint metrics.</p><p>Gemma Corrigan will join a panel of global experts at Cantillon 2024, the tenth annual conference to be hosted by Munster Technological University (MTU) on Thursday, March 7, at Ballygarry Estate Hotel, Tralee.</p><p>Originally founded to honour the legacy of the pioneering economist Richard Cantillon, the conference will explore how business leaders can navigate complex transformation processes as they seek to commit to a resilient and prosperous world for generations to come.</p><p>Speakers will include executives representing Kerry Group, AIB, Fexco and Mitsui, along with leaders from Irish state and educational institutions. The summit is geared towards collective problem-solving approaches through cross-industry partnerships, public-private collaborations, and knowledge-sharing platforms.</p><p>\"There is a narrow window of opportunity for countries to have a positive impact on biodiversity. We are seeing a lot of investors going in the right direction. Some governments are taking positive steps, but we need to see more businesses follow suit,\" said Gemma.</p><p>\"With its biodiversity action plan, Ireland is an early mover. There are a lot of economic benefits that a country can reap from taking the right steps, especially in terms of a nation's ability to attract investment.</p><p>\"We are seeing huge investor appetite for funds that have a positive environmental impact. Globally, the fastest growing area of investment is into these impact funds. In the UK, we recently launched a fund with the UK government, whose benefits will include generating carbon credits.\"</p><p>There is huge interest among global investors in new funds that actively support the oceans, marine life, wetlands, kelp forests. Global investors are keen to invest in funds whose longevity is underpinned by their biodiversity impacts.</p><p>\"We really have to take these actions, of course, because inaction will have catastrophic consequences for the global environment,\" said Gemma. \"Pharma companies are very receptive to moving towards positive impacts, conscious that their customers and clients are demanding that they take these impacts into account.</p><p>\"Biodiversity is an under-appreciated issue that is of huge systemic importance, and it is one of the biggest risks and opportunities that I see over next decade as an investor.

nitf:lede=\"true\">KEVIN O SULLIVAN</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Environment and Science Editor  Much more Government investment in  environmental capacity at both State and civil society level  is required to address Ireland s biodiversity and climate crises   and to ensure Ireland s renewable energy ambitions are realised, according to a joint statement by environmental NGOs and representative bodies in Irish renewable energy.</p><p>Wind Energy Ireland  and the Irish Solar Energy Association  have joined forces with leading environmental NGOs including the Irish Wildlife Trust, BirdWatch Ireland  and Friends of the Earth  in calling for windfall corporation taxes to be used to resource and to build up expertise in Government departments and State bodies, while also strengthening environmental groups.</p><p>This was to ensure  an environmentally sound transition to a zero-carbon power system , they have told the Government in advance of the budget. </p><p>The country s renewable energy and environmental objectives are at risk due to lack of resources and expertise, they warn. </p><h>Restore nature The joint statement, which is unprecedented, sets out a range of targeted measures to protect and restore nature when scaling up the switch to green energy.</h><p>In light of State commitments to ramp up renewable energy sources in accordance with Ireland s legally binding carbon pollution limits, the organisations say greater funding must be in environmental protection, nature restoration and monitoring as part of the delivery of renewable and electricity grid infrastructure.</p><p>Lack of environmental capacity in State agencies is undermining renewables objectives and compliance with environmental law, while lack of resources among NGOs means  they are often prevented from substantially engaging in the planning and development process .</p><p>Their statement calls for a fast-track recruitment process for State bodies critical for delivering a zero-carbon power system and enhancing nature,  to ensure enough ecologists, for example, to progress their work in a timely fashion .</p><p>The climate and nature restoration fund should finance climate and nature infrastructural and capital investments,  including nature-based solutions .</p><p>A dedicated new funding stream is essential to support training and upskilling of existing staff in public bodies carrying out environmental impact assessment, it says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The bank is not in the top 15 of major project finance banks globally, and most have yet to adopt similar restrictions.</p><p>Jeanne Martin, its head of banking standards, said the move to limit finance to expansion projects and set climate tests for all clients was good to see, although it still had concerns, including around the bank's funding of fracking.</p><p>\"We have outstanding concerns, so have made clear to the bank that we will be scrutinising the way it implements its fossil fuel policy and will not hesitate to escalate our engagement again should we be dissatisfied with progress,\" she said.</p><p>Danish investor Sparinvest, which had backed the resolution, said Barclays' policy \"introduces significant new commitments\" but urged \"further steps, for example on short-lead time assets\", Senior Portfolio Manager David Orr said in a statement.</p><p>Katharina Lindmeier, senior responsible investment manager at UK pension investor Nest, called it a \"strong step forward\" but said the bank \"could and should\" go further\", including on fracking.</p><p>The bank was the biggest funder of fossil fuels in Europe between 2016 and 2022 and the second-biggest in 2022, a report by the non-profit Rainforest Action Network showed, though most of it came from corporate lending rather than project finance.</p><p>Barlow said the bank's oil and gas on-balance sheet financing as a percentage of its total lending activities was less than 2%, with capital markets financing for the sector less than 3% of total activity.</p><p>Emissions linked to Barclays' lending to the energy sector dropped 32% between 2020 and 2022, beating a target reduction of 15%, the bank said in its 2022 annual report.</p><p>Additional restrictions introduced by Barclays include no financing for exploration and production in the Amazon, and, from June 2024, no financing to firms that get more than 20% of their production from unconventional sources such as oil sands.</p><p>All Barclays corporate clients in the energy sector will be expected to present transition plans or decarbonisation strategies by January 2025, alongside 2030 methane reduction targets, and a commitment to end all non-essential venting and flaring by 2030.</p><p>The clients would also need to have near-term net-zero aligned targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions - those linked to their own operations and energy usage - by January 2026.</p><p>Barclays' head of sustainable finance, corporate and investment bank Daniel Hanna said the bank looked at over 80 variables when assessing clients' decarbonisation plans and had committed to review 750 client entities at the last AGM.</p><p>In January, Barclays announced the formation of a new energy transition group to provide strategic advice to clients on everything from renewables to nature-based solutions and carbon capture.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

They all increase the amount of carbon that can be stored in their ecosystems. Elephants disperse seeds and trample low vegetation, enabling taller trees to grow. Sea otters eat sea urchins, allowing kelp to flourish. Whales feed at depth and release nutrients as they breathe and rest at the surface, stimulating phytoplankton production.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It isn't just these three. We are learning that many species have complex effects on their environments that change the amount of carbon stored by their ecosystems ultimately affecting climate change.</p><p>When the population of wildebeest in the Serengeti plummeted due to disease, they no longer grazed as much, and the uneaten grass caused more frequent and more intense fires. Bringing back the numbers of wildebeest through disease management has meant fewer and smaller fires. And the Serengeti has gone from releasing carbon back to storing it.</p><p>These are examples in a stunning paper just published in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature</emphasis>. It makes the case that animals cause ecosystems to be more effective in storing carbon, through their eating, moving, trampling, digging, defecating, and building. Looking at a range of studies, it concludes wild animals account for only 0.3% of the carbon in the total global biomass, but can cause anywhere from 15% to 250% difference in how much carbon is stored in a given ecosystem.</p><p>We already knew that 'nature-based solutions' need to be part of any effective strategy to tackle climate breakdown. Reducing emissions is not going to be enough. We need to use the immense power of nature to remove carbon from the atmosphere and lock it up. But this new research carries important lessons for how we pursue these nature-based solutions.</p><p>First, nature works. Specifically, the complex mechanisms that nature has developed are startlingly effective in ways we do not yet fully understand and we destroy them at our peril. It may well be sensible to try to develop new technologies to capture carbon, but it is definitely not sensible to ignore the proven ways of doing so that nature already gives us. We would do well to be a little less enamoured of our own ingenuity, and a little more respectful of nature's.</p><p>This means avoiding the urge to go for quick and simple fixes of plant monocultures to sequester carbon, devoid of animals. The current emphasis for nature-based solutions is on the plants - restoring mangroves, kelp and seagrasses, for example. They are important, but can only be part of the answer. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature</emphasis> paper uses the example of the Arctic, where huge amounts of carbon are stored in the permafrost. Ensuring there are herds of large animals will help keep the carbon there, by compacting the snow, keeping the soil frozen. Restoring populations of reindeer, wild horses, musk ox, and American bison is not a nice-to-have tangent to the main effort against climate change, but a key part of that effort.</p><p>Second, conservation works. We know that nature can recover when given the chance, and that animal populations can bounce back quickly. We know how to do it - it needs habitats to be protected, interests to be aligned with communities and the conditions recreated for animal populations to return at scale.</p><p>We now have numerous examples of conservation's success, from the return of red kites in England to the recovery of tigers in much of Nepal and India. This work is the purpose of the organisation I lead, the Zoological Society of London. When I took this job, a small part of me worried that working on wildlife was a bit of luxury, given the enormity of the threat from climate change. We know now that the opposite is true. Understanding the role that animals can play in helping nature capture carbon has profound implications for how we do conservation.</p><p>We are moving away from the arid old model of conservation through segregation- separating nature from people to allow it flourish. That simply isn't enough. Instead, our focus is on helping wildlife and people co-exist, by supporting efforts to reduce conflict between them and working with communities who are vital to the health of their wild animals. This has long been the Zoological Society of London's approach to conservation. And it works. It was this approach that saw communities set up their own sanctuaries for pangolins on Palawan island in the Philippines, and it is this approach that is helping to identify conservation ideas for the protection of the critically endangered angel shark off Ireland and Britain's coastline. And it is just as true for cities as it is for the Serengeti - as our recent report explains, nature can help mitigate the impact of extreme weather in urban areas as well.</p><p>A world in which wildlife thrives is also a world that has the resilience it needs to withstand and mitigate the climate crisis. Our future is inextricably intertwined with the wellbeing of the world's wild animals. If we want to save ourselves, we need to do better at protecting them.</p><p>* Matthew Gould is Zoological Society of London chief executive. - Guardian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The annual migration of wildebeest from the Serengeti National park in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara national reserve in Kenya</emphasis> Picture: AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:684J-9D71-JC8V-40T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

During the day, you can pull in and calculate if you can make it through it but it's at night that is the problem. It's very deceiving, it just looks like surface water on the road but it's when you're in it that you realise that you're in a bit of trouble and I know local farmers probably have a pain in their bum pulling cars out,\" said Cathy Lee of the Ahare River Biodiversity Group.</p><p>Wexford County Council have committed to putting measures in place to address this issue following Malachy Walsh's preliminary flood risk assessment report on the river in 2022. This report recommended the implementation of a flood warning system and cutting a beach channel clearing prior to heavy rainfall to help reduce the risk of the River flooding. There were seven other possible flood risk reduction measure mentioned in the report.</p><p>However, Wexford County Council are yet to implement any of the recommended measures to reduce the risk of flooding on the busy road between Tara Hill and Castletown.</p><p>\"We need to get that warning system in place, we don't know what the delay with the county council is because it was agreed and we thought it would be put in place in the summer. It's very frustrating because we don't get any feedback or updates as to what's happening,\" said Cathy Lee.</p><p>The matter was brought up by Cllr Joe Sullivan at the Gorey-Kilmuckridge District meeting on Tuesday, October 17. \"This is essentially an environmental issue which has been foisted onto roads,\" said Cllr Joe Sullivan.</p><p>The Ahare River floods easily when high tides are combined with incessant rain. It also flooded as a result of Storm Agnes in September. \"There's no magic wand, we're going to have to live with it but we need to work together to find nature based solutions and try to help alleviate the situation,\" said Cathy Lee.</p><p>Cathy has been advocating for years for the Ahare River to be included in the River Basin Management Plan and it will be included in the plan next spring.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WEXPEO-https://www.independent.ie/regionals/wexford/goreynews/stormbabetfloodsahareriveringoreywithnomeasuresinplacetoreducerisk/a1243231996.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WEXPEO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69FV-NG71-F06V-6007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wexford People (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40444\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 22, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001906</classCode><className>FLOOD ZONES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000418</classCode><className>COUNTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N921100QG</classCode><className>COUNTY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001906</classCode><className>FLOOD ZONES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It is a concern as we face into winter. If we see very heavy rainfall patterns that could present a difficulty,  he said.</p><p>Long-term strategies to combat flooding should address the use of land further upstream, including planting different species of grass and new forestry strategies, Mr Ryan said, arguing this could be done in a way that benefits farmers and foresters.  We re going to have to really look at how we manage our land. It s that sort of planning now we re going to need as part of the long-term adaptation to climate change we are going to have to do. </p><p>Mr Ryan said billions of euro would have to be invested, including in  nature-based solutions , to deal with climate change. The approach would not be about  micromanaging any farmer or telling people what to do . However, reforming land use to tackle the threats from climate change has proven to be politically divisive in Ireland and elsewhere.</p><p>Senior Government sources said a EUR 10 million allocation to a humanitarian fund for victims of this week s flooding was set to increase, but the Opposition raised concerns over the adequacy of funds for households, businesses and remediation of affected infrastructure.</p><p>It is understood Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney will next week seek Cabinet approval for a significant increase in the payouts for impacted business, which top out at EUR 20,000.</p><p> Coalition insiders were guarded about just how much the grants would increase, saying only they would go up  markedly . It is understood Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has yet to review the draft package.</p><p>Separately, President Michael D Higgins has said the recent floods revealed Ireland s lack of protection against climate change.  We re now in circumstances where the consequences of climate change . . . are ones that are going to be visited on us again,  Mr Higgins told reporters after he delivered a speech at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation forum in Rome.</p><p> We ve done good things. For example, I think that the climate change response responsibilities in different government departments, given a specific person, these are good decisions,  he said.  We re not doing well enough, we need to improve our performance. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20435586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69FF-4P71-DYS1-0008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 21, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;

That figure describes the tipping point to stave off the worst fallout from climate change.</p><p>The world is currently at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels after more than a century of burning fossil fuels as well as unequal and unsustainable energy and land use, leading to extreme weather events in every part of the world, the IPCC said.</p><p>Mr Lettice said: \"The evidence is very clear. If we do nothing, too little, or indeed take decisions that actively work against solving climate change, future generations will not forgive us.</p><p>\"We would knowingly be condemning future generations to dire consequences. These are not 'unimaginable' consequences anymore.\"</p><p>The IPCC report again points out the need for sustainable cities including supporting public and active transport, Mr Lettice said.</p><p>\"Think Bus Connects in Cork and other Irish cities, as well as green infrastructure such as trees and green spaces that can support some carbon uptake and storage, as well as protecting our cities and towns from the worst impacts of climate change,\" he said.</p><p>\"Green infrastructure such as parks, gardens, street trees etc can protect citizens from heatwaves, flooding, heavy rainfall, drought, while offering the bonus of improved health, wellbeing and livelihoods.</p><p>\"Building sustainable, green cities is a prime example of where solutions to the climate emergency can also make for better cities for everyone.</p><p>\"There are few downsides to these solutions and we need to be implementing them in our cities immediately. Nature-based solutions are vital.\"</p><p>An example of a nature-based solution would be planting trees in coastal areas, known as mangroves, that would simultaneously tackle storm impacts on people and local economies, but also provide habitats for flora and fauna.</p><p>However, the IPCC report makes clear that such \"ecosystem-based\" approaches will become less effective with increasing warming.</p><p>Above 1.5C warming, the report notes, ecosystems such as warm-water coral reefs, coastal wetlands and rainforests will reach a point where they can no longer adapt to a changing climate and their effectiveness as nature-based solutions to climate change will be lost.</p><p>\"Nature itself is one of our best tools for solving this crisis,\" said the report. \"Doing too little, too late, means we could be throwing away these tools.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67WB-YC41-JC8V-42TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"523\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The charismatic, Jack Russell-sized rodents are what a 2020 study from the University of Exeter in the UK described as  the quintessential ecosystem engineer . The researchers described how beavers  dams hold back water during peak flood and maintain water flows during droughts, and how they increase the biodiversity of river corridors by selectively felling trees, thereby increasing the volume of dead wood and opening shaded areas to light,  providing rich habitat for insects, birds, bats and amphibians .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dams trap sediment, thereby storing carbon and enhancing downstream habitat for spawning fish, particularly salmon and trout; and they can even help to restore the natural sinuosity to rivers, many of which have been artificially straightened and deepened. The paper concluded that beavers  may have a substantial role to play in the renaturalisation of river systems .</p><p>F\u00e9idhlim Harty, director of FH Wetland Systems and someone who has been working on  nature-based solutions  to water management in Ireland for nearly 30 years, agrees and thinks that,  absolutely , beavers should be introduced. He has been experimenting with  beaver dam analogues ; basically a human attempt to build a beaver dam with logs and dead brash and found them effective at holding back water, restraining and filtering the flow before it moves on downstream. But the advantages are many.</p><p> They ve got the advantage of providing fire breaks with the landscape, also they ve been shown to improve biodiversity, they bring back wetland habitats which are sorely needed . . . they improve the quality of fish stocks, they improve the hydrodynamics   reducing flooding and reducing droughts   they can help to recharge groundwater,  he says.</p><p>They would  work to undo the damage caused by the Arterial Drainage Act , referring to the legislation, dating to 1945, that requires the Office of Public Works to continually dredge and drain over 11,500km of river channel, something that leads to ecological degradation and increased risk of downstream flooding. He added that the Act  should be changed radically, if not scrapped .</p><p>But there is a catch. Beavers are not proven to have ever been in Ireland. Therefore, any release of the rodents into the wild would be an  introduction  as opposed to a  reintroduction . Once hunted for their fur and castoreum (a scented secretion believed to have had medicinal properties), beavers have made an astonishing comeback across the European Continent while, since 2009, a number of reintroductions have been successful in Scotland and England   most recently to Ealing in West London.</p><p>While some ecologists in Ireland think that beavers must have made it to Ireland (given their ability to swim and the abundance of perfect habitat for them here in the past) the fact remains that there is no evidence, such as bone fragments or gnawed logs, to back this up.  </p><h>Invasive species </h><p>Mary Bourke, assistant professor of geography at Trinity College Dublin, who is researching nature-based solutions to flooding in Ireland, agrees that  the scientific evidence is there to support the effectiveness of beavers in cleaning waterways and reducing peak flooding. But until we find bones, we shouldn t be thinking of introducing them .</p><p>Having lived in Australia, she has seen the damage that invasive species can do. She also notes that we don t have enough trees to support beavers.  We have very limited riparian [riverside] forest and so there isn t the standing wood there to allow beavers make their dams. </p><p>Indeed, trees and vegetation have been zealously cleared from riverbanks across the country in the belief that they cause flooding. Many of our rivers have been denuded of any kind of vegetation, as well as being straightened and deepened under government-funded drainage schemes.</p><p> I would not have beavers on my list. There is so much more we can be doing,  she says. Bourke is working with  leaky dams  at sites in Cork and Wexford, where logs are used as barriers to hold back high-water levels. Unlike beaver dams, they do not reach down to the river bed and so do not flood farmland. </p><p>She believes that creating a series of these leaky dams, starting in the uplands, can be done at scale and with community support, that would be effective in reducing the impact of downstream flooding and would effectively mimic the work of beavers.</p><p>Harty agrees that there s a lack of trees and woody material in and around our rivers, but nevertheless believes there are likely to be some areas that would be suitable for beaver introduction. He thinks step one is to pay farmers a premium for native woodland establishment on either side of rivers. Both the new Forest Strategy and the Department of Agriculture s agri-environment scheme, ACRES, provide dedicated measures for this purpose. He thinks that the habitat creation and establishment of beavers would be a five- to 10-year process.</p><p>Would beavers prove to be invasive, in the way that rhododendron or grey squirrels have proven to be? The science suggests this is unlikely, given that, unlike most species which are listed as alien invasive in Ireland, beavers have evolved for millenniums in western Europe and alongside the many other species with which they interact. We also seem to be quite relaxed about introducing large numbers of non-native species, such as pheasants or free-roaming sheep, with few or no safeguards for the wider environment. And while it may be possible for people to mimic the work of beavers, given the scale of work that is required across Ireland, wouldn t beavers do a better job and at a lower cost?</p><h> A story of renewal and abundance  </h><p>At the University of Exeter last April, beaver ecologists and policymakers convened to celebrate the impressive success of beaver reintroductions in England and Scotland. In Wales, beavers are being kept under close watch in fenced enclosures at a number of locations, while some breeding in the wild is suspected. There have been some conflicts with local landowners, but these are being dealt with. Overall, reintroducing beavers is high return with low impact and low cost. One attendee noted that  beavers are such a different nature story than the one we normally associate with loss and destruction. It is one of renewal and abundance .</p><p>After years of trying to engineer our rivers into submission, there was welcome talk this autumn of changing how we use our land as part of wider efforts to deal with flooding. After Midleton in Co Cork was badly affected, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said:  We have to consider the impact inappropriate land use can have on flooding and drainage. </p><p>Along with flooding, over half of our rivers are failing to reach  good status , due largely to pollution from agriculture and human waste, as well as poor  hydromorphology , a word that describes how the shape of rivers has been altered through arterial drainage and the imposition of dams and other barriers to the movement of fish.</p><p>Meanwhile, biodiversity is plummeting, with some of our most endangered species and habitats associated with river systems, such as the freshwater pearl mussel, Atlantic salmon, and native alluvial (swamp) forests.</p><p>The task is immense: as well as facing the prospect of runaway climate change, we have legally binding commitments to protect biodiversity and restore all of our water bodies to  good status  by 2027. Why wouldn t we use the cheapest and most effective tools at our disposal? The science is there to prove how important beavers could be in restoring rivers; it shouldn t be ignored.</p><p>P\u00e1draic Fogarty is an ecologist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20486049</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69PG-BBX1-JC8Y-8018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 23, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZJS</classCode><className>FISHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZJW</classCode><className>RODENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001817</classCode><className>WATER QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS9K</classCode><className>HABITAT CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D182</classCode><className>LAND DEGRADATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D78I</classCode><className>REPTILES &amp; AMPHIBIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Adaptation is an essential response to climate change and it needs to be informed by the best available science.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 600 people will converge on Dublin Castle next week, in person and virtually, to explore, discuss and generate \"actionable knowledge for a climate-resilient Europe\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These will include climate adaptation researchers and practitioners, policymakers, local authorities, the private sector, investors, NGOs, citizens' organisations, youth and education organisations, community groups engaged in adaptation, musicians and other performing artists.</p><p>The goal of this sixth European Climate Change Adaptation (ECCA) Conference is to inform and inspire effective adaptation actions by showcasing solutions, exchanging knowledge, creating connections and encouraging dialogue on how to act.</p><p>Dialogue that builds trust and bridges between science, policy and practice in climate resilience has never been more urgent. The recently published Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report urgently called for \"accelerated implementation of adaptation actions\" in addition to \"deep, rapid and sustained mitigation\" this decade.</p><p>This international expert body of scientists revealed the extent to which human-caused climate change is already affecting every region of the world. Widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages are increasingly apparent both in nature and for people.</p><p>There are significant injustices associated with this, as vulnerable communities that have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected by these adverse impacts.</p><p>While our past pollution actions are catching up on us as the global temperature increases by over 1 degree, the future becomes increasingly worrying. For any given future warming level, many climate-related risks are projected to be higher than assessed previously, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher than currently observed. The risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming.</p><p>The future is not prescribed, however. Climate science shows we have options, and that we can and must change. Climate-resilient development integrates adaptation and mitigation to advance sustainable development for all, and is enabled by increased international co-operation, including improved access to adequate financial resources, particularly for vulnerable regions, sectors and groups, and inclusive governance and co-ordinated policies.</p><p>This is essential in order to deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality and health, but also to reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems.</p><p>The ECCA conference includes more than 70 parallel activities with a key focus on six specific adaptation themes and key messages for a growing community of practice on actionable knowledge for a climate-resilient future.</p><h>Stepping up climate action - support through climate platforms and services Climate information platforms and climate services are key sources of accessible climate information that enable non-specialists to assess climate vulnerability, risks and determine actions. The state of play and future of these will be central to ECCA 2023.</h><h>Adaptation responses to sea-level rise and coastal change Sea-level rise is one of the most challenging and essentially irreversible consequences of climate change. Europe is developing unique shared structures to better understand the multidirectional and complex impacts of rising sea level around its coastline. This ECCA topic is clearly of significant interest for Ireland.</h><h>Nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation The interactions between climate action and biodiversity are strong, bidirectional and often positive (actions in favour of one also benefit the other). So-called \"nature-based solutions\" can limit climate change while also preserving biodiversity. </h><p>Such solutions often have an important role to play in adapting to impacts of climate change in particular geographic contexts and in specific aspects of planning and implementation. ECCA will explore best practice in nature-based solutions and how these can be scaled up.</p><h>Preparing for more frequent and severe climate extremes Increasing occurrence of extreme weather and climate events is the most high-profile feature of climate change. The severity of impacts has been experienced across Europe. Being prepared for future extremes, and managing the hazards they pose, requires appropriate knowledge, tools, institutional arrangements and changes in practice. ECCA will have a strong focus on how to develop the systems needed to prepare for and respond to future weather and climate extremes.</h><h>Reframing societal transformation by challenging underlying assumptions Many obstacles block the true societal transformations necessary for a climate-resilient future. These obstacles are often driven by underlying assumptions found in many domains (including civil society, public/private sector, politics and so on). </h><p>The development of systematic responses to addressing these obstacles is essential, and ECCA will provide a forum for identifying how this can be advanced.</p><h>Climate and social resilience of future energy infrastructure and systems Energy systems need to be resilient to future climate conditions as well as to changing societal and economic demands. </h><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has positioned the societal and economic resilience of the energy system into stark focus, alongside the challenges of the energy transition. This has tested in new ways the complexity of the energy transition and the interlinked societal implications. </p><p>It has also shown that the transition to clean energy is both essential and also requires a dual focus on energy security and resilience. How to do this will be explored at ECCA.</p><p>In the light of the current European geopolitical developments, this conference will also include a special focus on Ukraine. In addition, the voice of the youth will play a prominent role with several activities organised by European Climate Youth activists.</p><p>There will also be some key contributions on Ireland's specific vulnerabilities and risks relating to climate change and the efforts needed to improve preparedness and resilience. This reflects the growing body of scientific research on adaptation in Ireland in recent years that has increased the evidence base for policy decisions.</p><p>In this regard, examples of recent published research from University College Cork and Maynooth University provide a useful snapshot of the range on scientific analyses being undertaken on climate adaptation.</p><p>In UCC, recent adaptation research has focused on investigating barriers to the environmental and socio-economic resilience of coastal communities faced with climate change, deliberative engagement and stakeholder and citizen participation in climate dialogues, enhancing the integration of disaster risk and climate adaptation into emergency planning and research on critical infrastructure vulnerability (including energy systems) to climate change.</p><p>This is complemented by research at Maynooth University focusing on the health and wellbeing implications of adaptation to flood risk, the impacts of climate change on river flows, forecasts of winter and summer rainfall levels in Ireland and uncertainties in the assessment of future impacts of climate change and the impact for flood hazard assessment.</p><p>The ECCA conference will use a range of activities to enable attendees to explore and exchange knowledge and views on the important questions linked to these six themes, in order to arrive at concrete and actionable adaptation solutions based on the best available scientific knowledge.</p><p>Prof Brian \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir is associate vice-president of sustainability at UCC.

Such a fund would come from \"windfall corporation taxes to finance future climate and nature infrastructural and capital investments, including nature-based solutions\", the Environmental Pillar said.</p><p>It also called for more staffing for the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in the face of the national and global biodiversity crisis.</p><p>Friends of the Earth also warned that obligations under the EU's forthcoming Nature Restoration Law, which passed this summer following a titanic political tussle in the EU between various factions, would likely mean Ireland needs to provide  300m a year as the decade progresses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann has unveiled a climate action plan it claims would slash its emissions 51% by 2030 if implemented.</p><p>It said that it aims to do so despite passenger numbers vastly increasing by the end of the decade.</p><p>Passenger journeys of 80m a year are targeted by 2030, up from a pre-covid high of 50m journeys, while a doubling of rail freight volumes is anticipated, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann said. It said it would achieve its 51% emissions target through a reduced reliance on diesel through alternative fuels on existing fleets, while transitioning to an electric-powered fleet.</p><p>All diesel fleets will operate with at least a 35% bio-fuel/ hydrotreated vegetable oil blend, as well as introducing green hydrogen and a range of other electrification measures.</p><p>Chief executive Jim Meade said: \"Rail has always been the most sustainable mode of land transport, and now we have the opportunity and the commitment to enhance this further. Our investment programme, funded by the National Transport Authority under the National Development Plan, is critical, with European funding also supporting our Cork Area Commuter Rail plan.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69FG-H3D1-DYRW-V00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Beyond removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it, nature-based solutions to climate change hold many benefits that society does not appreciate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They improve water quality, mitigate flooding and protect valuable ecosystems: all while helping us to meet our climate and biodiversity targets. They are the cheapest, simplest and most scalable solutions to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet despite there being no clear pathway to net zero without supporting biodiversity, nature-based solutions remain severely underfunded.</p><p>Nature-based solutions currently receive only 2.5% of climate change funding worldwide.</p><p>Indeed, financial investment in nature-based solutions would need to increase four-fold by 2050 if we want to keep beneath 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise.</p><p>Belfast City Council are already thinking seriously about how we can do this. As part of the One Million Trees project, Belfast City Council aims to plant one million trees by 2035. This commitment demonstrates how we need to go beyond simply 'protecting' nature, we need to restore it. To successfully tackle the converging climate and nature crises, we need to extract less and plant more.</p><p>Belfast City Council's One Million Trees project also shows how, as well as reversing wildlife loss, nature-based solutions hold aesthetic value. They bring life and colour into our city, regenerating our urban landscapes.</p><p>Of course, we need to go beyond just planting trees and protecting forests. We need to ensure that multiple types of habitat are protected, such as grasslands, wetlands and peatlands.</p><p>We need to consider how to restore biodiversity in our oceans as well as on land. We need to protect important habitats, like sea grass, kelp forests, salt marshes and oyster beds: all of which store blue carbon.</p><p>We need to adopt an interdisciplinary approach when we think about how to restore nature, ensuring that we protect different types of carbon stores as well as multiple habitats.</p><p>Sadly, in the UK, we have failed to engage with nature sustainably. Our biodiversity is rapidly declining, and the UK now has one of the lowest percentages of natural habitat cover in the world.</p><p>Equally, our reputation as 'the emerald isle' means that it can be easy for us to underestimate the impact of the biodiversity crisis on the island of Ireland.</p><p>Yet, according to research from the Natural History Museum and the RSPB, Northern Ireland sits 12th worst in the world for biodiversity loss out of 240 countries surveyed. The Republic of Ireland is not much better, ranking 13th lowest and only one place ahead of Northern Ireland.</p><p>A recent report also highlighted that zero of Northern Ireland's waterways meet water quality standards. Not one of our 496 rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a \"good overall status\". We need to address this.</p><p>We often see public attention directed towards geo-engineering solutions and high-performing technologies. While these technologies can help with carbon capture and CO2 extraction, we need to be directing our attention towards nature.</p><p>Technological solutions can be highly innovative and enabling, but words like 'green hydrogen', 'smart grids' and 'heat pumps' mean very little to ordinary people.</p><p>Even industry-changing technology cannot bring people together in the way that nature does.</p><p>Unlike technology, nature-based solutions and projects - involving local communities from their conception to installation engage our hearts and minds. When we take nature into account, we become better custodians of the planet. We also become better custodians of one another.</p><p>Taking ownership of a nature project and spending time outdoors is a deeply emotional process.</p><p>We demonstrate commitment to the land. We build connections with nature as well as each other. We invest in our shared spaces.</p><p>To accelerate global efforts to tackle the climate crisis and reverse biodiversity loss, the private sector must become more involved in implementing nature-based solutions in a regulated way. Some people have raised valid concern over the mingling of nature and markets. In the past, we have certainly seen how private sector funds for nature restoration are simply used as offsets.</p><p>The legitimacy of companies using mitigation activities, like planting trees, to offset their compliance activities raises a huge question mark. Rather than simply offsetting, companies should firstly align their internal operations and supply chains with science-based biodiversity and nature targets. Offsetting may be an inevitable part of this process, but it cannot justify or atone for highly destructive land practices.</p><p>For too long, nature has not been included in the way global economic systems assign value. Nature holds cultural value, or even spiritual value for communities, but not market value.</p><p>Yet, world leaders are beginning to acknowledge that our understanding of the relationship between nature and the economy needs to change. The idea of 'natural capital' should be introduced into our economic systems, and inform our public policy as well as financial decision-making.</p><p>Investing in nature is the best investment Northern Ireland could make.</p><p>While advances in technology and reducing our emissions will bring us closer to solving the climate crisis, they will not be enough. They will not replace the beauty, power and potential of natural systems.</p><p>Put simply, there is no substitute for nature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Restoring: One Million Trees project</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-176633932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64VF-JY51-JCBW-N1JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.
