It is a beacon that upended centuries of Catholic church teaching by framing a dialogue for all of humanity. It embraced green radicalism, pleading for collective action to rescue Mother Earth. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Subtitled  On the Care of our Common Home , the challenges it presented went beyond  tagging God into the global conversation on climate change    and the target was far beyond the world s 1.2 billion Catholics. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Published in June 2015, the message of Laudato Si  (Praise Be to You) was arresting; the accompanying environmental audit of the world was breathtaking. It was designed to transmit a message of  serious moral responsibility  to protect the environment. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Francis highlighted human damage to the planet that had exacerbated poverty, particularly in the developing world.  A true  ecological debt  exists, particularly between the global north and south,  it said, citing over-exploitation of resources and a throwaway lifestyle of the better-off that is frequently incompatible with a sustainable world. </p><p>He was clear on where obligations rested: almost totally among wealthier countries and powerful multinational corporations. </p><p> It is our marching orders for advocacy,  Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of the US Congress of Catholic Bishops said. </p><p>Columban missionary Fr Se\u00e1n McDonagh, an unlikely contributor to the document, says Laudato Si   is probably the best encyclical I have seen going back to the 19th century . </p><p>In his book Laudato Si : an Irish Response (2017), McDonagh wrote it  is the first papal document to understand the magnitude of the ecological destruction taking place globally and the urgency with which it must be faced . </p><p>It rows back on biblical tradition, he says, which dictated that mankind multiply and take over the Earth including every living creature. </p><p>It addresses  the central issue of our time   climate change   and destruction of biodiversity , McDonagh says, but 10 years on  unfortunately, the Catholic church didn t take seriously the message in Laudato Si  . </p><p>It is seldom at the centre of Christian faith today, he says. And given the world is closer to climate tipping points and scientific evidence provides unprecedented clarity,  a new Laudato Si  is required . </p><p>On a personal basis, he says he had  a poor enough record with the Vatican  because of his 1990 book The Greening of the Church, which said it must address the global population issue. </p><p>McDonagh s involvement was initiated after he wrote an article for the Universal Catholic in November 2013. He got a call from Cardinal Peter Turkson, the pope s leading climate adviser, who asked him to write a paper on connections between justice and the creation. </p><p>He told the cardinal he had a fractious relationship with his predecessor Cardinal Renato Martino, especially after he had run a Vatican conference in 2007 and invited six climate sceptics from the US. That did not preclude McDonagh s input. </p><p>Within the church, the encyclical was criticised as negating the Christian tradition, but from conversations with Francis after its publication, McDonagh says, the pope was undeterred and displayed profound understanding of ecology and this was reflected in subsequent sermons. </p><p>As  an ageing atheist , the late environmentalist Michael Viney, in a 2017 column in The Irish Times, praised the encyclical:  I can only cheer the greening of the church in such an influential manner.  </p><p>He praised McDonagh s crusade of over 30 years for  ecotheology , but said:  Laudato Si  quite failed to acknowledge human overpopulation as the driver of planetary degradation.  </p><h>Natural ecosystems</h><p/><h> Viney noted, however, the encyclical s value in granting to natural ecosystems  an intrinsic value independent of their usefulness. Each organism, as a creature of God, is good and admirable in itself . . .   </h><p>Laudato Si  was  timed to be political  in advance of the annual UN gathering of almost 200 countries on climate action, Cop21 in Paris, says Lorna Gold, director of the Laudato Si  Movement. Pope Francis was  a political mover  and it was accompanied by a successful diplomatic offensive, she says. </p><p>It fed into an ambitious coalition including Christiana Figueres, then executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; lead architect of the landmark Paris Agreement, Laurence Tubiana, and small island states (arguably the most vulnerable to climate disruption). This was a key catalyst in forging the historic Paris Agreement. </p><p>In addressing  all people on the planet , Francis went beyond his flock, Gold says.  One of the revolutionary things is that it was the first church document to quote science, philosophy, poetry. It was not self-reverential as so many documents were in the past.  </p><p>Pope Francis called for an intense and fruitful dialogue between religion and science, where, in the words of theologian Fr Dermot A Lane,  the human is the culmination of the unfolding history of the cosmos and the evolution of life on Earth . </p><p>The encyclical said:  The divine and the human meet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God s creation, in the last speck of dust of our planet. </p><p>It emerged from wide consultation   including contributions from Ireland, especially from McDonagh on biodiversity    which made it more rounded , Gold says. This meant it was well received among environmental luminaries of the left such as Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein and former president Mary Robinson. </p><p>A decade on,  it has been a harder struggle in bringing it into the mainstream of the church than you would have thought , Gold says. </p><p>It does not get talked about often as negative stories surface, including clerical sex abuse, but there is a vibrant movement around Laudato Si , Gold says. In the timeline of the church, 10 years is the blink of an eye, so this is laying foundations. </p><h>Movement</h><p/><h> The movement is established in 191 countries including Ireland but concentrated in the Global South. More than 25,000  animators  have been trained  to lead efforts to bring Laudato Si  to their communities and to green the church . </h><p> Whether it s a transformation of the church, it s too early to say. There s a vibrancy and people relate this to their faith and to social justice,  Gold says. </p><p>Despite internal opposition, Francis worked to advocate for  ecological conversion  and  integral ecology . </p><p>The church s leadership has taken a strong position on the unfolding climate and biodiversity crises. It has not endorsed the proposed Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global initiative to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, but more than 100 Catholic institutions have done so. </p><p>Many parts of the church have divested from fossil fuels and Francis spoke out on the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground   much to the ire of Big Oil. </p><h>Common stand</h><p/><h> In advance of Cop26, the UN climate summit held in Glasgow in 2021, the Vatican hosted a meeting of world religious leaders who took a common stand on environment in the hope it would raise ambitions of global leaders. It was attended by 40 faith leaders of the world s major religions and scientists from 20 countries. They called for  ecological conversion rooted in the common good . </h><p>Days before Cop26, on BBC Radio 4 s  Thought for the Day , Francis said only urgent action could  offer concrete hope to future generations  and called on leaders to  take radical decisions . </p><p>Overall, however, Cop26 was a failure; a call to  consign coal power to history  did not happen. Last-minute interventions by China and India weakened the final text. </p><p>Francis s concern about persistent lack of political will in the run-up to Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 (which he had been due to attend, only to withdraw because of illness), and the fractious global context in which climate was being discussed, led him to double down on his climate message. </p><p>He published an apostolic letter, Laudate Deum (Praise God), calling out specifically the influence of corporate interests in multilateral processes at Cop summits.  To say that there is nothing to hope for [at Cop28] would be suicidal, for it would mean exposing all humanity, especially the poorest, to the worst impacts of climate change,  he wrote. </p><p>Robinson was at the launch of Laudato Si , which she described as  a call for climate justice from one of the most influential moral voices on our planet today . </p><p>Before his death she said:  I have a great admiration for how Pope Francis has managed to speak about climate and nature in a seamless way. It s quite clear he understands we have to value and respect nature as well as climate   and also link it to issues of poverty. His influence has been enormous.  </p><p>Influenced by writings of Se\u00e1n McDonagh, Prof John Sweeney, Lorna Gold, Fr Tim Bartlett and others, Irish bishops embraced ecotheology and climate change challenges before most of their confreres. This led to the 2014 pastoral letter The Cry of the Earth. Echoes of this can be seen in Laudato Si . </p><p>The bishops called on  parishes, through their parish pastoral councils and diocesan trusts, as a first step, to identify and care for 30 per cent of parish grounds as a haven for pollinators and biodiversity    to be enjoyed in perpetuity by  the whole community , a phrase applied to entire localities, in the interests of a collective humanity and true to the spirit of Laudato Si .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21822881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FMR-3TT3-RS25-J2T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

In line with Government targets, its ambition is to ensure up to 80% of Ireland's energy comes from renewables by 2030.</p><p>EirGrid is the Climate Action and Energy partner with Young Social Innovators, a national organisation that engages thousands of young people annually in co-creating and developing innovative ideas to address social challenges.</p><p>During the workshop, the Sligo students had the opportunity to engage in thought provoking sessions on climate justice and biodiversity, led by experts from EirGrid and YSI. The teenagers explored various ways to make a positive impact on the environment which they implemented into their own project, which focused on water as a source of power.</p><p>Speaking at the event, EirGrid's chief infrastructure officer, Michael Mahon said: \"We are proud to partner with YSI for this workshop and to engage with the next generation of clean energy advocates. By empowering teenagers to develop initiatives around more sustainable energy practices in their communities, we hope to inspire them to continue the great work they are already doing in addressing climate change.</p><p>This partnership highlights the importance of collaboration between industry leaders and youth organisations in addressing challenges of climate change and promoting sustainable development. We look forward to seeing these projects come to life and being adopted in schools and communities around the country,\" added Mahon.</p><p>Young Social Innovators CEO, Roger Warnock said: \"We are delighted to partner with EirGrid and participate in this innovative workshop for teenagers focused on climate action, the environment, and sustainability. The enthusiasm and creativity demonstrated by these young minds are a testament to the potential they hold as the leaders of tomorrow. Their social innovation ideas are not only inspiring but crucial drivers for the positive change we urgently need in our world. This event perfectly aligns with our mission at YSI, as we strive to empower future change-makers and foster a collaborative spirit for a better and more sustainable tomorrow\".</p><p>The workshop concluded with an opportunity for participants to share their project ideas, drawing from the day's activities around sustainable energy, positive biodiversity practices and social justice commitments.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLIGO-https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligo/news/sligostudentsparticipateineirgridworkshopsindublinonclimatejusticeandbiodiversity/a1528181250.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLIGO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B77-JDH1-F06V-600W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399002</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sligo Champion</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11451\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 31, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Israel has bombed basic societal infrastructure and civilian targets such as hospitals, schools, shelters and refugee camps. Israel has imposed a siege, preventing food, medicine, water and fuel from reaching the 2.3m Palestinians trapped in the occupied Gaza Strip, leading Oxfam to accuse Israel of employing \"starvation as a weapon of war\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dozens of UN experts have described the situation as \"a genocide in the making\", hundreds of international scholars have warned of an unfolding genocide and prominent Israeli genocide expert, Raz Segal, has called it \"a textbook case of genocide\". But most of the world, particularly the so-called global north, is looking the other way.</p><p>Despite these horrors, some have chosen to focus the public debate on attempts to delegitimise statements about Gaza made by young people in the climate justice movement. Contrary to what many have claimed, Fridays for Future has not \"been radicalised\" or \"become political\". We have always been political, because we have always been a movement for justice. Standing in solidarity with Palestinians and all affected civilians has never been in question for us.</p><p>Advocating for climate justice fundamentally comes from a place of caring about people and their human rights. That means speaking up when people suffer, are forced to flee their homes or are killed, regardless of the cause. It is the same reason why we have always held strikes in solidarity with marginalised groups - including those in S\u00e1pmi, Kurdistan, Ukraine and many other places - and their struggles for justice against imperialism and oppression. Our solidaritywith Palestine is no different, and we refuse to let the public focus shift away from the horrifying human suffering that Palestinians are currently facing.</p><p>Due to the amount of misdirected attention on us, as well as the number of misinterpretations of our position, we would like to once again clarify our stance. All Fridays for Future groups are autonomous, and this article represents the views of nobody but FFF Sweden.</p><p>The horrific murders of Israeli civilians by Hamas cannot in any way legitimise Is-rael's ongoing war crimes. Genocide is not self-defence, nor is it in any way a proportionate response. It also cannot be ignored that this comes within the broader context of Palestinians having lived under suffocating oppression for decades, in what Amnesty International has defined as an apartheid regime. While all of this alone would be reason enough to comment on the situation, as a Swedish movement, we also have a responsibility to speak up due to Swedish military cooperation with Israeli arms companies, which makes Sweden complicit in Israel's occupation and mass killing.</p><p>We are now seeing a sharp increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic statements, actions and hate crimes in Sweden and the world. The leader of the largest member of Sweden's rightwing governing bloc is speaking of demolishing mosques, and the Israeli flag was burned in front of a synagogue in Malm\u00f6. This is unacceptable. We unreservedly condemn all forms of discrimination, including antisemit-ism and Islamophobia. Everyone speaking out on this crisis has a responsibility to distinguish between Hamas, Muslims and Palestinians; and between the state of Israel, Jewish people and Israelis.</p><p>We grieve the lives lost over the past several weeks and are appalled by the fact that those numbers have been allowed to continue to rise. The death rate in the Gaza Strip is at a historic high, with thousands of children killed in just a few weeks. This amount of suffering is incomprehensible and cannot be allowed to continue. When UN experts call upon the world to act to prevent a genocide, as fellow humans, we have a responsibility to speak out.</p><p>Demanding an end to this inexcusable violence is a question of basic humanity, and we call on everyone who can to do so. Silence is complicity. You cannot be neutral in an unfolding genocide.</p><p>n Greta Thunberg, Alde Nilsson, Jamie Mater, Raquel Fres-cia (Fridays for Future Sweden) n Guardian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has been speaking out against the Israeli war in Gaza</emphasis>.

Not only Little Women, but also her other books in the series. I remember being so happy to discover that the story didn't end with the sisters still living at home. We moved to Belfast when I was 13, and I was heartbroken when I discovered that the only trunk that mattered - the one containing our books - had been lost en route. Decades later, I still feel the heartbreak. For some reason, one book that did make it was a primary school prize of Tales of the Arabian Nights. It was my first inkling that books could also take you to the utterly unknown and exotic, and I was enthralled by it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My favourite classic read I'm probably like many others and find it hard not to include Jane Austen in this category. I adore her wit, the irony of so much of her writing, and her acuity in presenting the limited life choices of women in her social class at that era. My mother bought me Austen's collected works one Christmas, a present I still treasure.</p><p>The book I recommend to others Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez exposes the male-centred nature of the world we live in, from seatbelts designed to protect male bodies; a male-dominant medical model that results in doctors not being taught that women's symptoms of heart attacks differ considerably to those of men; to protective clothing that women struggle to wear. I could rant on!</p><p>Women were only hired by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra after a lawsuit in the 1970s, when 'blind auditions' were instituted, preventing any continuance of male bias. It's a book that I would make compulsory reading on every curriculum.</p><p>The book that's made the most impact Sheila Rowbotham published Women, Resistance and Revolution in 1972. At the time I was a young student, involved with women's liberation, struggling with the lack of any knowledge of the history of Irish women, and being told by lecturers that women hadn't done anything. Rowbotham showed that women had always been at the scene of the action and gave me the confidence to begin researching the contribution made by women in Ireland. For that, I will always be in her debt. In more recent times the team at Cork University that has given us the Atlas of the Irish Revolution and Atlas of the Irish Civil War have done Irish society a huge service. They are vast tomes, covering a huge array of topics, and I find myself returning frequently to their pages.</p><p>My favourite author That's a hard one, with so many terrific authors around. Margaret Atwood, Ann Patchett and Maggie O'Farrell write brilliant novels, tackling big issues in a rich variety of settings, and Edna O'Brien has been a heroine since the days of The Country Girls. Her last book, Girl, was an extraordinary achievement.</p><p>My comfort read Comfort for me partly derives from being immersed in lengthy, satisfying reads, with believable characters in settings that appeal to the historian in me. About ten years ago I immersed myself in Elizabeth Jane Howard's The Cazalet Chronicles - a five-book, elegantly written family saga, ranging from the Great War to the 1950s. So many issues are covered - childhood, class, family, fidelity, war, betrayal, the decline of upper-class life and traditions. It is incredibly absorbing and during Covid I found a renewed comfort when returning to it.</p><p>The book from which I take inspiration Mary Robinson's autobiography Everybody Matters details the enormous contribution she has made in Ireland and globally, transforming lives through legal challenges to a system dominated by the Catholic Church and becoming our first female president before her appointment as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. She now fights for climate justice on behalf of the world's poorest people. She is one of the 'Elders' proving moral leadership in a world sorely in need such a voice. She is a global inspiration.</p><p>Rebel Women: Cumann na mBan in Belfast and the Glens of Antrim 1914-1924 by Margaret Ward (Beyond the Pale Books) is available now</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Heroine: Edna O'Brien</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-202845089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5Y-MHT3-RS2C-M4FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

While domestic priorities are pressing and urgent, it is crucial that we also fulfil our international obligations.</p><p>Ireland has earned a proud reputation as a champion of human rights and peace, and it must continue to speak out for the people of Palestine and prioritise the urgent passage of the Occupied Territories Bill. Crucially, despite the pressure it now faces, it must not dilute the impact of this proposed legislation.</p><p>Equally pressing is the climate crisis. The next government must place climate justice at the core of its agenda, recognising the disproportionate burden climate change places on the world's poorest and most vulnerable communities. With 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record, and global temperatures surpassing the critical threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the need for decisive action has never been more urgent.</p><p>Ireland must remain steadfast in promoting women's rights and combating violence against women. Addressing this at home and abroad requires sustained focus. Over the last year, the international community has failed to stop a plausible genocide in Gaza, to take the necessary climate action, and to compensate the Global South for rich countries' excesses. Ireland can chart a different course. As part of a shared humanity, our actions - or inaction - have profound effects beyond our borders. The proof will be in the pudding. The programme for government must realise Ireland's commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance by 2030 and publish a clear pathway to achieve this. It must provide transformational climate finance that meets our fair share. And it must fight to protect women's rights.</p><p>KAROL BALFE, CEO, ActionAid Ireland... THIS season of peace is the time to reflect on Article 29.2 of our Constitution, where Ireland affirms its belief in the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.</p><p>The head of Nato, Mark Rutte, recently said it is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and the European Council stated in August 2024 that Nato is an 'essential partner of the EU, sharing the same values and strategic interests'. Could our new government please call a halt to the ongoing militarisation of the EU and initiate peace talks where possible?</p><p>ELIZABETH CULLEN, Kilcullen, Co.

This is a theft of our collective future, and it must stop.\"</p><p>The charity said the richest 1% are responsible for over twice as much carbon pollution as the poorest half of humanity combined, with their emissions having caused trillions of dollars in economic damage and millions of excess deaths since 1990.</p><p>These emissions highlighted by Oxfam come from luxury lifestyles such as using private jets and yachts, and from investment in heavily pollutant industries.</p><p>It has previously said that its research has shown that 40% of billionaire investments analysed were in industries such as oil, mining, shipping, and cement.</p><p>It has said that the richest 1%, made up of 77m individuals including billionaires and millionaires, were responsible for 15.9% of global CO2 emissions in 2019 - whereas the bottom 50% accounted for 7.7% of all emissions.</p><p>By 2030, Oxfam said, the wealthiest individuals are expected to cut their emissions by only 5%, which is far short of the 97% reduction needed to align with the 1.5C target.</p><p>Mr Clarken said: \"Government leaders need to tax luxury emissions - including superyachts and private jets - introduce significant wealth taxes to fund climate action and make rich polluters pay.

The possibility of appealing to young women and encouraging them to get involved in taking up leadership roles, getting involved in politics and having their voices heard, I think, appealed to her a lot.\"</p><p>The feature-length documentary serves as both a portrait of Ireland's former president and a stirring social history of Ireland. It charts how Robinson became a reforming constitutional lawyer and senator early in her career, before winning the presidential vote in 1990, at a time of huge political and societal change.</p><p>Later, she would campaign for human rights as UN High Commissioner and as a member of The Elders, the group founded by Nelson Mandela.</p><p>Kelleher says she wanted to include some of Robinson's more controversial moments, too: \"I think that, actually, multiple companies approached her at the same time. And I think that she liked the warts-and-all concept that we were presenting.\"</p><p>The filmmaker adds: \"We made it very clear that we'd be addressing issues like the fact that she hadn't completed her term, the fact that she had quite a controversial role in the saga of Princess Latifa Al Maktoum. That appealed to her - she wanted to acknowledge where mistakes have been made and in the case of not seeing out her presidential term, talking about the lead-up to that and why that had felt necessary at the time to her, even though she absolutely acknowledges it was a mistake.\"</p><p>The documentary reminds us that Robinson's work is very much ongoing. Now the Chair of The Elders - an independent group of social leaders - she is also spearheading Project Dandelion, a climate justice campaign: \"The fight for climate justice she regards as the key battle of her life. Basically that this is the mother of all battles - that everything has been leading up to this. You really can't tell her story accurately without telling that story. It was vital to include that.</p><p>\"There would have been an argument for ending the film, for example, after the presidential campaign and it certainly could have been done, for it to be an exclusively archival piece. But for Mary, the central truth of her life is that climate justice is this key issue of her life.</p><p>\"Also it is very unusual to have a politician still be as active at this point in their life,\" Kelleher observes. \"You've had many members of The Elders, for example, step back. When we were filming, this is someone you might imagine who would always have an entourage. But actually she travels alone a lot, and she has a very full schedule to an extent that I do think is unusual.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mrs Robinson</emphasis> tells Mary's story, in her own words, for the first time, interspersing her testimony with slices of observational filmmaking in locations that include Ireland, the US, UK, Rwanda, and Uganda.</p><p>Almost 30 interviews were conducted for the film to capture a broad scale of Robinson's impact - as well as family members, contributors include Peter Gabriel, Richard Branson, Fintan O'Toole, and OIivia O'Leary.</p><p>But interestingly, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mrs Robinson</emphasis> also shines a light on her relationship with husband Nick, the nature of which Kelleher was surprised by: \"The story of Mary and Nick is something that I really think has not been in the public domain. And the extent to which she relies on him is something that I would have found very surprising. She is really explicit about the role he has played throughout the course of her career - not just as a support and not just as someone who was holding the fort while she was off travelling internationally. Her preference was always for him to be by her side as a sounding board, as an adviser. That was very surprising - I think there had been a perception of Nick as kind of a 'silent partner' but he played this really active, very supportive role.\"</p><p>Dublin filmmaker Kelleher first came to prominence through her critically acclaimed documentary series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Growing Up Gay</emphasis> which was broadcast on RT\u00c9. She also won awards for her radio documentary <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Case of Majella Moynihan</emphasis>, telling the story of a female garda threatened with dismissal for giving birth to a baby out of wedlock in 1985.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mrs Robinson</emphasis> follows Kelleher's first feature documentary, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">One Million Dubliners</emphasis>, a funny and poignant tale of Glasnevin cemetery and the souls - living and departed - that inhabit it.</p><p>Having worked on and with the subject matter of her latest documentary, what does she feel Robinson's legacy will be?</p><p>\"She's been so outspoken on so many different issues that I think her legacy is going to be really kind of complex and multifaceted,\" says the filmmaker.</p><p>\"She put topics on the agenda that I think contributed to extraordinary levels of progress in Irish society throughout the 1990s. The representation she provided for women and other communities around Ireland was really significant, particularly at that point, whether it was bringing in reproductive rights or gay and lesbian rights really to the fore at that time. How we moved from a society that was kind of quasi-theocratic to something much more open and outward looking and with a really significant role for the diaspora and much more respect for diversity.</p><p>\"The issue of climate justice I do think is going to be really significant. I mean, she talks about the fact that she never spoke about climate justice as president. She never spoke about it in her role in the UN. It was only when her grandson Rory was born and realising, from what she was hearing from communities in Africa, that things were getting so much worse. I definitely think her hope would be that her legacy would focus on climate justice - but I think there's more to her life and more to her career than that as well.\"</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mrs Robinson</emphasis> is released in cinemas on August 23.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Robinson in 1983, seven years before she became president of Ireland; left, the poster for 'Mrs Robinson'; and top, the documentary's director, Aoife Kelleher</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CS8-JJW1-JC8V-402S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

But today, our nation finds itself in a contradictory position.</p><p>While we bear the scars of colonial oppression, we also benefit from a global system that perpetuates modern-day colonialism, extracting wealth from the global south to enrich countries like ours.</p><p>As a state that largely arose out of the ashes of colonialism, we have a unique moral responsibility to confront this reality by enacting policies that move towards a fairer global order. Oxfam's major report, 'Takers Not Makers', published this week, illustrates this point with undeniable evidence, and the spotlight doesn't shy away from Ireland.</p><p>Nearly $100m ( 96m) per day was amassed by the world's 10 wealthiest people while low and middle-income nations are spending half their budgets on debt repayment.</p><p>Indeed, 60% of global billionaire wealth was inherited, or gained via close connections or monopolistic sources.</p><p>The impact of this extreme disparity and hoarding of wealth on the Global South shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>In 2023, the Global North extracted  900bn from the Global South through the financial system - four times the amount money spent on aid. It's time to talk about the elephant in the room that is the global financial system, and Ireland's role in it.</p><p>Ireland's population is tiny on the global scale, but our economic footprint is anything but. We can see the direct impact of our policies on the global south through climate breakdown. Ireland remains an emissions-intensive economy.</p><p>Last year, billionaire wealth rose by an astounding $2tn while more than 733m people worldwide faced hunger. Poverty and inequality are the fruits of systems designed to extract and concentrate wealth in the hands of a few.</p><p>Global North nations hold 77% of billionaire wealth.</p><p>This glaring asymmetry cannot be separated from the colonial foundations upon which our economic systems were built.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Colonialism by another name</emphasis></p><p>Colonialism involved the physical, economic, and political domination of territories, often through violence. While formal colonial rule largely ended in the mid-20th century, its structures were never dismantled - they merely evolved.</p><p>Today, we live in an era of modern colonialism. The extraction of wealth and resources from the Global South continues through global trade systems, multinational corporations, and financial institutions.</p><p>The richest 1% in the Global North received over  29m an hour from the Global South through financial institutions alone in 2023.</p><p>Ireland's economic policies, trade practices, and membership in the European Union place us among the nations that benefit from this unjust system. We export technology and financial services, often built on supply chains that exploit workers in the global south.</p><p>This is a world where African nations, rich in resources essential for green technologies, remain impoverished, with 43% of people lacking access to electricity.</p><p>Colonialism's legacy is embedded in every global institution, from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>These bodies were established during or immediately after the colonial era, reflecting and perpetuating the power dynamics of their time. G7 countries, representing less than 10% of the world's population, still hold 41% of the votes in these institutions.</p><p>This imbalance was starkly evident during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the Global North hoarded vaccines while the Global South faced devastation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Toward a decolonised future</emphasis></p><p>We must dismantle the structures of inequality that colonialism built and that modern colonialism sustains.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tax extreme wealth</emphasis>: Use it to pay for public services, honour our international commitments and to broaden our own tax base.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commit to climate justice</emphasis>: Ramp up our domestic climate action and provide greater financial support for countries in the global south experiencing climate breakdown despite having low emissions.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lead efforts for a multilateral world</emphasis>: Advocate for debt cancellation, democratisation of international institutions, and regulate corporations to ensure living wages and fair-trade practices.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Empower the global south</emphasis>: We must foster economic sovereignty and sustainable development led by the global south.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">End ongoing colonial practices</emphasis>: Formal colonialism persists in territories denied self-determination, most obviously in the occupied Palestinian territories. Ireland must address these injustices through its trade links. Our world can no longer afford the costs of inequality. Without urgent action, it will take over a century to eradicate extreme poverty.</p><p>Climate breakdown is fuelled by the consumption of the richest 1%. To live within our planet's limits, we must prioritise the needs of the many over the excesses of the few.</p><p>Ireland's history reminds us of the suffering wrought by inequality - but it also inspires hope for a different future. Let us reject the myth of billionaire meritocracy and confront the enduring legacy of colonialism.</p><p>A radically more equal world is not just a vague aspiration. It is the only path to justice for all, and the survival of our suffering planet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boys take water on a street in Nairobi, Kenya.

Heat records have been shattered, and this year is \"virtually certain\" to be the hottest year ever recorded, with unprecedented extreme weather events pushing the planet further into uncharted territory.</p><p>The destabilisation of the biosphere and the natural ecosystems we depend on to survive is leading to untold human suffering and further accelerating the mass extinction of flora and fauna.</p><p>Azerbaijan's entire economy is built on fossil fuels, with the state-owned oil company Socar's oil and gas exports accounting for close to 90% of the country's exports. Despite what it might claim, Azerbaijan has no ambition to take climate action. It is planning to expand fossil fuel production, which is completely incompatible with the 1.5C limit and the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change.</p><p>Many attenders of this year's Cop are scared to criticise the Azerbaijan government. Human Rights Watch recently said it could not be certain that attendees' rights to peacefully protest would be guaranteed. In addition, Azerbaijan land and sea borders will remain closed during Cop29, making it only possible to travel in and out of the country by air, which causes pollution and which many Azerbaijan citizens can't afford.</p><p>The reason given for closing borders at all Cops since the start of the covid pandemic is to maintain \"national security\", but I've heard many Azerbaijanis describe the situation as being \"kept in a prison\".</p><p>The Azerbaijan regime is guilty of ethnic cleansing, humanitarian blockades and war crimes, as well as repressing its own population and cracking down on the country's civil society.</p><p>The independent watchdog Freedom House ranks the country as the least democratic state in Europe, with the regime actively targeting journalists, independent media outlets, political and civic activists, and human rights defenders.</p><p>Azerbaijan also accounts for about 40% of Israel's annual oil imports, thus fuelling the Israeli war machine and being complicit in the genocide in Palestine and Israel's war crimes in Lebanon. The Azerbaijan-Israel ties are mutually beneficial as the majority of weapons used by Azerbaijan during the second Nagorno-Karabakh war and likely those used in the September 2023 military operation into the Karabakh region were imported from Israel.</p><p>The 'Cop of peace' is a theme chosen for this year's conference by the host, which wants to encourage states to observe a 'Cop truce'.</p><p>It is gut-wrenching, to say the least, to talk of global peace after the terrible human rights violations committed by Azerbaijan's Aliyev regime against ethnic Armenians living in the Na-gorno-Karabakh/Artsakh region. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is planning to green-wash its crimes against Armenians by building a 'green energy zone' on territories where the population has been ethnically cleansed.</p><p>How did this country get to host the climate summit? It was eastern Europe's turn.</p><p>But Russia vetoed EU members, so the options were either Armenia or Azerbaijan. Armenia lifted its veto against Azerbaijan and supported its bid in exchange for a release of prisoners, although a large number of Armenian political prisoners are still held.</p><p>Last year, regime critic Gubad Ibadoghlu was imprisoned after criticising Azerbaijan's fossil fuel industry. Other political prisoners include peace activist Bahruz Samadov, ethnic minority researcher Iqbal Abilov, political activists Akif Gurbanov and Rus-lan Izzatli and journalists .</p><p>Meanwhile, the EU continues to buy fossil fuels from Azerbaijan and plans to double its import of fossil gas from the country by 2027.</p><p>The climate crisis is just as much about protecting human rights as it is about protecting the climate and biodiversity. You cannot claim to care about climate justice if you ignore the sufferings of oppressed and colonised people today. We cannot pick and choose whose human rights to care for, and who to leave behind. Climate justice means justice, safety, and freedom for everyone.</p><p>During Cop29, the picture of Azerbaijan reported by the media will be a whitewashed and greenwashed version that the regime is desperate to portray. But make no mistake - it is a repressive state accused of ethnic cleansing.</p><p>We need immediate sanctions targeted against the regime and a halt to the import of Azerbaijani fossil fuels. Diplomatic pressure must also be put on the regime to release its Armenian hostages and all political prisoners - and ensure the right to a safe return for Armenians.</p><p>* Greta Thunberg is a Swedish activist and international climate crisis campaigner</p><p>People pose near a sign outside the venue for the Cop29 UN Climate Summit in Baku. Azerbaijan is planning to greenwash its crimes against Armenians by building a 'green energy zone' on territories where the population has been ethnically cleansed, says Greta Thunberg.

The Social Democrats forced their way into the picture with a strong showing.</p><p>The two smaller, left-leaning parties were adjudged to have the best climate policies (even ahead of the Greens) in independent analysis commissioned by Friends of the Earth. That might provide assurance on necessary climate ambition within the next government should they be involved, but neither seems keen   and certainly not if either of the two stays out. The next obvious option is Independents.</p><p>Dr Tara Shine, chief executive of sustainability consultants ChangeByDegrees, says it is  a shame the Greens got burned  and blamed for the cost of living which had nothing to do with green/climate policy.</p><p>The Labour and Soc Dems combination could ensure strong accountability, she says, as good as the Greens or even better, especially on building understanding that  housing justice and climate justice are part of the same thing .</p><p>Going with Independents will slow the response, although legal commitments and compliance with EU regulations still apply, Shine says. Delays will lead to frustration, escalating costs (and fines) and  unhelpful signals to markets .</p><p> It won t be easy. It won t change the [overall] direction of travel\u00a0 but slowing down will be bad for Ireland,  she warns.</p><p>Climate policy specialist Sadhbh O Neill, who failed to win a Labour seat in Waterford, says  it feels like the election took place inside a bubble of denial and delay . She is fearful of how parties will tackle more challenging topics like data centres, high electricity costs and sustainable land use,  because if the next government doesn t act we re all in big, big trouble .</p><p>From a climate policy perspective, the likely combination will be  disastrous . It s not that everything will backslide, she says, but what s already backsliding   on agriculture, land use and forestry   will continue.</p><p>The Climate Act mandates governments to reduce carbon emissions, while they must comply with carbon budgets and meet Paris Agreement obligations. Even if it wants to shun more radical or penal actions, the climate to-do list is substantial. The new coalition has to agree a 2025 climate action plan, to adjust measures where sectoral emission ceilings are being exceeded and set a 2026-2030 carbon budget. So what of the Independents?

We see it in our stormy skies and in the floodwaters inundating our communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We feel it in our throats and lungs when we inhale polluted air, and on our skin as we walk down the street during heat waves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">World leaders would convene every year to make decisions and deals, compromises and commitments, always falling far short of delivering what was needed to mitigate and, increasingly, to adapt to climate change. This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop29) was no exception.</p><p>All this inertia has spurred some to try to find a way around the hard work of ending harmful greenhousegas emissions, protecting critical ecosystems, and rethinking economic growth and development.</p><p>One proposed \"solution\" being pushed by a small but vocal minority in the Global North, is solar geoengineering, which involves modifying Earth's atmosphere to create a reflective barrier against the sun's radiation. For today's youth and future generations, however, such interventions threaten to be as catastrophic as climate change.</p><p>Solar geoengineering can take many forms, including the release of huge amounts of sulphur particles into the stratosphere to create a reflective barrier against sunlight (stratospheric aerosol injection) and the injection of salt spray into shallow marine clouds (marine cloud brightening).</p><p>But it never addresses the root causes of the climate crisis, and it involves modifying our planet's atmosphere in ways that cannot be adequately tested at scale, with effects that will last decades or longer.</p><p>Geoengineering research has always been controversial for precisely these reasons. Countless scientists and experts have warned that the approach could cause far-reaching unintended consequences.</p><p>Studies show, for example, that it could disrupt climate and weather patterns, leading to severe droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme weather. These risks are unpredictable, and their effects would be unequally distributed.</p><p>In fact, solar geoengineering would amplify existing global power imbalances, not least because decisions about its deployment would be made primarily by rich countries in the Global North - the same countries that created the climate crisis.</p><p>These countries nurtured a deadly phenomenon, the burden of which is falling disproportionately on vulnerable communities, and now they propose a highly risky strategy that, even in the best-case scenario, would not solve the problem.</p><p>None of these objections has prevented millions of euro from being funnelled - largely by tech and finance billionaires - into solar geoengineering initiatives. Proponents suggest that such initiatives are a temporary fix, a way to buy more time for mitigation and adaptation. To us, such statements sound like dangerous castles in the air - appealing but illusory.</p><p>It is far more likely that solar geoengineering would provide an excuse for the world's major emitters not to end their fossil-fuel addiction. This compounds the threat of a \"termination shock\": if solar-geoengineering efforts were abruptly halted, rapid warming would ensue.</p><p>Future generations - including today's young people - would thus have to confront dangerous spikes in temperature and far more acute crises than those we face now.</p><p>If nothing else, we will be the ones footing the bill for the economic and societal transformation that climate change demands - a transformation that is not receiving adequate investment today. Advocates of solar geoengineering like to frame it as a \"cheap\" solution, but diverting resources from initiatives that we know work - and do not risk the health of our planet - cannot possibly be considered sound financial management. Instead, it amounts to offloading the hard work of addressing the carbon debt onto our generation and those that follow us.</p><p>That is why we advocate a full ban on solar geoengineering. And we are not alone. More than 2,000 civilsociety organisations, including Fridays For Future, and over 540 academics have called for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering.</p><p>Countries on the front lines of the climate crisis, such as Vanuatu and others, have similarly opposed the use of such technologies.</p><p>Some loud - and, no doubt, well-funded - voices might accuse opponents like us of being closed-minded, suggesting that we should be more willing to engage in dialogue on the topic. But this is merely a ploy to dismiss a position backed by ample research.</p><p>The small group of wellfunded young individuals advocating research into solar geoengineering are often connected to organisations known for promoting these controversial technologies, raising the suspicion that they are being co-opted to give solar geoengineering the guise of youth support.</p><p>The last thing young people need is to be left shouldering the responsibility of yet another crisis we did not create. But that is precisely what solar geoengineering would most likely mean. Pursuing it amounts to a profound generational betrayal.</p><p>  Mohammed Usrof is Founder of the Palestinian Institute for Climate Strategy. Disha Ravi is Co-Founder of Fridays For Future India.

Here, as countries around the world celebrate International Women s Day on March 8th, we present a portrait of 25 Irish women who have provided leadership, instigated change and bought hope to others in the first quarter of this century. We celebrate Irish women and their stories, from Katie Taylor pretending to be a boy to get her first chance in the boxing ring to Mary McAleese exclaiming  wow  as Queen Elizabeth II began her speech in Irish at Dublin Castle for her historic State visit in 2011. Starting in 2000, we offer a year-by-year snapshot, documenting early successes, lifetime achievements and moments that have shaped lives and had far-reaching effects on Irish society.</p><h>2000 </h><h>Sonia O Sullivan </h><h>On 25th September 2000, all Irish eyes were on Sydney, as O Sullivan lined up for what would be the crowning race of her career. As she rounded the final bend of the 5000m Olympic final, it looked for a moment as though gold might be there for the taking, but alas Romanian Gabriela Szabo had the legs on the day. O Sullivan crossed the line in silver medal position, in a national record that still stands to this day, and became the first and (so far) only Irish woman to win an Olympic medal on the track. A world champion, three-time European Champion, two-time World Cross Country Champion, and, until recently, a World Record holder (her 2000m world record stood until 2017), she is arguably the best sportsperson this country has seen, and an undoubted inspiration for the crop of talent that has followed in her footsteps. </h><h>  Niamh Donnelly </h><h>2001</h><h>Deirdre O Kane </h><h>In 2001, Deirdre O Kane was being touted as a  face to watch  at the Edinburgh Festival, as she performed her first-full length show there. She would go on to perform at this festival every year thereafter, becoming more than a face to watch, but a stalwart of the comedy and entertainment scene. Her career has been a robust and varied one. As an actor, she s toured with Druid Theatre Company, appeared in Paths to Freedom (2000), Intermission (2003), and Moone Boy (2012   2015), and won an Irish Film and Television Award for her portrayal of children s rights campaigner, Christina Noble, in the 2014 feature, Noble. When she started out in the comedy circuit, she was one of the few female faces on the scene, and she has blazed a trail for Irish women in stand-up. She s also poured her energies into humanitarian causes, as co-founder of Comic Relief in Ireland. </h><h>  ND</h><h>2002</h><h>Mary Robinson </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><h>In November 2002, having concluded her five-year term as United Nations (UN) Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson received the Sydney Peace Prize for her  consistent support of the vulnerable and disadvantaged the world over . This support of the world s most vulnerable is perhaps the defining element of a career that has included becoming the youngest Reid Professor of Constitutional Law at Trinity College Dublin; working to decriminalise homosexuality, legalise contraception and divorce, and enable women to sit on juries; and serving as the first female president of Ireland, from 1990 1997. Robinson was the first Head of State to visit Rwanda following the 1994 genocide, and the first Head of State to visit Somalia after the 1992 crisis. Now in her 80s, she remains an active campaigner for peace and climate justice. She is a member of the Elders, a group of independent global leaders working for peace, justice, human rights, and a sustainable planet, founded by Nelson Mandela. </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><h>  ND</h><p/><h>2003 Marian Keyes </h><p/><h>A stalwart of the Irish fiction world and a fierce champion of homegrown writing, Marian Keyes started her career in 1995 with the hilarious novel Watermelon. By 2003, she was seven books into her career and Watermelon was about to be released on to the screen in a film adaptation starring Anna Friel and Brenda Fricker. Keyes  career has only gone from strength to strength since. Her whip-smart, empathetic stories, coupled with her own honesty and vulnerability about her personal life, including her time in rehab for addiction and the later depression she experienced, have seen her become a beloved force in Irish publishing. In the early 2000s, the phrase   chicklit   was still being used to describe commercial fiction penned by women. Keyes was among the authors   like Maeve Binchy, Cathy Kelly and Sheila O Flanagan   who showed that fiction about women could be accessible while plumbing the depths of human experience.   Marian Keyes introduced the world to a particularly witty Irish sense of humour,  says author Edel Coffey.  But she also showed Irish writers that you didn t have to emulate other voices or literary styles to be successful but rather you could be totally authentically yourself and still connect with a large international readership.    Aoife Barry</h><p/><h>2004 Alice Leahy</h><p/><h> In 2004 the National University of Ireland awarded an Honorary Degree to Alice Leahy, director and co-founder of the Alice Leahy Trust, a non-judgemental, befriending, social and health service for people who are homeless. A former nurse, Leahy cofounded the Trust in 1975 (it was just  the Trust  then) after </h><p>years spent working with the Simon community in Dublin. In the years since she has been chairwoman of the Sentence Review Group and a former Irish Human Rights Commissioner as well as a writer, broadcaster and lecturer. Her focus throughout has been on battling the issue of social exclusion and helping people who have been left behind. Her memoir, The Stars Are Our Only Warmth, co-written with Catherine Cleary was published in 2018, the same year she was awarded the International Human Rights &amp; Nursing Award from The International Care Ethics Observatory and the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Irish Red Cross. She s one of the people who makes life in Ireland bearable for the most vulnerable.   Patrick Freyne</p><h>2005 Ruth Negga </h><p/><h>2005 was when Irish-Ethiopian actor Ruth Negga truly made her mark on the big screen thanks to her role as Charlie (friend of Cillian Murphy s character, Kitten) in the Neil Jordan film Breakfast on Pluto. Born in Addis Ababa, Negga grew up in Limerick and later London, and by the early 2000s was working across the stage, television and film. Just 10 years after Breakfast on Pluto she received an Oscar nomination for her role as Mildred Loving in the film Loving, about the real-life interracial couple who helped overturn anti-miscegenation laws in 1960s America. Negga became one of the new faces of the Irish screen, but her talent was swiftly spotted abroad and she went on to star in series such as Misfits, Preacher and, </h><p>Presumed Innocent.   AB</p><h>2006 Garry Hynes </h><p/><h>In 2006 Hynes was awarded Freedom of the City of Galway, the city s highest bestowed honour, having cofounded the Druid Theatre Company there 31 years previously, the first professional theatre company outside Dublin. The world-renowned director had already made history in 1998 as the first woman to win a Tony Award for Directing (her work on Martin McDonagh s debut, The Beauty Queen of Leenane, was recognised on the occasion). From working with McDonagh, to Enda Walsh, to frequent collaborations with the late Tom Murphy, Hynes has had a defining influence on Irish theatre. She has brought new life to old work, and helped to shape a new generation of theatre makers. In 2005, Fintan O Toole described DruidSynge, her production of all six of John Millington Synge s plays, as  one of the greatest achievements in the history of Irish theatre .   ND</h><p/><h>2007 </h><p/><h>Lydia Foy </h><p/><h>Often it is individuals who make a large contribution to changing legal history in Ireland. In 1993, transgender Kildare woman Lydia Foy sought a new birth certificate with her female gender. She was refused, and brought High Court proceedings in 1997. While her claim was rejected in 2002, in 2007 the case was brought back to court and the judge found that her rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated. This significant result was initially appealed, and in the end it took until 2014 for Foy to settle her action against the State, which pledged to introduce a Gender Recognition Act. This was enacted into Irish law in 2015 and meant that such an onerous legal journey would no longer be necessary for other Irish trans people.   AB</h><h>2008 </h><p/><h>Saoirse Ronan </h><p/><h> I think I feel more like a kid than ever,  Saoirse Ronan told reporters on the 2008 Oscars red carpet, where aged 13, she was the youngest nominee on the night. Who can forget her green dress, or her breakout performance as Briony Tallis in Atonement, for which she received the nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category. In the years that have followed, Ronan has flown the flag for the Irish in Hollywood, with three more Academy Award nominations to her name, along with seven British Academy Film Award nominations, and a Golden Globe win for her portrayal of Lady Bird in Greta Gerwig s 2017 film of the same name. Her serious approach to her art form matched with her unpretentious demeanour, her feminist attitude, and her support of up-and-comers, has made her a much admired and beloved figure in Irish arts.   ND</h><h>2009  </h><p/><h>Catherine McGuinness</h><p/><h> In 2009, former Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness was given a Lord Mayor s Award  for her contribution to the lives of children and families  and later became the Chairperson of the Campaign for Children. Born in Belfast in 1934, McGuinness has made monumental contributions to Irish life over several decades. She was appointed as the first female judge to the Circuit Court in 1994, subsequently becoming a High Court and a Supreme Court judge. McGuinness also served as a Senator and as a member of the Council of State for Presidents Hillery and Higgins. Her active involvement in public service shaped Ireland s legal and social landscape   she is a former President of the Law Reform Commission and served on the Kilkenny incest investigation. McGuinness s trailblazing legacy is celebrated in a portrait at the National Gallery, recognising her lifelong commitment to justice.   R\u00f3is\u00edn Ingle</h><h>2010 Michelle O Neill </h><p/><h>In June 2010, the Tyrone Times reported that local government in Dungannon had  ushered in a new era , when it elected its first ever  lady Mayor . That lady, Sinn F\u00e9in councillor, Michelle O Neill, would go on to serve in the Northern Ireland Executive as minister for agriculture, health minister, and Deputy First Minister, before becoming the first nationalist First Minister of Northern Ireland in 2022.  I am a republican. I will be a First Minister for all,  she pledged, hoping to again usher in a new era of change. The daughter of former IRA prisoner and Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Brendan Doris, O Neill had her first child aged 16, while still at secondary school. She became vice-president of Sinn F\u00e9in in 2018, a post she still holds.   ND</h><p/><h>2011 Mary McAleese </h><p/><h>As the second-ever female Irish president, Mary McAleese was already making history when she successfully invited Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland for a historic State visit in May 2011. The visit necessitated the largest security operation in the history of the Republic, but overall was seen as a symbol of the normalisation of the relations between the Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom, and a direct result of the Belfast Agreement. McAleese, who grew up in Belfast, described the visit as an  extraordinary moment in Irish history  and a sign of the success of the peace process. That McAleese herself was seen to exclaim  wow  when the Queen opened her speech at Dublin Castle with the phrase  A Uachtar\u00e1in agus a chairde  showed just how significant an event it was.   AB</h><p/><h>2012 Katie Taylor </h><p/><h>Goosebumps rippled across the ExCel Arena from the moment Katie Taylor walked into the ring for the women s lightweight Olympic final, until the final victorious blows. London was green, white, and gold. Chants of Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, and Ireland, Ireland, Ireland drowned out the commentary. It seemed this moment had been written in the stars. From her early days pretending to be a boy so she could get into boxing competitions; to fighting in the first officially sanctioned female boxing match in Ireland, aged 15; to being a leading force in the campaign to get women s boxing into the Olympics, Taylor s 2012 Olympic glory couldn t have been more fortuitous. She is widely credited with putting women s boxing on the map, an undertaking she has continued to uphold in her professional career   she competed in the first women s boxing match to headline Madison Square Garden (Taylor v Serrano, 2022), and in the most-watched women s professional sporting event in US history (Taylor v Serrano, 2024). A recent survey confirmed that she is Ireland s most popular sports person.   ND</h><p/><h>2013 Catherine Corless </h><p/><h>A  tireless crusader of dignity and truth  is how the then Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin described amateur historian Catherine Corless in 2021, following a government commission examining Ireland s Mother and Baby Homes. In the early 2010s, Corless began researching the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, later publishing an article asking if children had been buried on the site of a septic tank at the home. Between 2011 and 2013 she obtained the death records for children who died in the home, with her story breaking in the national media one year later. In 2017, it was confirmed that a number of human remains   including those of babies and children   were found at the Tuam site. Thanks to Corless s tenacious work, the dark history of these long-running institutions was finally acknowledged and the State apologised for failing the mothers and children who lived in them.   AB</h><p/><h>2014 Sister Stan </h><p/><h>A  long-standing commitment and dedication to improving the lives and living conditions for the under privileged in Irish society  was recognised in 2014 when Sister Stanislaus Kennedy was awarded the UCD Alumni Award for Social Sciences. A member of the Religious Sisters of Charity since 1958, Sr Stan (as she is fondly known) had graduated with a Bachelor in Social Science in 1969, and a Master of Social Science in 1980. She has dedicated her life to campaigning for the marginalised in society, particularly those in poverty and homelessness. In 1985, she founded Focus Point, which would later become the homeless charity Focus Ireland, one of the largest voluntary organisations in the country. In 2001, she established the Immigrant Council of Ireland, an organisation that promotes the rights of migrants in Ireland.   ND</h><p/><h>2015  Breege O Donoghue</h><p/><h> From rural Co Clare, Breege O Donoghue was born into an Ireland that did not expect women to become accomplished businesspeople. But after an  accidental  career in hotel management that began in Galway, she joined Penneys in 1979 to set up its human resources department. At that time, it had 24 stores. It now has 350 stores across 11 countries. As the first woman on the Penneys board, she had a long and impactful career at the company until 2016, when she called time after 37 years. The year before she finished, the store reached a milestone moment when Primark (its international arm) opened its first United States store in Boston. O Donoghue was instrumental in this new phase for the company, showing exactly why she has earned such a fierce reputation in business.   AB</h><p/><h>2016 </h><p/><h>Lian Bell </h><p/><h>When members of Ireland s theatre community noticed the Abbey Theatre s centenary programme for 2016 was heavily male-dominated, they did more than complain to the theatre   they started a grassroots movement. The reaction to the programme sparked the campaign #WakingTheFeminists, with artist Lian Bell as campaign director and tens of other artists involved. A public meeting was held at the Abbey in late 2015, where #WakingTheFeminists called for equality for women across the Irish theatre sector. Its calls were heard   it was commissioned by the Arts Council to undertake research into gender balance into the Irish theatre in 2016, and the results were shared with the public that year. The movement forced the Abbey Theatre and Irish theatre as a whole to reckon with how women had been treated in this sector of the arts, leading to new gender policies, codes of behaviour, unconscious bias training and more.   AB</h><h>2017 Sally Rooney </h><p/><h>In 2017, a 26-year-old Irish woman published what The New Yorker called  a new kind of adultery novel . Conversations with Friends had been acquired by publisher, Faber, in a seven-way auction. Its author had recently been shortlisted for the Sunday Times Short Story Award, for her story Mr Salary. Clearly, things were about to take off for Sally Rooney. But just how stratospheric her rise would be was unfathomable to most. The publication, a year later, of her second novel, Normal People, followed by a wildly successful TV adaptation starring Paul Mescal, would garner the admiration of everyone from Sarah Jessica Parker to Kourtney Kardashian. But superstardom aside, it was clear that Rooney had pioneered a new kind of fiction, one whose imitators would be numerous. She has gone on to publish two more successful novels, Beautiful World Where Are You (2021), and Intermezzo (2024). Beyond her literary prowess, she has navigated her elevated status with grace, shying away from the limelight except on rare occasions, when she might advocate for Palestinian rights, or deliver a clear-minded takedown of the Irish government s approach to housing.   ND</h><p/><h>2018 Tara Shine </h><p/><h>Environmental scientist, Dr Tara Shine has devoted her career to the pursuit of preserving our planet, having advised world leaders and international organisations on climate change, worked as special adviser to the Mary Robinson Foundation: Climate Justice, and served for ten years as climate negotiator at the United Nations. In 2018, she cofounded the award-winning social enterprise, Change by Degrees, with the aim of making sustainability convenient for businesses and communities. She is also an advocate for women in science and in January 2019, she travelled to Antarctica as part of Homeward Bound, a global leadership programme for women in science. In 2020, she was appointed to a senior UN role, to facilitate the delivery of Paris Agreement goals. Christiana Figueres, Former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has described Shine as  determined and steadfast, driven by her principles and her desire to find practical solutions to climate change that [will] benefit the many and not the few .   ND</h><p/><h>2019 Ailbhe Smyth </h><p/><h>It s hard to name a more notable figure in Irish activism than Ailbhe Smyth, who has been involved in LGBT+ activism, feminist activism, the campaign for marriage equality and the campaign to Repeal the 8th Amendment   to mention just some of her work. Born in 1946, Smyth first became involved in activism in the 1970s during the days of the women s liberation movement. In 2022, she was awarded the freedom of Dublin city. In 2019, Smyth was named as one of Time s 100 Most Influential People alongside her co-directors of Together for Yes, Grainne Griffin and Orla O Connor, in recognition of their roles in the campaign to legalise abortion in Ireland. As actor Ruth Negga (who also features on our list of notable women) wrote in her Time profile, the women s  incredible tenacity and integrity and courageousness will be an inspiration for generations to come . Smyth s activism has spanned decades, and inspired many people to fight for causes that impact people across Ireland.   AB</h><p/><h>2020 Eileen Flynn </h><p/><h>Eileen Flynn became the first Traveller to serve in the Oireachtas when she was appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach in 2020. She grew up in the Labre Park Traveller Housing Site in Ballyfermot in Dublin. Her mother died of pneumonia at the young age of 48. Flynn was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 18. She attended Trinity College as part of an access programme, before attending the Ballyfermot College of Further Education and earning a degree in community development from Maynooth University. Over the years she has been an activist with the Irish Travellers Movement, the National Traveller Women s Forum and the Ballyfermot Action Programme. She has campaigned against racism and prejudice and for marriage equality, housing and abortion rights. Since 2020 she has been a tireless voice for equality in the Seanad. Young Traveller writer and activist Emma Ward says of Flynn:  I consider Eileen to be a role model. What she has done during her time as a senator really is amazing ... I hope I can be as brilliant an activist as she has been.    PF</h><p/><h>2021 Patricia Scanlon </h><p/><h>2021 represented a kind of crossroads for Patricia Scanlon. That was the year that the entrepreneur and engineer became executive chair of SoapBox Labs, the company she founded in 2013, having transferred from the chief executive position as funding poured in: by 2021, the company had raised over $12 million in funding to support their endeavours. Soapbox offers voice technology for children to assist with their reading skills, as well as helping them interact well in educational settings. The technology was inspired by her three-year-old daughter, after Scanlon had observed her behaviour responding to a poorly formatted educational reading game on an iPad. Named by Forbes magazine in 2018 as one of the world s top 50 women in tech, in 2022, after selling her company to US education company Curriculum Associates, the Naas native became Ireland s first Artificial Intelligence ambassador, appointed by the Irish government to provide support to government departments and other agencies in relation to the hazards and opportunities created by AI.   Nadine O Regan</h><p/><h>2022 Nicola Hanney </h><p/><h>In 2022, news broke that a now former garda named Paul Moody was sentenced to three years and three months in prison for the coercive control of a woman who was ill with cancer. He was one of the first people in the state prosecuted under that law, and the court heard the abuse included harassment, threats and sending 30,000 messages to the woman. Judge Martin Nolan told the court that Moody made his ex-partner s life  hell . The survivor in this case was Nicola Hanney, who the following year waived her anonymity for the RT\u00c9 documentary Taking Back Control.  I feel that if I don t break my silence how can I send a positive message to other people that are living in these situations?  Hanney told RT\u00c9. She was widely praised for sharing her story, which included calling for more support for survivors to help them leave abusive relationships and raising awareness about relationship  red flags .  Nicola has been a huge inspiration to women around Ireland who are subjected to coercive control,  says Sarah Benson, chief executive of Women s Aid. </h><p> By sharing her account of abuse at the hands of her former partner she broke the silence that surrounds abuse in Ireland. Women s voices and experiences are critical and should be at the heart of the national conversation on zero tolerance of all forms of gender-based violence.    AB </p><h>2023 </h><p/><h>Sin\u00e9ad Burke </h><p/><h>Born in 1990   the year Ireland got its first female President, Mary Robinson   Sin\u00e9ad Burke has gone on to become a trailblazer in the world of disability activism. As a little person, she grew up with parents (Chris and Kath) who founded the organisation Little People of Ireland in 1998, and so understood early on the power of advocating for yourself. Though she trained as a teacher, it was Burke s interest in the fashion industry and how she interrogated its treatment of disabled people on her blog Minnie M\u00e9lange that put her on the radar of high-powered people including US president Barack Obama, who invited her to the White House in 2016. </h><p>She s since founded the accessibility consultancy Tilting the Lens, been the first little person to attend the Met Gala in 2019, run a podcast, written a book (Break the Mould) and appeared on the cover of British Vogue in 2019 and again in 2023, when she also served as a consultant editor. Having already made such a large impact, Burke continues to blaze a trail in the worlds of disability activism, fashion and beyond.   AB</p><h>2024 Rhasidat Adeleke </h><p/><h> When I crossed the line and I realised I came second, I was a bit devastated,  Tallaght s Rhasidat Adeleke told David Gillick, moments after walking off the track at the 2024 European Championships. The then 21-year-old had just won a silver medal in the 400m, and run a national record of 49.07 seconds, but it is perhaps the measure of her mettle and ambition that she felt she could have achieved more. </h><p>Later that same year, she would compete in her first Olympics, coming fourth in a 400m final that saw the Olympic record broken. She would also help the women s relay team to another nail-biting fourth, and grip the entire country. </p><p>With national records in every sprint event from 60m to 400m, and a dazzling contract from sporting brand Nike, Adeleke is possibly the most talented sprinter Ireland has ever seen. On and off the track, she inspires young athletes with her talent and positive attitude.

Coppinger explained that she would abstain on a vote to nominate Mary Lou McDonald as Taoiseach because of \"recent moves to the right\" that Sinn F\u00e9in had made. \"They are turning their backs on vulnerable groups like trans young people and denying them healthcare, and on refugees. This makes it very difficult to give them a free pass,\" Coppinger explained.</p><p>A coolness passed between Boyd Barrett and Coppinger, chilly enough to be perceivable from all the way up in the press gallery above. With his time, Boyd Barrett said that he would be backing McDonald's bid for Taoiseach because \"parties on the left have an obligation to end 100 years of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael and put together the first left-wing government this State has ever seen\".</p><p>The nomination of McDonald as Taoiseach is a plainly doomed endeavour, so maybe that's why the altogether moot disagreement didn't generate much commentary or analysis. But actually, the two differing TDs represent two sides of what could prove to be a very fateful debate for Ireland's left. If mismanaged, this thorny issue could do more to guarantee another century of Fianna F\u00e1il/Fine Gael permagovernance than the heretofore \"establishment\" parties could ever manage on their own.</p><p>'could eager a left-that into one</p><p>Ireland doesn't really have the same kind of Conservative/Labour or Republican/Democrat binary left-right divide that we tend to see in other countries, and thank Christ for that. What has emerged in sharp relief since the 2020 election is a different kind of polarisation, between those who are at worst ambivalent about 'FFG' enduring in government and those who think that the dominance of the two parties represents the absolute nadir of Irish politics. With a new government that could be perceived as more 'right' wing than ever before - in relative terms party isn't left- - there is a strong chance that the anti-FFG vote could grow and distill by the next election.</p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in convincingly sold itself as 'the alternative' to the public in 2020, and less-convincingly tried the same in 2024. There is a cohort on the left, as articulated by Boyd Barret, who think that it's their responsibility to help make that Sinn F\u00e9in 'change' government happen, to kick FFG out. But the Irish left - which stretches all the way from trade unionism to socialism - could be about to do more harm to itself than any FFG majority reign ever could.</p><p>Having spent decades consumed with the moral quandaries associated with \"propping up\" Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, politicians who obsess the most about ideological purity seem prepared to sacrifice it for the opportunity to prop up Sinn F\u00e9in. The same Sinn F\u00e9in that is often incoherent on climate justice, which has tried to scrap property tax (a wealth tax!) and which has exhibited an identity crisis on issues like immigration that has it veering all over the political spectrum. Ireland's progressive politicians could be so eager to form a left-wing government that they sleepwalk into forming one with a party that isn't all that left-wing at all.</p><p>That's not to say that a Sinn F\u00e9in-led government should not happen, and that those on the left shouldn't use their time in opposition pro-actively to work on a constructive alliance. But if you were Mary Lou McDonald, and you watched socialists and lefties tell each other that they were \"obliged\" to put you into power, why would you bother offering compromises and concessions to make your party more attractive to people who think they have a moral duty to make you Taoiseach?</p><p>Though it would get me exiled from leftie Twitter, if I hadn't already been banished for other cerebral tresspasses, the unspeakable truth is that parties that have gone into power with FFG in the past have changed the erstwhile \"Big Two\" for the better. Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael are infinitely more populist than they would ever willingly admit, and they have moved a lot on social and climate issues over the last couple of decades - often under the influence of a junior coalition partner with just enough leverage to bring down the government.</p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in are populist too, and have moved a lot more for a lot less. But to carelessly christen them Ireland's leftwing government-in-waiting is to destroy whatever purchase genuine left parties might have to negotiate for very important policy changes from Sinn F\u00e9in.</p><p>A better strategic position, and one that would increase the probability of having a far more left-wing government in practice, would be for progressives and their parties to start feeling the same way about a coalition with Sinn F\u00e9in as it does the other two parties. In other words, as a \"hold your nose\" political union. Those who articulate completely reasonable questions they have about Sinn F\u00e9in's left-wing credentials, like Coppinger, have already been accused of leftie heresy. But only by people whose version of secular democracy is actually frighteningly close to dogmatic <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.religion.be\">www.religion.be</url> so form wing they forming with a that that wing'</p><p>There is hope for a more left-wing government in Ireland's future, and the prospect of neither Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael being in power is now reasonable enough. A word to the wise for the lefties plotting to put Sinn F\u00e9in into power at any cost: when a coalition government goes wrong, guess who always gets the blame?</p><p>'Politicians could be so eager to form a left-wing government that they sleepwalk into forming one with a party that isn't all that left-wing'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-201889784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DW0-W6P3-RS6B-J0BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 11, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQNG</classCode><className>SOCIALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000C43N</classCode><className>BONE FRACTURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQQA</classCode><className>POLITICAL &amp; SOCIAL IDEOLOGIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001461</classCode><className>REFUGEES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) begins two weeks of hearings today  at which more than 100 nations and organisations will make 30-minute back-to-back oral submissions in a case being described as  a watershed moment in the global struggle for climate justice .</p><p>The aim of the case is to identify states  obligations as set out in international legal instruments including the UN Charter, the Paris Agreement of 2016, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights   and to clarify exactly how those obligations must translate into concrete political action.</p><p>The fact that the Declaration of Human Rights is included among those instruments is being taken as an indication that climate change is now being considered as a potential human rights issue.  With most countries falling far short of their obligations to reduce emissions and protect and restore nature, this advisory opinion has real potential to send a powerful signal that states must fulfil their legal duty to act,  says Manuel Pulgar-Vidal of the World Wildlife Fund. </p><h>Island of Vanuatu The case began in 2019 as a campaign led by 27 students on the Pacific island of Vanuatu. Today it is regarded as a case study illustrating the power of grassroots activism and the resilience of small nations in the face of existential climate threats.</h><p>That Vanuatu campaign led directly to the adoption in March 2023 of UN general assembly Resolution 77/276 by a consensus of the 193 states   a vote regarded at the time as underscoring the urgent need among states themselves for clarity about the extent of their legal responsibilities. That level of interest was maintained when the ICJ opened its proceedings and received 91 written submissions, the highest number filed in advisory proceedings before the court. The aim of those proceedings is to answer two specific questions, both carefully couched to allow a multifaceted response.</p><p>The first is: What are the obligations of states under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases?</p><p>The second asks: What are the legal consequences for states under these obligations where they, by their acts or omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, including small island developing states that are particularly vulnerable, and current and future generations affected by climate change?</p><p>The ICJ case is part of a growing legal momentum at a number of UN-backed courts behind the issue of climate change.</p><p>The first was the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea which issued an opinion in May that defined greenhouse gas emissions as a form of marine pollution and said states must  take all necessary measures to prevent and control  them.</p><p>Also last May, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights began hearings on the obligation of Latin American countries to tackle climate change. A decision is expected later this year.</p><p>Separately, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in a case in April relating only to Switzerland, issued an opinion establishing protection from the effects of climate change as a human right under European law.</p><p>If there is a timely precedent the ICJ judges may acknowledge in issuing their advisory opinion   which is non-binding but authoritative   it may well be that ECHR ruling.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21484337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJH-3S41-JC8Y-802H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 2, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Tribunals</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922110EM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL COURTS &amp;

And for the third time in a row, the party has managed to shoot itself immediately in the foot. </p><p>At the outset of of the 2016 campaign, Enda Kenny tied himself in knots and never fully disentangled himself over the meaning of the words  fiscal space . In 2020, an unexpected controversy blew up in the party s face over a long-planned commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary. </p><p>Now, in the opening rounds of this general election, Simon Harris has been forced on to the defensive over comments made at a Fine Gael event in Mullingar by Michael O Leary. Pointing to the high proportion of teachers in the D\u00e1il, the Ryanair boss pronounced that he  wouldn t generally employ a lot of teachers to go out and get things done .</p><p>The line itself would hardly make anyone s top 100 list of provocative O Leary statements. More embarrassing for Fine Gael was probably the guffaws and applause of the audience, captured on video.</p><p>Michael O Leary s views on teachers are unlikely to have much bearing on the ultimate outcome of this election. But in a short campaign that has only 17 days remaining, every slip means a precious news cycle has been lost.</p><p>With all parties rolling out policies and promises across a range of issues, and with manifestos either being published or imminent, there is a risk that voters will be overloaded with information. That is a perfect environment for a viral meme like the O Leary clip to have an impact, particularly if it feeds into a particular narrative.</p><p>Fine Gael s opponents, who now include not just the mostly left-leaning parties of the Opposition but also erstwhile Government colleagues in Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party, now have a shared purpose: to paint the party as uncaring and less committed to social or climate justice than they are. If the party wished to rebut such attacks, then inviting Michael O Leary to speak off the cuff at its campaign event might not have been the wisest strategy.</p><p>It is a peculiarity of Irish electoral politics that since the demise of the Progressive Democrats none of its major parties wishes to be described as centre-right. In other countries, a robust defence of free-market economics and a preference for a smaller state would be unremarkable. Fine Gael is the natural inheritor of that political tradition yet seems uneasy about acknowledging it. Hence the awkward gap between the cheers for O Leary s comments in Mullingar and Harris describing them as  crass and ill-informed .</p><p>There is, of course a simpler explanation. Three weeks before an election is the worst possible time to insult a large bloc of voters.</p><p>Fine Gael s curse strikes again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21431796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD6-0S51-JC8Y-848Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002S0T</classCode><className>RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>RYAAY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>RYA (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DSNG</classCode><className>INFORMATION OVERLOAD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE000DEWP</classCode><className>ENDA KENNY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I feel very lucky to be part of that.\"</p><p>Kerrie McNeill (26), Saintfield, artist Illustrator Kerrie is all about ensuring people find joy in her work.</p><p>\"My work is known for its bold and bright colour palettes, patterns and quirky illustration style.</p><p>\"I'm a maximalist through and through and I take a lot of inspiration from nature, nostalgia and everyday life.\"</p><p>She operates from her home studio in Co Down.</p><p>\"For me, illustration is all about spreading positivity, finding joy in the little things, and making people smile.\"</p><p>She graduated from Ulster University in 2022 after studying graphic design and illustration.</p><p>\"During university I had the opportunity to work on an introducing range for Tesco through UK Greetings, and that was the moment I realised maybe I could make this work.</p><p>\"I gradually dropped shifts at my part-time job and, in 2023, I decided to take the plunge and go full-time as a freelancer.</p><p>\"Now I create playful paper goods, including art prints, greeting cards, and stationery, which I sell online and in independent shops across the UK, USA and Europe.\"</p><p>As for her business journey so far, Kerrie describes everything as \"a little crazy and exciting\".</p><p>\"I never imagined I'd be doing this, let alone working with some of my dream clients.</p><p>\"It still blows my mind when I take a minute to think about it. I feel so grateful to be doing what I love every day, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.\"</p><p>Josh Bell (26), Bangor and Belfast, cafe owner The two businesses operated by Josh Bell - The Highwayman and Coffee Rustler - are minimalist, trendy spots boasting stripped back decor, exposed wood, a slim menu and fashionable crockery.</p><p>The inspiration for both is more bucolic, related to his family background in the countryside.</p><p>\"I feel like my farming heritage definitely has a huge part in my work ethic. I just love the work and I love the early mornings. The 5.30am starts get me going all right.</p><p>\"My fianc\u00e9e and I built Coffee Rustler ourselves with whatever money I had saved.

Because if we don't make substantive changes... between now and 2030 we will not get to the net zero,' the former president said.</p><p>'I cannot emphasise enough; I think about it all the time. It's my compelling urgency that we are not necessarily going to have a liveable planet for people alive today. That's frightening, but we can solve this. It's very, very doable, and that's frustrating.'</p><p>Mrs Robinson would not be drawn on the decimation of the Green Party in the recent general election, and what its wipeout signals on attitudes towards climate in Ireland. However, she did criticise the Government's handling of carbon emissions.</p><p>The Climate Change Advisory Council has once again warned that Ireland has not met its climate change challenges, and is currently set to miss its agreed carbon targets out to 2030.</p><p>'I'm always very careful not to get involved in the Irish internal political situation, but I have noted the report that we potentially are going to have to stupidly pay (EURO)20billion to the EU in 2030 because we haven't got our policies right,' Mrs Robinson said, referring to a damning assessment by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p><p>'I don't think it's a political comment to say that is not clever.</p><p>We need now to understand that we should spend something like (EURO)20billion to get ourselves on track between now and 2030 so we don't have to give it instantly to the EU.'</p><p>Mrs Robinson, 80, served as the first female president of Ireland between 1990 and 1997. She ended her tenure controversially in 1997 to take up the role as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p>Following her time in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, Mrs Robinson went on to become a founding member of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders working for justice and sustainability founded by Nelson Mandela, and has served in a variety of high-profile UN climate roles.</p><p>Asked how global events in the past 12 months have impacted her work, she replied: 'This has been a very busy year, and it ends on a worrying note, because unfortunately, the geopolitical divides are still opening up.</p><p>'We didn't have a great COP on climate in Baku, but we did get an agreement we can build on...</p><p>And then we had the election of President Trump again.'</p><p>As Mr Trump prepares to return to the top office, many of the Republican's policies have sparked global concern with world leaders apprehensive about his economic, climate and migration pledges. Mrs Robinson previously voiced concern that Mr Trump will withdraw the US again from the landmark Paris Climate Accord.</p><p>She has now gone further in her concerns about his return to power on January 20, saying Mr Trump will 'make life a lot more difficult' across a broad range of issues, including world peace, climate and human rights.</p><p>'I was obviously disappointed [about his re-election] for a number of reasons. I think we have to anticipate that this time, he will be even more determined to take steps very early on and very aggressively that will not be helpful on a whole range of things,' Mrs Robinson said.</p><p>'He's talked about deporting people on a massive scale. He clearly is worrying a great many minorities, and then he's been responsible for the more conservative Supreme Court that has pushed back the rights of women enormously, and that presumably will continue. So it's going to be a bumpy four years, a rough four years, but we'll see it through.'</p><p>Despite these challenges, Mrs Robinson maintained that she is hopeful for the future. She said: 'I learned a great lesson from Archbishop Desmond Tutu. He was accused of being an optimist, and he said, \"Oh no, I'm not an optimist. I'm a prisoner of hope\". And that means even if the glass isn't half full, even if there is only a little in the glass, you work with that. That's what I believe in.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:news@dailymail.ie\">news@dailymail.ie</email></p><p>'It's going to be a bumpy four years' 'It's doable - and that's frustrating'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Famous duo: Mary Robinson with screen star Zendaya at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards in West Hollywood earlier in 2024</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-201579757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DS1-81X3-RSGG-X2R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 28, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSTY</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

Current policies would lead to a disastrous 2.7 degrees of warming this century, according an update by the Climate Action Tracker project.</p><p>This would cause a level of disruption that many scientists say will put human civilisation at risk.</p><p>The expected level of global heating by the end of the century has not changed since 2021, with  minimal progress  made this year, it concludes.</p><p>The main obstacle among negotiators from the nearly 200 countries gathered in Azerbaijan is over how much finance wealthier countries should provide, and how much could come from other sources. Key disagreements remain on the total finance number and how much is from public money, loans and private finance.</p><p>It had been  very rough  over the previous 24 hours, said Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, who is leading negotiations on adaptation measures in Baku. This followed controversy over his French colleagues not coming to Baku and the withdrawal of the Argentinian delegation. But there were  strands for hope  in setting out a course to achieve $1.3 trillion for low- and middle-income countries.  The question is how is that made up,  Mr Ryan said.</p><p>The all-important text for what is known as the  new collective quantified goal  has expanded from nine to 34 pages but this was a technical summary needing to be knocked into shape over coming days, he added, before minsters gather next week in an attempt to forge a political agreement.</p><p>The EU believed it was putting climate justice at the centre of the goal but there was a need for private finance and for funds with fair interest rates, Mr Ryan said.  That will be critical. Agreement is not impossible despite a lot of turbulence in recent days. </p><p>Beyond a headline figure in public funds, a variety of finance was required, including money from multilateral development banks, insurance companies, carbon markets and new funding sources.</p><p>With global subsidies for fossil fuels standing at about $7 trillion,  redirecting that into the clean [energy] is a key part of what we have to do , he said. Focusing on the demand side by  switching to clean energy is the best way to cut off oil and gas supply .</p><p>Speaking after a meeting of EU ministers, Mr Ryan said there must be contributions from all big carbon polluters including emerging economies such as China.  But how exactly you deliver that is where the negotiations will go. </p><p>It may involve a lot more transparency on what is already happening on financial flows, such as China s  belt and road initiative  in developing countries, and allowing countries to opt into that  rather than rewriting who is a developing country, who is a developed country .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21440708</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDT-X8F1-JC8Y-80XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 15, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

It must be affordable and accessible,\" she said.</p><p>She also expressed concern that Ireland was following other countries towards \"a populism about those who have come into our country. I sense that there is more hate speech and more rudeness. I think it is really important to counter that.\"</p><p>The former professor of law and senator recalled the backlash she experienced when she set out to reform the country's law on family planning.

Blanket misuse has, troublingly, turned the term in to a feature on an Israeli politician's lingo-bingo scorecard.</p><p>And all this is happening precisely at a time when antisemitism is increasing globally, and when Jewish schools and synagogues have been dealing with death threats and desecrations.</p><p>In the past 18 months, a Jewish woman was stabbed in her home in France, there have been shootings at schools in Canada, and an antisemitic riot in Dagestan in Russia.</p><p>Meanwhile, the far right is taking advantage of the political crisis brought about by Israel's world-changing war, alternately using actual antisemitism and a pretence of caring about antisemitism to advance its bigoted ideology.</p><p>For some sections of the far right, antisemitism is the active ingredient powering a racist, migrant, and Muslim-bashing agenda.</p><p>It echoes the antisemitism that has always been at the core of white supremacism and which has made a comeback with the \"great replacement\" theory, the conspiracy that Jewish people are secretly plotting to flood Western countries with people of colour.</p><p>On the other hand, for resurgent farright parties across Europe, a performative fight against antisemitism has provided a path to political rehabilitation.</p><p>Extremist leaders - from Hungary's Victor Orb\u00c3\u00a1n to Geert Wilders in the Netherlands - present as self-declared champions of Jewish minorities in a supposed clash of civilisations against Islam.</p><p>All of these factors - and a few more besides, just to add to the confusion - have collided to turn our conversation on antisemitism in to one characterised by accusations and rebuttals, contortions and misunderstandings, bad faith interpretations and endless blind spots.</p><p>It's the sort of dissonant mess from which any reasonable person might decide to quietly step away.</p><p>Because what is the uninvolved onlooker supposed to make of it all?</p><p>While researching my new book on the subject, several people I spoke to told me they were afraid to even ask about antisemitism, for fear that this might itself be construed as antisemitism.</p><p>This is another sign, if any other were needed, that something has gone badly wrong in the way we talk about the issue.</p><p>Untangling these confusions, I found it was possible to identify distinct themes, so that the moving parts of this chaos came in to focus.</p><p>For starters, there is the way that racism is commonly understood as a colour line.</p><p>While the invention of \"black\" and \"white\" is key to understanding the racism that enabled slavery and colonialism and that still inflicts daily harms today, this doesn't help us to fully comprehend the roots of antisemitism.</p><p>Studying the histories of racism and antisemitism shows us that one has always influenced the other.</p><p>The persecution of Jews in the Middle Ages helped create the architecture of racism that underpinned colonisation and enslavement in the Americas, and reveals how the category of \"whiteness\" is a fundamentally unstable invention. This is why Jewish people have, in the past, fallen in and out of it, confusing and intensely irritating racists through the ages.</p><p>Then, there is the grim hypocrisy of our political conversation on antisemitism, which remains hyperfocused on the left.</p><p>While media cycles spin out over whether the chanting of long-used Palestinian slogans constitutes antisemitism, examples of anti-Palestinian hatred from supporters of Israel get waved along.</p><p>This is not just about the silencing of voices protesting against Israel's carnage in Gaza, although that is bad enough.</p><p>If antisemitism is so blatantly wielded as a political weapon, it creates the impression of a fundamental unseriousness about the subject.</p><p>Dedicating endless column inches to campus protests over Gaza is shifting the spotlight, not just away from the devastation in the Palestinian strip, but away from the dangerous antisemitism coming from the far right.</p><p>In her latest book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Doppelganger</emphasis>, Naomi Klein writes about the important political issues that have been discarded by the left, only to then be opportunistically seized and twisted by the right.</p><p>So, during the pandemic, for instance, people's reasonable fears about pharma monopolies were commandeered to spew out vaccine conspiracies.</p><p>The same dynamic now applies to the fight against antisemitism, where the right has strategically filled a space vacated over decades by the left.</p><p>But far from raising awareness of this ancient prejudice, the right has, instead, turned the issue in to a wedge with which to clobber political opponents: Those protesting against Israel's multiple aggressions and violations of international law, the Black Lives Matter movement, diversity and equity programmes, or those grouped together under that catch-all irritant 'wokeism'.</p><p>The effect has been to sow division, derailing progressive movements, thwarting efforts at social, economic and climate justice, and helping an increasingly extreme right wing to win elections around the world.</p><p>A true understanding of what has gone so wrong with our discussion of antisemitism - and how to put it right - will not just fortify the left in this urgent political moment.</p><p>It will also consolidate our anti-racist endeavours.</p><p>It will yield inclusiveness, moral clarity, and cohesion.</p><p>And, most of all, it will help us to make sense of the alarming, divisive, and destructive rightwards shift of the world.</p><p>Only then do we stand a chance of changing it.</p><p>* Rachel Shabi is the author of 'Off-White: The Truth About Antisemitism';</p><p>* The Guardian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu predictably labelled 'antisemitic' the arrest warrant issued against him for alleged war crimes</emphasis>.

to conserve nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Hollywood star will join former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, in headlining a conference on the climate and biodiversity crises.</p><p>They are the main speakers at the AIB sustainability conference, which is now in its eighth year and takes place on November 25.</p><p>Norton is best known for starring in iconic movies such as Fight Club and the recent Netflix film Glass Onion, but he also has a long history of environmental activism.</p><p>He is a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity and a founder of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust in Kenya.</p><p>The trust works with communities in southern Kenya to protect endangered wildlife and threatened forest ecosystems.</p><p>Farmers in the region are helped to develop nature-sensitive enterprises and are compensated for any livestock taken by wild animals so that they do not lose out by supporting conservation programmes.</p><p>Norton has spoken recently of applying those principles to the industrial economies of the global north so that nature and natural resources are better protected.</p><p>His other philanthropic works include the Solar Neighbours Programme that provides solar power technology to low-income households.</p><p>He also works with the Enterprise Foundation, which works on sustainable, affordable housing projects and he established the Middle East Peacemakers Fund to support study abroad for college students interested in fostering peace in the region.</p><p>Ms Robinson, chair of The Elders, is a long-time human rights and climate justice campaigner.</p><p>She speaks regularly to international audiences on the subject and an annual Mary Robinson Climate Conference takes place in her home town of Ballina, Co Mayo.</p><p>AIB chief executive, Colin Hunt, said the reality of climate change had become undeniable and addressing it was \"everybody's business\".</p><p>\"By being united in our resolve to combat climate change we can empower people to build a sustainable future,\" he said.</p><p>\"Through their actions Edward Norton and Mary Robinson have led the way on sustainability, and they, along with

Many countries want to do this to maintain its political momentum.</p><p>Hopes of a breakthrough at the deadlocked Cop29 in Baku were dashed after a new draft of a possible deal with no specific figure was condemned by both rich and poor countries.</p><p>Faith in the ability of the Azerbaijan presidency to produce a deal ebbed yesterday morning, as the draft texts were criticised as inadequate and providing no  landing ground  for compromise. Climate Cops often hinge on late compromises, but many negotiators said bridges to close gaps were not apparent as talks look set to run over into the weekend.</p><p>Instead of setting a global goal for at least $1 trillion in new funds for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis, the text contained only an  X  where numbers should have been.</p><p>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres returned to Baku and warned failure could jeopardise national climate action plans with  potentially devastating impacts as universal tipping points are getting closer .</p><p>He said countries needed to find a  clear  agreement on climate finance.  Amidst geopolitical divisions and uncertainties, the world needs countries to come together ... I appeal directly to ministers and negotiators: soften hard lines. Navigate a path through your differences and keep your eyes on the bigger picture. </p><p>UK secretary for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, who has been helping the host country in trying to put better shape on the text, highlighted the risk of a backward step on mitigation   actions to cut emissions   based on the draft text released yesterday morning.</p><p> I m afraid the text doesn t yet meet the moment and the demands of this Cop. On mitigation, we see ... increasing disasters all around us. So in this context, standing still is retreat and the world will rightly judge us very harshly if this is the outcome,  he said.</p><p>He said some countries believed Cop29 needed to focus on climate finance,  but that cannot possibly be the case when we see the evidence of the climate crisis in all of our countries .</p><p>His view was strongly backed by Ireland s Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, who said at a briefing that if lack of mitigation ambition prevailed then Cop29  will be to no avail . It would not protect all people of the world, especially developing countries, he said.</p><p>Ambition meant stopping the status quo, including vested interests wishing to retain the current fossil fuel system, he said   a position endorsed by a high ambition coalition of countries from North and South America, the EU, Asia, Africa and  small islands and big .</p><p>On transitioning away from fossil fuels, Mr Ryan said there was no clear mechanism to advance what was agreed last year.  There has been a backsliding; an attempt to interpret what was agreed as a menu of options. That has to stop.</p><p> The world needs hope and confidence and trust that we can stop climate change. What is present is not balanced. It doesn t reflect this imperative; the real demand for action. </p><p>Asked if he was angry with the stance of Arab countries, he said he didn t wish to point fingers but Arab countries were threatened by climate change too, notably extreme heat. It was in their interests to move to a clean energy system that would bring climate justice where  you will never fight over renewable power .</p><p> The Arab group will not accept any text that targets any specific sectors, including fossil fuels,  said Albara Tawfiq from the Saudi delegation at a plenary gathering reviewing progress.</p><p>China also said it opposed an explicit mention of the fossil fuel pledge, contained in the Cop29 deal.  There should be no singling out of a single paragraph,  China s delegate told the gathered nations.</p><p>Bolivia s delegate, Diego Pacheco, also spoke against it.  Developed countries continue trying to impose on developing countries a prescriptive and intrusive approach  to cutting emissions, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21458503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DG9-PFV1-JC8Y-83G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 22, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DRNR</classCode><className>CARBON NEUTRAL ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp;

Whilst there has been progress, with the critical climate change crisis placed firmly on the global agenda, we are still on course for 2.4 degrees warming. And there is deep disappointment that powerful states did not flex all their muscle power to go that extra step to steer current and future generations to safety.</p><p>For example, Tr\u00f3caire was particularly disappointed at the omission of loss and damage financing from the final COP26 agreement. This was a missed opportunity by powerful nations, who have contributed most to climate change, to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities to recover and rebuild after climate disasters.</p><p>However, it is vital that we don't lose heart. And now that the focus will move to other issues, it is critical that momentum created by COP26 is not lost. It is up to all of us to build on the achievements secured, to bridge the gaps, and to pressure decision-makers at home and abroad to continue to act with the urgency that is required. It is easy to label COP26 a cop-out. But a lot can and must be achieved before nations reconvene in Egypt for COP27.</p><p>Ireland can play its part. We must not forget the millions in the global south who are most impacted by the climate crisis, and whose young people are now mobilising to demand change. They have done the least to cause this crisis. This is a matter of climate justice.</p><p>CAOIMHE DE BARRA, CEO, Tr\u00f3caire, Maynooth, Co.

A likeness of our former president woven into a Persian rug which sat for years in the window of a shop on Dublin s Dame Street. When the shop was repurposed in the mid-late 2000s the portrait vanished from the public eye. It s an icon of modern Irish popular culture, but where is it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was reminded of the Mary Robinson tapestry recently when Galway actress Nicola Coughlan addressed the Time 100 Next gala in New York city.  I don t want to brag but the Irish have beat you to it by some way,  Coughlan told those assembled and said she hoped they were on track to elect their first woman US president. </p><p>She did go on to brag a little, explaining that Mary Robinson was elected as Ireland s president in 1990. Coughlan said she s admired Robinson since she was  a little girl  and she echoed Robinson s call for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p>Mary Robinson is now 80 years old and is the chairwoman of The Elders, a group of independent global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela and which counts Richard Branson and Peter Gabriel among its current members. </p><p>She s an iconic Irish figure and even in her ninth decade she continues to work tirelessly for peace and climate justice. I often wonder what impact having a woman president had on my generation of little girls. I now worry how missing out on their first female president will affect all of America s children.</p><h>Cult status </h><p/><h>Certainly, the tapestry image of her has since gained cult status. A friend used to have the image on her phone case. You can buy tea-towels, badges and other nostalgic trinkets inspired by the iconic image of Mary in her pink shoulder padded blazer and black polo neck, her curly 90s hairdo forever immortalised in thread.</h><p>The rug shop was called Pars Gallery and it sat adjacent to the large Philips electrical store that overlooked the corner of Dame Street and George s Street. Both stores were contained within the Montague Burton building, which was erected around 1930 to house a Burton s Tailors store. </p><p>That corner remains an iconic location. Where the Mary Robinson tapestry once stood is now a large Spar, known colloquially as  Gay Spar  because of its proximity to legendary gay bar The George. The  Gay Spar  moniker has been adopted by the owners of the shop itself.</p><h>Shop window </h><p/><h>A Totally Dublin article from 2005 is one of the only solid sources online about the Mary Robinson tapestry. Pars Oriental Carpet Gallery opened in 1990, the same year of Robinson s election to \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, and the gallery owner commissioned an Iranian woman to weave the piece as a gift to the new president. It took almost three months to complete. </h><p>However, president Robinson was not allowed to accept gifts while in office so the rug was put on display in a gilt frame in the shop window instead. Repeated offers to buy it led to the almost equally iconic  Not for Sale  sign attached to the piece which remained on permanent display until Pars Gallery closed.</p><p>There is a Pars Gallery in the UK which has been contacted about the Mary Robinson tapestry several times   me among those inquiring   but says it is unconnected and has no knowledge of its whereabouts. </p><p>The 2024 Mrs Robinson documentary film is a deeply charming portrait of the life and times of our Mary, but no mention or shot of the tapestry made the cut. A source connected to the documentary told me that when the rug was mentioned to the former president, she had only a passing awareness of its existence which implies that the piece is not in the personal Robinson archives.</p><p>On a tip that the tapestry may once have been displayed in the Little Museum of Dublin I followed the scent of ageing carpet fibres but once again hit a dead end. Trevor White, founder of the museum, confirmed that they ve never had it in their collection but would be eager to show it if it ever pops up.</p><p>Maybe the most fitting place for the tapestry, if it is ever located and offered for public display, is in Gay Spar. </p><p>Mary Robinson has a long history of fighting for LGBTQ+ rights. It was she who signed the Bill decriminalising homosexuality in 1993 after leading David Norris s legal fight at the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>In 2022 when the store put a  Happy Pride, from Gay Spar  in its window, a tweet noted  The Mary Robinson rug would be so proud .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21416737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCB-3YH1-DYS1-03KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 8, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000777</classCode><className>LGBTQ+ PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DTQC</classCode><className>POPULAR CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DM6W</classCode><className>CEASEFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N442210MM</classCode><className>FLOOR COVERING STORES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC333</classCode><className>ISRAEL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC373</classCode><className>LEBANON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The plan sets out a roadmap for the State to halve emissions by 2030 and to reach net-zero no later than 2050.</p><p>However, Community Law and Mediation CLG and its co-plaintiffs alleged the plan was too weak to comply with the carbon budget programme and international obligations. They pointed to recent calculations from the Environmental Protection Agency projecting that the State would   substantially  exceed its greenhouse gas emissions targets.</p><p>They alleged the Minister for the Environment and the Government prepared and approved the climate action plan in breach of the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.</p><p>The Government should not have approved the plan as submitted by the Minister and instead should have requested an amendment or modified it to ensure it complied with the 2015 Act and the carbon budget programme, the plaintiffs said.</p><p>They claimed the Government could not rely on unquantifiable or unspecified future measures to meet its statutory obligations and to ensure the climate action programme conformed with the carbon budget programme.

The needs of people in their 20s and 30s are frequently hindered by obstacles such as the housing crisis, high cost of living, reproduction concerns, health issues, career stress and climate justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For those in this age bracket, there is evidence to suggest this cohort of adults may be the first generation to be worse off than their parents. The everyday struggles they now face have a significant impact on their mental health.</p><p> All evidence suggests that those in their 20s and 30s are in a critical stage in life for improving and maintaining mental health,  says Kevin O Driscoll, from the National Youth Health Programme, which is a partnership between the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p> This period is marked with a myriad of significant life transitions, including education, entering the workforce, establishing and maintaining relationships and leaving the family home. Mental health is affected by a wide variety of issues and circumstances meaning it can not be addressed with one  quick fix . It requires a multifaceted and multidepartmental approach from government and society. </p><p>Cliona (26) believes young adult mental health has been affected more than ever before.  Young people have so much access to news and what s happening around them that it s impossible to be insulated against it. </p><p>News has become more readily available with constant alerts, fake news included, and social media platforms consistently alerting users with targeted headlines. The draw of social media platforms complicates an already difficult digital relationship as this generation was quickly consumed by the internet age and digital revolution.</p><p> We re constantly being primed by these  political, economic, and societal events that are happening outside our world, primarily through the news media,  says Cliona. </p><p> Having more access to information, in general, is impossible to escape, and that can really have an effect on young people who are already stressed about school, about finding out who they are, about friends. There s so many things and facets of being a young person. It can be difficult, but I think more so than ever. All these external factors are really contributing to our mental health journey. </p><p>Cliona feels the situation is worsening with a lack of safe spaces to openly talk about concerns affecting a person s mental state.  It s why organisations like Jigsaw are so imperative,  she says.</p><p> They give young people a safe space where they can speak about how they feel, learn coping mechanisms, and start to think about their mental health as something they need to look after, but also that it s normal. </p><h>Openly discussed </h><p/><h>With the stigma around mental health still existing in Ireland, Cliona feels that for her parents  and grandparents  generations, mental health was never something that was openly discussed. </h><p> The cultural approach to mental health ... is obviously something that can worsen your mental health,  says Cliona who plays a part in opening the discussion as an advocate for the youth mental health organisation Jigsaw, facilitating talks in schools and with young adults.  I think what is so important about mental health is allowing young people to feel like they have those safe people they can talk to. </p><p> Any approach to improving the mental health of those in their 20s and 30s will need to include a variety of promotion, prevention and intervention initiatives,  says O Driscoll.</p><p>These initiatives, he explains, advocate for accessible and equitable mental health services   including expanding access to therapeutic services, increasing funding for mental health services, making them more affordable through the health system, and expanding the provision of services online.</p><p>Private therapy can be cost-prohibitive for individuals.</p><p> As has been well reported and publicised, the mental health services in Ireland are severely stretched and under pressure,  says O Driscoll.  Long waiting lists and delayed intervention have led to a large number of community-based and youth-work organisations taking up the baton and being proactive around mental health.</p><p> These organisations run a wide variety of programmes and initiatives designed to promote positive mental health and wellbeing and to prevent the development of mental health issues and illness. These are delivered to support individuals, families and communities to develop the resilience and coping skills to deal with the ups and downs life throws at us. </p><p>O Driscoll explores this by emphasising the importance of workplace mental health programmes, educational campaigns, community-based support, addressing socio-economic factors, supporting digital wellbeing, recognising cultural sensitivity and inclusiveness, crisis intervention, and policy advocacy. Making initiatives such as mental health days and employee assistance programmes the norm in a workforce provides flexibility for those dealing with mental health issues.</p><p> Stigma and embarrassment still play a significant role in reluctance to seek help,  says O Driscoll.  Third-level institutes, and particularly student unions, are well placed to deliver campaigns with adequate resources. </p><p>Additionally, O Driscoll sees the opportunity to support community organisations, community centres, family resource centres, and youth work organisations through funding and resources as they all play  a vital role in promoting and improving the mental health  of our communities.</p><p> One of the major stressors and issues for this age cohort in 2024 is affordable housing,  says O Driscoll.  This feels unattainable for many, so it should be a priority policy area. And, increasingly, this age group struggles with managing debt due to issues such as high student loans, high rents and other financial obligations. Financial stability is proven to reduce stress and anxiety. Putting in place supports and policies to make this a reality for more people will impact mental health positively. </p><h>Struggling </h><p/><h>Cliona wonders if she hadn t been involved with an organisation involved in youth mental health from a young age, would she have struggled more and if she was struggling where would she have turned?  Knowing that there was always someone there, not even someone, but an organisation I knew I could turn to, seek support if I needed it, always made me feel like I had an option. </h><p> For those struggling with their mental health and in need of a therapeutic intervention, community and youth work organisations offer a low-cost intervention in many cases,  advises O Driscoll.</p><p> In 2024, the National Youth Health Programme launched the Mental Health Sign-Posting Tool. This online information tool was designed to capture and distil all the valuable work being done in the sector and make it easily accessible for those seeking help.</p><p> The signposting tool has the details of all the services, initiatives and programmes developed and delivered in response to a myriad of mental health issues in one place.</p><p> It is an aid to an individual seeking support, family members looking to help loved ones and professionals seeking additional services at both a local and national level. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21388859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFN-SXF1-DYS1-001G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 19, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Public Health &amp;

These platitudes, presented as wisdom, are as much about shaping the future as they are about rewriting the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This narrative isn't new. I heard it four years ago, during the formation of the outgoing government. Back then, I wrote an open letter, which was signed by three other Green Party candidates, urging party members to reject the programme for government. The argument was simple: The proposed plan offered a greener status quo, not the transformative action Ireland so desperately needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead of delivering a true Green New Deal - where housing, healthcare, workers' rights, and economic security pave the way to a zero-carbon future - it proposed policies that risked deepening inequality and falling short of climate goals. Housing policies catered to developers, carbon taxes disproportionately burdened rural and low-income communities, and agriculture policies continued to favour industry over family farms. For pointing this out, we were dismissed as naive, un-pragmatic, and even childish.</p><p>But the mythology of pragmatism - that the \"worst day in government is better than the best day outside it\" - is a powerful confidence trick. It perpetuates the status quo, ensuring transformative change remains out of reach. And yet, standing at that crossroads in 2020, even those of us who opposed the deal could see why that mythology has such a profound impact.</p><p>Amid the global pandemic, the Green Party entered government for compelling reasons. Climate breakdown demanded urgent action, and the chance to shape policy after decades of inaction was too critical to ignore. Yet, the past four years raise profound questions about whether this was the right call - not just for the party, but for the climate movement and the Irish people.</p><p>There were successes. The Climate Law was a landmark achievement and Greens in ministerial positions advanced important legislation. However, the promise of transformative action was stymied by the status quo. Attempting to retrofit climate solutions onto a neoliberal economic framework left them inaccessible to many. Grants for warmer homes, renewable energy, and electric vehicles encouraged uptake but were largely accessible only to those with the financial means. Instead of fostering equity, these initiatives widened disparities and failed to harness the developmental potential of climate action. The broader climate movement, which had propelled the Greens into power, faltered and lost momentum.</p><p>Beyond climate action, the social dialogue remained weak and the social contract was further eroded. Homelessness soared, housing costs spiralled, and our healthcare system, battered by the pandemic, emerged as one of the worst-performing in the northern hemisphere. While there is no counterfactual, it's hard not to imagine better options were possible.</p><p>In spring 2020, as the government was formed, the European Central Bank had suspended fiscal rules to encourage borrowing in the face of the pandemic, creating a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Ireland could have launched a green industrial revolution - creating jobs, retaining young talent, and accelerating decarbonisation. Instead, cautious fiscal policies prevailed and we failed to meet the moment.</p><p>At times, the Greens seemed compelled to justify their place in government by overstating incremental progress while systemic issues deepened. One recent example was the reframing of emissions reductions from offshoring electricity generation as domestic progress in greenhouse gas reductions. Even after this was exposed, the party stuck to the 7% reduction figure - a well-intentioned attempt to highlight achievements but one that let messaging trump the complexities of reality.</p><p>Messaging was never going to be enough. Enduring climate action requires material benefits that people can see and feel, distributed equitably across society. Without this, climate action risks losing public trust, leaving the very foundations of progress vulnerable to collapse.</p><p>The shortcomings of the past four years are not the fault of one party but reflect a deeper immaturity in Ireland's political system. At its heart, this immaturity undermines representation, engagement, and democratic progress. To build a robust, inclusive democracy, two changes to how we vote and a critical reform to how we legislate are urgently needed.</p><p>First, it's indefensible that Irish citizens abroad remain disenfranchised in 2024. Emigration, often driven by economic necessity, should not strip people of their voice in shaping the nation's future. Second, declining voter turnout further weakens the social contract. Compulsory voting, as practised in Australia, combined with accessible options like mail-in ballots and extended polling days, would ensure greater representation and stronger mandates.</p><p>Beyond voting, Ireland's rigid party whip system constrains legislative progress. It forces TDs to toe the party line and reduces opposition to a symbolic role rather than a legitimate space for constructive contribution. This rigidity stifles innovation, blocks collaboration, and perpetuates the idea that meaningful politics only happens in government.</p><p>To mature as a democracy, we must relax the whip system, enabling opposition parties and individual TDs to shape legislation collaboratively. A system that encourages cross-party initiatives and independent ideas would elevate governance and make opposition a platform for progress, not just dissent.</p><p>I RELAND urgently needs a new vision for politics, rooted in a renewed social contract. One that ensures a safe, sustainable future for generations to come while guaranteeing dignity and rights for those living today. Despite the limitations of Ireland's legislative process, opposition offers the most fertile ground for crafting and advancing such a transformative vision.</p><p>True transformation starts with bold ideas that challenge entrenched systems. Opposition provides the space to develop, refine, and champion these ideas, turning them into platforms for building alliances, mobilising social movements, and connecting with voters disillusioned by the status quo. In this moment, a united and constructive opposition, underpinned by robust grassroots organising, has the potential to reshape Ireland's political landscape far more effectively than diluted compromises forged in government.</p><p>The shifting global economic landscape only heightens this opportunity. As the foreign direct investment model faces mounting challenges and deglobalisation reshapes economies, Ireland stands at a crossroads. We can embrace a bold alternative: Green industrialisation built on State-owned wind energy, fair redistribution, community wealth-building, and democratic local economies. This vision cannot emerge from a government tied to neoliberal orthodoxy; it must come from outside.</p><p>I'm convinced that Green Party voters in 2020 did not vote for the configuration of the last government. They didn't vote for a climate action agenda that would falter due to public push-back, nor did they vote for the housing crisis to deepen or for young people to continue emigrating en masse.</p><p>They voted for something else: A politics that confronts the enormous challenges of our time - climate breakdown, inequality, and the housing crisis - head-on. This is the aspiration of many who seek alternatives to Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael. While current seat arithmetic may allow Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael to govern alone, the temptation for smaller parties to join may persist.</p><p>If those entrusted with the vote for change want to honour it, they must focus on building a new social contract. To do this, we need to break free from the myth of pragmatism. If smaller parties feel tempted to 'pull on the green jersey', they should reflect on the lost opportunity to build a real alternative - a model of governance that is bold, fair, and forward-thinking.</p><p>True pragmatism is about shaping solutions that tackle the root causes of our crises. Real climate action, a just transition, and a renewed social contract will not come from the status quo; they will come from those willing to break with it.</p><p>In doing so we might find a new politics in Ireland - one that values collaboration, embraces complexity, and dares to dream bigger. Ireland is at a crossroads, and the decisions made now will shape its future for generations. For those at the crossroads, the question is clear: Will you preserve the system as it is, or will you build the future we desperately need?</p><p>* Se\u00e1n McCabe is head of Climate Justice and Sustainability.

Billed as the finance Cop, discussions on the New Collective Quantified Goal - a financial target to support developing countries in their climate actions after 2025 - are at the heart of what needs to be agreed before this crucial climate summit concludes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coming days are make or break for all our futures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The current lack of climate finance is pushing the planet to the brink. Rather than a climate finance goal of $100bn, as previously agreed, this figure has to be in the trillions now in order to help Global South countries already drowning in debt from climate impacts. This commitment of trillions will also help leapfrog the fossil-fuel era by funding the scale-up to renewable energy.</p><p>The Global South is already paying the cost of floods, droughts, cyclones, and destruction caused by climate change. Women are disproportionately impacted. Women and children, for example, are 14 times more likely than men to die during climate-related disasters such as floods or cyclones due to social and cultural barriers.</p><p>In order to transition to greener pathways, they need finance from rich countries.</p><p>This is not a matter of charity; it's a matter of justice and righting a fundamental wrong. Rich countries are most responsible for causing climate change but are providing far too little support to countries impacted and harmed the most in the Global South.</p><p>The estimated fair cost for developed countries is to pay $5 trillion ( 4.74tn) per year in grant-based finance.</p><p>At Cop29, however, the push is to get agreement on $1tn per year, way below what is required. The pressure must be kept this week on rich countries to step up and deliver the finance that is urgently needed to give humanity a real chance of averting runaway climate breakdown.</p><p>Up to this point, it has been largely civil servants in Azerbaijan working desperately hard to negotiate how this goal can be achieved. Nothing is resolved in week one, but the gulf in views is laid bare. The result is a sprawling and scrambled negotiations text that covers the good and the bad of climate finance, the scale of the money, the quality, whether through loans and investments or public finance, with questions of who should be on the hook - developed countries or some developing countries too.</p><p>It is now in the hands of the political leaders who converge this week. There will be vastly opposing world views, pressure to cave, and immense efforts to persuade, all against the backdrop of a tense global political climate.</p><p>The backdrop to these talks is the failure to stop war and a plausible genocide in Gaza, and a global rise of the far right with a deadly anti-climate action agenda.</p><p>All of this is happening as we find ourselves in a general election campaign here in Ireland, with housing and the cost of living dominating the political agenda.</p><p>The idea that Ireland plays its part and forks out billions to the Global South in climate finance will seem impossible with so many homeless and families suffering with high prices of food and essential goods. But we think in the short term at our peril. It is always the poorest who suffer the most, whether in Ireland, in Bangladesh, or in Ethiopia. We must put a better future front and centre in our present.</p><p>Every penny spent now to avoid climate disasters later will be the best money we can spend, for Ireland and the world. This is needed along with reducing our emissions in Ireland and ensuring we do our fair share here. It is not an overstatement in any way to say that the future of our planet depends on just climate action.</p><p>It is of huge concern that governments from the Global North are emphasising the role of private finance when it comes to climate finance and the new goal. This is being framed that 'climate injustice' is essentially an issue of access to private finance on fairer terms. Rather, the injustice is the failure of rich polluting countries to repay the climate debt of the historic responsibilities we owe to the countries on the frontline of the climate crisis.</p><p>Yes, the private sector has a huge role to play. The shift to renewables will crucially involve private sector innovation in green renewable energy. However, it is a false economy to think that the private sector can be the driver of climate finance. The countries that are most vulnerable to the climate breakdown are also facing a debt crisis. ActionAid research found that where data is available, 93\u00b0/u of the countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis are in, or at significant risk of debt distress.</p><p>The need to service external debt in foreign currency has become a major accelerator of the climate crisis. There is a vicious cycle between the debt and climate crises, each reinforcing the other. Having more than two thirds of climate finance in the form of loans serves to exacerbate this debt crisis.</p><p>The real value of these loans is often overstated and yet, alarmingly, many of the proposals presently being considered for expanding climate finance seem to be focused on even more loans, rather than exploring fairer and more sustainable alternatives.</p><p>The central issue of publicly-funded climate finance, not loans, and ending the ever-expanding use of fossil fuels and large-scale agriculture, are among the most important issues the globe needs to focus on.</p><p>The experiences of communities in the Niger Delta provide a snapshot of what people in the Global South are facing - and a stark reminder of the human cost of fossil fuels.</p><p>My colleague Friday Ogezi, Action-Aid international climate justice adviser for Liberia and Nigeria, who is at Cop29, said this week that every day more than 2.5bn cubic feet of natural gas is flared in the Niger Delta, releasing pollutants that have poisoned water sources, destroyed farmland, and sickened people.</p><p>\"The once vibrant community is now a shadow of its former self,\" he said.</p><p>\"The oil companies have stolen our future. We demand a just transition backed by adequate finance in the form of grants. The time for empty promises is over. It's time for action.\"</p><p>A just transition is in all our interests. Crucial decisions and action are needed to halt the runaway climate-change train and ensure a safe, just, and more equal world for future generations.</p><p>Ireland must also play its part, and in this election voters should demand this better future of Irish politicians. The Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, of which ActionAid Ireland is a member, is hosting a hustings this Wednesday in which representatives of all parties are invited to participate and outline their priorities. Tackling the climate crisis must be at the top of the new government's agenda. Our future is in their hands.</p><p>A fossil-free world, built on justice, is the only future.</p><p>* Karol Balfe is CEO of ActionAid Ireland, which is part of a global federation with a presence in more than 71 countries, working for a world free from poverty and injustice. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.actionaid.ie\">www.actionaid.ie</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Giant portraits of world leaders are submerged by indigenous people in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, ahead of the G20 Summit, to protest at a lack of leadership on climate and biodiversity</emphasis>.

Unwieldy and interminably slow in reaching a decision by consensus, critics dismiss Cops as ineffective talking shops; a  circus of parties . Yet against the odds, they frequently drive change.</p><h>Is the Paris Agreement  fit for purpose? </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><h>In the room will be signatories to the Paris Agreement   almost 200 countries   a monument to collective action. It is a guiding map, reinforced by climate science, showing the way to a more benign physical world, less polluted and healthier   nature balanced with humanity.</h><p>But it is flawed.</p><p>Countries have committed to hold warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial times and to work to limit this to 1.5 degrees. But the agreement allows each country to determine what contribution it makes to these efforts. This inevitably led to a wide gap between collective goals and national commitments. The bottom line is that the collective response is wholly inadequate given what is facing Earth.</p><h>Where are we on temperature and emissions goals? </h><p/><h>It s best summarised in three words: over the limit. This year is set to become the first on record when average temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, breaching that Paris threshold   though this has to happen over years to be declared lost.</h><p>Emissions are at unprecedented levels, especially from burning fossil fuels. Global temperatures are at their highest in human history. Like a household budget, climate science sets a carbon budget on greenhouse gases that can be  spent  (emitted) for a given level of global warming. If we exceed this budget, global temperatures will become higher. We continue to exceed that budget to an alarming extent.</p><h>Is anything helping us to  get to a better place? </h><p/><h>Many countries have pledged to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions, the main antagonists of warming. Added to that, a clean energy revolution is gathering pace. The single biggest way to pivot the world is to replace fossil fuels with renewables as the prime energy source. It is the quickest route to a decarbonised world.</h><p>Analysis would suggest this is unstoppable, despite US president-elect Donald Trump s return to the White House.</p><h>Why should Ireland  slash emissions? </h><p/><h>Ireland generates a mere 0.1 per cent of global emissions, so on the surface it s not our problem. But for many reasons that s not a sustainable position. As climate scientist Peter Thorne has highlighted:  Ireland has among the highest per capita greenhouse emissions in Europe.  We put a small proportion of total emissions into the atmosphere, but if every person in the globe had the historical emissions profile of Ireland, global mean temperature today would be north of 3 degrees. In short, the world would be cooked and humanity would be lucky to survive..</h><p>We need to get a handle on this, Thorne added.  If we can t solve these challenges, challenges on the island of Ireland, then where on Earth can? We have a highly educated population. We have, fundamentally, the capital resources. We have the nimbleness, if it is our priority to act faster. </p><p>What s more, climate disruption is already on our doorstep. Intense rainfall and associated flooding may be a permanent threat to Irish food production.</p><p>Ireland has continued to dodge a bullet and is overdue a storm surge several metres high; not quite of the scale that hit Spain s Valencia region but enough to cause widespread damage. Infrastructure across the island cannot cope with the impacts of climate extremes already happening. </p><h>  So the climate response is  an ethical/fairness issue?</h><p/><h> Yes, and a lot more. The world cannot decarbonise with ensuring climate justice, but ultimately achieving net-zero emissions brings huge economic opportunity   notwithstanding upfront costs and rocky terrain ahead.</h><p>That transition needs to empower people, not heap blame on them. Climate guilt should rest primarily with Big Oil and carbon polluting industries.</p><h>So what are key agenda  items at Cop29?</h><p/><h> By some distance it is about money and resetting a climate finance goal. A target of $100 billion a year from developed countries for vulnerable countries is in place.</h><p>Remarkably, there is broad agreement this should scale to trillions but gaping differences over who should pay, how much and sources of finance.</p><p>The EU is pushing for much more diversified funding sources, including private finance. What constitutes a rich country is also contested. </p><p>A 1992 list doesn t include China and many wealthy petrostates despite their economic might after decades of growth. Setting out a credible path towards that target will be key to building trust. Ireland s Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has been asked to play a lead role on adaptation measures to build climate resilience in developing countries.</p><p>Again, this will require money on the table but also, as he sees it, a better way of addressing climate and development.</p><p>A good outcome at Cop29 could provide momentum on overall negotiations and progress parts of the Paris Agreement to ensure meaningful carbon trading and transparency on credits. </p><h>With Trump likely to pull  out , does that make  Cop29 largely irrelevant? World leaders from almost 100 countries are gathered in Baku and Trump will be the main conversation topic. </h><p>The US   the country responsible for most emissions historically and currently the world s second largest emitter   is walking away from its responsibilities. </p><p>It risks heightening fear about inevitable emission impacts in coming years as Trump ratchets up oil and gas production. This may translate into paralysis that scuppers Cop29.</p><p>In the past alliances of more ambitious countries formed during Cops and helped forge strong outcomes against the odds, often with unlikely partners. But big economic blocs, the EU and China, will have to provide leadership and drive the process on this occasion in spite of what has been described as the  Trump whiplash  looming over the talks.  </p><h>Surely a small country like Ireland has minimal impact? </h><p/><h>This is far from the case.</h><p>Ireland has an excellent record in international diplomacy and especially development, in how it supports poorer countries and its presence on the ground. Ireland s negotiating team in recent Cops has played an important role, especially in securing a landmark loss and damage fund.  Ireland s position can be a bridging position between the Global North and the Global South,  Ryan told a pre-Cop29 briefing. </p><h>What s the best that  can be hoped for? Some will adopt a nihilistic view and declare the 1.5 degree target dead in the water. The evidence suggests, however, the world is a different place since Trump was first elected in 2016 and a green economic race, rather than politics, is driving decarbonisation.</h><p>Leaders of this transition need to reunite parties under the Paris Agreement, while increasing ambition and accelerating actions, for Cop29 to be declared a success.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21426246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD0-1H01-JC8Y-83JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Nobody dissented.</p><p>The big argument was always about how to ensure such enormous sums of money will be provided.</p><p>Who will pay, who will receive, who will be responsible, how much should come from governments, the private sector, the World Bank, and other multilateral development banks.</p><p>Should China (which is included on a 1992 list of developing countries) get a free pass, or instead be compelled to contribute?</p><p>The mega-rich Arab oil states too - they are listed as developing nations on the 1992 list and refuse to let anybody knock them off that list.</p><p>What about new global taxes that could be ringfenced and channelled into climate finance? That means the possibility of new levies on airline flights, or shipping, or better still, on oil or other fossil fuels.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest row was over how much of the $1tn would come from public finance sources.</p><p>Of course, public finance was the preferred funding route for most poorer countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NGOs campaign for global south</emphasis></p><p>Funds that come from governments like our own, tend to be doled out as grants rather than loans. They don't saddle a developing nation with enormous debts that eventually drag them down.</p><p>Many non-government organisations campaigning for the so-called Global South, the cover-all description adopted for developing nations of the world, argued that the entire $1tn per year by 2030 must come from the public finances of western governments.</p><p>Anything else they said would be a sellout and not acceptable.</p><p>Climate champion, and a member of the Elders, Mary Robinson, told them when she arrived last week that they would have to lower their expectations.</p><p>If they could get a commitment for $300m per year of climate finance from government sources by 2030, they would be doing well, she said.</p><p>The rest would have to come from other sources, including the private sector.</p><p>That didn\u2019t quell the demands from civil society organisations however, or the accusations and recriminations against rich nations.</p><p>Laurie van der Burg, at Oil Change International, said a commitment of just \u20ac300m of climate finance from government sources would be embarrassing.</p><p>She said it would allow rich countries to dodge the climate debt they owe to the Global South by relying on the private sector to provide the remaining funds.</p><p>This would then create a debt trap for countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis.</p><p>\"Rich countries must seriously step up and pay the trillions they owe to the global south. They can raise over $5tn every year for climate action if they end fossil fuel handouts, tax the super-rich, and change unfair global financial rules\" she said.</p><p>Ms Robinson fingered Saudi Arabia and its Arab group as being the number one blocker to progress an overall agreement.</p><p>Russia too, another very major oil producer, was causing blockages behind the scenes for what she described as geopolitical reasons.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil states blocking agreement are being protected-German Foreign Minister</emphasis></p><p>Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, became very heated about that same issue and let loose on the final day of the talks.</p><p>She said openly that the oil states blocking the agreement were being protected and supported by the COP29 Presidency, Azerbaijan, which itself is yet another major oil producer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2024/1123/1482526-cop29-climate/\">COP29 clinches $300bn for poor nations in climate deal</url></emphasis></p><p>\"We are in the midst of a geopolitical power play by a few fossil fuel states.</p><p>\"Their playing board is the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries.</p><p>\"We as a European Union will not accept a deal that comes at the expense of those who suffer most from the effects of climate crisis.\"</p><p>She described what was taking place at the most fraught stage of the negotiations as the last stand by the old fossil fuel world and said the EU will not allow the most vulnerable, especially the small island states, to be ripped off by the few rich fossil fuel emitters.</p><p>She said: \"Climate finance and CO2 reduction are closely linked. We, as the EU, therefore increased our financing commitments until 2035.</p><p>\"We are continuing to work on building bridges. We are living up to our responsibilities, including as historical CO2 emitters.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No deal is better than a bad deal stress activists</emphasis></p><p>It was a message that would have been well received by the civil society groups repeatedly demonstrating outside the massive COP29 plenary halls right up to the very end.</p><p>They danced under banners, urging on the negotiators representing the global south.</p><p>No deal is better than a bad deal was their central message.</p><p>The anger of these civil society groups over the failure of the global north to pay for the climate damage their carbon emissions have inflicted on poorer nations was clear.</p><p>They keep on destroying our lands, said Haneen Shaheen an Arab World Member of Climate Action Network.</p><p>\"We need to be clear about obligations - the obligations for the ecological debt, for environmental collapse, for the surpassing of the planetary boundaries,\" she said.</p><p>\"They are playing with the lives of people, our existence, our present and our future.\"</p><p>Another demonstrator, this time representing the youth of Africa, spoke about feeling frustrated, and angry, and disappointed.</p><p>\"We gather year after year in COP summits listening to all their promises and pronouncements. But the reality is betrayal. A betrayal of the planet. Betrayal of vulnerable people. Betrayal of the younger generation. And all the while politicians pat themselves on the back.</p><p>\"We pour over these texts, these draft decisions for COP. And what do we find? A disheartening echo of unfulfilled promises and pledges from a system rigged against those who need it.</p><p>\"The needs are astronomical. We need trillions and not billions. Where is this money, and where is the justice?\"</p><p>Activist Tetet Lauron was even more impassioned.</p><p>She described the climate negotiations as a farce that has been going on for the last 30 years.</p><p>She said: \"Our people have been dying. Our people have been displaced. The climate crisis is upon us and we did not cause it.</p><p>\"People are being silenced, killed, harassed for defending the rights of the environment.</p><p>\"This is how rich countries of the global north, together with their corporations, are putting in dirty tactics, dirty tricks all over these negotiations just to confuse everybody, but also to continue peddling that lie that fossil fuels are clean, that corporations can be part of the solutions, that multilateral development banks are providing climate finance</p><p>\"No, they are not.</p><p>\"We are drowning in debts, and they're wasting our time while people are dying under floods. They ruin our world, ruin our future, and they want to ruin everything for every coming generation.</p><p>\"If they think that we're going to accept the private sector controlling our future, shaping our adaptation plans, and telling us what to do, if they think that the banks are going to be allowed to control our economy, we are telling them no.\"</p><p>This was all very strong stuff at the end of a truly exhausting fortnight at the climate talks in Baku.</p><p>And it seems clear from the anger articulated by the civil society groups that the fight for climate justice is going to go on and on.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/\">Read latest climate stories</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

These events reveal the need for an urgent response based on the principles of equity, justice, co-operation and sustainability, with a human rights-based approach,  they said in their petition.</p><p> There is a close relationship between the climate emergency and the violation of human rights,  they added. It is this link between climate change and human rights that the IACHR will seek to define, while also examining how climate change affects migration and looking at the disproportionate effect on children, women and Indigenous people. Chile and Colombia also asked the court for clarification on a state s duties to protect environmental activists. Latin America is the most dangerous place in the world for environmental and land defenders, according to advocacy group Global Witness. About90 per cent of the 177 killings of environmental activists recorded in 2022 took place in the region.  The hearing aims to ask for clarity about human rights obligations and the climate crisis,  said Jacob Kopas, senior attorney at the Earthjustice environmental group, one of a group of lawyers who spoke at the Barbados hearing on April 26th.  It will help to create a more concise framework to guide state behaviour and policy to confront the climate crisis and protect human rights,  said Kopas. Among those submitting testimonies will be the residents of the El Bosque fishing community in Tabasco, Mexico, where rising sea levels caused by climate change have swept away about 200 metres of coastline. Since 2019, the school and more than 50 homes have been destroyed, forcing about 200 people to leave.</p><p>El Bosque community leader, Guadalupe Cobos, said she and 10 neighbours will probably have to leave within a year and resettle in an area about 12km away, where new homes are being built by the government.  We depend on the sea but coastal erosion has affected our way of life. It s important for the court to know that we re living climate change now and that this isn t something that will happen in the future in 20 or 50 years  time,  said Cobos.</p><p>The court s advisory opinion could have important implications for climate litigation across Latin America and the Caribbean and make it easier for communities living with the effects of global warming to take legal action.</p><p>The opinion will apply to all signatories of the American Convention on Human Rights, most of whom are members of the Organization of American States.

Excluded populations   including women, Catholics, ethnic minorities and individuals without property   have gained political rights. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is an ongoing campaign to lower the voting age to 16. Many activists on climate justice believe we should go one step further, arguing that representation for future generations should be baked into our democratic institutions. But why end there?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A more radical proposal is to give the natural world, starting with non-human animals, a  voice  in our democracy. It may seem fanciful, but Trinity College Dublin philosopher Dr Pablo Maga\u00f1a Fern\u00e1ndez is determined to give the idea a fair hearing   and to persuade us in the process to become less anthropocentric.</p><p>Four proposals have been put forward by political theorists: First, reserving several seats in parliament for specific  representatives of animals , such as members of an animal rights party. Second, changing the electoral system to allow such a group a greater say in parliament. Third, creating an ombudsman for animals   an independent office tasked with protecting and representing their interests. And fourth, staging deliberative initiatives, allowing citizens to reflect on issues that affect animals   the 2022 Citizens  Assembly on Biodiversity Loss could be seen as a model upon which to build.</p><p> Conceptually speaking, I think, all these proposals make sense. The crucial question is practical: namely which of these proposals is likely to achieve the best combination of feasibility, success, durability, democratic legitimacy and immunity from abuse and manipulation,  says Maga\u00f1a Fern\u00e1ndez, an Irish Research Council research fellow who is participating in a public lecture series on Democracy at a Crossroads this month.</p><p>He explains further as this week s Unthinkable guest:</p><h>Why go beyond existing political institutions to protect animal welfare?  We can improve animals  wellbeing through the law   for example, by passing stricter animal welfare legislation or granting them legal personhood, perhaps even some fundamental rights. But only up to a point. If policymakers can, with little cost, disregard animals  interests   who cannot, after all, vote them out of office   political decisions are likely to be biased in anthropocentric ways. When a political system is biased in these ways, the laws it creates will   to some extent   inherit such biases, thus constraining what judges or animal- focused legal advocacy groups can achieve through the law. The extra step of representing animals in policymaking seeks precisely to affect policymakers  incentives   to make it, in short, costlier to disregard animals  interests. </h><h>Which animals should be represented?  My view is that this is, and should be, best left as an open question. I like to think about this by way of the following analogy: we can pass animal welfare laws even if we disagree about whether such protections should be extended, say, to invertebrates. Then, as we acquire higher-quality scientific evidence about which animals are conscious, whether they can suffer etc, we can suggest amendments, and subject them to public debate.</h><p> I suggest we do the same with representation: we may disagree about the moral status of ants, spiders or lobsters, but we largely agree about  higher mammals , for instance. So we can start there, and leave the conversation open. Moreover, representing animals can only succeed if it s practicable. If we don t know enough about ants  minds, or citizens do not care about them, it is highly unlikely that, here and now, any such proposal could be even slightly successful. </p><h>Should XL Bully dogs  have a  voice ?  That s a good   and hard   question. Similarly, one might wonder what to do with predators and prey   should they get  two voices ? As I see it, the main problem, right now, is that policymakers can quite easily ignore animal interests, even when these are deeply affected by the decisions they make . . . In this sense, I do believe XL Bully dogs should receive  a fair hearing  in politics, so to speak. Of course, that doesn t tell us how to resolve the substantive issue. </h><p> But, not even in the case of humans, does representation settle substantive questions. Public deliberation, discussion and negotiation are indispensable. We simply don t know of any other way to make publicly acceptable collective decisions. And, again, any proposal that ignores this, no matter how well it sounds on paper, will be impracticable. </p><h>Are there any examples of these ideas being trialled internationally?  Since 2020, Spain has a directorate-general of animal rights which, although limited in its power, has been instrumental in championing the new animal welfare law passed in 202</h><p>3. In 2022, the United Kingdom created an animal sentience committee tasked with investigating the impact of policymaking on animal welfare, which is empowered to complain to   and request answers from   the secretary of state. And institutions for future generations have been tested, with different degrees of success, in Finland, New Zealand, Israel, Hungary and Wales. Because they have received larger empirical scrutiny, and since the challenges are similar   the unborn cannot vote either, we can also turn to them for advice and improvement. </p><p>Dr Pablo Maga\u00f1a Fern\u00e1ndez will participate in a public lecture on Democracy at a Crossroads at TCD on October 10th</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21334801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D4G-WHW1-JC8Y-82JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 7, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000302</classCode><className>CIVIL RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

He is correct that Ireland has qualified and experienced merchant mariners. So the key question is why are these mariners not enticed to the Irish Navy at present? Why do Irish mariners work contracts at sea, away from Ireland for extended periods? There can only be one answer: the remuneration received in the merchant navy would appear to be more enticing. This is the financial remuneration and the remuneration for hours worked. The implementation of the working time directive for the Naval Service and the wider Defence Forces would be a positive from a retention perspective and could potentially entice Irish mariners that Capt McGowan states are readily available. However, one must be cognisant of the fact that the offshore renewable energy market will increase dramatically over the next decade and this will become a draw for experienced Irish mariners and a further draw on naval personnel.  Capt McGowan is correct about the workforce but it would appear that the remuneration model offered by the Naval Service  does not currently match what is available in the merchant navy. A lesson there for for our Minister for Defence Miche\u00e1l Martin, the secretary general of the Department of Defence, and of course the flag officer commanding the Naval Service. </p><p>I would have to disagree with Capt McGowan in respect of his opinion on weapons on Irish warships. The Naval Service has not been afraid to use their weapon systems against gun-running fishing vessels. Main armaments on Naval Service ships have also been used to sink derelict vessels. Such main weapons also act as a deterrent when the Naval Service has conducted maritime interdiction boardings in Irish waters or on missions overseas in the Mediterranean. Capt McGowan makes extremely valid points about the utility of the Spanish navy vessel that visited Ireland earlier this year. The tug Carnota is classed by the Spanish navy as a salvage tug and, as such, brings great utility to support a whole host of maritime safety tasks. This Spanish navy vessel is part of a balanced fleet that the Spanish navy use to carry out a whole range of maritime safety and security tasks. </p><p>Capt McGowan is indeed correct that the Naval Service needs a balanced fleet to conduct a range of naval tasks. The service is what is referred to as a constabulary role navy, tasked with a whole series of maritime security roles, such as providing protection for our gas pipelines, energy interconnectors and subsea fibreoptic cables, vital to keep our economy running. </p><p>Capt McGowan believes that if we don t change our operating methods, we may end up with no naval ships at sea. His is correct, but it is the operating method of the government department and the military command that needs to change, to get our eight vessels back to sea to protect Ireland s economy. The Naval Service personnel must be rewarded for being at sea to a similar extent as their merchant colleagues. The Naval Service must be able to recruit large numbers to grow the force and, considering it is losing highly skilled technicians, such as ordnance artificers,   there must be some retention package implemented as a matter of urgency.   Yours, etc,</p><p>CONOR HOGARTY, </p><p>Blackrock, </p><p>Co Dublin. </p><p>Rethinking </p><p>Irish Rail </p><p>Sir,  A reader s account of the shambles that is Irish Rail is no surprise (Letters, December 14th). Yes, underinvestment over many years (training staff, maintaining signalling, rolling stock, stations, bridges, railway crossings) but the essential issue here, like so much of the country s institutions and infrastructure, is that it is down to what we re bad at   understanding and recognising who the customer is and what they want. If you understand the idea of service and its delivery, you ll do your damndest to see the customer is okay. Yes, you need capital to provide a seamless and super service but if you don t have lots of money you can at least still provide for stations to be open, officials to be in post answering the public s queries day in and day out. Before you plough money in, you can still provide a service. It s bloody difficult, let s be honest. But officials, poorly paid, often demoralised  and usually in no mind to readily to assist a passenger waiting for their train or enquiring about times, departures, etc, still need to get to grips with what their jobs entail; too many punters, all with different questions on a wintry platform. Far easier to go and hide away or just absent yourself then no one can hassle you!</p><p>The next thing to say is that there s little merit in unions defending the status quo; they may not be able to provide the cash but they can at least make sure their people turn up on time and do the best they can.</p><p>On the investment front, railways, like our already disregarded infrastructure, flood defences, planning, transport, just needs to be addressed. How long do we wish to recognise there s a problem yet do nothing? While politicians are interested in burnishing their own careers and knowing they will be off and away shortly, they just don t care and will not, and probably cannot, plan for the future adequately. But it just has to start somewhere. Why doesn t the incoming government sit down after Christmas, look at the state of this half-built nation and simply say, the public has suffered enough. We will now identify every one of those key infrastructure issues that remain incomplete and allocate the extraordinary monies from capital receipts in our coffers to sort it out. Plan it, finance it, and before delivering it get everyone in a service industry in the public sector properly trained and made aware of the fact their role, their only role, is to help that customer first time and on time. If you can t do it on your own, get help from the private sector; they ll come running if they know this long-standing issue is now being seriously and rigorously addressed.</p><p>We ve been waiting long enough.   Yours, etc,</p><p>ALASTAIR CONAN, </p><p>Coulsdon,</p><p>London. </p><p>Hoping for peace in Syria</p><p>Sir,   In 2009, my self and my late husband decided to visit Syria. We chose it as we wanted to visit a historic place, not too touristy and safe.</p><p>We noticed there a quiet air of menace, and apart from our small group, there were few tourists in the country.</p><p>To witness the splendour of amphitheatres, superbly preserved by time and sand, was truly memorable. </p><p>To wander among the ruins of the great city Palmyra, one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world, was breath-taking. To walk almost a kilometre beneath the Great Colonnade was to be transported back in time to Rome s great majestic past.</p><p>To be dwarfed by the colossal medieval fortress Krak des Chevaliers was humbling and awe inspiring.</p><p>Sadly many of the great Roman edifices, such as the Temple of Ba al, Nebu, etc, have been destroyed by Isis in 2015. I often wonder what became of the young student who approached me in the Souk in Damascus and pulled from his coat pocket a copy of Jane Austen s Pride and Prejudice and asked what I thought of his accent and English grammar. Or our guide, a retired professor of archeology  who fed a white camel in the desert with sweets. Or the trader, who galloped off on his white steed over the hill to procure the pale blue table cloth I requested.</p><p>I hope now that with the fall of the Assad regime and the dawn of a new era for Syria, life for the Syrians will be much better and tourists can visit this great country, the cradle of our civilisation.   Yours, etc,</p><p>BEATRICE AIRD O HANLON,</p><p>Delgany,</p><p>Co Wicklow.</p><p>Anti-Semitism, Israel and Gaza </p><p>Sir,   John Rawls, esteemed political philosopher, in a 1995 paper, wrote:  In the conduct of war, a democratic society must carefully distinguish three groups: the state s leaders and officials, its soldiers, and its civilian population.  </p><p>Thinking of Israel, if Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu engages in sustained wrongdoing (which I believe he does) against the civilians of Gaza, it does not follow that the civilian population of Israel are also doing so. Equally, if one criticises the Israeli state for the unwarranted killing a lot of innocent people, such a charge is not laid against the civilian population of Israel.</p><p>The charge of being anti-Semitic when speaking out against sustained wrongdoing by a state really rings hollow when that speaking out is not levelled at the civilian population of Israel. It doesn t make sense and is a coercive piece of sophistry which, sadly, twists truth.   Yours, etc,</p><p>Dr JAMES FINNEGAN,</p><p>Letterkenny,</p><p>Co Donegal.</p><p>Nursing homes and care sector </p><p>Sir,   I refer to article  Care services for most vulnerable not good enough, says Simon Harris  (News, December 21st). Nursing Homes Ireland is pleased to see the express commitment of Taoiseach Simon Harris to recognising the urgent need to improve care services for older people, carers, and vulnerable members of our society. The acknowledgment of these challenges and prioritisation of this issue in the programme for government is both timely and essential.</p><p>I note statement of the Taoiseach:  Whether it is care for an older person, whether it is care for a vulnerable child, or whether it is care for a person with a disability, in terms of disability services our systems are not where they need to be. There will be a resourcing and funding issues the next government will have to address, we re up for that. </p><p>The sustainability of nursing home care remains under severe strain, with over 70 nursing homes having closed since 2018. Decisive action is required to safeguard the future of care for Ireland s older population. Immediate measures, including reform of the Fair Deal pricing mechanism, are critical to ensuring nursing home care remains accessible, sustainable, and capable of delivering the dignity and respect our older population deserves.</p><p>The demographic challenges facing Ireland are well-documented. The over-65 population has grown by 35 per cent over the past decade and is expected to double in the next 20 years, with the most significant proportional increase among those aged 85 and older. These trends underscore the need for a coordinated response to provide appropriate care for our ageing population.</p><p>Nursing Homes Ireland remains committed to working collaboratively with the Government to address immediate challenges, including funding shortfalls, workforce pressures, and access to primary care services for nursing home residents. Alongside these urgent priorities, we are committed to developing long-term policy to ensure that nursing home care remains a vital part of the continuum of care. </p><p>This approach, aligned with the principles of Sl\u00e1intecare, will enable the provision of the right care, in the right place, for communities across the country.</p><p>We remain committed to working collaboratively with government as we celebrate our ageing population with an ambitious fully resourced plan. We look forward to seeing these commitments explicit in the forthcoming programme for government.   Yours, etc,</p><p>TADHG DALY,</p><p>Chief Executive Officer,</p><p>Nursing Homes Ireland,</p><p>Dublin 24.</p><p>Remembering Tom Hyland </p><p>Sir,   Tom Hyland ( Death announced of East Timor peace campaigner Tom Hyland (72) , News, December 26th) was not only the founder and guiding light of the East TimorIreland Solidarity Campaign, but also the crucial founder of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The IPSC was founded in the autumn of 2001 by a small group of activists, academics and journalists, of which I was one. But Mr Hyland was unquestionably the central driving force behind the whole initiative, and without his experience, energy and courage it would not have taken place. In great measure, the enormous groundswell of sympathy for Palestine we see in Ireland today was partly facilitated by Tom Hyland s prodigious original work.</p><p>Tom s death is a great loss to Palestine activism as well as to Timor activism. Indeed, in recent times, Tom was active in setting up a Palestine solidarity movement in East Timor. What Tom would have made of the current horrors perpetrated by Israel and connived at by the leading states of the  rules-based international order , one can only imagine.   Yours, etc, </p><p>CONOR McCARTHY,</p><p>Monkstown,</p><p>Co Dublin. </p><p>Martyn Turner s calendar </p><p>Sir,   I ve just finished  cheating  and absorbing all of the cartoons and messages in Martyn Turner s calendar for every month of 2025. It left a broad wry smile on my face. Martyn Turner is one of our national treasures!   Yours, etc,</p><p>ROBERT P GOGAN,</p><p>Kilbeggan,</p><p>Co Westmeath.</p><p>Delivering </p><p>the goods</p><p>Sir,   Once again, thank you to all your delivery crews who never failed throughout the year.  Every morning my copy of the newspaper was waiting for me   hail, rain or snow!   Yours, etc,</p><p>LAURA O MARA,</p><p>Stillorgan,</p><p>Co Dublin.</p><p>International</p><p>aid obligations </p><p>Sir,   The parties and groupings that shape the next government bear a significant responsibility, with the programme for government charting Ireland s course for the next five years. While domestic priorities are pressing and urgent, it is crucial that we also fulfil our international obligations.</p><p>Ireland has earned a proud reputation as a champion of human rights and peace, and it must continue to speak out for the people of Palestine and prioritise the urgent passage of the Occupied Territories Bill. Crucially, despite the pressure it now faces, it must not dilute the impact of this proposed legislation. </p><p>Equally pressing is the climate crisis, which demands radical and ambitious action. The next government must place climate justice at the core of its agenda, recognising the disproportionate burden climate change places on the world s poorest and most vulnerable communities. With 2024 on track to be the hottest year on record, and global temperatures surpassing the critical threshold of 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the need for decisive action has never been more urgent.</p><p>Ireland must remain steadfast in promoting women s rights and combating violence against women. Addressing this at home and abroad require sustained focus. </p><p>Over the last year, the international community has spectacularly failed to stop what some believe to be a genocide in Gaza, to take the necessary climate action and to compensate the Global South for rich countries  excesses. </p><p>Ireland can chart a different course. </p><p>As part of a shared humanity, our actions   or inaction   have profound effects beyond our borders.</p><p>The proof will be in the pudding. The programme for government must realise Ireland s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) on overseas development assistance by 2030 and publish a clear spending pathway to achieve this. It must provide transformational climate finance that meets our fair share. And it must fight to protect women s rights.   Yours, etc,</p><p>KAROL BALFE,</p><p>CEO, </p><p>ActionAid Ireland,</p><p>Dublin 1. </p><p>Looking around the corner </p><p>Sir,   This Christmas, we indulged in a bit of nostalgia, reminiscing about the simpler times of the 1950s and 60s. Back then, Christmas meant a candle in the window, a sprig of holly on the mantel, and perhaps a modest gift of a knitted jumper or a new book. </p><p>Midnight Mass was as essential as the pudding, and the most advanced technology involved winding the clock to ensure the turkey wasn t overdone.</p><p>After the guests had departed, and fuelled by leftover mulled wine, I turned my thoughts to the future. In 50 years, will Santa s sleigh be replaced by drones? Will Christmas dinner consist of lab-grown turkey served on biodegradable plates? Will AI-powered trees suggest carols to suit your mood? And will holographic family gatherings make up for empty chairs at the table?</p><p>Between nostalgia and predictions, one thing seems certain: whether through holly or holograms, Christmas will always be about the same timeless gifts   family, generosity, and a good laugh at how wrong our predictions turn out to be.   Yours, etc,</p><p>ENDA CULLEN, </p><p>Armagh. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21547496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DRS-NWT3-RXFF-32G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2668\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 27, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Admiralty &amp;

Ireland has played a significant role at each one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In September 2021, United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres convened the UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) on the premise that achieving sustainable food systems will be essential in delivering the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the world s development agenda to 2030, while 155 countries committed to transform their food systems, involving collaboration between governments, the private sector and civil society. President Michael D Higgins and then taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin played a prominent role in providing political leadership and policy ideas to the summit.</p><p>In December 2021, the Nutrition for Growth (N4G) summit in Tokyo succeeded previous N4G summits in London in 2013 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. These summits recognised the central importance of good nutrition in building a country s human capital and as the basis for future economic and social development. In Tokyo, Ireland committed EUR 800 million to nutrition programming over 2022-2026 which, on a per capita basis, represented the highest contribution of any country present.</p><p>At Cop28 in Dubai in December 2023, with the benefit of strong leadership from the UAE Cop presidency, 159 countries signed the Emirates Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action. This was the first time since the Cop process on climate change started in Germany in 1995 that a significant outcome linking climate and food was delivered. Minister Eamon Ryan has also played a leading role at recent Cop meetings dealing with the creation of a loss and damage fund and a climate finance package.</p><p>Each of these conferences will meet again in 2025: N4G in Paris in March, UNFSS+4 in September and Cop30 in Brazil in November. Countries will report on their progress, or lack of it, against their commitments made at earlier meetings.</p><p>Ireland has a unique opportunity during 2025 to play a leadership role across the upcoming conferences, given its performance at the recent conferences and its longer-term credibility within the UN on peace and development issues.</p><p>In doing so, it should stress the interconnection between the underlying issues these conferences will deal with: food and nutrition security; human capital and health; climate justice and action; the synergies between these issues at national and international level; and the need for longer-term implementation strategies if significant change is to be achieved.</p><p>Lessons can be drawn from two examples in recent decades when Ireland succeeded in influencing international policy and in protecting its vital national interest.</p><p>In 2008, the report of the Irish Hunger Task Force led to Ireland having a significant influence on international food and nutrition security policy in the 2008-2013 period. Post the Brexit decision in June 2016, a well-conceived and executed political and diplomatic campaign succeeded in minimising the potential damage to Ireland s political and economic interests.</p><p>Both these initiatives succeeded because there was broad political consensus, including support from Opposition parties, backed up by a wider societal consensus. The political consensus meant policy continuity: when the government changed in 2011 and 2017, the policy remained unchanged. Well co-ordinated cross-departmental implementation arrangements were another key factor.</p><p>In the case of the Hunger Task Force report the societal consensus meant all major Irish NGOs supported the report s recommendations and adjusted their own programmes to enable shared learning with Irish Aid. The All-Island Brexit Civic Forum facilitated discussion with the social partners on the evolving Brexit negotiations.</p><h>Political prioritisation</h><p> The other key factor in both cases was the investment in strategic partnerships with governments, institutions and individuals who supported the Irish case. </p><p>Should these lessons be applied to the 2025 conferences, planning should revolve around three principles: political prioritisation, policy coherence and partnerships to advocate for policy change.</p><p>An early decision by the incoming government to prioritise an integrated food/health/climate strategy at the 2025 conferences would be a powerful signal of political intent. It would enable relevant Oireachtas committees to forge a broad political consensus on the strategy, which in turn could facilitate a societal consensus.</p><p>Developing an integrated strategy will be challenging and will require cross-departmental co-ordination arrangements not currently in place.</p><p>Ireland s international advocacy is most credible when it can be supported by evidence from its domestic policy.  Practise what you preach  is a powerful maxim. </p><p>In 2018, taoiseach Leo Varadkar truthfully acknowledged to the European Parliament Ireland was  a laggard  in its climate policy. In 2024, this is no longer the case. Ireland s 2023 Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets for reduction in emissions and improvement in water quality and biodiversity.</p><p>Food Vision 2030 has as its central objective a commitment that Ireland will be an international leader in sustainable food systems by 2030.</p><p>So Ireland has in place climate and food policies which are fully supported by the government, are internationally credible and about which annual implementation reports are published. Although both policies face implementation challenges, there is a solid basis for framing a credible advocacy policy at each of the 2025 conferences.</p><p>Cop30 should present an opportunity to advocate for policies aligned with long-term Irish interests. The Brazilian presidency will prioritise further development of the Emirates Declaration.</p><p>In addition, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has established the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, which aims to harness political drive, enable resource mobilisation and align national and international support to policies aimed at combating hunger and property. </p><h>Strategic partnerships</h><p> This should go hand in hand with commitments to long-term policies enabling food to be produced with a lower environmental footprint and more diverse cropping patterns which are resilient to future climate change. Ireland has agreed to join this alliance.</p><p>Forging strategic partnerships was key to the success of the Hunger Task Force initiative and the Brexit strategy. For Ireland to maximise its influence on policy change at the 2025 conferences, a similar approach will be needed. Fortunately, we can build on existing strong relationships with the European Union, the UN, the United States and the African Union to seek alignment of policy priorities and opportunities to advocate for policy change.</p><p>The British government is committed to positively engage in a range of multilateral initiatives, reversing the insularity and negativity of successive Conservative governments since 2016. As part of the reset in Irish/UK relations announced by Taoiseach Simon Harris and prime minister Keir Starmer, there is scope for innovative Irish/UK collaboration at the 2025 conferences, akin to the positive relations the governments shared in promoting international food and nutrition security during the 2008-2013 period.</p><p>Each of the three conferences in 2025 will require a tailored and differentiated approach, albeit with a common strategic thread which should include a strong focus on gender equality. Any partnership will need to identify shared policy ground, following which specific advocacy priorities for the particular conference should be agreed.</p><p>If Ireland delivers on a credible food/health/climate strategy for the 2025 conferences this should open longer-term possibilities for Irish political leadership and diplomacy. During 2025, attention will turn to the framework to succeed the SDGs which were delivered in 2015 under Irish and Kenyan leadership. If Ireland can demonstrate its commitment to an integrated food/health/climate strategy, both in its domestic policy and through its foreign policy, it will bring practical experience of a vital priority for whatever new framework emerges.</p><p>The three international conferences in 2025 offer a sliver of positivity in an otherwise grim geopolitical situation, including the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. This is all the more reason why Ireland should seize the opportunity, along with its chosen partners, of optimising the possibilities arising from these conferences.</p><p>Tom Arnold is chair of the Ireland Africa Rural Development Committee</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21393663</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DC4-4RJ1-DYS1-02FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1479\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 7, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0FD</classCode><className>FOOD SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

The Civil War parties, while accounting for their lowest vote share total of all time, at just over 42%, will control large swathes of the next parliament.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That reality should prompt some soul-searching from those who had spent the three weeks in the general election campaign arguing that another five years of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael rule would be a disaster for the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the fragmentation of the Irish political landscape since 2016, coupled with Miche\u00e1l Martin and Simon Harris ruling out talking to Sinn F\u00e9in, means that the path to power in the D\u00e1il is exceptionally narrow at present.</p><p>But is there a left alternative? Can it be built in five years ahead? Or is it always destined to eat itself?</p><p>In 2020, Sinn F\u00e9in's 24.5% of the vote saw it claim 37 seats and come back as the second-largest party in the D\u00e1il with the largest number of votes. But a dearth of candidates meant that many of the beneficiaries of that surge were other parties of the left, some of whom parlayed that support into seats, some of whom didn't.</p><p>Take, for example, the country's largest vote-getter in 2020, Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Dublin Bay North, Denise Mitchell. Without a running mate, she took 21,344 votes, nearly a full 10,000 above the quota. When her surplus was redistributed, Independent Left and People Before Profit picked up 2,000 votes each, Social Democrats TD Cian O'Callaghan got 1,200, and Labour's Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 Riord\u00e1in added 600. Fine Gael's Richard Bruton netted just 160.</p><p>The 'vote left, transfer left' idea was something that parties were espousing on the doors, but was more heavily backed on social media, where it trended in the days ahead of polling. In truth, there was no formal or even informal agreement among the parties.</p><p>In the end, while Sinn F\u00e9in claimed victory and the left spoke about the latent desire for change and some in the Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il benches said that Mary Lou McDonald's party could reach the 80-TD threshold for a majority, this was disingenuous.</p><p>Any coalition at that time would have asked the Green Party to work with the Healy Raes to work with People Before Profit to work with rural and regional independents. Not exactly the stability that covid-era Ireland was searching for.</p><p>In 2024, not much has changed in terms of pure numbers, but Sinn F\u00e9in is attempting to put in the work, meeting with the Social Democrats on Thursday and Labour likely next week.</p><p>The party's housing spokesman, Eoin \u00d3 Broin, is a key cog in that machine and denies that a Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael renewal is a foregone conclusion.</p><p>\"Our focus is on government formation, you can see this isn't locked in,\" he told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Irish Examiner</emphasis>. \"Our approach is that we live in the real world, but we have to be ready to provide that alternative in the short, medium, and long term.</p><p>\"We're not talking about opposition at the moment.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Real world</emphasis></h><p>However, that real world is one where if Sinn F\u00e9in was able to woo Holly Cairns and Ivana Bacik sufficiently and if Roderic O'Gorman was minded to throw in his lot alongside nine (a generous number) Independents who may be willing to back such an arrangement, they would still be 14 seats short of a D\u00e1il majority.</p><p>Yes, Sinn F\u00e9in deserves credit for its due diligence, but the chances of a truly left government are slim. The only way those parties end up in government is with one or both of the Civil War parties, who look set to rely on Independents to get over the line.</p><p>If that does transpire, what is the left to do?</p><p>Now-retired former Labour TD Brendan Howlin is a veteran of the question of whether the left is a viable alternative. In 1997, the Labour Party ran much of its general election campaign on the basis that it was a choice between left and right, buoyed in large part by the election success of the resurgent British Labour Party under Tony Blair.</p><p>However, the party would lose half of its seats and oust leader Dick Spring, having been washed away by Bertie Ahern's popular and populist Fianna F\u00e1il, and would merge with Democratic Left within two years.</p><p>Just days after the first election which he did not contest in 42 years, Mr Howlin strongly believes that a left-wing alternative is possible - if the parties can stop fighting.</p><p>\"Of course a left-wing alternative could emerge,\" said Mr Howlin. \"There's real opportunity to build a serious alternative there. The old duopoly has been shattered of Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il. But we have to present policies that are attuned to the needs of people. We have to explain what an interventionist state backed by taxation means.\"</p><p>Mr Howlin is also clear on one thing that some of the left find somewhat unpalatable - the Labour Party is part of the solution, not the problem. Following the 2011 coalition with Fine Gael, Labour has found its brand among many of the left to be toxic, but Mr Howlin says they're going nowhere.</p><p>\"The curse of the left has been seeing those closest to you as your enemy. The next D\u00e1il presents a chance to reverse this.</p><p>\"There was no outreach from Sinn F\u00e9in until late in this election campaign and even then it excluded Labour. The Labour Party is the anchor of that centre-left vote. We will be the anchor of that into the future and we need to build with a sense of confidence.</p><p>\"We've survived a century because the critical core will be there. Simple mathematics will tell you, you can't do it without us. If people are serious about building an alternative, they must acknowledge it.\"</p><p>For Mick Barry, who was a Socialist Party TD for Cork North Central until last week, the answer is in getting people on the streets. While many on the left pride themselves in their grassroots work, the country hasn't seen mass mobilisation of people on a domestic issue since water charges. Mr Barry believes that the assumed coalition can lead to the renewal of that energy.</p><p>\"A right-wing government dominated by Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael will open up opportunities for the left to mount not only a vigourous opposition in the D\u00e1il but also people-powered politics on the streets,\" said Mr Barry.</p><p>\"The country is crying out for a strong housing campaign of this character. With Trump in the White House and the clock ticking towards 2030 climate, real opportunities are there also to build a youthful climate justice movement on the streets.</p><p>\"I was elected in 2016 with more than 8,000 votes when social protest in the form of water charges was at a high point. If the left is going to capitalise on the opportunity offered by right-wing governments, the lessons are clear as what needs to be done on this front.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Co-operation</emphasis></h><p>The left in Ireland has long been seen as the punchline to the Brendan Behan quote about the priorities of any Irish organisation. The first item on the agenda, he said, was the split.</p><p>With Democratic Left having come from the Workers' Party, which had its roots in a dispute over the Sinn F\u00e9in name, and the Social Democrats founded by two former Labour members, there is plenty to point at.</p><p>At this stage, questions about a merger between the red and purple parties of Irish politics are so frequent that they are met with eyerolls from members of either and both sides reject the idea.</p><p>\"We're not them and they're not us. The ideology isn't miles apart, but the outlook is,\" said one Social Democrats source. A Labour Party source says that the pair joining forces would be \"pointless\" as it would merely dilute support.</p><p>\"We could absolutely work together in the future, but the best way of doing that is to get as many seats as possible,\" said a senior Labour figure.</p><p>Mr \u00d3 Broin agrees that co-operation on the left needn't mean coalition.</p><p>\"A lot of people are writing that for the left to grow it must coalesce, but the opposite is true,\" he said, pointing to an example in his own constituency where Labour's candidate was the popular local councillor Francis Timmons.</p><p>In 2020, Mr Timmons and the Labour Party combined for 2,600 first preferences, but as a Labour candidate this time, he pulled 2,200. The point, Mr \u00d3 Broin says, is that the assumption that combining forces improves appeal is not necessarily true.</p><p>\"PR allows you vote for the party you want.</p><p>\"There's also a lot of co-operation here in Leinster House that people don't see. The Raise the Roof housing campaign was going really well before covid. On the Climate Bill, Lynn Boylan, R\u00e9ada Cronin, and Jen Whitmore came together on amendments and the Planning Bill saw myself and Cian O'Callaghan work to amend that.</p><p>\"The challenge is seats, so we all have to focus is on how we maximise our votes into seats.\"</p><p>Interestingly, one former government TD said that the most likely version of a left-wing government in Ireland would be a change of leadership in Fianna F\u00e1il.</p><p>\"If Miche\u00e1l was gone and you had a leader like Darragh [O'Brien] who was more of that working-class Fianna F\u00e1il, you could see something close to 'left wing'. That's as close as I think it comes.\"</p><p>Dublin City University School of Law and Government professor of politics Gary Murphy agrees that the path to a left-wing government is narrow.</p><p>\"The short answer is there's unlikely to be a path in the next five years,\" said Prof Murphy. \"You've parties trying to find their own path and their own vote. And there's an attraction for about half the people in the country for a version of centrism.</p><p>\"I don't see that dropping in the short term without a calamity.\"</p><p>However, as the left faces those questions about the next five years, many who are seeking a change of approach will watch Labour and the Social Democrats closely. Both parties will meet with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael next week. At which point, the left could lose one of its potential building blocks and the existential questions would deepen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik celebrating after being elected.

But, for acclaimed Indian writer Amitav Ghosh, childhood reading in the English-speaking world   including Golding s Lord of the Flies   has something to answer for here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These treasured texts of English literature are part of a story of belligerent individualism that readers  imbibe  from an early age, the Kolkata-born author argues. In recent years, Ghosh has emerged as one of the foremost anglophone voices writing about the climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2018, he became the first English-language writer to receive the Jnanpith Award, India s highest literary honour. </p><p>The following year, Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the most important global thinkers of the preceding decade. Today, Ghosh is to deliver a lecture in Derry on one of his recent non-fiction works The Nutmeg s Curse (2021), coinciding with the launch of a new round of activity being set in motion by the Field Day Theatre Company.</p><p>The annual lecture is named after the late Seamus Deane, a driving intellectual force behind the original project. Along with Deane, actor Stephen Rea and the late playwright Brian Friel began Field Day in 1980 as an artistic and intellectual response to what seemed like intractable political crisis in the North, then gripped by the 30-year conflict now known as the Troubles.</p><p>This new round of work will examine more contemporary concerns: namely, accelerating climate breakdown and its roots in European colonialism, an intertwined history that Ghosh has long traced.</p><p>Rea told The Irish Times that some of the themes explored in his colleague and cofounder s most celebrated writing hold relevance for dispossessed communities at the front lines of the climate crisis today.  The issues we began to explore in Brian Friel s Translations   territory, belonging, language and dispossession through renaming   are still current around the world for indigenous peoples,  he says.</p><p> Amitav has made a singular contribution to our understanding of the ways in which issues such as climate justice are closely bound up with our histories of colonialism. </p><p>Ghosh also sees clear crossover between Field Day s work and his own.  Most of all, [in] questions of place,  he says.  How do we care for a place? How do we inhabit a place? And, equally, issues of humans and non-humans   how they interact with each other.</p><p> How do we tell stories about this? About human and non-human interactions. That s something I ve been very concerned with and, in that sense, there s an overlap with Field Day, I think.  The power of narrative is evidenced, Ghosh points out, in the developmental arc of man-made climate change itself. But while one dominant story, in particular, has driven the crisis, stories also offer possible ways out.</p><p> I think it s very important to tell stories,  he says.  I mean, that s partly because I m a storyteller.</p><p> But, in effect, if we look around us, if we look at the planetary crisis in the broadest possible sense, it is in a sense a crisis that has been brought about by a story: a story of endless profit, endless growth, of individualism.</p><p> And these stories are very deeply planted, especially within the anglosphere. Children begin to imbibe them from the time they re in school. They re made to read Lord of the Flies, for example, which is this whole idea ... that humans are by nature inclined to create a war against all. This isn t the case at all   it s just an anglo view of how the world is.</p><p> So I do think it s very important for us to create new kinds of narratives. And a lot of my work has been pushing in that direction. </p><p> An established set of narratives that Ghosh s work closely scrutinises are those surrounding European colonialism. Ireland is particularly germane to these concerns, he says, because it is  where the British created all their colonial methods, that s where they tried it out first .</p><p>One way he opens up these points for a contemporary audience is through a reconsideration of plant life, the cultural and economic histories tied up with plants and their figuring in language. In Ghosh s writing, organic matter is not something inanimate or mute. Plants are revealed to be historical subjects with an astonishing power to influence the events framing our lives.</p><p> I ve become really interested in the whole question of plant sentience,  he says.  There s a huge literature on it now. We do know that plants can actually experience certain kinds of emotions. They have certain sorts of responses and reactions. </p><p>In Ghosh s most recent work, Smoke and Ashes: Opium s Hidden Histories, as in The Nutmeg s Curse, plants such as the nutmeg and opium poppy   controlled, commodified and appropriated in the interests of empire   become historical subjects in their own right, shaping world events in critical ways. To illustrate his point, Ghosh underscores the historical roots of the British and Dutch imperial projects as  narco-states .</p><p> They used opium to finance themselves, especially in Asia, where their revenues rested largely on opium. But it s a very curious thing to see how opium creates these repetitive patterns throughout history. What opium did to China in the 19th century was to create an absolute political, moral and financial catastrophe for the country. And it took them decades and decades to finally recover in the 20th century. It s very striking to me today that, with the opioid crisis and the drug crisis in America, generally speaking, we see remarkably similar patterns emerging. </p><p>In 19th-century China as in the US now, Ghosh adds,  the areas that were most affected were areas with mines and the populations that were most affected were working-class people   miners, et cetera   people who did very heavy physical labour. And, so, I think when you see these patterns, you can t help but feel that this plant, the opium poppy, is actually a historical agent which is creating certain cyclical patterns in history .</p><p>More recently, the author says, instructive details concerning the development of the climate crisis could be spotted in the Covid-19 pandemic. The public health emergency not only reshaped domestic and international politics, in Ghosh s eyes, it was a  forerunner , or dry run, for the big political battles of the 21st century.</p><p>It also prompted a degree of undue optimism, he says, as one crisis gave way to other, deeper crises.  I think, on the whole, what we see is that epidemics actually don t lead to any kind of rethinking. So, for example, the 1918 influenza [Spanish flu] epidemic   immediately after that, you get this huge stock market bubble. People go back to doing whatever they were doing and they do it at triple intensity. And that s exactly what we see after Covid. </p><p>There were lessons, however, concerning western vulnerabilities to growing climate instability and a lack of preparedness. This has recently been underscored by the devastation wreaked by hurricanes in the US and flash floods in Spain. Covid-19 was, to Ghosh,  in many ways a forerunner of what s going to happen as climate change intensifies. And I think it shows us the patterns of certain outcomes .</p><p> So, for example, the standard narrative on climate change is that climate change will devastate poor countries, while allowing rich countries to come through and [find themselves] not being that badly affected. There was the same narrative around Covid.</p><p> You ll remember in 2019, there was a study done on which countries were the best-prepared for the pandemic and the results were published. Naturally, the US was on top, the UK second, and then a whole string of European countries. And, of course, African countries were right at the bottom.</p><p> But, in fact, the way that it played out was almost the opposite of what this study had found. Many African countries, like Senegal, had very good outcomes, comparatively speaking. Whereas the US and the UK had the worst outcomes   not just in terms of people dying of disease, but [also] the degree of polarisation that it created. </p><p>However, in another important sense, Ghosh believes the world is entering a new chapter   with potentially disastrous outcomes for those most vulnerable to the effects of climate breakdown.</p><p> For 400 years, Europe and the West have been dominant across the globe,  he says.  Now, suddenly, we re finding that it s no longer dominant   we find especially that Europe has become quite marginal to what s happening in global politics. </p><p>As UN climate talks concluded at the Cop29 summit in Azerbaijan, in the shadow of a second Trump presidency, Ghosh sees so-called developing nations increasingly adopting a  western, extractivist model  of economic growth. It is one of a number of consequences of 35 years of US global dominance, he says, adding that its decline may produce yet more damaging fallout.</p><p> I think it s very important to remember that half the greenhouse gases that are in the atmosphere have been put there since 1990,  he says.  That is, since the end of the cold war, since the  unipolar moment , since the establishment of American hegemony, and along with that went the Washington model   extractivism, rampant consumerism and so on.</p><p> It was that impetus that has really accelerated the climate crisis. It would have happened at some point, maybe, anyway. But since 1990, since that geopolitical moment, it has hugely accelerated.  </p><p> Ghosh even traces the big pollution events choking some of Ireland s most important freshwater bodies, at Lough Neagh and Lough Corrib, back to the growth-driven policy initiatives of this period.</p><p> Now, the curious thing, of course, is that it s in this period that the EU put in place these very market-oriented policies, especially in regards to agriculture, pushing models of industrial agriculture, which now have led to disaster.</p><p> In the Netherlands, for example, these huge lakes of nitrogen, which have built up because of industrial farming. So, all of that really goes back to that one geopolitical moment. </p><p>Diminishing US hegemony and a shift towards a multipolar world, however, will not mitigate climate breakdown, Ghosh reflects. Instead, a new contest for geopolitical supremacy will bring about a  massive intensification  of the crisis.</p><p> Basically, it s a disaster for the climate,  he says.  These wars that have broken out [in Ukraine and the Middle East], because, as we all know, the single most environmentally destructive environmental activity is war. </p><p> These wars are intensifying ... One thing these wars have made clear is where the world s priorities lie. </p><p>He adds:  Climate as an issue has now become completely marginal, even as we re seeing more and more climate disasters occurring all around us. We re living through an absolutely catastrophic conjuncture of events. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>The Seamus Deane Lecture 2024 is scheduled to take place at the Guildhall in Derry today.

Earlier this week, Dublin Castle hosted the National Economic Dialogue, a civil enough title for an event that is, to put it plainly, an annual polite fight between people in suits over what we should be spending money on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea is that people from business lobby groups, trade unions, environmental groups and other NGOs meet up with the Government and discuss what the State's spending priorities should be. The event is also the soft launch of budget season: an all-consuming, and often quite tiring, political and media cycle that obsesses over predicting how and on what the Government is going to spend money. Even at a point in time when Ireland is in the fortunate enough position to have projected budget surpluses in the region of mind-boggling billions, there are more than enough compelling and competing demands being put on the Government which would, if ceded to, exhaust those coffers quite quickly.</p><p>Ireland is a bit of a weird dichotomy. The country is flourishing, while equity is withering. By a lot of meaningful metrics, the country is doing quite well. But below headline figures, inequality is festering. There is a yawning chasm between the quality of life experienced by different groups, particularly in areas like income and housing. We're often told that, internationally, Ireland is perceived as a successful country. But the State still staggers and fails on things that a lot of us would consider to be basic essentials: accessible healthcare, disability services, affordable housing.</p><p>People are exasperated with what they see as the State failing on the fundamentals. And this malaise is likely exacerbated by a cost-of-living crisis that is biting very hard. When it comes time for the finance minister to make big budget decisions, people are going to be hungry for some kind of financial respite. Politicians, greedy for electoral capital, understand that. That's why we've already had quite a few out flying kites in premature climates, tempting middle-income earners with the promise of tax cuts.</p><p>I sometimes find the budget coverage to be a little bit grubby. The budget is often portrayed not as a deeply serious set of decisions with long-term consequences, but as a kind of individualistic jamboree which we've all come to expect to get something from. The coverage in the days that follow is usually dominated by whatever group felt that they 'got' nothing. The budget's success or failure is decided by personal calculators, as we all rush to condemn or praise the spending plan for an entire nation based solely on the net benefit it brings to our own household.</p><p>Politicians can be equally as grimy. You would be forgiven for thinking that the budget was nothing more than a grand ceremony to showcase the ostentatious generosity of government TDs, who bless us all with a kindly 'giveaway' of money from their own deep pockets. But the money is not really theirs, they're just the present custodians of it. Those who want to spend a lot of money on popular ideas, with one eye on a looming election, seem to me like thieves who are raiding state funds and using it to invest in their own selfish future.</p><p>So prudence is important. But what is also more important this year is political bravery. We often associate hard choices with dark days and rainy days, days blackened by austerity and cutting back. But there is just as much necessity for hard choices when the sun is shining.</p><p>Last week, the Government published a piece of research called Ireland's Well-being Framework. It's a great idea: instead of just focusing on economic metrics, the people in charge try to use holistic measurements to understand how the country is really doing. The annual research analyses what our healthcare is like, how people use their time, how much knowledge and skills we enjoy, what our sense of community is. Of the 11 key areas measured, Ireland performed negatively in just one: the environment, climate and biodiversity.</p><p>Saving the world seems like a just political pursuit, until you consider the flaws of electoral politics: a system that punishes decisions that are excellent in the long term if they're painful in the short term. Chief executive of Friends of the Earth Ois\u00edn Coghlan summed up the situation quite well during a question and answer session in Dublin Castle on Monday.</p><p>\"So, we have a once-in-a-lifetime budgetary surplus and we have a once-in-a-lifetime, indeed once-in-a-civilisation biodiversity and climate breakdown crisis,\" he said. \"And that challenge needs to be a key driver of public investment decisions made not just this year, but for the rest of the decade and beyond.\"</p><p>Climate justice is a long-term but life-saving investment. If the Government devotes resources to it, it is not a benefit any of us will see in the weeks and months after the budget in our social welfare payments, our grocery receipts, our creche fees, our rent, our private healthcare bills or any of the myriad other oppressive financial pressures we're all feeling. But it is a problem that is, frankly, more existential than all of those important things combined. This is an emergency that requires a response. We have a surplus. Let's fix the roof while the sun is shining.</p><p>'Ireland is perceived as a successful country.
