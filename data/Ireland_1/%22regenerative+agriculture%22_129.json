Her latest, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New Ballymaloe Bread Book</emphasis>, is published by Gill and out now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOK Ultra-Processed People</emphasis> I'm loving Chris van Tulleken's expose of the world of ultra-processed food that has such an impact on the health and well-being of so many. Required reading for all.</p><p>I also find myself rereading Alice Waters's latest book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Are What We Eat:  A Slow Food Manifesto</emphasis>. It's an impassioned plea from the chef and food activist, and founder of the Edible Schoolyard Project in California, to consider the impact of our agriculture and food choices on farmers, food producers and the environment - and to sit around the kitchen table with family and friends. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">?FILM My Sailor, My Love</emphasis> I watch virtually no TV but keep meaning to so I can make intelligent conversation regarding the latest \"big thing\".

I did love <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">My Sailor, My Love</emphasis>an Irish production filmed on Achill Island, a poignant story of a curmudgeonly old gent who lives alone and reluctantly falls for the housekeeper, to the dismay and chagrin of his daughter who employs her to look after him.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PODCAST Cherry Bombe</emphasis> I enjoy an eclectic mix of podcasts, from Weston A Price's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wise Traditions</emphasis>and David McWilliams to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Radio Cherry Bombe</emphasis>, a celebration of women chefs, cooks and food writers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The BBC Food Programme</emphasis>keeps me up to date on movers and shakers on the food scene; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">People Fixing the World</emphasis> - on finding solutions to intractable problems; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Yorker Fiction</emphasis> - always fascinating; the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Regenerative Agriculture</emphasis> podcast gives me hope for the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FESTIVAL Venice Biennale</emphasis> I can't wait to visit the Venice Biennale in 2024, as I missed the last one. And who wouldn't love this and the opportunity to eat at the Osteria Da Fiore in the alcove overlooking the canal? I'm also super excited to be asked to participate in the Gourmet Galle Festival in February next year, as I love, love, love Sri Lanka.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORKAN-https://www.independent.ie/life/ballymaloesdarinaalleniwanttoseethebarbiefilmsobadlydesperatefomo/a1080958593.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORKAN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69M6-2W71-JCRS-G21T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corkman (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40452\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 12, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UDR</classCode><className>NON FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9J</classCode><className>FOOD CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SWJ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001902</classCode><className>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RO7</classCode><className>PODCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DH0B</classCode><className>ALICE WATERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>GC381</classCode><className>SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And they don't practise typical farming: instead, they are part of a growing global movement practising regenerative agriculture - or regen ag for short.</p><p>\"Really simply, regenerative agriculture is nature-friendly farming,\" says Fallick, who says she stopped being vegan when her health suffered. \"It's thinking about the health of soil, animals, humans and how they all link together.\"</p><p>On Nunwell home farm, which sits alongside land the pair manage for the Wildlife Trust and produces meat and eggs for their direct-to-consumer business, chickens peck away alongside belted Galloway cows, nomadic pigs graze on grass as well as kale and bean \"cover crops\" sown to boost nutrients in the soil.</p><p>The idea is that by following the basic principles of regen ag - not disturbing the soil, keeping it covered, maintaining living roots, growing a diverse range of crops and the use of grazing animals - they can regenerate tired and depleted soil and produce nutritious food. The work, they argue, is urgent. Up to 40% of the world's land is now degraded by industrial and harmful farming methods, according to the UN, while a recent study suggested improving soil could keep the world within the 1.5c heating target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's thinking about the health of soil, animals, humans and how they all link together</emphasis> The pair - who make bank transfers from the quad bike, listen to regen ag podcasts while moving cattle and share ideas with likeminded farmers on WhatsApp groups - also promote their message and products in relentlessly upbeat Instagram reels. Do they see themselves as \"farm-fluencers\"?</p><p>\"We're part of a really exciting movement, and we want to spread the word,\" says Cooper.</p><p>\"And this way of farming is really sexy - I've been to plenty of other farms, and I wouldn't share them on Instagram.\"</p><p>This year more than 6,500 people turned up to Groundswell - a sort of Glastonbury for regen ag farmers - which had just 400 attenders to its first event in 2016. The first Scottish Groundswell opened a month later.</p><p>\"The trend is definitely on the up,\" says Alex Cherry, who worked in the city before returning to his family farm and starting Groundswell.</p><p>\"There's a lot of conventional farmers who are now at least trying to adopt one or two of the principles.\"</p><p>He argues that the movement's momentum is unstoppable. In the EU, reforms to the common agricultural policy (CAP) came into force in January, with the bloc's Farm to Fork strategy aiming to reduce fertiliser use by 20% and halve chemical pesticides and soil nutrient loss.</p><p>Farmers are also looking at their bottom line as the price of fuel and fertiliser rockets and more funding becomes available, says Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network and a third generation farmer in the UK. A 2018 study of 20 US farms found that while those using regenerative systems experienced a drop in yields of 29%, profitability increased by 78%.</p><p>Lines says his farm has reduced fuel use by 65% and its herbicide and fungicide bill by 70% and 60% respectively. \"We're making more money,\" he says, simply. \"Ten years ago that was not the case.\"</p><p>But this new breed of farmers will have to \"stack enterprises\" and fill out a lot more grant applications, he says. For example, a winter cover crop could garner payments from a water company, the government and a shepherd grazing their flock.</p><p>Regen ag farmers argue that food security can be achieved with better managed farms and eating habits - according to a 2021 UN report globally a third of food is never eaten. \"Farmers need to be producers of food not feed,\" says Lines.</p><p>* Guardian Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hollie Fallick and Francesca Cooper on their Nunwell home farm</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6924-9B21-JC8V-4049-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

If we are, we are failing miserably at it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming out of Covid in 2021, the Government set an ambitious target of getting 2.5 million people back in work by this year. The latest CSO figures show that by the end of 2023, 2.7 million people were employed in Ireland. While we still have significant challenges in housing and health, there is no doubt that our economic performance is raising living standards. In 2023, the median household income topped (EURO)55,000 and the rate of consistent poverty fell to 3.6pc, the lowest on record.</p><p>The health of our economy is feeding through to our public finances. The Central Bank estimates we are on track for a budgetary surplus of more than (EURO)30bn by 2026. Last week, Cabinet approved the establishment of two new funds into which we will invest this surplus, protecting us against an ageing population, economic downturns and the climate and biodiversity crises to come.</p><p>This success has come despite massive challenges affecting the entire Western world. Following the war in Ukraine, natural gas prices peaked at more than 10 times their pre-pandemic levels, and the price of oil almost doubled.</p><p>I am proud our party spearheaded the response to these challenges, supporting every household with (EURO)1,250 of energy credits, cutting public transport fares for the first time in 75 years, and halving childcare fees. These measures were accompanied by a series of tax and social welfare interventions which meant every budget by this Government has helped the poorest most. Thanks to such actions, the acute phase of that crisis has now passed. Choosing not to go Green would be economically reckless. It is cheaper to save the world than to destroy it and that is what is now at risk. Every scientist of note is raising the red alert about the dramatic change in our climate in the last year. Global sea and air temperatures, concentrations of emissions and indicators about the health of our natural systems are all going off the charts.</p><p>The one hope is that the green solutions to these threats are also unfolding with unexpected speed. A solar revolution, a switch to sustainable transport and the rise of regenerative agriculture are all now at hand. This is where all the jobs and investment are going and what we are increasingly good at as a country. Last year public transport numbers went up by 24pc, renewable power increased by about a fifth and the use of nitrogen fertilisers dropped by 27pc.</p><p>Provisional figures suggest that our emissions fell by 5pc last year, while our economy continued to grow ahead of our international competitors.</p><p>Each of the main contentions in Conor's article is either wildly inaccurate or misleading at best.</p><p>It is not true that we are opposed to the provision of new water supplies to Dublin and the eastern region; we know we will need it because of the weather extremes that climate change will bring.</p><p>It is true that our electricity prices are high compared to some other countries, but the main reason for that has been our historic dependence on imported fossil fuels, not the development of our own local renewable power, which we are delivering at speed and scale.</p><p>It is also true that under this Government there has been a significant increase in spending on active travel and public transport. For decades we neglected both. This is why we have such bad congestion in our car-dominated towns and cities.</p><p>It is simply incredible that the former head of planning in the Dublin Institute of Technology seems to be opposed to such sensible spatial and transport planning. It is even more bizarre he seems to argue we should ignore the conditions already set by An Bord Plean\u00e1la with regard to the development of Dublin Airport. Does he want us to go back to the bad old days when the corruption of our planning system cost us all so dearly?</p><p>My party is working to ensure that Ireland gains an early mover advantage in this Green transition. In the same way that we advanced our economy by going from a closed economic model to an open one under the economic plans set by TK Whitaker and Se\u00e1n Lemass in the 1960s, we now need to switch from an unsustainable to a sustainable model. If Ireland and Europe fall behind on this leap forward, we risk undermining our economic competitiveness as much as our natural systems.</p><p>We can prepare to benefit from the challenges of the future or we can cling to the ways of the past. In my view, the regressive assertions in last week's article are the real \"wrecking balls\" and the surest ways to hobble this country's economy and our people for decades.

Waterford.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project aims to feed up to 85 families and set an example as a 'viable alternative model' to the current systems of food production and consumption.</p><p>He told the Irish Mail on Sunday: 'It hasn't been used much for the last 30 to 40 years, so the opportunity to bring it back to life and give it a modern twist is just really exciting for us.'</p><p>The walled garden at Curraghmore will be brought back to its original use for food production by Mr Kelly's GIY - a Waterford-based network that supports over a million people in growing their own food.</p><p>It comes as a comprehensive economic study published by the Potsdam Institute For Climate</p><p>Impact Research last week found that - aside from improving human health and climate prospects - a return to more sustainable food systems could create up to (EURO)9.3trillion of benefits a year. Mr Kelly said he hopes to sign 85 families up to receive weekly boxes of organic produce from the 12-acre walled garden.</p><p>The 'classic smallholding' will have fruit, vegetables, poultry, pigs and beehives, cultivated following the principles of regenerative agriculture. 'It's the opposite to the way modern agriculture is set up, which is very focused on mono-cropping or specialising in dairy or veg and so on,' Mr Kelly explained. 'We're doing a bit of everything.'</p><p>The walled garden at Curraghmore - one of the largest in Ireland and the UK - once fed the estate and surrounding area, even growing tropical fruit in its now derelict greenhouse.</p><p>There were around 50 gardeners in its late-1800s heyday. The famous gardener and writer William</p><p>Robinson - considered a pioneer of rewilding - began his working life at Curraghmore before making his name in Britain as he developed what would become known as the Robinsonian naturalistic gardening style.</p><p>'They would have been using a coal-fired furnace to heat the greenhouse to allow them to grow things like pineapples, bananas, grapes and all sorts of exotic things,' Mr Kelly said.</p><p>'It would have been a showcase for the estate at the time, to show they're there, to show their wealth and power,' he added.</p><p>The new market garden will also stock the GIY caf\u00e9 in Waterford city and, 'really importantly', allow the social enterprise to run more courses in growing and consuming food sustainably.</p><p>'I think it has the potential to be a viable alternative model,' Mr Kelly said. '[The Potsdam report] talks about the radical change that's needed to address climate change, and it focuses on smallholdings as very important parts of that - where you're producing food in a way that's locking in carbon rather than increasing the problems of carbon emissions. So I think it has the potential to be a viable alternative model.' Many of the walled gardens around the country were originally used for growing food rather than for the ornamental plants and flowers common today.</p><p>If successful, the initiative at Curraghmore could inspire more stakeholders to rethink how to best utilise some crumbling walled gardens, although the 'walls aspect probably isn't the important thing', Mr Kelly said.</p><p>'There are some examples of food production in other walled gardens, mainly at hotel estates, but there are actually lots of examples of small patches of land in the community being turned into productive gardens that are producing food for communities.</p><p>'In Cloughjordan in Co. Tipperary, for example, they have a community-supported agriculture scheme on a similar amount of land that supports 70, 80 families in the community. Also, the food is much more nutritious and much healthier for you.'</p><p>Mr Kelly said his 'focus' is on the consumer having 'a really critical role' in moving away from current food production systems, which contribute both directly and indirectly to climate change, destroy biodiversity and lead to worse health outcomes.</p><p>'It's a very unpopular message, but the reality is if we don't support smaller growers and we keep focusing on buying cheap, imported foods, then that'll be all that's left for us,' he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:colm.mcguirk@dmgmedia.ie\">colm.mcguirk@dmgmedia.ie</email> ?

And agricultural land is forecast to increase by about 10% by 2030, putting pressure on ecosystems and potentially driving deforestation.</p><p>Meanwhile, climate change is expected to increase drought severity and area of impact, as well as drought duration (by up to 80% by 2050 in some regions). This will threaten food systems.</p><p>159 countries signed the Cop28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action, committing to adapting and transforming food systems and including food and land use targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) by 2025.</p><p>Actions targeting sustainable food production, food waste reduction, diet shifts, and improved land management could reduce emissions and deliver nature and health co-benefits.</p><p>Separately, several countries (including the United Arab Emirates and Britain) agreed to include an integrated approach to food and water management in their NDCs and NAPs. Agriculture is responsible for 70% of freshwater withdrawals.</p><p>A broad coalition of 200 farmers' groups, frontline communities, businesses, philanthropic organisations, and cities signed the Non-State Actors Call to Action for Transforming Food Systems for People, Nature, and Climate. This reinforces the role of governments in transforming food systems. The signatories also committed to actions such as supporting frontline food system actors and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples when making food system investments.</p><p>Leading food and agriculture organisations committed to partnering with 3.6m farmers to accelerate the transformation of over 160m hectares to regenerative landscapes, with an initial investment of more than  2 billion.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture involves practices such as cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced use of chemicals to foster more resilient agricultural systems. Research in the EU has shown that a 20% increase in the number of farmers using these techniques would lower emissions by 6% while boosting soil health and farmer incomes.</p><p>National governments, the World Bank, and the Gates Foundation committed nearly  900m at Cop28 to support smallholder farmers through research on technologies and techniques which build resilient and sustainable food systems, such as new crop varieties and land management techniques.</p><p>The Dairy Methane Alliance was launched by six large food companies, including Kraft Heinz, and Nestl\u00e9, in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund. The signatories have committed to disclose emissions from dairy production and to launch a public action plan by 2024 to reduce methane emissions in their supply chains.</p><p>The companies represent over  200bn in global sales.</p><p>The companies, which also include the Bel Group, Danone, General Mills, and Lactalis USA, will help dairy farmers reduce methane emissions and make farming more sustainable.</p><p>Methane pollution from all sources in 2023 will cause more warming in the decade ahead than all the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burned this year. That's why cutting methane emissions is the fastest way to fight climate change.</p><p>Methane can trap 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after its release into the atmosphere. Although it has an outsized impact on warming, methane only remains in the atmosphere for a relatively short number of years - compared with centuries for carbon dioxide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over 100 countries signed a declaration at Cop28 to focus on the impact of food and land-use changes on carbon emissions</emphasis>.

While the problem of rising water may seem insurmountable during the flood event, the causes are surprisingly straightforward. These are twofold; in-creased rainfall and reduced catchment storage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In terms of rainfall, global weather systems are in turmoil. In addition to increases in Irish annual rainfall over the past 30 years, individual rainfall events have changed in character. We have been seeing storms of greater rainfall intensity as well as longer duration - both of which contribute to flooding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the sheer scale of climate breakdown may appear too big to do anything about, bear in mind that it is our collective decisions and actions - namely an over-reliance on fossil energy - that caused the problem; and similarly a collective step-down from fossil energy can reverse this trend. Meanwhile we need something we can do now to help prevent flooding next year and the year after. Fortunately solutions are there in abundance; specifically increasing the water storage in our river catchments wherever flooding is a problem. Not just the river; but the land covering the entire catchment.</p><p>Over the past 70 years and more, we have steadily and relentlessly reduced the ability of the landscape to hold water. Woods have been felled, wetlands and wet fields drained, hedges cleared, floodplains developed for roads and housing. Even the organic matter content of our farms has been steadily depleted by excessive soil disturbance and nitrogen fertilisers.</p><p>The consequences for water are fourfold. Firstly, the catchment response is faster; ie a shorter interval between rain falling on the land and water reaching the watercourse. Secondly, there is a larger peak volume of water from the rainfall event. Thirdly, a greater total volume of rainfall actually reaches the watercourse rather than being stored or evaporated en route. These three impacts not only lead to flooding, but also to droughts. The fourth impact is on water quality. The faster water runs off a catchment, the more pollution it carries with it and the less filtration it receives as it goes, so the quality of our waterways falls.</p><p>But where wetlands, woodlands and hedgerows have been lost, they can be replaced. Even though it has taken us many decades to arrive at our current predicament, positive changes can take place surprisingly quickly. I have seen new catchment-scale wetland projects take effect almost from the time of construction. Even modest storm-water wetlands can be built in a day beside car parks, roads, farm yards and industrial areas to soak up flood water and release it slowly into groundwater or local streams.</p><p>Within the stream and river channels we can install leaky log dams and brash dams, such as carried out in the successful flood prevention scheme in Pickering in North Yorkshire, where regular flooding stopped after a broad suite of nature based solutions were introduced. We can build artificial beaver dams.</p><p>We could bring back beavers (the jury is still out as to whether they were native to Ireland or not, but there is absolutely no arguing with their flood management skills).</p><p>Reestablishment of woodlands takes longer, but with careful drain management, new forestry projects and urban woodlands can be designed to greatly reduce runoff from the outset. Long term, the flood control effect of woodlands is tremendous. Native trees are particularly well suited to flood prevention because they are deeper rooted, providing more storage for water, and they are better suited to continuous cover forestry than conifers, which are typically clear-felled, exposing soil to erosion and rivers to pulse flows of flood water during storms.</p><p>Within our fields, we can replace hedgerows, particularly along the contours of sloping land so that any runoff from fields, whether close to the river or not, flows to the hedge and has time to soak into the soil. A Welsh study of the Pontbren farming project found that water soaked into the ground a full 67 times more effectively on fenced wooded land than on grazed pasture. That's all potential space to hold runoff water beneath contour hedgerows, fenced from livestock so the soil stays light and porous.</p><p>The ground beneath our feet holds more potential than we tend to appreciate. By increasing the soil organic carbon content we can build humus, which holds up to 20 times its own weight in water. This is a twofold process: Firstly cut back/ out high artificial nitrogen inputs which strip soil organic carbon and denude the soil of humus.</p><p>Secondly, compost farm yard manure into a stable humus form instead of using liquid slurry as a waste management tool. What this takes is to invest in technologies at government level that actively build soil carbon rather than those that denude it. Paradoxically, as well as increasing water holding capacity, increased soil organic matter also improves drainage, making farming easier and more productive on heavy or compacted soils.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture techniques such as reduced soil disturbance, continuous cover cropping, reduced chemical inputs and managed grazing techniques have been shown to build soil carbon and improve crop health. Working with trees on the farm using agro-forestry and silvopasture can greatly increase the moisture holding capacity of the soil, as well as providing valuable habitat, shelter belts and diversified income streams such as fruit and nut crops, firewood or timber crops. Tree cover also supports pollinators, which pollinate our crops; and shelters predator species which can then keep pests in check naturally.</p><p>Building soil organic matter also contributes greatly to sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Instead of agriculture being the biggest contributor of greenhouse gasses in Ireland we can make it one of our greatest assets in addressing climate change.</p><p>So what's the next step? Flooding, like climate change, is a symptom of many ills. The remedy needs to be similarly multifaceted.</p><p>At government level, we urgently need to provide incentives for farmers to protect and introduce wetlands, woodlands and other natural land-based flood defence measures, rather than penalising farmers for having excessive \"unproductive\" areas. We need to update forestry policy to include flood control as a central consideration. Planning policy that keeps new developments off floodplain areas is an absolute minimum requirement.</p><p>In flood prone catchments, all existing paved areas should have new natural flood amelioration measures introduced wherever possible. This can be as simple and beautiful as a garden pond or town park wetland; or lowlying parkland that can flood in wet weather and return to a park or a playing field again afterwards.</p><p>On a community level, we can team up with the local farmers and land owners and introduce habitat, buffer zones, ponds and the like in catchments that are at risk, such as the Owen-acurra catchment that flows into Midleton. LAWPro, the Local Authorities Waters Programme has recently announced a new round of funding for community projects of this sort, so it's an ideal time to meet with neighbours and discuss the possibilities. Many farming groups around the country are familiar with the EIP (European Innovation Partnership) projects which have provided assistance and expertise on farm scale measures. Check with your local farm advisors about either joining or setting up such a scheme in your catchment area.</p><p>Individually in our farms we can build ponds and wetlands, plant hedgerows and woodlands, we can compost and investigate regenerative agriculture techniques. In our urban areas we can build rain gardens to hold water, garden ponds to take roof runoff, compost to build our soil organic carbon levels in our own gardens. Many tidy towns groups around the country are leading the way with introducing SUDS (Sustained Urban Drainage Systems) in their local areas to catch urban runoff and reduce both flooding and pollution.</p><p>There are so many ways to start that it can be both daunting and exciting - so the trick is to choose the one that looks easiest and jump in. Then take it from there and soon it becomes habit forming. Whether the issue is the biodiversity crisis, climate breakdown or flooding, all routes lead back to habitat restoration and land-based solutions. The solutions are there. It's time to start implementing them.</p><p>* F\u00e9idhlim Harty is an environmental consultant, writer and speaker.

Consumer groups say the practice is misleading for shoppers and does not always mean emissions are falling.</p><p>Nestle is shifting toward in-house programmes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations and supply chain, a spokesperson said. The Swiss food company also dropped plans to make plant-based meal lines Sweet Earth Foods and Garden Gourmet carbon neutral.</p><p>Carbon-offset programmes don't really reduce businesses' impact on the climate, critics say, even though the label does have appeal for well-meaning consumers.</p><p>\"If you're a consumer in the supermarket, you have no way to know how much of a carbon neutral claim is from actual emissions reductions and how much is from these dubious carbon-offsetting projects,\" said Emma Calvert, a food-policy officer at European consumer-rights organization BEUC, which wants to ban \"carbon neutral\" claims on food.</p><p>Multinationals are under pressure to help prevent the planet from heating up more than 1.5C. The net zero standard requires companies to set long-term science-based targets to cut all possible emissions before 2050. While Nestle is abandoning carbon offsets, it still aims to achieve net zero in 2050, planning to reach that through measures often known as \"insets\". That includes actions like helping farmers shift to regenerative agriculture, restoring wetlands, protecting habitats for pollinators and planting hedgerows to prevent soil erosion.</p><p>Insets however are problematic as well. It's hard to check the methodologies that companies use and there are no global verification standards, according to the NewClimate Institute. Those measures could give consumers a false impression of a company's impact on climate, the group said.</p><p>The issue is we expect companies to regulate themselves, said Alban Grosdidier, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe.</p><p>\"Reduction plans should be mandatory for companies of a certain size,\" he said.</p><p>* Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nestle says it is shifting toward in-house programmes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations and supply chain</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68M7-V841-JC8V-440R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Not only are they responsible for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, they are also the top contributors to water pollution and biodiversity collapse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On top of that, many aspects of our food systems are extremely vulnerable to disruptions from climate change and other shocks, as we saw in the first months of the pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Agroecology - an approach to farming long practised by indigenous and peasant communities around the world- could transform our food systems for the better. And agribusinesses in the Global North are actively looking to agroecology to re-brand and build new markets under the banners of carbon farming and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>But, a relentless focus on single outcomes, such as carbon, coupled with industry's instinct to define and standardise, threatens the trans-formative potential of agroecology.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Win-win food systems</emphasis></h><p>In addition to their immense ecological costs, our food systems are also tremendously unjust. As many as one in four people experience moderate or severe food insecurity. The global expansion of industrial agriculture continues to be a vehicle for the violent spread of colonialism.</p><p>Agroecology offers the promise of a win-win, where people nourish themselves while restoring ecosystems and addressing the harms and legacies of colonialism.</p><p>It is also at the centre of the food sovereignty movement, a global constellation of peasant- and indigenous- led organisations fighting for the right to healthy and culturally appropriate food, produced in a way that is ecologically sound and socially acceptable. Food sovereignty is arguably the single largest social movement in the world.</p><p>La Via Campesina, the movement's largest organisation, represents over 20m farmers in 70 countries. And the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa, which operates in 50 countries, is the largest civil society movement on the continent.</p><p>Agroecology aligns with the food sovereignty movement because it is inherently emancipatory and democratic. Where industrial food production emphasises scalability and proprietary technology, consolidating and controlling power and wealth, agroecological practices require wealth and power to be held locally.</p><p>For example, crop development through genetic modification is closed off to many by intellectual property laws, patents, and the high technological competencies and equipment involved. On-farm domestication and breeding are, by contrast, democratic technologies because they're open and entirely reliant on local knowledge and sharing.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Colonising agroecology</emphasis></h><p>Corporate plans to invest in regenerative agriculture appear to be mere appropriations of agroecological practices, hollowed out of their potential for supporting broad societal transformation. Agroecological systems are networks ofrelationships, not collections of practices. They cannot be easily rendered into a set of definitions, standards or technological principles.</p><p>For example, indigenous agroforestry, a system of forest relations called chagra, played an essential role in establishing the rich biodiversity of much of the Amazon. For the practitioners, chagra cannot be distinguished from the forest itself.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">An ethical space</emphasis></h><p>Agroecological systems are as diverse as the people practising them and the places where they are practised. Indigenous clam gardens in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska are a world away from the system of ranching known as cattle winterage in the Burren of Ireland. But they share an ethical landscape defined by a commitment to social and ecological justice.</p><p>There is no doubt that regenerative agriculture and other agroecological practices can help address climate change, including by sequestering carbon in the soil. But, at a time when innovation and diffusion of new ideas are urgently needed, fostering an ethical agroecological space where people can experiment and share is a more promising theory of change than creating mechanisms to enforce uniformity and exclusion.</p><p>Agribusiness has an opportunity to be part of a global transition to more ecologically sound and socially just food systems. That will require the sector to set aside narrow understandings of the problem and abandon the imperative to colonise the spaces of innovation long-held by indigenous peoples and other racialised people around the world.</p><p>* Philip A Loring is associate professor and Arrell Chair in Food, Policy, and Society, University of Guelph, Canada</p><p>* The article was originally published on theconversation.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65S4-JXT1-JC8V-401B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The gross carbon footprint was 207 kg CO2/t, or 232 kg CO2/t, including drying, which is low by international standards.</p><p>\"In warmer countries like Italy and Spain, the figure would be closer to 1,000kg CO2/t. When the carbon sequestered by straw incorporation was included in the calculations the figure dropped dramatically, giving an average net carbon footprint of 38kg CO2/t, with a number of the crops at or below net zero.</p><p>\"Irish growers generally have a very low carbon footprint, and the results of this study support it. The most influential factors impacting the carbon footprint of the grain pool are good crop nutrition and high yields.\"</p><p>Straw incorporation improves carbon sequestration and has become more popular with the support of the Department of Agriculture's National Straw Incorporation Measure.</p><p>Tirl\u00e1n Head of Grains John Kealy said: \"The results for Irish grain shown in the Life Cycle Analysis are a strong endorsement of the sector's sustainability credentials and highlight the important role of Irish grains within the agricultural sector and along the value chain.</p><p>\"Our winner of the Sustainability Award, Mark Sheridan from Navan, CoMeath, had three crops in the top five of the lowest carbon footprint res u l t s f r o m t h e s t u d y . H e adopted widespread use of straw incorporation, and his winter oats were carbon neutral. It was an exceptional performance amid some really high standards and a sign of the quality of our Irish grain.\"</p><p>This year's big winners, the Deering family from Morette, near Emo, in Co Laois, who won the overall award, also picked up the individual Food Grade Oats Award for harvest 2023. The champion growers were among 14 top suppliers commended at the highly competitive Tirl\u00e1n Quality Grain Awards for 2023 ceremony on Tuesday.</p><p>New research from Teagasc on the Tirl\u00e1n grain pool shows that Irish grain has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world.</p><p>The research unveiled at the awards is the first of its kind using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology specifically developed for Irish grain on a wide range of commercially-grown Irish cereals. Accounting for straw incorporation, the study showed the net carbon footprint could be close to net zero.</p><p>Addressing the awards, Martin Heydon, Minister of State with responsibility for Research and Development, Farm Safety and New Market Development, acknowledged the dedication of the growers to delivering the highest quality grain, while also farming sustainably in what was a difficult year for weather conditions.</p><p>\"They take immense pride in what they do, how they farm, how they nurture and respect the land. This dedication, passion and commitment to sustainability is what sets Irish grains apart, as evidenced by the research work unveiled here today. We continue to strive to find new markets and add value to this quality Irish produce,\" he said.</p><p>Tirl\u00e1n chairman John Murphy said it was one of the most challenging years in living memory for grains, but commended Tirl\u00e1n's 1,100 plus growers on the resilience they've shown.</p><p>\"As the largest buyer and user of premium Irish grains, Tirl\u00e1n is investing in the future of Irish grain. Tirl\u00e1n paid our growers almost  3m in additional bonuses last year, specifically for premium grains. And in spite of the exceptionally challenging weather, we doubled our gluten-free oats intake last year,\" he said. \"We've built strong capabilities in our Oat Mill in Portlaoise and in research and development with a view to maximising returns for our farm families. We continue to expand our plant-based offerings, and we're evolving our portfolio to meet growing global demand in key markets such as North America, Europe and Asia, where demand for sustainably produced, fully traceable products made from quality Irish grains continues to grow. Our new Avonmore Oat Drinks are performing very well in Ireland and the Asian market, and we recently launched a new Truly Oat beverage range into the US market.</p><p>\"As plans for harvest 2024 continue, we remain committed to facilitating sustainable growth in the grain sector, in line with Government ambitions. Our grains team are out working with our valued growers, assessing and harnessing regenerative agriculture practices on farms and continuously improving the sustainability credentials of the premium portfolio.\"</p><p>Tirl\u00e1n Quality Grain Awards Overall Winners John and Ann Deering farm with their son, Mark, and grow a range of crops on the family farm, including cassia winter barley as their main crop. Break crops used on the farm are winter oilseed rape, spring beans, winter gluten-free oats and winter food-grade oats. Winter wheat and contracted spring barley are also grown.</p><p>Commenting on his win, John Deering said: \"We were honoured to come here today to receive the Food Grade Oats award. But to win the Overall Award for 2023 is a huge boost, particularly when last year was such a tough one for growers.\"</p><p>Son, Mark Deering, added: \"We focus on doing the little things well and are very thankful to our agronomist, Tim Scott, for his help through out the year. It's lovely to be recognised for the work we do as a family to produce a range of quality crops in a sustainable way. We're thrilled to be going home with two wins. It makes the hard work very worthwhile, and we will enjoy celebrating these wins.\"</p><p>Crops on the Deering family farm are established mainly bymin-till, and organic manures are used on some of the land. Attention to detail is a hallmark of their success in growing quality grains. The winning crop had an average specific weight of 57.8kph at 17.6% moisture across 214t and, incidentally, was a crop of gluten-free oats. The Deering family's Tirl\u00e1n agronomist is Tim Scott.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Spink, Teagasc Head of Crops Environment and Land Use Programme, unveils the new research at the Tirl\u00e1n Quality Grain Awards for 2023, and the study is the first of its kind using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology specifically developed for Irish grain on a wide range of commercially-grown Irish cereals</emphasis>.

The founders of the Handmade Soap Company have bought a farm 2km from their factory in Slane village. The couple, who started making soap in their kitchen 13 years ago, have an ambition to create a profitable regenerative farm.</p><p>\"With our business, we're always trying to practise what we're preaching,\" Quigley explains. \"We just got a B Corp Cert.\" This is no small achievement. B Corp is a rigorous inspection standard which audits a company's environmental and social impact. \"We want to carry that ethos over to the food supply.\"</p><p>The huge question of how to produce food without degrading soil while making a profit and enabling the land to sequester carbon and improve water quality was behind the decision to buy the farm. It's not a hobby farm, though. \"Land isn't cheap so we have to get a return,\" Quigley says.</p><p>They looked up maps from the 18th century and found that the large perennial ryegrass field was once five smaller fields, divided by hedgerows. Replanting that hedgerow system will be one of the first steps. This year they will also put in an orchard of apples, pears, damson, plums and cherries, advised by local \"apple grower extraordinaire\" Mark Jenkinson from The Cider Mill.</p><p>The grandson of a farmer who grew up around farmers, Quigley says he isn't daunted by the prospect. He took a regenerative agriculture course at the S\u00edolta Chro\u00ed centre in Co Monaghan. He is also inspired by Richard Perkins, who runs Ridgedale Farm in Sweden, an education centre based on making a living from small farms. Gemma is doing a deep dive into vegetable growing with a year-long market garden course.</p><p>They hope to plant a native woodland on part of the farm and to create a 5-acre agroforestry area where wide-spaced trees can be combined with grazing or growing. They have applied for a herd number and plan to buy 10 Dexter cattle. \"We want Dexter because of their [smaller] size which means they can stay out all year round,\" without damaging the soil, he says.</p><p>Strip or mob grazing will mean the animals move between the small fields, a technique that can help boost biodiversity rather than just rewilding.</p><p>\"We've planted an Irish wildflower mix, a perennial mix across 2 acres,\" Quigley says. The 30 acres has been pasture land for the previous two decades, heavily fertilised with nitrogen fertiliser and low in biodiversity. That's all about to change. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.5019632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F2-Y4R1-DYS1-01CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 10, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSDM</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSGR</classCode><className>GRAZING LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

From the world's oldest whiskey tradition, and the EU's secondlargest spirit export, to the famous stout of the island, the Irish drinks industry is taking seriously their responsibilities to be sustainable, both locally and globally. \u2022 For example, spent grain, a by-product of brewing and distilling, has been provided to farmers as a high-quality animal feed.</p><p>\u2022 Heineken Ireland has achieved ZERO waste to landfill from their brewery in Cork.</p><p>\u2022 Diageo Ireland has removed plastic ring carriers and shrink wrap from multipacks of products, replacing them with 100pc recyclable and biodegradable cardboard. \u2022 Guinness is working with Irish farmers to define the most effective regenerative agriculture practices, adapted to the local context and the specific needs of Irish barley production.</p><p>\u2022 Recent developments in packaging for beer have seen producers using nontoxic glue as an adhesive for canned beer packs, instead of using plastic rings. This is in an effort to try to reduce its environmental and carbon impact, strengthen its role in the regenerative and circular economy, and deliver a positive impact on communities.</p><p>Another recent example is the Irish Whiskey Association, the representative voice within Drinks Ireland for the Irish Whiskey industry. They launched 'Irish Whiskey Sustainable Together' in 2022. This is a new roadmap for how Ireland's drinks producers continue with sustainable business practices.</p><p>Some of the measures in the roadmap include reducing water usage and supporting the circular economy.</p><p>Director of the Irish Whiskey Association, William Lavelle, says, \"The roadmap is about industry working together and sharing knowledge with a shared ambition to make Ireland the home of the world's most sustainable distilleries.

Other materials in this pair are upcycled or recycled. Ugg is aiming to use 65 per cent recycled, repurposed, regenerated (plantbased), renewable (biobased) materials by 2027.</p><p>WHY SHOULDN'T I BUY? Several of Ugg's styles, including its ever-popular Classic Mini Boot, are made from nylon and non-upcycled sheepskin that has been artificially dyed and treated.</p><p>THE EXTRA MILE Ugg's sustainable collections are impressive: Plant Power designs are made from plant-based materials, and Regenerate styles use raw materials from farms that practise regenerative agriculture ? this includes restoring soil and encouraging wildlife diversity.</p><p>TAZZ SLIPPERS, (EURO)135 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ugg.com\">www.ugg.com</url></p><p>MADE IN The brand manufactures in several countries including China, Vietnam and Cambodia. A lack of traceability means we are unable to pinpoint where this style is made.</p><p>MADE FROM The upper is 80 per cent upcycled wool and 20 per cent lyocell; the braid is rayon and recycled polyester; the sole is made of synthetic rubber (from sugar cane) and the textile binding is recycled polyester.</p><p>JOURNEY Ugg hasn't given us details ? but whether by plane, truck or boat, its products travel over 6,500km to reach Ireland.</p><p>OUR RATING</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PSZENICKI NATASHA</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-184883824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CD-RWM1-DYTY-C3V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"253\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Given its size, cutting emissions is a huge task for starters as it attempts to cut its direct emissions, and indirect emissions due its activities but occurring from sources not owned or controlled by it   a vast amount of suppliers; notably cotton farmers.</p><p>Director of Primark Cares Lynne Walker is leading implementation of the retailer s sustainability strategy started in September 2021. Much of the work is channelled through teams ranging from design to ethics.</p><p>It also attempts to reduce fashion waste, protect nature and improve the lives of those who make Primark clothes. She admits they alone cannot achieve such ambitions, and working with others across the entire fashion industry is vital.</p><p>Walker is attempting to embed the strategy across every department. Founded in Ireland in 1969 under the Penneys brand, there s about 65 people now in its Dublin head office with some form of sustainability in their role.</p><p>A key aspect is working with the global head of environmental sustainability Nick Farrar.  We manage everything from climate to circularity, to biodiversity, chemistry, water ...  he says.</p><p>With about 25 people globally, they are in effect the technical centre of excellence for environmental sustainability. That means  helping to provide guidance to Lynne s team and beyond .</p><p>The point of Primark Cares, she says, is  defining publicly what we need to do and what we need to change as a business .</p><p>Their sustainability and ethics reports issued last November shows the first year was mainly foundational; building capability and becoming solution-focused. </p><p> There is a lot of work still to do and we know that.    45 per cent of their garments now have the Primark Cares logo or label on it.</p><p>In moving to a circular system, it s  about thinking about what are our clothes made from ... how do we make a garment circular. So how do we think about design of garments from the very beginning, right through to what it s made out of, and then how do we ultimately recycle it,  she says.</p><p>Crucially, it s about moving away from single-use  virgin fibres . This is where its Sustainable Cotton Programme comes in. Some 252,000 farmers have been trained in this approach, which is due to reach 275,000 by year end as it moves beyond Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and China to Turkey.</p><p>Having spent years in fashion, she was humbled to see that programme operating in India earlier this year. Primark is  a high cotton business    40 per cent of its garments have cotton.</p><p>As materials are the foundation of products;  how we source it, how it s manufactured, how it s processed , is core, Farrar says. How they then engage with the supply base and supply chain becomes important. The bulk of Primark s carbon footprint is within that space. It aims to halve emissions by 2030 and transition to renewable energy.</p><p>The overall impact of the fashion industry is a factor, he says,  so a big focus of ours is around, better sourcing practices , recognising the old linear model needs to shift into a more circular model,  and really looking at different ways of operating as businesses and industry to really help close that loop .</p><p>Producing sustainable fibres, Walker says, means less water usage, more natural pesticides and less chemical fertilisers while moving towards regenerative agriculture. With other fibres, developing recycled polyester is key.</p><p>Its first circular product collection comprises 35 pieces designed to be worn for longer and to reduce fashion waste. Clothes are made from at least 95 per cent cotton from the sustainable programme. The other 5 per cent is trims, embellishments or buttons which, where possible, are designed to be removable or recyclable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20408623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GH-0RX1-JC8Y-83YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 26, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUVU</classCode><className>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR9O</classCode><className>FASHION &amp;

Floral dresses are out, the fashion industry says. Slouchy suits are in. I find it hard to celebrate this wash-rinse- repeat cycling of trends without picturing this season's \"must-haves\" atop smouldering landfills in developing countries in a few months' time.</p><p>This year, another horrible shadow is cast over the glamour of the catwalks. April 24th marks a decade since the fourth-largest industrial accident in history happened. The collapse of the garment factory in Bangladesh, Rana Plaza, exposed the human cost of fast fashion. Eleven hundred people died in the disaster, and 2,500 were injured.</p><p>So, I'm much more drawn to Fashion Revolution Week, which starts next weekend. Part of a global Fashion Revolution movement, of people who \"love fashion, but we don't want our clothes to exploit people or destroy our planet\". The Irish website offers the tools for you to go all in and host an event like a clothes swap or repair cafe, or just join in the social media promotion of the Fashion Revolution manifesto. But what if you're tentatively putting away winter layers and thinking about new things for summer? Can we have our fashion cake and eat it, helping to create as Fashion Revolution Ireland puts it, a \"safe, clean and transparent fashion industry\"?</p><p>If you've no idea where to start, Kit Christina Keawwantha and Mal\u00fa Color\u00edn of Fibreshed Ireland can help. They will be hosting a series of free online tutorials and events to promote the Fashion Revolution manifesto, explaining the array of problems with our current fashion system and some of the ways we can fix them. The answer lies not just in consumers buying differently, but also in manufacturers putting a regenerative agriculture model back into the heart of how we dress. This is a project with deep roots that could create a fashion model that does good for people and the planet.</p><p>In the meantime, for Fashion Revolution Week, the Fibreshed Ireland free workshop series will be a brilliant way to learn mending and upcycling skills.</p><p>\"Throughout the month of April, we are promoting a 'nothing-new' approach to clothes, wherein we support the idea that we can make, do and mend rather than buy new items with dubious environmental and socio-economic impacts,\" Kit explains.</p><p>The tutorials will include darning, patching, creative felting and natural dying. At the end, they are planning an online social media \"fashion show\" where people can showcase some clothes or an outfit which they have upcycled or mended. A community-building fashion show which does good and teaches new skills? Sounds to me like the new black. l</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.5000265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6814-JXM1-JC8Y-855X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 15, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPJU</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE FASHION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DR9O</classCode><className>FASHION &amp;

In fact, figures show that agri-food exports reached  228.6bn, with EU imports at  158.6bn in 2023, resulting in a total surplus of  70.1bn (22% and  12.8bn higher than in 2022).</p><p>However, the EU is heavily reliant on imports from third countries for its plant protein sources.</p><p>Environmental and health impacts can arise from this dependence, let alone economic, and geopolitical events and their impacts on trade have renewed focus on the need for more open strategic autonomy on protein sources in the bloc.</p><p>At a meeting in March 2022, EU leaders identified increasing the production of plant-based proteins as a means to improve the EU's food security and reduce food prices.</p><p>The European Commission is this year working on reviewing its protein policy in 2024, and it is hoped that an EU protein strategy will be published this year.</p><p>Some of the proposals being considered to close the EU's protein gap include encouraging the domestic production of protein-rich crops, and diversifying the available protein sources for food and feed - think insects and seaweed proteins, for example.</p><p>European farmers are expected, and they sure hope, to benefit from the production of plant or new proteins as an alternative source of revenue, and more price stability when it comes to selling and purchasing these proteins.</p><p>The demand for new plant-based protein sources for human consumption is growing across the world.</p><p>A  10m EU-funded project called Smart Protein has sought to develop a new generation of foods that are \"cost-effective, resource-efficient, and nutritious\".</p><p>The project is encouraging farmers to grow quinoa, lentils, fava beans, and chickpeas to feed into the rapidly growing markets for plant-based foods.</p><p>The ideal soil for quinoa in particular is loamy, well-drained, and well-endowed with organic matter. In Ireland, it is challenging to reach technological seed maturity, according to the project team, and for this reason, seed drying technology is highly recommended.</p><p>Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal have been identified as good locations to grow qui-noa.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quinoa in Belgium</emphasis></p><p>However, an innovative farmer based in Herent in the Flanders region is one of only a number of growers in Belgium trying his hand at the crop.</p><p>Wouter Saelens works with his parents in running the family farm and enterprise.</p><p>Mr Saelens grows 30 hectares of wheat, 20 hectares of maize, 1.5 hectares of spelt, and one hectare of quinoa.</p><p>He has over 200 Belgian Blue-Whites, of which 90 are calves, and the farm has 40 hectares of grassland, 10 of which are devoted to making hay for the winter.</p><p>Thirty hectares are used for grazing.</p><p>Mr Saelens produces 98% of his own livestock feed. The rest is made of soymeal and linseed. He aims to operate as closed a system as he can.</p><p>Trying out growing quinoa for food is a relatively new undertaking for him, in a bid to improve the farm's sustain-ability and shrink his overall footprint, along with making the farm more viable.</p><p>He works closely with a nearby research station to help him in trying out new crops, and previously grew soybeans.</p><p>After growing for around four years, he stopped because it was not profitable enough.</p><p>The soybeans were used for the production of soy 'milk' - production was far too expensive to use it in animal feed.</p><p>Mr Saelens is hopeful that a soy variety can be found to grow well in northern Europe, and that he could one day produce soy oil for human con sumption, and soy meal for livestock feed.</p><p>He is now turning his attention to growing quinoa, but has described it as a difficult market, and that he has possibly entered it at too early a stage, with it remaining underdeveloped in the region.</p><p>According to Mr Saelens, thankfully, quinoa can be processed easily using equipment the farm already has.</p><p>His plants need to receive regular water until they're about 20cm high. After that, it is more weather-resilient.</p><p>Normally, the crop would be seeded by Mr Saelens in April.</p><p>However, this year, it will be seeded in May because the ground is too wet. It would normally be harvested in August or September.</p><p>After he harvests, he brings the quinoa to a plant in the Netherlands for it to be dried and cleaned, where it stays for a few months before it is returned to him.</p><p>He packages and labels it himself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taking a loss for the love of it</emphasis></p><p>The sixth-generation farmer has been growing quinoa for three years; he is taking a loss to grow it, he said - \"but it's an idea I want to believe will work\" in years to come.</p><p>Selling it to retailers and in his on-farm 'automaat' - vending machine - quinoa is something he very much likes as part of his business model - but \"I thought it was going to be very easy, that we grow it in the field and sell it\".</p><p>\"The growing in the field is no problem - but the selling is a big problem,\" he explained. \"I think we are 20 years too early with it.\"</p><p>Quinoa is an item that people in Europe may eat much less frequently than rice or pasta - but he hopes in decades to come that it will become a household staple.</p><p>\"The group that eats it keeps growing,\" he said, but due to demand being lower than hoped, \"it's a difficult product to sell\", and \"if I have to pay for the marketing of that, it's not possible, I don't have that much money\".</p><p>In the first year of growing quinoa, he started with two and a half hectares, but his yield suffered as a result of weather conditions.</p><p>The second harvest year was more successful, but he found he couldn't sell it all in one year, so he has now decided to reduce the area he plants. It is too expensive for him to produce to use as animal feed so all his production is for food.</p><p>He intends to keep trying it each year and to continue learning - and believes that consumers are beginning to choose quinoa over other protein sources for health benefits. It is enjoyed as an addition to salads and soups, or as porridge and cereal, amongst other uses. Quinoa, which is grown for its edible seeds, is referred to as a 'complete protein' - it contains all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own.It is favoured for its fibre and healthy fat content.</p><p>With an overall mild taste and a nutty flavour to it, quinoa is also naturally gluten-free.</p><p>Peru and Bolivia are the world's largest producers and exporters of quinoa, and have produced it for centuries.</p><p>Quinoa is said to be the most versatile of Andean grains for human consumption.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ireland and quinoa</emphasis></h><p>Quinoa trials have been conducted in Ireland in recent years.</p><p>The Smart Protein project as mentioned above started in January 2020 and ends this June, and one of the work packages within this focused on growing a number of different protein crops including quinoa at pilot farms across Europe, including Ireland.</p><p>According to the project, quinoa was \"shown to be adaptable to the Irish climate\".</p><p>\"Using adaptable varieties and implementing regenerative agricultural practices, yields of about 1.3 tonnes per hectare can feasibly be achieved,\" the project team said.</p><p>\"Growing quinoa in Ireland offers promising results since it adapts well to various climates and the demand for high-protein crops is continuing to grow.</p><p>\"In field trials over the past three years, the Titicaca and Puno cultivars produced the largest yield, while the other cultivars only partially performed. Aphid attacks were observed on all varieties during growth and development, although blight pressure wasn't considered a significant risk.\"</p><p>Due to a difficulty in seeds reaching \"full maturity under Irish climatic conditions\", the use of seed-drying technology is strongly recommended.</p><p>\"Additionally, new quinoa varieties that are more diversified in terms of seed colour and protein content are entering the market, which is likely to promote wider consumer acceptance. Higher yields, along with easier mechanisation and the use of regenerative agriculture, are other potential benefits of this crop's diversification,\" the project team has said.</p><p>Tirl\u00e1n, which is Ireland's largest buyer of grains, has said that it \"continues to review the potential of quinoa and other ancient grains as part of the overall premium grains portfolio\".</p><p>\"Tirl\u00e1n has a clear focus on innovating and adding value to our grain pool, with almost  3m in premium grain bonuses paid to growers last year,\" a spokesperson said.</p><p>\"Tirl\u00e1n took part in a European Commission Horizon 2020 project on Smart Proteins, with trials undertaken in Carlow to test varieties of quinoa.</p><p>\"The trials showed there was potential to grow the crop in Ireland, however, it was not deemed a commercially-viable proposition to bring to growers at that stage.\"</p><p>Other projects focused on proteins include the ongoing Protein-I project funded by the Department of Agriculture and led by University College Dublin, which is developing \"strategies to maximise sustainable plant protein produc tion in a traceable/transpar-ent fashion\".</p><p>It aims to support the development of \"sustainable crop production systems in Ireland\", to \"demonstrate a route to increase plant protein diversification in the Irish diet\", and to \"co-design pathways that will support new value chains based on sustainable crops that will benefit rural communities\".</p><p>Meanwhile, as part of the U-Protein project, Teagasc researchers are identifying and refining the key technologies used in the dairy industry, along with developing new practices, to achieve similar results in the plant protein space.</p><p>Irish Grain Growers Group chairman Bobby Miller welcomes the work being done by researchers in this area.</p><p>Mr Miller said that the focus of growing protein crops in Ireland currently is on the feed industry, \"that's where the market is presently\".</p><p>\"For it to be of real benefit to the tillage sector going forward, my own opinion is that we need to be chasing the food-grade market, which is grow ing rapidly,\" Mr Miller said.</p><p>\"We're all fully aware of the growth of the flexitarian diet and plant-based diet which I believe can live in perfect harmony with the dairy and beef industries here in Ireland.</p><p>\"We shouldn't be seeing it as a competition, we should be seeing it as opportunity for the agriculture industry.\"</p><p>With successful research being carried out on proteins in Ireland, Mr Miller said that \"we're at the point now where we need Government support to boost the food-grade protein industry\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support for protein crops</emphasis></p><p>Ireland's Protein Aid Scheme supports farmers to establish nitrogen-fixing crops, but this has been introduced to provide support for the growing of protein crops to counteract the dependence on imported protein for use in animal feed.</p><p>The protein scheme is a voluntary coupled support scheme funded by the EU.</p><p>In 2023,  10m was set aside for the Protein Aid Scheme. There were over 1,000 applicants, growing beans, peas, lupins, and soya.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wouter Saelens operates as closed a system as he can on his farm and produces 98% of his own livestock feed, with the rest made of soymeal and linseed</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A quinoa plant with its seeds in bloom</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 3, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing quinoa for food is a new undertaking for Mr Saelens, who is trying to improve his farm's sustainability and shrink his overall footprint, along with making the farm more viable</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2P-FXT1-JC8V-43VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

She greets me with a big smile. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's only 10am and she's already driven out to Rossmore to collect the oysters for the day. Goldie gets through a lot of oysters, serving them last week with pickled red onion granita and coriander oil - and now she's offering to make me a cortado. It's been a while since I last chatted to her in person and the first impression I have is that she's a lot more comfortable in her skin than she was a few years ago.</p><p>\"Twenty-four years of age opening a restaurant? I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!\" she says. \"It's really difficult, whether it's dealing with all the stresses of being an employer, leading a team, trying to write a menu, trying to be relevant, building relationships with press, securing the restaurant in the positions where you want it to be, getting into the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michelin Guide</emphasis>, all those things, and dealing with the pressure of that. And I've great business partners who have shepherded me and guided me through so much of it, but it's been hard because everything has happened so quickly.\"</p><p>Four and a half years have passed since Moore, who is now 29, opened Goldie, a fish restaurant taking a unique-to-Ireland and sustainable fin-to-gill approach, buying in whole fish of many different species and using every last possible bit of them in dishes such as crunchy fish spines, smoked collars and fish-head terrines. Goldie hit the ground running in 2019 and has barely drawn breath since, other than during the enforced pandemic hiatuses. It's held a Michelin Bib Gourmand since 2021.</p><p>\"The personal growth I've experienced during that time has been amazing,\" she says, reflecting on everything that's happened over the past few years. \"I've learned so much. And things that would've knocked me a year ago no longer shake me. What's that about? It's life experience, I suppose, a bit of maturity.\"</p><p>These days she sits with the boys (and a couple of other women chefs) on the Euro-Toques Ireland Food Council - \"I thought I'd better have a seat at the table,\" she says, \"despite not coming from a fine-dining background\" - and pops up in the media regularly. And, now, as if she didn't have enough going on, Moore has published her first book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whole Catch</emphasis>.</p><p>Writing it on her days off, in the early mornings before work and when she got home after evening service, the 30 recipes, from shaoxing soused mackerel to karaage hake nuggets, are a little different to what you might expect to find in a run-of-the-mill fish primer. </p><p>For those who love to eat fish in restaurants but avoid cooking it at home, there are useful hacks, including 'non-stick tips for cooking fish' (this alone is worth the price of the book) and on cleaning squid, to deal with some of the most common kitchen challenges facing the home cook.</p><p>\"I hope the book might encourage one or two people to try a few different species of fish and maybe get them into their rotation of cooking,\" says Moore. \"And if it educates one person on how to cook a little bit more fish at home, then I'd be delighted with that.\"</p><p>Moore grew up in Cork city, and remembers her mum, Jackie, shopping in the English Market. Back then, no one, least of all herself, would have predicted that she'd end up cooking fish for a living.</p><p>\"When I was younger, I hated the smell of the fish in the market. I don't think the refrigeration was as sophisticated back then... I do remember my mum buying noodles and things you couldn't get anywhere else from Mr Bells. She was quite an adventurous cook.\"</p><p>An interest in food that began at home was fostered by transition year work experience at Ballymaloe - \"My mum took a week off work and drove me up and down each day\" - where JR Ryall, now Ballymaloe's head pastry chef, took 16-year-old Moore under his wing.</p><p>\"I was very lucky that he was the first chef I worked with,\" she says.</p><p>But there wasn't a whole lot of encouragement in school when she said she wanted to pursue a career in cooking.</p><p>\"People said, 'You don't need to become a chef. You're smart enough. You can get the points. You can do whatever you want. Why would you do this?' Luckily, my parents told me to do whatever would make me happy, and if it didn't make me happy, I could change.</p><p>\"When I started at MTU, there were 80 in my year of level 6 culinary studies. That course doesn't exist any more. Twenty-three of us graduated, and I'd say only two or three of us are still cooking.\"</p><p>Moore went on to spend another two years in college, graduating with a BA in culinary arts. Many chefs now opt to learn on the job, progressing through kitchens without ever enrolling in a course, but Moore remains an advocate for formal study.</p><p>\"I think college teaches you discipline, and that academia is important. But all those courses are struggling to get the numbers now. They're tough, between working and studying, because in this industry, unfortunately, you have to be working. You can't do four years in college and not have any industry experience and come out and expect to do well.\"</p><p>Moore has spent most of her working life in Cork. While she was running the kitchen at another Cork restaurant, Elbow Lane, where she became head chef at the tender age of 23,  the owners spotted a gap in the market and suggested they open a fish restaurant together. \"It wasn't that I had a burning desire to work primarily with fish,\" she says, \"but I'm really happy it happened that way.\"</p><p>From the outset, Moore was determined to take the whole-catch approach, and for the menu at Goldie to feature both sustainable species of fish and parts of the fish that are generally spurned by Irish restaurants. Almost all the fish served at Goldie is landed by the boats coming into Ballycotton, and you won't find salmon on the menu, because Moore can't countenance the controversial farming methods used. She makes an exception, perhaps, once a year, when she gets a wild salmon and sells it below cost just to give her customers the experience of eating something truly special.</p><p>\"The Irish customer loves monkfish,\" she says, \"so if I put monkfish on the menu, no matter what day of the week it is, we will sell out. But we can only get so much of it, so we're always going to sell out of it and I want to use other species too. So it can be a struggle to communicate that. I try to write the menu as best as I possibly can so that we don't run out as quickly as we do, but it is a balancing act to manage people's expectations and make sure that there's enough variety and choice.\"</p><p>Pollock, for instance, is a hard sell. \"It divides people,\" says Moore. \"Personally, I really like it. Because we buy in whole fish, we get to see what the fish is eating, and that does affect how it tastes. And pollock always has sea truffle in its mouth and its gills, and I'm convinced that is one of the reasons why I like it so much. But a lot of people just say, 'No, absolutely not.' I tend to put it on with our best sauce, the one that I think will appeal to the most people, so they'll think, 'I want that sauce, so I'll have the pollock.' It's a bit of clever menu writing.\"</p><p>Despite the challenges facing hospitality, and a call for tax breaks for restaurants such as Goldie, which buy locally and minimise waste, Moore is happy with the way things are going at the restaurant, which opens for dinner only, four nights a week. </p><p>For her staff, it means they have achieved the holy grail of work-life balance in the restaurant industry.</p><p>\"To be honest, we wouldn't be able to do what we do any more than four days a week. We've gotten to a stage now where I'm really happy with how business is running, our quality, our consistency, and it would take a lot for me to jeopardise that. I've missed only two services here this year, and only two last year.</p><p>\"Our customers want me to be here and I want to be here. I didn't open a restaurant to not be in it, so being here is still very much my priority. And I'd miss it too much if I wasn't. And I love people. I've discovered I love making people happy more than cooking - it takes you a while to realise what your motivation is. I love being here and we're so lucky with so many regular customers. It's a real relationship. We have customers who come here sometimes twice a week, and we're only open four days!\"</p><p>On the first Wednesday of each month, Goldie invites children in to eat fish for free.</p><p>\"It's been really fun,\" says Moore. \"You see the kids come in and they're a little bit dressed up and they'll eat nearly everything. Some of them have a full three-course meal! We've had kids eat oysters, mussels, gurnard, mackerel. Some of them are really open to it. And for the ones that aren't, we'll have a fish schnitzel, and they can have that with some chips.</p><p>\"We don't want to lecture or preach but we do try and make a bit of an effort where one of the chefs will bring a dish to the table and tell the kids about it. I just think it's great to see kids in restaurants - and we're educating the next generation of diners. Hopefully it might encourage parents to cook some fish at home, which is a hard ask for a lot of people.\"</p><p>With Goldie on an even keel, I'm curious as to whether Moore has plans for another branch or another restaurant.</p><p>\"When we were opening, I thought, for a creative person, this is the most fun thing you could ever do. There are so many outlets, from the menu to the decor to the wine. I absolutely loved it and, as soon as we were open, I said, 'I can't wait to do another one.' And I thought, 'Oh, I could do this or I could do that,' something different, not necessarily just fish.</p><p>\"But now that I've spent the last four years working with fish, I've realised that probably nobody else on the island of Ireland has the advantage that I now have so I want to make the most of that. So while I will probably do something else in the future, I'm not in a rush. And I'm not sure whether it would be another restaurant or a different kind of creative outlet.</p><p>\"Long term, I want to get into regenerative agriculture in practice and on the plate. That would be the dream for me, I suppose. I see that as the future, and I would love to have a farm at some point, but I don't have the means or the information to do that yet. But I think I can be ambitious and say I could do it in 10 years. I'm really lucky to be young.\"</p><p>With things at Goldie the way she wants them, and the book about to be published, Moore's making time to reconnect with friends who don't work in hospitality - \"people with normal jobs\", she says. She likes to spend her time off walking George (after George Michael), the Cavachon she shares with her mum, and - believe it or not - cooking.</p><p>\"Because I cook all week, when I have a day off, I do want to cook, but I want to cook exactly what I want to eat, and I want to have one thing, and I can't eat the same thing the next day. I hate leftovers. I'm terrible. I hate leftovers in the restaurant as well. So we really try to run out of things every day so that we can start afresh the next day.</p><p>\"I've gotten so particular over the years about the ethics of where food comes from and all those things that my mum is really slow to cook for me now. I get it. I wouldn't want to cook for me either.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aishling Moore's 'Whole Catch' is published by Blasta Books</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORKAN-https://www.independent.ie/life/fooddrink/corkchefaishlingmooreopeningarestaurantat24iwouldntrecommendittoanyone/a1967734058.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORKAN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BV8-7FM1-F06V-60KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corkman (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40452\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 20, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DNKD</classCode><className>SELF IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N722100CC</classCode><className>FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N511130CC</classCode><className>BOOK PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

However, few have since carved out clear plans to reach that goal.</p><p>Danone, which works directly with 58,000 dairy farmers across 20 countries, expects to remove 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>Between 2018 and 2020, the French company had reduced its methane emissions by about 14%.</p><p>Danone said it will launch four new initiatives this year for methane reduction in Africa, Europe and the US.</p><p>It is also launching a partnership with US non-governmental organisation Environmental Defense Fund, and working with the United States Department of Agriculture and the European Commission-funded Climate Neutral Farms project.</p><p>Simple techniques can have a big impact, said Chris Adamo, vice president of regenerative agriculture policy at Danone.</p><p>\"In Belgium and Spain, for example, we're looking at a variety of different manure options. We've been finding that, for example, with one technique that is just different management of manure, you're literally removing the liquids so that the solids dry - the solids then become a better substitute, actually, in many cases for synthetic fertiliser on the crop side as well,\" Adamo said.</p><p>!But that mere separation itself can have anywhere from a 25-35% reduction in methane from the manure itself,\" he told Reuters on a phone call.</p><p>Danone declined to comment on how much it would spend on its plans.</p><p>\"The costs are really, frankly, somewhat unknown, or early days in terms of estimating because these are new technologies that are coming out,\" Adamo said.</p><p>About 60% of the methane in the atmosphere comes from industrial sources, including oil and gas pipelines and drill sites, as well as feed lots, croplands and landfills.</p><p>Dairy production from cattle makes up an estimated 8% of total human-caused methane emissions, as part of agriculture and livestock activities which represent approximately 40% of global methane emissions, Danone said.</p><p>The company said it will report on its methane emissions as part of its extra financial disclosure in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-1349103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67BD-FC51-JDRT-22J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"426\"/><timeReceived>7:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 17, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH </className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002JO8</classCode><className>DANONE SA (FRANCE)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS312112 BOTTLED WATER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS311821 COOKIE &amp;

The ire of protesting farmers in recent weeks has targeted cheap imports, green policies and government regulation they say is destroying their livelihoods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Patrick Holden, one of the pioneers of organic farming in Britain and advisor to King Charles, says their anger is misdirected. The true problem is a race to the bottom among supermarket giants that has left small family farmers on their knees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Farmers are pawns in the game,\" says Holden, who is also the chief executive of the Sustainable Food Trust (SFT). \"They are victims of a system that we are all responsible for.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The system of food production is parasitic on farmers. If you are trying to have a price war with your competitors, the only place they can extract any more costs from the system has been farmers.\"</p><p>Demand for cheap food and the rise of discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl has driven down profits so that only the \"big boys\" can afford to compete, he says.</p><p>\"The farmers either intensify and enlarge, or they quietly give up. We're seeing the demise of small family farms because they've just had all the life sucked out of them by low prices.\"</p><p>\"It is sort of cultural cleansing by price.\"</p><p>I meet Holden in Pangbourne in Berkshire where he is recording a podcast with Iain Tolhurst, another stalwart of the organic scene. Dressed in a navy rain jacket, sensible boots and shirt, Holden looks like someone you would pass on a gentle hike.</p><p>On the way to lunch we stop at a local cheese shop because he is curious to see whether they stock Hafod, the cheddar made on his farm in Lampeter, Wales. Although Holden, 73, is still an active farmer (\"I'm in it for life. It's a great life\"), it is his second wife, Becky, who does much of the milking, alongside two of his eight children who are living at home.</p><p>As the head of the SFT, a big part of Holden's day-to-day life is trying to persuade people that we need to heal our relationship with the land that produces our food.</p><p>In 1995 there were more than 30,000 dairy farms in Great Britain. As of April last year there were just 7,500 - a 75pc reduction.</p><p>Meanwhile, intensive pork and poultry farms, which hold upwards of 40,000 birds and 2,000 pigs, have been on the rise, growing 7pc between 2017 and 2020 The agriculture industry in Britain is undergoing its biggest transition since World War II, as EU-era subsidies are removed and replaced by a new system that pays farmers for delivering public goods, such as tree planting and improved soils.</p><p>It is the specific shape of these proposals that have brought anger among Welsh farmers to a head in recent weeks, with around 3,000 demonstrating outside the Senedd (the Welsh parliament building) last month, in the wake of demonstrations across Europe.</p><p>In its latest survey tracking opinion among farmers, the UK's Environment Department found only 6pc of English farmers fully understood what the vision was for the future of farming. A further 5pc said the post-Brexit changes would force them out of the industry.</p><p>Holden, who has farmed for 50 years, says he has been insulated from the industry's pressures only by making a \"reassuringly expensive cheese\" from his 65-strong dairy herd on the land he first set up as a commune in 1973, and his day job at the SFT, which he co-founded in 2011.</p><p>\"You take the cheese out of it and we would be a statistic. We would be one of the farms that has given up,\" he says.</p><p>Among ordinary farmers, criticising the supermarkets has been seen as almost a taboo because of fears they could be \"de-listed\" - removed as a favoured supplier by the big four, or the wholesalers and processors that act as middlemen in the supply chain.</p><p>\"The story behind our food is hidden for a good reason. Because if we knew that story, we might not want to buy the food,\" Holden says.</p><p>Take the fact that intensive free-range chicken farming has been allowed to proliferate, particularly in Wales, nearly doubling in size since 2011, and has been blamed for an ecological \"death spiral\" on the River Wye, where colossal levels of nutrients from manure are choking off aquatic life.</p><p>Or the fact that around half of the UK's dairy comes from cows that live permanently in massive sheds, and will never touch grass, according to industry estimates.</p><p>Or the hundreds of miles their animals are forced to travel before they are slaughtered, often with long waits at either end, because of the demise of local abattoirs as supermarkets enter into contracts with the bigger players.</p><p>Holden says he is \"telling on himself\" as much as his fellow farmers here.</p><p>\"Some of our dairy cows end up in London restaurants,\" he says. \"But the rest will sell to a haulier who will take them to an abattoir somewhere. The truth is I don't know where they end up, and that is part of a system that makes everything anonymous, including to the farmers.</p><p>\"We can't ignore it any longer, that farming is a central part of the problem.\"</p><p>What he is keen to do is lay the blame in the right place.</p><p>\"I'm not denigrating the farmers. It's not their fault,\" he says. \"They've been led down this path by a combination of policy and economics for decades. They've been sacrificed on the altar.\"</p><p>What has been lost in the move to intensification is the kind of mixed farms that the SFT and other proponents of the rising 'regenerative' farming movement advocate returning to, which combine grassland, grazing livestock and crops on a rotational system.</p><p>Holden knows he is something of a difficult interlocutor to persuade farmers, still being considered a \"wacky\"</p><p>figure in the industry.</p><p>One of four children born to a family of Oxford scholars and Anglican missionaries in south London, his mother worked at Bletchley Park (the World War II code-cracking centre) and then became a social worker, and his father was a child psychiatrist.</p><p>With no farming in his blood, it was only when his father got a job at Stanford</p><p>University in California that he started to think more deeply about the land, eventually setting up a rural commune in Wales.</p><p>\"My parents were very sweet, actually, when I decided to become a farmer,\" he says. \"They were of a generation that will never be directly open about their kids. But Dad did say to me once, 'I'm proud of you.' That meant a lot.\"</p><p>Determined to farm with as little impact on the land as possible, the commune soon realised they would struggle to turn a profit. Instead, they decided to turn their new 'organic' approach into a selling point.</p><p>\"It was a means to an end really,\" Holden says. \"Survival in what was a very difficult economic time.\"</p><p>But if he remains something of an outsider in farming, Holden has won friends in high places along the way.</p><p>In the 1980s he was asked to join a group of experts to help King Charles set up his own organic holding at Highgrove, which became the Duchy Originals brand. He has remained a friend and advisor to the King ever since, and is in touch with him regularly.</p><p>\"He's highly intuitive and a bit of a visionary in his contribution to fostering a new understanding of our relationship with nature,\" he says. \"We're not separate from nature, we're part of nature.</p><p>\"His promotion and his advocacy, before he became King, especially of sustainable agriculture, but also in many other fields, is remarkable. I think he is a leader for our time.\"</p><p>In 1995, Holden took charge of the</p><p>Soil Association, the organic standards body, and oversaw an increase in annual sales from \u00a350m to \u00a32bn during his 15 years in the role. Since then, sales have lagged at around 2pc of the market.</p><p>\"The whole organic project has been misunderstood and stalled because of this distorted economic system where the polluter doesn't pay,\" he says.</p><p>\"And the other people aren't having the polluter-pays principle applied, because everybody's addicted to so-called cheap food, which is dishonestly cheap.</p><p>\"If you say to yourself, I can't afford to spend more on food, I think that is completely legitimate for probably about 20pc of the population. And for that 20pc, that's what governments are for. The other 80pc of us who can afford to spend less on something else, that's what we should do.\"</p><p>The challenge may be easier for Holden, who eats mainly from his own 300ac farm, than for the rest of us trying to navigate the endless labelling in our weekly supermarket shop.</p><p>\"I think you'd recognise our family's diet as being a diet that you'd want to eat,\" he says. There is unsurprisingly \"shed loads\" of cheese, milk and meat almost every day, including \"the most delicious sausages I have ever eaten\", from their own pigs that have just been sent to the local slaughterhouse. Vital role Livestock, he says, have a vital role to play in regenerative agriculture, helping to feed the soils.</p><p>\"Why are so many young people going vegan? I think they misunderstand the importance of livestock in sustainable farming systems,\" he says.</p><p>\"And they intuitively sense that the meat and other livestock products which supermarkets sell probably have a very poor welfare story behind them.\"</p><p>But he believes that the message of the important role that livestock can play is getting missed because of public figures such as David Attenborough, who call for us to eat less meat because of livestock's impact on the climate.</p><p>\"David is a national treasure and I wrote him a letter recently to ask if he would be prepared to get involved in the discussion about sustainable agriculture,\" Holden says.</p><p>\"He wrote a charming handwritten note back, saying 'I would love to help but I don't know enough about farming.' Which is honest.</p><p>\"But the people who have been writing his scripts have made him a mouthpiece for the one thing he's got wrong, which is the livestock thing. It's not the cow, but the how.\"</p><p>None of Holden's children, aged between 16 and 52, have shown an inclination towards veganism, although \"they all mind about the story behind the meat they eat\".</p><p>The family have just acquired 10 chickens to supply the many eggs eaten by Holden's rugby-playing son Harry, 19, who has just returned to the farm after dropping out of Edinburgh University after one term. His older brother Ben, 21, has also dropped out of Glasgow University and is back in the family home.</p><p>Both Harry and Ben are now helping out on the farm. Holden's youngest son, 16-year-old James has also declared his knowledge of farming to be \"cool\".</p><p>\"There's a whole generation of young people that are starting to think about farming in an interesting way now,\" says Holden.</p><p>He is keen not to dismiss the difficulty that farmers are facing, which are compounded by rising interest rates and input costs in the wake of the Ukraine war.</p><p>But he dismisses the \"no farmers, no food\" slogans that have appeared at recent protests, particularly in Wales, where protesters have rejected the Government's proposed sustainable farming scheme, which would require farms to maintain 10pc woodland and 10pc wildlife habitat to qualify for subsidies.</p><p>\"It's just a bit trite, isn't it? The point is, what kind of farming story do we want? It's got to be: no sustainable farmers, no food,\" he says.</p><p>\"Farmers are understandably confused and dismayed and anxious about the future because most farmers responded to the policy and economic signals of the last 40 years.</p><p>\"They have been locked into a system which they've assumed has been the right system for a very long time. And they've invested in it, and they're defensive. A lot of them have borrowed a lot of money to intensify.</p><p>\"The Government shouldn't back down on the farming transition, but realise more needs to be done to help farmers, who can't improve the way they do agriculture if they don't make money.</p><p>\"Farming is absolutely part of the problem. But it could become part of the solution.\"</p><p>The answer, though, will require us all to change the way we eat, and what we expect from our supermarkets. For starters, Holden says we have to see \"the end of cheap chicken.</p><p>\"It's over. People need to get used to the idea that they should buy quality food and eat differently. This transition is going to hurt us all. And we can't leave it to farmers to take all the pain.\"</p><p>Telegraph</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>King Charles at the calving shed on Shane Fitzgerald's Waterford farm in 2022 Photo: Julien BehalPatrick Holden disagrees with DavidKing Charles at a mart in LincolnshirePatrick Holden, a pioneering organic farmer and mentor to King Charles, on his holding in Wales</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-195030999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKF-C4V1-DYTY-C1JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 19, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XG5</classCode><className>BRITISH MONARCHS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X8V</classCode><className>MENTORS &amp;

giant Nestle has today pledged to spend over 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.01 billion) by 2030 on efforts to source coffee sustainably.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is more than double its previous pledge, as challenges linked to climate change pose particular risks for the bean.</p><p>Study after study has shown that by 2050 roughly half the land currently used to grow coffee, especially that of the high quality arabica variety, could be unproductive thanks to rising temperatures, drought and disease.</p><p>Multinationals are meanwhile facing increased reputational and legal pressure from consumers and governments alike to clean up their global supply chains in the fight against climate change.</p><p>The European Commission has proposed several laws aimed at preventing and, in the case of forced labour, banning the import and use of products linked to environmental and human rights abuses.</p><p>Nestle has already pledged to source all its coffee sustainably by 2025.</p><p>It said it is now also aiming, by that date, for 20% of its coffee to be grown using 'regenerative' agricultural practices as part of its new NESCAF\u00c9 Plan 2030.</p><p>These include planting cover crops to protect soil, using organic fertilisers to improve soil fertility and increasing the use of agroforestry and intercropping to preserve biodiversity.</p><p>The measures have the aim of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p><p>The company, announcing its plan to double spending on sustainable coffee sourcing, said it is \"committed to supporting farmers who take on the risks and costs associated with the move to regenerative agriculture\", and will provide programmes aimed at helping them improve their income.</p><p>A major coffee report published last year said there is little evidence efforts by the world's top coffee roasters and traders to prevent human rights and environmental abuses are having any impact, with most farmers operating at a loss and unable to produce sustainably.</p><p>The coffee sector is valued at $200 billion-$250 billion a year at the retail level, according to the report.</p><p>But producing countries receive less than 10% of that value when exporting beans, and farmers even less than that.</p><p>Around 125 million people around the world depend on coffee for their livelihoods, while an estimated 80% of coffee-farming families live at or below the poverty line, according to non-profit organisations Fairtrade and Technoserve.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Running a research farm must have a whole different set of challenges to running a commercial one, but we are all at the mercy of the weather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Teagasc has enormous knowledge and expertise in Irish soils, even if this has not always seemed to be at the centre of its advice to farmers. It is over 70 years since research started in Johnstown Castle and our soils have been through a lot in that time.</p><p>The production of synthetic nitrogen came from arms research during World War II, an event that left millions of hungry people in need of all the productivity it offered. Explosion Mechanisation allowed farmers to harness the new input, and plant breeding contributed to an explosion in farm output.</p><p>For a time we were able to develop pesticides as fast as problems arose, and for decades the soil was treated more or less as a host for our technologies.</p><p>The bell has rung on this game of chemical whack-a-mole and we are farming with fewer and fewer synthetic inputs and strict usage limits on the remaining ones.</p><p>If farming went too far in one direction, we can be fairly sure that the reaction will be equal and opposite, and some of the consequences are going to be painful - and not only to farmers.</p><p>There seems to a presumption that the high outputs of recent decades will be maintained while farming adjusts - or that food will just come from somewhere else.</p><p>But raging against the unfairness of regulation won't change the fundamentals.</p><p>We have treated soil almost as an adversary, to be battered into submission and made to take its medicine. Now we need it as an ally, and our agricultural education and experience have left us poorly equipped to nurture it.</p><p>The growth of regenerative agriculture in Ireland has been farmer-led and has mostly met with indifference if not hostility from the establishment.</p><p>Inertia may be a bigger cause of this than the cynical protection of a lucrative status quo, but inertia can be overcome and momentum is definitely building.</p><p>Soil is the key to regenerative farming and the breadth and depth of knowledge displayed in Johnstown Castle were stunning.</p><p>It felt like a parallel universe where farmers have been trying to figure out the practicalities of the puzzle that soil can be, while over in the next dimension, Teagasc is doing serious research into all these physical, chemical and biological components and building on a bank of knowledge that stretches back to the National Soil Survey of the 1960s.</p><p>This feels like the moment for collaboration. Researchers need to be released from their silos to develop systems-based approaches that look at complex farming situations.</p><p>Farmers will wean themselves off the bottle if they are offered palatable solid food.

The goals are challenging, but the industry is making strong progress.</p><p>Nicole Keohane farms alongside her parents John and Anne in Innishannon, County Cork. \"We're currently milking 90 cows, a typical Irish family farm by all means,\" she says.</p><p>The 25-year old currently combines part time farming with her studies for a MSc and work as a researcher for an animal health company.</p><p>\"Between Monday and Friday you might catch me in the laboratory, trying my hand at a bit of molecular biology, on one of my trial farms collecting milk samples, or in the library.</p><p>\"On the weekends, I'm mostly found at home on the farm; milking cows, looking after calves, anything to do my part.\"</p><p>Nicole caught the farming bug a little later than most, she explains. \"My grandparents have been the custodians of our land for the past forty years, and I have early childhood memories of feeding the calves with my grandfather, peering in through the door to watch my grandmother in the milking parlour, and a tractor journey here and there. It wasn't until I was around sixteen that I even milked my first cow. But once I had, I was hooked.\"</p><p>Nicole typifies a new generation of farmers for whom scientific innovation and ancient traditions can happily co-exist. Young farmers currently represent 6% of the total farming cohort in Ireland. Nicole would like to see that number improve and feels that spreading her passion for regenerative agriculture and speaking out on the efforts farmers are making to tackle climate change challenges can encourage a new generation into the industry.</p><p>\"Agriculture has been tasked with reducing our carbon emissions by 25% by 2030,\" she says. \"Farmers are actively seeking solutions and implementing them where we can. There's a huge focus on breeding strategies, resulting in higher yielding, longer lasting and healthier cows. We can produce more dairy per cow, which is far more emissions-efficient.</p><p>\"The plants cows graze have been reconsidered. Species such as clover, plantain, chicory require far less artificial nitrogen, and they reduce the amount of artificial fertilisers required. We have embraced technology to track a cow's health and welfare and record grass growth, and we're using GPS systems to ensure efficient spreading of fertiliser.</p><p>\"Dairy farmers strive to do better, to ensure that there is a future on the farm for the next generation.\"</p><p>Miriam Gunn farms with her husband in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon and they were National Dairy Council and Kerrygold Quality Milk Awards finalists in 2019.</p><p>Miriam says that sustainable farming starts from the ground up. \"We spread all of our slurry with low emissions spreading techniques and we use low-emission fertiliser,\" she says. \"We have a nutrient management plan, so last year we had soil samples taken across the entire farm to determine what nutrients were needed and in what areas. We tailor our fertiliser programme to suit exactly what is required, so there is no excess of anything being used.\"</p><p>Miriam refers to new regulations, entitled the 'European Union Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters Regulations 2022 Statutory Instruments S.I No. 113 of 2022' and says that while these regulations are instructive they do not affect their farm in Strokestown as they are already mindful of slurry spreading methodologies.</p><p>\"We are always checking the weather forecast,\" she says. \"Slurry is a valuable resource, so we don't want to be wasting any of it and we don't want any of it to go astray.</p><p>\"We want to make sure that all of it is growing more grass. We would be very mindful of how, when and where we spread our slurry.\"</p><p>Miriam says she would be delighted for any of her four children to pursue a career in agriculture. \"I know they are young -14,12, 8 and nearly 6 - and I would be fairly certain even at this stage that 3 of them will probably pursue careers in agriculture,\" she says.</p><p>\"I think it's a great way of life and they have such a gr\u00e1 for it already. You know it's something that's in you. It's not something that you can buy or necessarily learn. It's the love of the land and a vocation rather than a career. I would be absolutely delighted to see my children following in our farming footsteps.\"</p><p>Shane Fitzgerald farms in Portlaw in Co Waterford with his father John and fianc\u00e9e Kate. The family farms 200 dairy cows on grass and Fitzgerald describes their efforts as a \"balancing act\".</p><p>Irish dairy farmers are focused on the climate challenge - 96% have signed up to the sustainability initiatives that are addressing the sector's environmental impact</p><p>\"While the political goalposts keep shifting, we are committed to producing high-quality milk in as environmentally-friendly a manner as possible. On one hand we are being incentivised to protect biodiversity, and yet the milk production system is not being adequately supported. There are challenges, but there are also opportunities and with the right supports we can encourage the next generation of farmers coming through to drive sustainable change.\"</p><p>\"Young people represent the future of farming,\" Fitzgerald says. \"We are aware of the consequences of the actions we take today. As a young dairy farmer I certainly want to ensure that our environment is protected for the next generation.\"</p><p>Fitzgerald is a National Dairy Council ambassador, one of a group of dairy farmers for whom spreading a sustainable message is second nature. His family has used protected urea as a fertiliser on the farm for four years now. \"It's a safer product,\" he says, \"which is more environmentally friendly and less prone to leaching into waterways.\"</p><p>Fitzgerald also uses a trailing shoe to spread slurry, which results in fewer ammonia emissions when compared to the use of a splash plate.</p><p>\"Our challenge is to balance the sustainability priorities alongside the human element and the production element of dairy farming,\" Fitzgerald says. \"And I'd love the public to better understand the balancing act we are trying to achieve.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicole Keohane, MSc student and dairy farmer, Inishannon, Co Cork</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shane Fitzgerald, dairy farmer, Portlaw, Co Waterford</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 3, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NDC Dairy products</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 4, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NDC Dairy</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 5, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Gunn farms with her husband in Strokestown, Co.

It is the perfect place for a relaxing break, oozing peace and tranquility in this quiet corner of Co Meath.</p><p>From the moment you arrive at the entrance to the wooded driveway, it is apparent this is somewhere at one with nature, the surroundings reinforcing the message that this is the ideal location to chill out and take a step back from the stresses and strains of everyday life.</p><p>The hotel has an intimate feel with reminders of its railway heritage interspersed throughout, particularly in its luxurious rooms.</p><p>The two-storey signal suite was converted from the original signal box, while the station master suite was originally the station master's living quarters.</p><p>The individually decorated main house cabins and the carriage house cabins, created by converting the original locomotive workshops, are welcoming and well-equipped - a comfy base from which to explore the area. We stayed in a carriage house cabin, located on the upper floor of the building originally used to store and maintain the railway engines and carriages. While the character and craftsmanship of the Victoria era are respected, it also has a fresh feel with all the features you would expect of a modern hotel room.</p><p>The property's outdoor terraces are perfect for relaxing in the better weather and lead out onto the grounds, one illuminated walkway taking you to an impressive amphitheatre which is ideal for weddings.</p><p>Dining is a delight at the Station House with fine food at the heart of their offering. Fruit and vegetables are grown in the gardens and in partner farms throughout the local area and it is this seasonal produce from the Boyne Valley that features prominently on the menus in the much-hailed Signal Restaurant and the Platform Bar and Piano Lounge.</p><p>The Station House has developed a special relationship with the nearby Swainstown Farm, with many of its scrumptious ingredients featuring in the Boyne Valley Tasting Evening.</p><p>The new spring menu is crammed full of tasty treats, including the pork belly with spiced carrot and pickled apple and the organic summer beetroot.</p><p>Main courses of wild Irish monkfish with ham, organic kale and beurre blanc, and braised shoulder and herb-crusted loin of organic lamb, proved particular favourites. Strawberry mille feuille and a Boyne Valley cheeseboard topped off a mouthwatering feast.</p><p>And of course no tasting evening would be complete without a selection of fine wine with the Il Borro from Tuscany well worth a try.</p><p>It was off to Swainstown Farm after breakfast the next morning, where we found out a bit more about the food which had so tantalised our taste buds the previous evening.</p><p>Fresh, local and chemical-free are watchwords for Arthur Preston and his wife Larissa who, since taking over the family farm five years ago, have set about converting it through a mixture of regenerative agriculture and protecting the wild areas.</p><p>Some of the innovative practices they have introduced include no-dig vegetable production and the mob grazing of livestock, all with the aim of promoting biodiversity, reducing waste and storing carbon.</p><p>It proved to be a fascinating insight into the work involved in sustainable farming, with The Piggery farm shop providing an opportunity to bring home some of the delicious Swainstown produce.</p><p>Another neighbour of the Station House is the colourful naturalist and film-maker Randal Plunkett, otherwise known as the 21st Baron of Dunsany. Dunsany Castle and estate lie just a few miles from Kilmessan and we were treated to a tour of the thriving 750-acre nature reserve which is the first Irish project to be recognised by the European Rewilding Network.</p><p>It is nine years since Randal took the gamble of rewilding his family's historic demesne, removing all grazing animals from the land with the aim of restoring ecosystems to a point where nature can take care of itself.</p><p>Now the animals are long gone and at first glance the fields of hip-high grass look neglected. But two-and-a-half hours of wandering through the estate convinced me that nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>The flowers, shrubs and trees are home to a multitude of insects and creatures, some of which had not been seen in the area for years.</p><p>Again, another place well worth a visit if you're in the area, which brings us back to where we started - the Station House Hotel. It's the perfect location for a relaxing, well-earned break and ideal if you want to discover more of Ireland's Ancient East. The hotel's Taste of the Garden offer includes one night B&amp;B with a glass of rose on The Terrace before a three-course dinner in The Signal Restaurant and a la carte breakfast.

We needed an animal that first of all, could thrive on poorer pasture, and those grasses that do well in the sea air.</p><p>\"Some people might call them weed grasses, but they are doing well on the land, especially with the addition of clover.\"Stephen started into dexters after his daughters bought him two Dexter cows at a challenging time when he was recovering from a serious illness.\"Two soon became four, four became eight, then we started showing them, and it just has grown from there,\" he said.</p><p>Today, the family runs a 125-strong herd consisting of 50 breeding female dexters, ten of which are to be sold as springing heifers, two stock bulls, three Belties and two Black Galloway maiden heifers.\"We soon realised we would have to market the meat ourselves, so the whole family ended up getting involved,\" Stephen said, explaining that his daughter, Hannah, has taken on a lot of the photography and marketing work for the farm.The business was recently boosted just a year ago, when the family got the opportunity to take on the lease for the National Trust's 55-acre farm at Orlock, around 10 miles away, looking out over the Irish Sea.</p><p>Stephen is also on the steering committee of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, which allows farmers from different sectors and walks of life to compare approaches and learn from each other.But despite, the focus on sustain-ability, Stephen insists he is focused on running a profitable business, well geared up for whatever the future will bring for farming.\"We are not playing at farming - we run a productive, profitable farm,\" he said.</p><p>Stock are finished at 30-36 months and killing out at 5458% of their liveweight. And this year, he has also invested in weighing scales, which he hopes will further improve the business.All cattle on the farm are certified as 'Pasture for Life'.</p><p>\"That means we don't feed any grain, whatsoever, and they are always fed on pasture,\" he said.\"Cattle are browsers, not grazers. Our cattle will target individual species on the herbal leys, depending on what they need. We also are great believers of letting our hedges grow big and thick and we will let them graze into the hedges too.\"The deep-rooting swards also have helped overcome some of the environmental challenges of the land.</p><p>Multispecies swards with mixes of 16 species for the grazing pasture and 11 species for the cutting platform, have been selected specially to match the results of soil testing .\"We needed to get the pH right, and with it being on the coast, we knew sainfoin wouldn't do well in the salty air, and needed an acidic soil. We had to do that to get the mix we wanted. It's not an off-the-shelf mix,\" he said.</p><p>The mixture has been sown for less than a year at Orlock but has already had big benefits in such an exposed part of the coastline.\"Before, the soil top soil was getting washed away, but now the mixed swards are keeping the soil covered and helping to prevent that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ballyboley Dexters: Hannah, Lorraine, Naomi with Cindy the birder terrier, Matthew, and Stephen Alexander</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67V3-VS41-DYRW-V50G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

They ate what they grew, wore what they wove, and sold what they could spare.</p><p>While often poor in material wealth by latter-day standards, they possessed a wide range of basic skills for farming, which is nowadays largely guided by agricultural science and dependent on complex technology.</p><p>Every parish had a network of people with an inherited knowledge which they shared with each other. Advice was often sought about folk medicines for sick animals, what vegetables should be planted in damp soil and where to set a row of sheltering trees.</p><p>Food was never wasted. Hob lawyers gave advice on disputes between neighbouring farmers about bounds ditches and trespassing cattle.</p><p>And there was no shortage of people whose weather predictions often dictated whether a farmer should cut a meadow of hay or mend a fence on any given day.</p><p>Mechanisation, rural electrification, television, growth in agricultural education and advisory services followed.</p><p>And so did the consumer society and membership of what is now the European Union, which changed rural life, mostly for the better.</p><p>Yet, some of the old ways are still relevant with a renewed focus on biodiversity, sustainability, and the natural health of the countryside.</p><p>Farming For Nature says there is widespread awareness of the environmental damage that can be caused by the wrong type of farming.</p><p>\"We hear about it all the time,\" it says. \"There isn't as much discussion of those that are doing a great job farming for nature, about the positive stories, meaning we don't have many good role models.</p><p>\"This negative narrative can alienate farmers from nature, making them feel apart from it rather than part of it. Encouraging farmers to feel that they are part of the solution, not just the problem, is the first step in a long journey which will require a lot of financial and technical support, new partnerships and new visions.\"</p><p>The project is open for 2023 applications until June 10. It will shortlist up to 50 applications, depending on the interest and capacity.</p><p>Brigid Barry, co-ordinator, said many f armers request a fellow farmer to visit and provide practical tips on what they can do to improve the environmental condition of their land while continuing to farm alongside nature.</p><p>The farmer pays a nominal fee of  50 to the visiting mentor and Farming For Nature covers the rest. Some 50 farms will be chosen this year to partake in the project with a view to expanding it into the future.</p><p>The mentors listed for this year include Thomas and Claire O'Connor, who manage a 25-acre mixed organic farm in Gleannna Gealt, Camp, Co Kerry.</p><p>They produce vegetables, wheat-grass, meat, poultry, and eggs, which they sell locally in their Tralee shop. They have 15 acres of native Irish woodland and four-acres of permaculture including fruit trees.</p><p>Another mentor, Suzanna Crampton, Bennetts Bridge, Co Kilkenny, has species-rich meadows and pastures, as well as woodlands, parkland, and numerous standalone mature trees which form a haven for local wildlife. She farms 12 acres on which she has 30 ewes and followers. They have access to a mixed sward with 17 species of grasses.</p><p>Suzanna practices regenerative agriculture with a rare breed of sheep that is triflective (milk, meat, fleece). She designs blankets from her award-winning wool.</p><p>The farm has herb-rich grazing for the sheep. Mature hedges add more habitat diversity for native plants, insects, and birds. A decades-old traditional or chard provides bountiful fruit.</p><p>Irish organic farming pioneer Michael Hickey, another listed mentor, farms for nature near New Inn, CoTipperary. He manages half of his 100-acre organic farm for tillage and the rest for his herd of 40 Aberdeen Angus cattle and horses.</p><p>The farm has a variety of habitats including seasonally flooded grasslands, fen areas, pastures, and meadows. He has given 30% of his farm over to habitats.</p><p>Farming For Nature says the programme involves an informal farm walk and a chat with the host farmer to share simple practical advice and given encouragement.</p><p>\"These farmers are not ecologists but are fellow farmers that are working day in, day out in situations that have an abundance of wildlife and plant life without impacting their farming systems,\" it says.</p><p>In many ways, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Horse's Mouth</emphasis> programme reflects how farming knowledge was shared locally generations ago. The title is apt. It means the advice given is straight from a reliable source.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689H-5XJ1-DYRW-V2MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Prior to that, I spent three years working as a Food and Agribusiness consultant working with a range of client types across the food supply chain. I have always been interested in agriculture and grew up on a mixed livestock farm in Co Cork.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What have been some of the stand-out moments in your role?</emphasis></p><p>During my time on the Origin Green Ambassador Programme, I did a one-year placement with McDonald's in a hybrid role with their Global Impact and UK &amp; Ireland sustainability team. I am currently in the middle of a six-month placement in the Environment team within Tesco. I have been based in London for all of my placements which I have really enjoyed. Throughout the programme I was fortunate enough to attend different events such as the EAT DRINK THINK Sustainable Nutrition event run by Kerry, and the Sustainable Food and Drink Conference held in London. I was given the chance to get back on-farm through supplier or knowledge-sharing visits. I visited FAI regenerative farm in Oxford, which was an amazing opportunity to see regenerative agriculture in practice.</p><p>Advertisement<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does a typical day look like?</emphasis></p><p>I am currently on my placement with Tesco, and on a typical day I will either travel to the Tesco head office based in Welwyn Garden City, or their central office which is based in Farringdon. My work in Tesco is focused on developing their nature strategy and a lot of my time is spent identifying biodiversity risk hotspots in their supply chain. Tesco has a longstanding partnership with World Wildlife Fund, and it is exciting to see in practice the projects taking place, and the impact being made through the partnership. One thing I really enjoy about this role is that I spend a lot of time talking to various start-ups or tech companies who provide innovative nature-based solutions with the aim of enhancing nature and biodiversity - not just in Tesco's supply chain, but at a wider landscape level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the most enjoyable aspect of the programme?</emphasis></p><p>The most enjoyable aspect of the programme for me has been meeting so many amazing people in the sustainability and wider food industry. I have learnt so much from the other fantastic Origin Green Ambassadors and brilliant colleagues I have met along the way. The Origin Green Ambassador programme is a fantastic opportunity to build a strong network in the food and drink sustainability industry. This is really important because I've learned over the course of the programme just how small the food sustainability space is.</p><p>Advertisement<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you recommend the programme to other prospective applicants?</emphasis></p><p>I think people should apply for the Origin Green Ambassador Programme as in my experience, the placement opportunities have been second to none and it is a fantastic way to gain a masters in sustainability in a really practical and hands on way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why did you choose to work with Origin Green?</emphasis></p><p>Personally, the main attraction of the Origin Green programme was the placement element and the invaluable opportuity it presented to work on the sustainability teams of leading food and beverage companies globally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where do you see your industry\u00e2\u20ac\u00affive years from now?</emphasis></p><p>I hope that the\u00e2\u20ac\u00affood industry, including our\u00e2\u20ac\u00affarmers, is recognised for its strengths and not just its weaknesses. I hope that we can transition to more holistic and nature-friendly food production systems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If you could go back in time and give yourself a piece of advice at the start of your career, what would that be?</emphasis></p><p>Follow what interests you and the opportunities will come.

In about 1720 they decided they wanted a more contemporary home and by 1745 Dowth Hall was built. Later, in 1877, the family developed an alms house for widows and orphans to a design by architect George Coppinger Ashlin, which became known as the Netterville Institution - a fine example of Victorian Gothic architecture - today known as Netterville Manor. It has a new castellated structure used as a function room, which overlooks a lake to the rear. It's quite intriguing that the properties have been connected for the past 250 years.</p><p>Besides the two important houses, the sale includes a whopping amount of fertile lands which are part of the Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne Unesco world heritage site: a total of 223 hectares (552 acres) to be precise. The property is bounded by the river Boyne, with private access and fishing rights to the river, and includes a private grass airstrip directly adjacent to the estate. Devenish purchased the fertile lands to investigate sustainable and regenerative agriculture to allow a more productive and economic method of farming to produce low-carbon beef and lamb by precision soil sampling. The lands here are one of 12 exemplary sustainable farms worldwide listed in the Global Network of Lighthouse Farms, a network that's describes its members as farms \"that have found radical solutions to address sustainability challenges\" and \"are already in 2050 in terms of providing sustainably produced food and ecosystem services\".</p><p>Netterville Manor, which Devenish purchased about three years after Dowth Hall, was used as a research centre and previously as a family home. Dowth Hall, which has superb architecture, dimensions and impressive plasterwork, needs restoration but the Brennan family began that journey over the past decade. The roof was repaired and it took five years to dry the property out, so it is now protected from water damage and all dry rot has been treated. In addition, the family undertook extensive research, groundwork and guidance with heritage architects into what needs to be done to fully restore the house - especially the striking plasterwork, which is attributed to stuccodore Robert West. Permission was granted until 2027 to fully renovate the property and stables.</p><p>There are a few options for intended purchasers of the estates. If it is bought in one lot, to include Dowth Hall, Netterville Manor and 552 acres for EUR 10 million, new owners could stay at Netterville during the restoration of Dowth Hall. Dowth Hall, with seven bedrooms extending to 970sq m (10,440sq ft) on 368 acres, is listed at EUR 6 million, while Netterville Manor on 100 acres is listed at EUR 2.85 million. There is also an 84-acre farm across the road for EUR 1.25 million.</p><p>It's quite the property, and the lands include about a quarter of the world heritage site and three significant monuments of the 50 or so between Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth, according to Stanton. There are also five properties and a lovely old walled garden surrounding Dowth Hall, and the lands here have spectacular views over the Stone Age passage tomb at Newgrange.</p><p>This slice of agricultural history, which has been farmed since the Neolithic era, comes with a 15th-century castle, an impressive Georgian residence and an equally spectacular Victorian manor, and is now on the market through Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.5001556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6826-DVK1-DYS1-00HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 27, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Lighthouses</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTY5N0M5QkJFOEQyNEUyOEEwNzgzRTg5QjU5NUI2OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001000</classCode><className>LAND USE PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

The food part is still important and looking trickier, with yields plateauing and the world population heading for 9 or 10 billion in the next decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Water is important too. Farmers need it to produce food, and they play a big role in its other functions for society - the soil is the first receiver of rainfall and, depending on its condition, can deliver stable supplies of clean drinking water or devastating floods.</p><p>And there is less useful soil every year. Those floods take away precious topsoil infinitely faster than it can be reproduced: 12 million hectares of soil is being degraded annually, equivalent to the area of arable land in Spain.</p><p>Much of the soil we continue to farm is in poor shape, devoid of biology and with poor physical structure and very low organic matter levels.</p><p>If soils are continually degraded, food production will not keep pace with population growth. Bear in mind also that the extra couple of billion people will need housing and infrastructure, and these are normally built on the best land.</p><p>Reversing biodiversity and ecosystem loss is no longer a fringe concern, and farming is seen as both the culprit and the cure. With the guidance, encouragement and regulation of advisors and governments, farming has contributed to these problems.</p><p>So have industry, construction, transport and the general rise in living standards in the Western world.</p><p>Farming as part of the solution is being loudly championed by governments and food businesses, so it looks like help is on the way. For instance, last week Nestl\u00e9 announced details of its plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>Regenerative</p><p>A key element is support for regenerative agriculture: \"The company is already working with over 500,000 farmers and 150, 000 suppliers to support them in implementing regenerative agriculture practices.</p><p>\"Such practices improve soil health and maintain and restore diverse ecosystems. In return, Nestl\u00e9 is offering to reward farmers by purchasing their goods at a premium, buying bigger quantities and co-investing in necessary capital expenditures.\" \"</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is being adopted by farmers in Ireland and across the world and support from markets would be very welcome.</p><p>But before spending the Nestl\u00e9 bounty we should check if the CEO and chairman who made this announcement have been in touch with the Chief Financial Officer, who told a conference in September that the costs of carbon neutrality were material.</p><p>\"Consumers are not going to pay for it. Investors and shareholders are not going to pay for it either. What we have to do is really to find efficiencies in our supply chain, efficiencies across the organisation in order to be able to finance it.\" \"</p><p>Farmers are the soft underbelly of supply chains, with large numbers of small producers selling to small numbers of large buyers, so I am not encouraged by our place in this hierarchy.</p><p>The contradictions in Nestl\u00e9's statements are not unique to that organisation - 'greenwash' is the term used for companies that talk the talk before they have done the work, or typically got somebody else to do it.</p><p>The EU's Green Deal also has ambitious targets for environmental improvements to be wrung from agriculture. At least 20pc of the new CAP budget will be devoted to eco-schemes, but this money will come from the existing budget.</p><p>It is a tax on farmers which they can reclaim by taking environmental actions.</p><p>If hand-wringing is the best that consumers, industry and government can do to protect the environment, the responsibility falls back on farmers.</p><p>Farmers cannot rebuild degraded soils while effectively being taxed for doing it. The short-term financial constraints of farming are not compatible with long-term care of soil and the environment. If farmers cannot afford to do this on their own, can society afford not to contribute to it?

Cow type at Newford differs from the norm, comprising mainly first-cross early maturing Angus/Hereford cows, bred from the dairy herd, for their excellent milk yield potential off grass, to minimise the need for use of bought-in concentrates.</p><p>Dawn Meats chief executive, Niall Browne, explained that progress on key sustainability metrics and regenerative practices has been accelerated in recent years through the range of Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) measures implemented at Newford and data-driven decisions made daily on farm management.</p><p>\"If implemented at scale nationally, these same practices can drive significant improvement in on-farm efficiency and greatly reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions in line with the national climate strategy,\" Mr Browne said.</p><p>Professor Frank O'Mara, director of Teagasc, said the challenge facing cattle farmers is \"significant\" in terms of economic, social and environmental sustainability.</p><p>\"The performance of the Newford suckler herd during the first phase of this joint initiative over the last seven years, has demonstrated what can be achieved in terms of animal performance, profitability and environmental sustainability.</p><p>\"We are delighted to continue this initiative into a second phase,\" he said.</p><p>Bord Bia CEO, Jim O'Toole, added: \"It is encouraging to see the Newford Farm is producing prime beef cattle that meet customer specifications in terms of weight, age and carcass grading, while reducing the carbon footprint of the farm. Recent analysis of Origin Green data shows that beef members have on average, reduced their carbon footprint by 8% since 2014-2016.</p><p>\"Collaborative on-farm initiatives have identified opportunities to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Some weeks previously we had a conversation on life which she concluded with \"it is important to leave the world a better place\".</p><p>Much has changed over my years in agriculture.</p><p>I have gone from promoting land drainage and hedgerow removal, to encouraging rewetting of lands and hedgerow planting.</p><p>In my early years in the advisory services, I would tell farms to use at least 3/4 bags/ac of 10 10 20 if they did not have soil analysis results - at that time sampling was provided free of charge.</p><p>We have progressed from using TCA for grass control to glyphosate. Many new pesticides were developed, approved and approvals withdrawn, often due to environmental concerns.</p><p>Mechanisation has transformed agriculture, leading to a much reduced labour requirement yet farmers struggle to fill those positions.</p><p>Our agricultural production systems have become dependent on fertilisers and pesticides, and while we have a huge range of new systems being promoted, very few people know what they mean.</p><p>Modern crop varieties are totally dependent on high-input systems.</p><p>Can farming be sustainable while we have to import fertilisers? What is regenerative agriculture? Is organic farming capable of feeding the world?</p><p>The primary role of farmers is to produce food, and as food providers they can claim to make the world a better place.</p><p>The current crisis is bringing that sharply into focus. The challenge is to produce that food without adverse impacts on the environment.</p><p>Until farmers are shown impacts they cannot be expected to embrace newer practices. Cashflow projections that do not make provision for environmental costs do nothing to make the world a better place.</p><p>Farmers are being told that farming is causing a deterioration in water quality; yet very few farmers know the water quality in their local rivers and streams.</p><p>Is it too much to expect a notice board on bridges advising of upsteam water quality?</p><p>While farmers are bound by a vast range of regulations in food production, there is little effort put into explaining the impact of not abiding be them.</p><p>How many farmers understand that leaving soil without growing vegetation over the winter will also leave many soil organisms without food? And the reduction in soil organisms will cause a deterioration in soil structure, erosion and a loss of nutrients.</p><p>New entrants into farming and those with smaller holdings are finding it impossible to compete for land to maintain viability.</p><p>The squeezing out of smaller operators is putting huge pressure on rural communities and is having a negative effect on rural environments. Would a system similar to 'affordable housing' be of benefit, whereby landlords would be obliged/incentivised to lease to farmers who cannot compete?</p><p>Another new practice we should embrace is 'Make room for nature' - don't wait for it to become part of yet another regulation.</p><p>Most commercial farms have brought very bit of land they can into production.</p><p>But consider devoting your least productive area to nature - no fertiliser, restricted animal access and no pesticides. Give it a couple of years and see what nature can do with it.</p><p>Let it be part of your \"leaving the world a better place\".</p><p>PJ Phelan is a tillage advisor based in Tipperary; he is a member of the ACA and ITCA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Working with nature: Farmers are being encouraged to leave hedgerows untrimmed, like this whitethornPHOTO: ROGER JONES</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-179254053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65MM-5T31-DYTY-C0VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 7, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Business &amp;

He explains why he is focusing on inventions to help farmers establish clover</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Niall Hurson</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Self-taught engineer Albert O'Neill has been working to solve some of the biggest challenges faced by farmers in Ireland today. His 'slurry tanker induction hopper' has caught the eye of many, with its ability to help farmers to better establish clover on farm and in turn reduce reliance on chemical nitrogen application.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"With the price of nitrogen fertiliser there's an eagerness among farmers to look at alternatives,\" says Albert, who is based on his family farm outside Strabane, Co Tyrone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I invented the slurry tanker induction hopper in 2009 and recently I thought we'll give it a go and market a few.</p><p>\"By putting clover straight into the tank, it's kind of lost. You don't know how much you're putting on in each load.</p><p>\"The hopper goes on the inlet pipe so as you're sucking in the slurry, that's where you mix the clover in. We're looking at a pressurised metre system for umbilical systems where we might be able to use the clover hopper at the outlet point.</p><p>\"The hopper is also ideally suited for applying all sorts of slurry and soil additives, such as humates, biostimulants, molasses, vermicasts and compost teas to enhance soil microbiology, all of which I believe will play a part in a new era in regenerative agriculture.\"</p><p>Albert, who set up a company called , has automatic welding in place in his workshop for the induction hoppers, with a series of batches being made at a time.</p><p>\"So far this year there's 70 made,\" he says. \"We're looking ahead now as it takes so long to get parts ordered, cut and galvanised and bring it all together. You always have to be working two to three months ahead of yourself.\"</p><p>\"We are retailing them for \u00a3210. I've got dealers appointed throughout Ireland to sell them.\"</p><p>Ballyheather's other inventions include the labour-saving 'Tyreshift' which allows farmers to more quickly cover silage pits; and the 'mixing slat lifter' which is not only labour-saving but also aids in safety when agitating slurry on farm.</p><p>Albert left school in 1998 and graduated from Enniskillen Agricultural College in 1999. With no formal engineering education, the fourth-generation farmer credits his skills to getting 'stuck in' with activities on the farm's workshop at an early age.</p><p>\"I was always interested in anything mechanical from a young age,\" he says. \"Engineering was more of a hobby now turned into another business stream. Hobby \"Only really when taking on another farm employee last year have I really found time for engineering. Before it was pretty much just a hobby.</p><p>\"My father and another worker on the farm here were very hands-on here welding when I was younger and I was always watching them and what they were doing.</p><p>\"Because they were good at what they were doing with a wellequipped workshop, I was able to get stuck in.</p><p>\"I have hardly ever put pen to paper on anything. I usually don't start to make anything until I can picture it in my head and then I start to work back from there.\"</p><p>Albert hopes to be able to build his own zero grazer for the farm for around \u00a33,500.</p><p>\"When I left college we were milking 160 cows and I embarked on my own agricultural contracting business on a small scale,\" he says. \"Bit of work here and there: grass raking, round baling straw and hay, and helping out sometimes with other contractors.</p><p>\"It was long hours at the contracting. Profit margins - any contractor will tell you - are slim. It was hard to make a decent profit out of it. We did that for about 10 years and then I decided to concentrate more on the cows and that's when we upped cow numbers to 200.</p><p>\"Contractors do the majority of silage work here now. Machinery is just too expensive. Our policy is just to run good second-hand equipment where the depreciation is already gone.\"</p><p>The farm, just outside the village of Artigarvan, now has a herd of 200 Montb\u00e9liarde Holstein cross cows, and grows around 40ac of crops between spring barley and spring beans.</p><p>Albert farms alongside his parents John and Evelyn and brother Wesley. The family has been supplying milk from their farm to the local Lakeland Dairies creamery for over 120 years.</p><p>Albert is married to Louise and they have two daughters Emma and Grace. Wesley is married to Gemma and they have twin girls Lily and Poppy and a son Alfie.</p><p>\"We own two blocks of land and we rent another two small blocks and altogether we're farming almost 300ac here. There's about 160ac on the milking platform,\" Albert says.</p><p>\"We're in very sandy loam soil here, very fertile and free draining land. The river Foyle runs through the valley from Strabane right up to Derry. The farm ranges from 25-300ft above sea level.</p><p>\"Land price can vary according to quality and location. In general, land rental prices here for grassland could vary from \u00a3150-300/ac ((EURO)170-340/ac).</p><p>\"There's been a few one-offs where it has gone a bit higher than that. Bigger dairy farmers and AD plants are calling the shots.</p><p>\"If more land were to become available we'd put that into crops. We'd utilise those crops for homegrown forage.</p><p>\"We're growing beans - it's a valuable protein source. It's a legume fixing nitrogen and any field in beans needs very little nitrogen for two years. We're following on with winter cereals and reducing our nitrogen use by about 75pc.\"</p><p>The herd is autumn and winter calving and the cows produce on average 9,000L/lactation.</p><p>\"We're about 20 odd years with the Montb\u00e9liard cross. My father went to see them at the Paris show and took a liking to them. He purchased a stock bull from Cork when he came back.\"</p><p>Nowadays it's all AI and sexed semen, Albert explains.</p><p>\"We're getting a good premium for the bull calves, around \u00a3100/hd more than your typical pure-bred Holstein. They're stronger, biggerboned and bigger-framed so they'll hold a bit more flesh.</p><p>\"We calve down at two years old and we're getting an average of five lactations, with a replacement rate of 20pc. With the cross-breeding we see a greater hybrid vigour and the cows are lasting longer in the herd. Optimum \"We work with a nutritionist to get the optimum out of our cows.

It will tackle issues including child labour, enhancing family-farm income and scaling-up regenerative agriculture in cocoa production up to 2030. </p><p>The two countries account for more than 50 per cent of the world's cocoa supplies. Chocolate accounts for around three-quarters of Nestl\u00e9's confectionery business with sales of around 5.2 billion Swiss francs (EUR 5 billion). </p><p>A cash incentive of up to EUR 481 will be paid directly to cocoa-farming households for certain activities such as enrolment of children in school in its first two years, the company said. Thereafter, it will be paid at EUR 240 per family. </p><p>The scheme will also reward agroforestry activities to increase climate resilience, like planting shade trees; and income diversification through for example through growing other crops, raising livestock such as chickens, beekeeping or processing other products like cassava.</p><p>The funding amounts to a trebling of the current annual investment by the world's largest fast moving consumer goods company on transitioning to more sustainable cocoa farming. </p><p>The company said the incentives were on top of premiums Nestl\u00e9 pays for certified cocoa, which is independently audited against the Rainforest Alliance sustainable agriculture standard.</p><p>Cocoa-farming communities face major challenges including widespread rural poverty, increasing climate risks and lack of access to financial services and basic infrastructure like water, healthcare and education. These complex factors heighten risk of child labour on family farms. </p><p>\"Our goal is to have an additional tangible, positive impact on a growing number of cocoa-farming families, especially in areas where poverty is widespread and resources are scarce, and to help close the living income gap they face over time,\" said Nestl\u00e9 chief executive Mark Schneider.</p><p>Payments will be delivered via a secure mobile service transfer to ensure traceability directly from Nestl\u00e9 suppliers to the intended recipient. </p><p>The programme will be expanded for the 1,000 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire farmers who took part in a pilot scheme in 2020 to include 10,000 families in the country, before extending it to Ghana in 2024. Nestl\u00e9 intends to to reach all cocoa-farming families in its global cocoa supply chain by 2030.</p><p>The company says it will introduce a range of products with cocoa sourced from the programme, starting with a selection of KitKat products in 2023.</p><p>\"By increasing traceability at scale, we will help build consumer trust in our products and respond to the growing demand for responsibly and sustainably sourced cocoa,\" said Magdi Batato, executive vice-president and head of operations.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 has more than 70 brands in the Irish market across its range of beverage, confectionery, cereal, food, petcare, dairy and infant nutrition brands. It has an infant formula manufacturing site at Askeaton, Co Limerick, and employs more than 700 people here. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4786803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64MN-MX21-JC8Y-8355-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 27, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>RAINFOREST ALLIANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F8K</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL INCOME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000287</classCode><className>CHILD LABOR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLLL</classCode><className>FOOD SALES &amp;

As we become more aware of the environmental impacts of consumerism (not to mention the impact on our health from all that indulgence, especially those selection boxes!), many of us are becoming more aware of how and where we spend our hard-earned Christmas cash. We still want treats, but not at the expense of the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Time to look local for more nutritious and sustainable options from small Irish producers. Christmas shouldn't cost the earth, for you or the world around you.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farm sustainably</emphasis></h><p>Regenerative agriculture is a term we're going to hear a lot more of in 2023 but you can get ahead of the trend by ordering L\u00fanasa Farm heritage-breed pork and grass-fed beef. A practice that focuses on rebuilding the health of the land and producing nutritious and sustainable food,regenerative farming is an important part of the EU's Farm to Fork Strategy to reach climate change targets. It's something Australian-Irish couple Cass and Nick McCarthy have prioritised on L\u00fanasa Farm.</p><p>Although delayed by the pandemic, the McCarthys and their young son Finn (now joined by baby Isla) moved from Byron Bay last December to establish their own farm outside Quin, Co Clare. They both have a background in food from Australia: former engineer Nick trained as a craft butcher, while Cass is a wholefoods cook and is currently studying for her bachelor's degree in food science and nutrition.In the last 12 months they hit the ground running. They sell first-class meat direct to customers, and their stock-up-the-freezer mixed pork and beef taster box costs  85 + delivery.</p><p>* lunasafarm.ie</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eat seasonally</emphasis></h><p>For anyone who loves cooking seasonal vegetables, Galway-based farmer Kenneth Keavey offers a comprehensive veg box delivery service at Green Earth Organics. All the produce he sells is organic, much of it grown himself and some sourced from other Irish farmers. There is also a certain amount of no-airfreight imported organic fruit and vegetables so he can offer a year-round selection.</p><p>Delivery nationwide (by electric van, where possible) is  4.50 and their 100% Irish farm box ( 28) includes mushrooms, potatoes, leeks, celeriac, and in-season-at-the-moment kale.</p><p>The company's Instagram account (@greenearthorganics1) has plenty of ideas for making the most of their boxes, with tips on storage and healthy recipe inspiration; kale and apple salad, beetroot bourguignon and curried parsnip soup are all posts to save. You can buy gift vouchers or set up a recurring order and their Christmas Day Box ( 43) with all the organic vegetables and herbs for a family can be ordered now for delivery on Christmas week.</p><p>* <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.greenearthorganics.ie\">www.greenearthorganics.ie</url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bake generously</emphasis></h><p>Give a man (or woman!) a loaf of bread and you feed them for a day. Send them on a Riot Rye sourdough course ( 125 for a one-day course) and they'll not only come home with an assortment of bread to be eaten straight away but with enough skills to turn their home kitchen into a mini-bakery.</p><p>The Bakehouse and Bread School in Cloughjordan, CoTipperary, is run by Joe Fitzmaurice and Julie Lockett, with a focus on nutrition, sustainable production methods and access for all. They turn beginners into sourdough devotees and it's a gift that will keep on giving to everyone in the house.</p><p>* For Christmas, they're offering a free banneton (the proving basket that makes you look like a pro) with every baking course place and baking course voucher purchased. Just want to learn to make sourdough at home? Riot Rye also offers free online tutorials aimed at empowering everyone to bake real bread, using basic, accessible kitchen kit such as a pyrex dish and a kilner jar.</p><p>* <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.riotrye.ie\">www.riotrye.ie</url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Love leftovers</emphasis></h><p>When everyone's had their fill of turkey sandwiches, avoid food waste by totally transforming that turkey with Green Saffron's Turkey Delight spice blend ( 3.85). For freshness and flavour, it's hard to beat Arun Kapil's spices and Turkey Delight (also includes coconut milk, tomatoes and limes) has a transformative effect on leftovers. Kapil has his own supply chain, spices sourced ethically and directly from partner farms in India which ensures consistency of supply and quality while guaranteeing farmers' incomes.</p><p>Turkey Delight, Kapil's take on the Tamil vadagam blend of spices from South India, also works well with chicken so it's worth getting a couple of packs as well as for gifting.</p><p>Have a fabulous meal and reduce food waste using responsibly sourced spices: it's a win-win situation.</p><p>* <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.greensaffron.com\">www.greensaffron.com</url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bubbly Christmas</emphasis></h><p>If you're going around to someone's house, ditch the soft drinks and bring Irish-made 'bubbles'. Established by Laura Murphy in 2012 and now based in Gweedore, Co Donegal, SynerChi Kombucha is made by fermenting organic tea with a live culture of yeast and bacteria.

With a focus on nutrient cycling - he sees his farm's soil health as his wealth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pair first began to make radical changes to the business a decade ago, starting their journey to conservation farming and no-till arable farming, following Sam's experiences working on other farms for his placement for his ag science degree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sam prefers to refer to himself as a \"conservation farmer\" rather than using the \"regenerative\" label.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The core principles are very similar to regenerative farming, but the FAO's definition is that conservation farming should include minimum soil disturbance, crop rotation, and retention of crop residues and cover crops.</p><p>It's an approach which fits well with his day job as a New Generation Agriculture agronomist.</p><p>\"People come to us and might, for example, say they want to use less bagged nitrogen fertiliser, so we will look at their farm, and start looking at how they can better use their slurry,\" he said.</p><p>\"They'll often come with very complicated things that they have seen online or heard in a regen podcast, for example.</p><p>\"But in my experience, the best way to start is usually with something really, really simple, and come back in six months and review it, let's see how it went for you... Is it making you money? Is your soil in better condition? And then go forward from there. That's very similar to the approach we take on the farm as well.\"</p><p>Sam's own curiosity about finding better ways to manage his soil was sparked during his university work placement in 2012.</p><p>\"It was an atrocious harvest - there were ruts put in fields - but I ended on a farm that was big into min till and improving soil fertility and the next spring, then, 2013, I came home and the seeds had been planted in my head,\" he said.</p><p>Previously, the Deanes had a very conventional approach to farming - spring barley and sugar beet, being close to the Mallow factory.</p><p>\"We were having conservations down in the field about how we hadn't seen seagulls in a long time. This year, now 10 years on, we're having birds landing on the ground even behind a no-till drill,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are on extremely dry ground and there was water lying on the ground.\" Luckily his father gave him the freedom at a young age to make major decisions and bring in new ideas.</p><p>First of all, he convinced his father to invest in a strip-till drill, realising it would save them money in the long-term.</p><p>\"I'm not allowed to go totally crazy, but he is a big believer of allowing someone to give things a go.</p><p>\"When we bought this, we thought it was the peak and it was where we would stop, then we got involved in cover crop trials with a seed company.\" From there, preserving the soil nutrients has become a cornerstone of the business decision-making process on the farm.</p><p>Today, the pair grow 35 acres of barley, 25 acres of beans, 20 acres of winter linseed, and 17 acres of spring wheat for feed, with mustard, phacelia, oats as cover crops. As crops are grown in a no-till system, he simply drills straight into the old crop's residue. He says the yields have been similar, if not, slightly higher, but without the higher input costs.</p><p>\"If they weren't, we would give up, because it wouldn't matter how much money you'd save, if you're not earning anything, you won't be able to keep going.</p><p>\"Before, we would have been around 2.7 tonnes per acre, we are now pushing closer to three... so it's around a quarter of a tonne extra in the last 10 years, while saving significantly on costs.</p><p>\"Because we adopted conservation agriculture, [cover crops have] now become part of our yearly plan,\" he said. \"We look and go, 'Right, what cover crops are going to go where, and how much will we spend? And how will we get them in?'\" Sam explained, but he added that it has taken time to reap the rewards.</p><p>\"The first couple of years, we didn't see many benefits, but we knew other people were saying it works, so we stuck with it, and now we are really seeing the benefits; I went out yesterday in the rain, and the water is circulating properly through the soil rather than sitting on the surface.</p><p>\"At the moment, we have beans and spring wheat in the ground, we have stubble and dying cover crop everywhere. I'll get out my trowel, and there are seeds germinating below - that's where we are now.</p><p>\"When I walk our farm, I do it with either a trowel or a spade in my hand. Harvest is my time to reflect on what has happened on the farm in the last 12 months - to look at what has happened and to assess things.</p><p>\"Every year, I look and say, 'Wow, my soil has never looked so good'. And then I come back the next year, and I say, 'Nah, last year was nothing. Now, my soil has never looked so good.' And it just keeps going and going like that every year.\" Soil samples are taken every three years on the farm, but this has recently been upped in frequency to every other year.</p><p>\"This comes from having a big, big interest in soil health and improving its fertility. Our fertiliser use is coming down slowly but surely,\" he said. \"A lot of people are trying to make very dramatic cuts this year with the price of fertiliser, but we have been trying to build up the soil fertility to do this gradually and sustainably. For example, we might try cutting fertiliser by 10%, seeing how that works and then trying the same the following year, but if we take it too far we aren't afraid to adjust either.</p><p>\"We haven't quite got to the point where we can take a holiday from P and K, but we have been able to reduce our P and K usage significantly.\" We would have been the kind of people using 18-6-12 to start off spring barley, but now we're using ?????. We can do that because our soil P and K levels seem to be holding steady and they're not going down.\" Sam explained the cover crops were \"mopping up nutrients\" that would be lost off-farm, while the decision to chop straw was helping to sequester carbon and also maintaining the P and K content of soil.</p><p>He tested the practice of chopping on headlands, but when the headlands started performing better.</p><p>The next big challenge he is taking on is working out how to significantly reduce the farm's use of chemicals, focusing instead on growing healthier, more disease and pestresilient plants.</p><p>It's something he believes will become a bigger focus even for conventional farmers in the future, as he expects more regenerative agriculture programmes will be launched in the next few years, bringing renewed focus on modern farming practices.</p><p>\"For me, farmers are part of the solution, if you we have healthy farms, we have healthy rural communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"Soil health is farm health, and that's the rural community's health too.</p><p>\"If farmers don't look after themselves and their farms, how can the rural community thrive, and the same goes for their soil too. It all starts with the soil.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farmer Sam Deane on his farm in Ballymague, Buttevant, Co Cork.</emphasis> Pictures: Dan Linehan</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67V3-VS41-DYRW-V500-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1153\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Farmers' wheat revenue above nitrogen cost has improved 1.5 times from 2020 to 2022. By cutting their kg per ha of nitrogen fertiliser from 221 to 192, wheat growers have kept yield at 9.46t per ha, compared to 9.62t.</p><p>Yara has historically sourced phosphate, potash and ammonia from Russia, and purchases significant volumes of natural gas from Russia for its production in Europe. It has stopped all sourcing from suppliers linked to Russian sanctioned individuals, turning to other global sources in order to keep supplying its customers.</p><p>The company revealed it has received claims for damages from suppliers linked to Russian sanctioned individuals. It has assessed these claims, and made no financial provisions for them. Accounts payables to companies linked to Russian sanctioned individuals amounted to $227m as of March 31, of which $112m was immediately due. But Yara said future settlements will depend on the development of sanction regulations. \"The timing of cash outflow is therefore highly uncertain\".</p><p>Yara's direct investments in Russia and Ukraine are \"limited\".</p><p>As a result of high gas prices (up 378% in Europe in 12 months), Yara curtailed production at several of its European ammonia and urea facilities in early March, but these resumed production when the profitability situation improved.</p><p>In Europe, Yara nitrogen industry deliveries to date in the 2021/22 season are estimated at 17% behind a year earlier. Deliveries were slow in the first quarter, and are likely to end behind last year for the season as a whole.</p><p>In the first quarter, Yara's global crop nutrition deliveries were down 11% compared to 2021, but this slump is highest in Europe, falling 24% from 2.9m to 2.2m tonnes.</p><p>The company says European producers' nitrate stocks are at a low level. Yara's own stocks of finished fertiliser are currently at their second-lowest level since 2018.</p><p>\"Future financial effects of the war are highly uncertain, and cannot be reliably estimated. However, it is likely that future financial effects will be driven by further price volatility for raw materials and end products, and that any estimate will be subject to significant uncertainties,\" a spokesperson said.</p><p>Yara says industry consultant projections show increased global nitrogen capacity growth in 2022, however, the outlook indicates a continued tight market, driven by high grain prices, supply disruptions, and low global inventories.</p><p>Calling for co-ordinated action to create a more resilient global food system, Yara recommended support for planting and harvesting in conflict zones; keeping borders and markets open; logistics to allow free movement of food and agricultural inputs; release of strategic grain stocks, and financial liquidity for low-income countries; support for smallholder farmers to close the yield gap in underdeveloped regions; and increased investment in infrastructure, renewable energy, and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>The company's own response includes a $25m fertiliser donation in co-ordination with the World Food Programme, which is the food-assistance branch of the United Nations; strengthened collaboration across food supply chains; careful monitoring and management of risks in raw material supply and volatile markets with sanctions; and free digital tools (AtFarm) for farmers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bags containing ammonia at the fertiliser giant Yara's plant in Le Havre, northern France.
