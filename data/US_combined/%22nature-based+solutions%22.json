The training took place over two days in Kusini Pemba region and two days in Kaskazini Pemba region, followed by a dedicated day focused on establishing a Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) network at the seascape level.</p><p>The Tanga-Pemba Seascape is home to ecologically rich coastal and marine ecosystems that sustain the livelihoods of thousands of coastal community members. However, these ecosystems face increasing threats from overexploitation, habitat degradation, climate change, and limited participation of marginalized groups in governance and decision-making processes. To respond to these challenges, the ReSea project has invested in strengthening community-based governance structures, particularly Beach Management Units (BMUs) and Shehia Fisheries Committees (SFCs), making them more inclusive and integrating Nature-based Solutions (NbS) into the governance and management of marine ecosystems.</p><p>The training adopted diverse, participatory approaches to ensure that the voices, experiences, and engagement of women and youth were central to the process. Beyond conventional training, it included, dialogues and real-life experience sharing, practical sessions such as deep diving for coral reef inspections used in training on coral reef restoration. Mangrove training covering species identification, their ecological roles, nursery development to transplanting. While creative methods like songs to inspire women to speak up, a \u201cpower walk\u201d exercise to trigger dialogue on gender dynamics in marine governance, and peer learning were not left out.</p><p>RESEA PROJECTGlory Mbia from WFTT conducting a 'power ralk' on a session during the workshop in Shidi, Mkoani district, Kusini Pemba region.</p><p>As a result of the four -day in-situ sessions, significant positive shifts in men \u2019 s perceptions towards women \u2019 s participation in LMMA governance were observed. Notably, new male champions emerged, including officials from the Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries (MoBEF). For instance, Shafii, Manager from Pemba Channel Conservation Areas (PECCA), independently initiated discussions during recap sessions on addressing gender-based violence in marine spaces and on ways women could recruit their husbands as male champions for women \u2019 s rights. These conversations empowered women participants to speak more confidently and sparked lively debates in both North and South Pemba in-situ trainings.</p><p>Additionally, LMMA practitioners enhanced their knowledge on the importance of expanding conservation areas, steps in initiating new conservation areas, different types of management measures, the role and types of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), technical skills in coral reef restoration and mangrove restoration and the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NbS.</p><p>RESEA PROJECTOne of the workshop facilitators, Mr Iswalala Pagu from the WCS, demonstrating to participants how to identify climatic impacts on coral reefs and its management during the workshop while at Shidi fisheries committee conservation site.</p><p>On the third day, the project facilitated the establishment of the Pemba LMMA Forum, which brought together 92 LMMA practitioners from 54 SFCs. Together, they formed the Pemba LMMA Network, elected eight leaders, and jointly developed the Forum \u2019 s Terms of Reference (ToR) and an action roadmap. The process was deliberately participatory to ensure ownership by both the Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries and the 54 SFCs, rather than by the ReSea project itself. Going forward, the will oversee and operationalise the network in collaboration with stakeholders, including the WCS and Mwambao, who actively participated in this process.</p><p>The in-situ training successfully strengthened inclusive governance and promoted Nature-based Solutions for climate adaptation in the Tanga-Pemba Seascape.

As a result of the four -day in-situ sessions, significant positive shifts in men \u2019 s perceptions towards women \u2019 s participation in LMMA governance were observed. Notably, new male champions emerged, including officials from the Ministry of Blue Economy and Fisheries (MoBEF). For instance, Shafii, Manager from Pemba Channel Conservation Areas (PECCA), independently initiated discussions during recap sessions on addressing gender-based violence in marine spaces and on ways women could recruit their husbands as male champions for women \u2019 s rights. These conversations empowered women participants to speak more confidently and sparked lively debates in both North and South Pemba in-situ trainings. Additionally, LMMA practitioners enhanced their knowledge on the importance of expanding conservation areas, steps in initiating new conservation areas, different types of management measures, the role and types of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), technical skills in coral reef restoration and mangrove restoration and the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NbS.

While all groups identified unfamiliarity with NbS as a key challenge, Coastal Engineers and Coastal Engineering Scientists had more design-focused views about NbS challenges (e.g. risk, technical guidelines and data deficits) and solutions (e.g. hybrid solutions). In contrast, Ecologists and Project Managers typically had more implementation-focused challenges (e.g. cost/lack of funding) and opportunity-driven solutions (e.g. community acceptance and education).

New hydrological insights for the region: The findings reveal that NBS are increasingly recognized as effective tools for managing urban stormwater and improving flood resilience. However, there is a significant gap between research and practice, with many municipalities still in the pilot project phase. Challenges include lack of region-specific design guidelines, especially for cold climates, and insufficient long-term performance and monitoring data.

Strict measures have also been established to protect the habitat of the endangered black-eared lark.<br/>This initiative foresees the planting of native species, such as junipers and holm oaks, together with Atlas cedars, a species catalogued as non-native but of which fossil remains have been found in the Iberian forests coinciding with the thermal optimum of the Middle Holocene.<br/>The main objective of the project is the creation of a mixed forest mass that will act as a carbon sink.

This avoids the use of heavy machinery such as bulldozers and minimizes the impact on the soil structure and existing vegetation.<br/>This type of afforestation solution, with long-term sustained management, as in the case of this project, prevents and mitigates fires and floods.<br/>The project includes the planting of a mixed forest mass on several plots of land in polygon 3 of Carrascosa de Abajo, currently catalogued as shrub pasture with isolated holm oaks and junipers.<br/>One of the keys to the Las Lomas Live 1 and 2 project is the combination of native species together with Atlas cedar, with an initial density of 1,283 trees per hectare.<br/>The selected species are:<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Atlas cedar</emphasis> (Cedrus atlantica): between 33% and 42%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hackberry (</emphasis> Celtis australis): 33%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sabina albar</emphasis> (Juniperus thurifera): 16%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holm oak</emphasis> (Quercus ilex): 9%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salgar pine</emphasis> (Pinus nigra subsp.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">salzmanni</emphasis> ): up to 9%.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The protection of the European meadowlark, a key factor in the permitting process</emphasis><br/>The Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti), one of the most elusive and difficult to observe birds in Europe, finds in the moors of southern Soria one of its last natural refuges in the Iberian Peninsula. Municipalities such as Carrascosa de Abajo, Retortillo de Soria, Layna or Barahona are home to steppe habitats of low scrubland where this species of fluting song and mimetic plumage still survives, despite its alarming decline. With only 4,700 specimens estimated for the entire continent, the Soria population represents a key nucleus for its conservation. The loss of habitat caused by intensive agriculture, infrastructure and fragmentation of the territory has drastically reduced its presence in other regions, such as eastern Andalusia.<br/>Precisely, one of the most important points of the project is its proximity to areas of habitat of the Eurasian Meadowlark. To guarantee its conservation, a total of 7.6 hectares have been excluded from the plantation, where buffer zones will be created and protection strips will be established in the areas adjacent to the bird's habitat. On the slopes, a first 15-meter strip will be created where only shrubs can be planted, and another 15-meter strip for native low-growing species, such as holm oaks and junipers. Likewise, work in areas close to the habitat of the scarlet lark will not be carried out during its breeding season, between April and June.<br/>The Atlas cedar, a tree of Paleo-Autochthonous origin, stands out for its high carbon sequestration capacity.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Atlas cedar, the great carbon sequestrator of Paleo-Autochthonous origin</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Silviproject</emphasis> has studied in depth the possible species that are adapted to the Iberian Peninsula and to climate change. The Atlas cedar belongs to the Mediterranean mountain conifers and is distributed in North Africa (Morocco and Algeria).<br/>During the climatic optimum of the Middle Holocene - a particularly temperate stage that took place between 5050 and 3050 B.C. approximately - the last native presence of the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) in the Iberian Peninsula is documented. According to a study published in the journal Ecosistemas by Alba-S\u00e1nchez and her team (2018), fossil pollen analyses indicate that this species, now extinct in the wild in the region, survived in mountain refuges in the southern peninsular until around 3050 BC. Thereafter, its presence declined drastically, probably due to increased aridity and the impact of human activities.<br/>In terms of climate mitigation, its high carbon sequestration capacity stands out, with up to 3.4 tons of CO2 per foot in 40 years according to Miteco data, which places it among the most efficient forest species in terms of carbon assimilation, but without causing the negative environmental impacts associated with other species efficient in the same matter.<br/>Its ecological security has been validated by data on controlled regeneration, non-invasiveness and absence of legal conflicts, being a species not included in risk catalogs or subject to regulatory restrictions. In addition, successful cases of implantation have been documented in Spain, with more than half a century of positive results in the historical repopulations in the mountains of Granada and Madrid, and in multiple regions of Europe such as France, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria, where it has also shown an ecologically stable behavior.<br/>Its use allows moving towards a multifunctional restoration, combining carbon sequestration with soil stabilization, increased water infiltration, habitat provision and ecological connectivity.<br/><br/>+ INFO:<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alba-S\u00e1nchez, F., Abel-Schaad, D., L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1ez, J.

According to news originating from Kenyatta University by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Advocates of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have argued that the approaches are important for addressing the various social and environmental challenges, including adaptation to climate change and biodiversity conservation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has developed eight criteria for identification of Nature-based Solutions: (1) address societal challenges (2) entail landscape scale of intervention (3) biodiversity gain (4) economic viability (5) governance capability (6) equitably balance trade-offs (7) adaptive management, and (8) mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Danida Fellowship Centre. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Kenyatta University: \"Nevertheless, studies have shown that interventions that seek to help people in the frontlines of climate change often fail to provide predictable financing, enable local ownership, and align to the actual conditions of the local communities. To address these challenges, in 2018 more than 20 countries formed a global commission on adaptation, which in 2021 adopted eight guidelines known as Locally Led Adaptation (LLA) principles to guide climate change adaptation efforts by ensuring that local communities are empowered to lead the design, implementation, and decision-making processes for adaptation projects. While NbS offer substantial co-benefits-enhancing biodiversity, supporting livelihoods, and improving water security-their success hinges on effective financing, governance, and local engagement. Sand dams, in particular, have been implemented for decades across arid and semi-arid regions, offering a reliable method of water harvesting and climate adaptation. However, their integration into NbS frameworks and LLA principles remains underexplored. As such, this study sets out to assess how one of the sub-national governments of Kenya (Makueni County) has aligned its implementation of Nature-based Solutions to the principles of LLA. The NbS under consideration is the county's sand dam project, which was instituted to address water scarcity in the face of climate change and inadvertently disaster risk management. To gauge the NbS project's alignment to LLA principles, 43 indicators and measurement metrics were developed based on the eight principles of LLA. Each principle has between 4 and 7 qualitative indicators. Data was collected through focus group discussions with sand dams' projects' committee members, key informant interviews with county and national government officials responsible for water and climate change, and analysis of the sand dams' projects documents. Each indicator was assigned a score of 1 if present and 0 if absent, giving a potential of 43 positive scores or 100 % if the county government scored 1 for all the 43 indicators.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"From indicators assessed, the County Government had a positive score in about 53 %, slightly above average (50 %). It is the view of the authors' that if better governance structures are pegged to the remaining LLA principles, then financing can flow more naturally to the water sector.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Aligning the management of nature-based solutions to locally led adaptation principles: A case study of sand dams in Makueni County, Kenya.

Sand dams, in particular, have been implemented for decades across arid and semi-arid regions, offering a reliable method of water harvesting and climate adaptation. However, their integration into NbS frameworks and LLA principles remains underexplored. As such, this study sets out to assess how one of the sub-national governments of Kenya (Makueni County) has aligned its implementation of Nature-based Solutions to the principles of LLA. The NbS under consideration is the county's sand dam project, which was instituted to address water scarcity in the face of climate change and inadvertently disaster risk management. To gauge the NbS project's alignment to LLA principles, 43 indicators and measurement metrics were developed based on the eight principles of LLA. Each principle has between 4 and 7 qualitative indicators. Data was collected through focus group discussions with sand dams' projects' committee members, key informant interviews with county and national government officials responsible for water and climate change, and analysis of the sand dams' projects documents. Each indicator was assigned a score of 1 if present and 0 if absent, giving a potential of 43 positive scores or 100 % if the county government scored 1 for all the 43 indicators.", "Each principle has between 4 and 7 qualitative indicators.

Microclimate data was collected at four locations featuring distinct vegetation coverage: a large lawn area without trees (Lawn), a parking plot with no greening (Parking), a greenery area with sparsely distributed trees (Tree), and a forested area with 100 % tree coverage (Forest). Models-including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks-were trained on local climate data, with LSTM demonstrating superior accuracy. Four GW scenarios aligned with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways for 2050 and 2090 were examined. Results show that the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at the Parking plot could increase from about 27 degrees C under GW1.0 to 31 degrees C under GW3.5. Low health risk (UTCI &gt; 26 degrees C) is projected to rise at all sites, while dense tree coverage effectively prevents extremely high-risk conditions (UTCI &gt; 38.9 degrees C).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These findings underscore the importance of urban greening in mitigating severe thermal stress and enhancing outdoor comfort under future climates.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Predicting Long-term Urban Overheating and Their Mitigations From Nature Based Solutions Using Machine Learning and Field Measurements.

According to news reporting from Bari, Italy, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"To address the challenges linked to climate change, rapidly increasing urbanization, and food security necessity, this study explores the potential of smart, low-cost innovative cultivation systems for modules on facades as nature-based solutions (NBSs) to improve building energy efficiency, urban food production, and sustainability. Innovative cultivation systems were studied and implemented in the horizontal experimental setup, with a focus on sub-irrigation techniques with terracotta pots, ozonated water, and IoT use. Financial supporters for this research include POC PUGLIA FESR-FSE 2014/2020-Riparti, POC PUGLIA FESR-FSE. The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Construction Technology Institute, \"The best eco-smart irrigation system was selected considering both plant growth and the water savings obtained (up to 57. 14%) in comparison to the traditional method. With the implementation of this system, a vertical green module (VGM) was designed, allowing for efficient distribution and water savings.", "14%) in comparison to the traditional method. With the implementation of this system, a vertical green module (VGM) was designed, allowing for efficient distribution and water savings. The positive effects in terms of temperature reduction and energy behavior were validated by comparing two office rooms: one without VGM and the other with VGM in a Mediterranean city. The drop in internal temperatures achieved was up to 3-4 degrees C during the hot days of the experimental campaign. According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The uptake of this low-cost and smart prototype can be useful to support the enhancement of energy-efficient, eco-sustainable, and self-sufficient buildings and urban spaces, contributing to creating more climate-resilient cities and promoting sustainable urban agriculture.

According to news reporting originating in Aarhus, Denmark, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Biological invasions threaten biodiversity and human well-being, making invasive species management a global necessity. Despite substantial investments in engineering-based management approaches, preventing invasions is becoming harder with rising species introductions.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Villum Fonden, Danmarks Grundforskningsfond, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Aarhus University, \"Additionally, widespread use of a few control methods raises ethical concerns, demands long-term human control over natural ecosystems and risks unintended socio-ecological impacts. Hence, there is a growing interest in alternatives that strengthen ecological processes to control invasions, aiming to enhance ecological autonomy while reducing dependence on intensive human control. Nature-based solutions (NbS) for biological invasions coupled with the Resist-Accept-Direct/Adapt (RAD+) framework offer a promising alternative. Here, we define NbS for biological invasions as 'measures developed to strengthen ecological processes that control biological invasions and their undesirable impacts, enhancing long-term ecological autonomy, resilience, and human well-being, with the potential to scale through ecological and social feedback'. NbS for biological invasions are context-specific, bottom-up and require flexibility for objective application. To guide their contextual implementation, we reconceptualize the RAD+ framework, allowing stakeholders to either resist invasion by strengthening ecological processes that limit invasive species, accept invasions and direct mixed-species communities towards a state with native species dominance, or accept invaded ecosystems and assist societal adaptation to mitigate negative impacts. By reviewing global case studies, we highlight the scalability of NbS across spatiotemporal contexts. These solutions strengthen ecological processes that control invasive species, support native biodiversity and contribute to climate change mitigation, while benefiting and empowering Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. By limiting intensive human control of ecosystems, NbS for biological invasions help address ethical dilemmas associated with lethal and pervasive management practices. Synthesis and applications: Integrating NbS for biological invasions into policies and research using the RAD+ framework can reduce the negative outcomes of human interventions in ecosystems, strengthen ecological autonomy and pave the way for sustainable and socially just approaches to invasive species management.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog. Las invasiones biol &amp; oacute;gicas amenazan la biodiversidad y el bienestar humano, convirtiendo la gesti &amp; oacute;n de estas en una necesidad global. A pesar de las inversiones sustanciales en soluciones de car &amp; aacute;cter ingenieril, prevenir la prevenci &amp; oacute;n resulta cada vez m &amp; aacute;s compleja debido al incremento continuo de introducciones de especies. Adem &amp; aacute;s, los m &amp; eacute;todos de control tradicionales plantean dilemas &amp; eacute;ticos, exigen un mantenimiento humano permanente sobre los ecosistemas y pueden desencadenar consecuencias socioecol &amp; oacute;gicas no deseadas. En este contexto, surge la necesidad urgente de explorar estrategias que, en lugar de imponerse de forma externa, refuercen los mecanismos intr &amp; iacute;nsecos de autorregulaci &amp; oacute;n del ecosistema, incrementen la autonom &amp; iacute;a ecol &amp; oacute;gica y minimicen la dependencia de intervenciones humanas intensivas. Las Soluciones Basadas en la Naturaleza (SbN) para las invasiones biol &amp; oacute;gicas, junto con el marco Resistir-Aceptar-Dirigir/Adaptar (RAD+), ofrecen un paradigma prometedor. Para las invasiones biol &amp; oacute;gicas, definimos las SbN como 'el conjunto de medidas dise &amp; ntilde;adas para potenciar los procesos ecol &amp; oacute;gicos que regulan las especies invasoras y mitigar sus impactos indeseables, con el doble objetivo de reforzar la autonom &amp; iacute;a y la resiliencia del ecosistema a largo plazo y de mejorar el bienestar humano, posibilitando su escalado mediante realimentaciones tanto ecol &amp; oacute;gicas como sociales'. Dada la heterogeneidad de ecosistemas y contextos socioecol &amp; oacute;gicos, las SbN requieren un dise &amp; ntilde;o y aplicaci &amp; oacute;n 'de abajo hacia arriba' que sea flexible y a la vez riguroso. Para orientar este proceso, reconceptualizamos el marco RAD+ de manera que la invasi &amp; oacute;nes biological puededn ser resistidas fortaleciendo los procesos ecol &amp; oacute;gicos que limitan las especies invasoras, aceptar invasiones y dirigir las comunidades de especies mixtas hacia un estado con dominancia de especies nativas, o aceptar ecosistemas invadidos y ayudar a la adaptaci &amp; oacute;n societal para mitigar los impactos negativos.

Despite substantial investments in engineering-based management approaches, preventing invasions is becoming harder with rising species introductions. Funders for this research include Villum Fonden, Danmarks Grundforskningsfond, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst. The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Aarhus University, \"Additionally, widespread use of a few control methods raises ethical concerns, demands long-term human control over natural ecosystems and risks unintended socio-ecological impacts. Hence, there is a growing interest in alternatives that strengthen ecological processes to control invasions, aiming to enhance ecological autonomy while reducing dependence on intensive human control. Nature-based solutions (NbS) for biological invasions coupled with the Resist-Accept-Direct/Adapt (RAD+) framework offer a promising alternative. Here, we define NbS for biological invasions as 'measures developed to strengthen ecological processes that control biological invasions and their undesirable impacts, enhancing long-term ecological autonomy, resilience, and human well-being, with the potential to scale through ecological and social feedback'. NbS for biological invasions are context-specific, bottom-up and require flexibility for objective application. To guide their contextual implementation, we reconceptualize the RAD+ framework, allowing stakeholders to either resist invasion by strengthening ecological processes that limit invasive species, accept invasions and direct mixed-species communities towards a state with native species dominance, or accept invaded ecosystems and assist societal adaptation to mitigate negative impacts. By reviewing global case studies, we highlight the scalability of NbS across spatiotemporal contexts. These solutions strengthen ecological processes that control invasive species, support native biodiversity and contribute to climate change mitigation, while benefiting and empowering Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.", "Para orientar este proceso, reconceptualizamos el marco RAD+ de manera que la invasi &amp; oacute;nes biological puededn ser resistidas fortaleciendo los procesos ecol &amp; oacute;gicos que limitan las especies invasoras, aceptar invasiones y dirigir las comunidades de especies mixtas hacia un estado con dominancia de especies nativas, o aceptar ecosistemas invadidos y ayudar a la adaptaci &amp; oacute;n societal para mitigar los impactos negativos.

This ten-year plan envisioned several new infrastructural interventions including the construction of more embankments, dikes, spurs, retaining walls and diversion channels. This plan also identified the need to improve the largely neglected national drainage infrastructure. Many of these ambitious plans, however, remained confined to paper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The massive devastation caused by the 2022 floods again prodded policymakers to reiterate the need for Integrated Flood Risk Management, which proposed pursuing a blend of 'hard' infrastructure and more nature-based solutions to minimise flood damages. Yet, the lack of attention paid to implementing such a holistic strategy was again evident given the havoc wreaked by the current monsoonal floods.</p><p>It is time for our policy planners and implementers to take the need for flood mitigation more seriously. Nature-based solutions merit particular attention as they offer the possibility of bolstering flood resilience without requiring a lot of capital, which is often secured via taking on more foreign loans. Pakistan already has some flood diversion and storage infrastructure in the form of barrages and canals, but these structures are heavily geared towards enabling irrigation rather than flood absorption. Varied experts have recommended building more flood retention reservoirs and reviving natural floodplains to ecologically manage the increasing intensity of climate charged monsoonal floods.</p><p>Attention has also been drawn to the possibility of channeling floodwater into ponds, wetlands or artificial lakes. 'Floodwater harvesting' or 'managed flood retention' can reduce peak flows downstream, thus lowering the risk of destructive floods. This stored water can then percolate down to aquifers via recharge basins to replenish depleted groundwater reserves and be pumped out for use during dry months. These are not merely theoretical suggestions.</p><p>Adelaide in Australia has created many recharge basins. Pakistan now seems poised to do the same via the 'Recharge Pakistan' initiative, which finally began its implementation phase last year. One major activity of this initiative is to create recharge basins and retention areas across DI Khan, Ramak, Manchar and Chakar Lehri watersheds. Lessons learnt from these efforts must be used to create replicable retention models which can be scaled up significantly to curb flooding.</p><p>Major rivers like the Indus carry enormous flood volumes, so creating a small number of small ponds or other retention areas will not be enough. Floodwater is also silt-laden, so ponds and artificial lakes will also silt up quickly and thus need regular maintenance.

This ten-year plan envisioned several new infrastructural interventions including the construction of more embankments, dikes, spurs, retaining walls and diversion channels. This plan also identified the need to improve the largely neglected national drainage infrastructure. Many of these ambitious plans, however, remained confined to paper. The massive devastation caused by the 2022 floods again prodded policymakers to reiterate the need for Integrated Flood Risk Management, which proposed pursuing a blend of 'hard' infrastructure and more nature-based solutions to minimise flood damages. Yet, the lack of attention paid to implementing such a holistic strategy was again evident given the havoc wreaked by the current monsoonal floods. It is time for our policy planners and implementers to take the need for flood mitigation more seriously. Nature-based solutions merit particular attention as they offer the possibility of bolstering flood resilience without requiring a lot of capital, which is often secured via taking on more foreign loans. Pakistan already has some flood diversion and storage infrastructure in the form of barrages and canals, but these structures are heavily geared towards enabling irrigation rather than flood absorption. Varied experts have recommended building more flood retention reservoirs and reviving natural floodplains to ecologically manage the increasing intensity of climate charged monsoonal floods.", "This plan also identified the need to improve the largely neglected national drainage infrastructure.

Varied experts have recommended building more flood retention reservoirs and reviving natural floodplains to ecologically manage the increasing intensity of climate charged monsoonal floods. Attention has also been drawn to the possibility of channeling floodwater into ponds, wetlands or artificial lakes. 'Floodwater harvesting' or 'managed flood retention' can reduce peak flows downstream, thus lowering the risk of destructive floods. This stored water can then percolate down to aquifers via recharge basins to replenish depleted groundwater reserves and be pumped out for use during dry months.", "One major activity of this initiative is to create recharge basins and retention areas across DI Khan, Ramak, Manchar and Chakar Lehri watersheds. Lessons learnt from these efforts must be used to create replicable retention models which can be scaled up significantly to curb flooding. Major rivers like the Indus carry enormous flood volumes, so creating a small number of small ponds or other retention areas will not be enough. Floodwater is also silt-laden, so ponds and artificial lakes will also silt up quickly and thus need regular maintenance. Also, creating new flood retention areas may require resettlement of communities, which is always a contentious process. However, these are not insurmountable problems, and adopting such nature-based solutions is much less damaging and disruptive than creating more concrete-laden dams or barrages.

According to news originating from Catania, Italy, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are emerging as sustainable alternatives to conventional coastal defences against flooding and erosion. However, modelling applications to assess their efficacy often employ deterministic approaches based on historical storms, seldom incorporating effects of climate change.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from \"VARIO-VAlutazione del Rischio Idraulico in sistemi cOmplessi\" of the University of Catania, Italy. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Catania, \"We argue that assessing coastal NbS performance for current and future scenarios is essential to ensure their long-term efficacy, adaptability, and potential synergies with climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. To this aim, we propose a modelling framework to investigate effectiveness of Nature-based coastal defences to mitigate climate change- driven, storm-induced flooding and erosion. An hydro-morphodynamic modelling chain (SWAN and XBeach) is setup to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions - a dune revegetation and a seagrass meadow reconstruction - in reducing coastal inundation and shoreline retreat. The study investigates present and future what-if scenarios, by simulating storm conditions based on present, 4.5, and 8.5 W/m2 radiative forcing scenarios. Dissipative effects of vegetation are modelled by providing their characteristics and spatial distribution through habitat maps.

Water has been sustainably managed here and related societal challenges successfully met through the use of nature, natural systems, or natural processes within rural as well as urban settings. However, despite the merits, in recent times, many of the old NBSs have come to be neglected and degraded, being increasingly replaced by gray infrastructure.", "However, despite the merits, in recent times, many of the old NBSs have come to be neglected and degraded, being increasingly replaced by gray infrastructure. These changes are deepening the water crisis in the country, with the rapidly transforming peri-urban locations being an important area of concern. This paper outlines some of the major NBS forms traditionally established and used in different parts of India. Thereafter, using an integrated analytical framework for assessing sustainability of NBS (developed under project NATWIP), the value of the NBS legacy in India will be analyzed. According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Finally, the paper proposes important lessons as a way forward for enhancing water sustainability in peri-urban India that is based on the adoption and rejuvenation of the disappearing NBS science in the country.

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Advances in modeling and monitoring technologies are facilitating the effective design and implementation of leaky dam networks, promoting their incorporation into comprehensive watershed management frameworks. This review highlights the significant potential of leaky dams as integral components of sustainable flood management systems, advocating for their broader adoption alongside conventional engineering solutions to achieve resilient and ecologically balanced water management.

Currently organic agriculture covers 10.5% of the EU land area, but production and consumption figures vary widely from country to country and from crop to crop.</p><p>In the face of accelerating biodiversity loss, the way we produce food has never been more critical. Agricultural systems are widely recognized as the single largest driver of biodiversity decline globally, due to land use change and unsustainable intensification leading to habitat loss, pollution, and soil degradation. As a result, the IUCN Red List consistently highlights agriculture-related pressures as major threats to species across taxa and ecosystems.</p><p>So, as the Summit \u2019 s objective implies, is organic farming the answer? When implemented with ecological integrity and landscape-level ambition, I argue that it offers a credible and scalable solution to restore and/or conserve biodiversity and build resilient food systems.</p><p>What is organic farming?</p><p>Unlike conventional systems, organic agriculture avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, prohibits genetically modified organisms, and supports ecological processes such as natural pest control, nutrient cycling, and pollination. These practices create healthier soils, cleaner water, and more diverse habitats.A meta-analysis by Tuck et al. in 2014 found that organic farms support, on average, 30% more species richness than conventional farms. From pollinators and soil microbes to birds and native plants, organic systems foster a richer tapestry of life.</p><p>Organic farming often also maintains landscape features such as hedgerows, cover crops, and diversified cropping systems which are essential for above- and below-ground biodiversity. Practices such as crop rotation, composting, and reduced tillage enhance soil health and microbial diversity, laying the foundation for resilient ecosystems.</p><p>But we should remember that organic farming is not a silver bullet on its own. It is most beneficial when embedded within broader agroecological and landscape-level strategies.</p><p>Organic agriculture and Nature-based Solutions</p><p>At IUCN we developed, maintain and support the adoption of the Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) which provides a framework for harnessing nature to address societal challenges. Organic agriculture aligns closely with this standard, particularly in biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem measures.</p><p>Organic systems preserve agrobiodiversity, reduce chemical inputs, and promote animal welfare. When combined with biodiverse landscape elements, they support natural pest enemies and reduce the need for chemical control. According to the European Commission (DG AGRI, 2023), organic arable farms save 75 \u2013 100% on plant protection product costs per hectare \u2013 so there are both ecological and economic benefits.</p><p>IUCNConference panellist Pascale Bonzom, Global Head of the Food and Agricultural Systems team at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, looks at the ecological arguments for broader adoption of organic agriculture.</p><p>How can organic farming be even better for biodiversity?Organic farming must aim for landscape-level outcomes. Ecological processes and species conservation operate at scales larger than a single farm, and organic farmers are really keen to understand the outcomes they contribute to at farm level and beyond, as well as to manage landscape level issues that they face.</p><p>Organic farms can serve as biodiversity refuges, but without connecting ecological corridors their contribution to species movement is limited. Neighbouring conventional farms cause pesticide drift and water pollution, undermining the gains of organic farming. A coordinated landscape approach through multistakeholder landscape partnerships and processes helps amplify benefits and minimize negative crossovers.</p><p>Organic agriculture also works best alongside other regenerative practices. Agroecology, agroforestry, and generally diversified landscapes are vital to making organic truly regenerative.The key message is clear: to benefit biodiversity, organic schemes must be ambitious, outcomes-based, and context-specific.</p><p>A foundation, not the ceiling</p><p>Organic agriculture is a necessary foundation of what sustainable food systems must become, but it cannot be the ceiling. While it represents a meaningful shift away from input-intensive conventional farming, not all organic systems are created equal. The diversity within organic production standards is vast, ranging from highly diversified agroecological farms to large-scale monocultures that meet certification criteria but offer limited biodiversity benefits.</p><p>As part of IUCN \u2019 s Vision for a just world that values and conserves nature, transforming food and agricultural systems is one of eight critical global shifts. Organic farming should be seen as a tool, not an end in itself\u2014for regenerating ecosystems and supporting species conservation.</p><p>The Copenhagen summit represented a timely opportunity to recognize organic agriculture \u2019 s potential as a driver of system transformation. But its success depends on integration into broader policies, landscape-scale strategies, incentives based on measurable outcomes, and socially inclusive approaches that are locally adapted and biodiversity-positive. Taking that approach, organic farming can be the cornerstone for a biodiversity-based agricultural future.</p><p>As I said in my conclusion at the Summit:</p><p>Clearly organic farming is part of the solution to the interlinked climate, biodiversity and pollution crisis and contributes to many other positive environmental and social results, alongside delivering nutritious food and improved livelihoods. Even more value could be derived from organic farming if we align it as much as possible with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions.</p>", "publisher": "Impact News Service", "instances": ["From pollinators and soil microbes to birds and native plants, organic systems foster a richer tapestry of life.

These approaches harness ecosystems to absorb stormwater, cool heat islands, purify air and deliver a host of social, environmental and economic benefits. Instead of relying solely on concrete drains, roads, walls or cooling towers, nature-based solutions offer multifunctional, adaptable replacements that protect people while enhancing urban life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Flood mitigation is one of the strongest examples. Through sponge city principles, such as permeable pavements, restored wetlands and bioswales, rainwater can be absorbed and stored, reducing peak excess and preventing catastrophic floods. Cities such as Sanya in China, Vienna in Austria and Leeds in the UK are already proving how these designs reduce disaster risks while doubling as recreational spaces. Likewise, urban greening has been shown to dramatically reduce heat. Studies confirm that trees can cut ambient urban temperatures by as much as 15 C, making them a natural defence against deadly heatwaves. Green rooftops in Valencia and stormwater parks in Bangkok soak up heavy rainwater, offering fresh air and public gathering areas and showing that resilience and liveability can go hand in hand.</p><p>Globally, there are striking examples of cities reshaped by nature-based solutions. In Bangkok, the Benjakitti Forest Park transformed a contaminated brownfield into a sponge park capable of storing 187,500 cubic metres of stormwater. Even during heavy rain, nearby localities experienced flooding, whereas the park remained dry and functional. Singapore, long recognised for its 'City in a Garden' vision, has knitted tree-lined streets, lush corridors and urban forests into its development fabric. The Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park project replaced barren concrete canal walls with a naturalised river, improving flood management, although welcoming dragonflies, otters and hornbills back into the city's heart.</p><p>Cape Town, facing the frightening prospect of 'Day Zero' in 2018, turned to watershed restoration. By eliminating hostile trees that consumed nearly 55 billion litres of water annually, the city improved downstream flows, increased biodiversity and created local jobs. In Turkey, the city of Izmir has integrated vertical gardens, green roofs, rainwater capture systems and smart irrigation into its planning, revealing how citizen co-design can bring both resilience and community dignity.</p><p>In Africa, Durban's Buffelsdraai Reforestation Project has transformed more than 580 hectares around a landfill into an indigenous forest, creating a natural barrier against fire, odour and erosion, while amplifying as a centre for environmental education. In South America, Curitiba's Caximba initiative has reimagined flood-prone informal settlements by combining affordable housing with urban agriculture, community centres and solar-powered infrastructure.</p><p>And in Nairobi's Kibera settlement, one of Africa's largest informal urban neighbourhoods, community groups have restored riverbanks with vegetation to reduce flooding and improve water quality, showing that even the poorest and most exposed areas can benefit from nature-driven resilience. Buenos Aires' Villa 20 neighbourhood is another example, where permeable pavements, hydroponic gardens and green corridors now manage stormwater, improving local living conditions.</p><p>Global institutes are progressively recognising the economic and social value of these projects. According to the World Bank, between 2012 and 2024, it backed 250 nature-based initiatives focused on resilience, coastal protection and ecosystem restoration. Completed projects have already benefited 9.5 million people and restored 1.1 million hectares of land, while ongoing efforts are expected to reach nearly 20 million people and 3.5 million hectares. The numbers are more than impressive; they are proof that green infrastructure can compete with and harmonise traditional engineering. In Beira, Mozambique, mangroves and urban parks protected 50,000 inhabitants from storm surges. In Buenos Aires, a retention basin project reduced flooding risks for three million people. In Sri Lanka, an urban wetland spanning 20 square kilometres now preserves 280 species while storing carbon and cooling its surrounding neighbourhoods.</p><p>In Pakistan, where over 36 per cent of the population already lives in cities and urbanisation is accelerating at a swift pace, these lessons are both timely and urgent. Karachi has experienced devastating urban flooding due to encroachment on nullahs and inadequate drainage. Lahore is gradually becoming a heat island with record-breaking summer temperatures. Islamabad faces urban extension in flood-prone zones, while Gwadar and Thatta lie vulnerable to rising seas and cyclones. The National Adaptation Plan 2023 classifies urban resilience as a priority; however, implementation will demand more than policy. It requires investment, innovation and community engagement.</p><p>The roadmap is clear-cut. Pakistani cities can pilot sponge-city projects by reviving stormwater nullahs, designing wetlands, creating floodable parks and promoting permeable streets. Municipalities should introduce incentives for green roofs and reflective building materials to counter urban heat. Reforestation belts like Durban's model could surround landfills, while coastal mangrove restoration could shield Karachi and Gwadar. Most importantly, communities must be placed at the centre of these efforts, ensuring that informal settlements and the urban poor - those most at risk - are partners rather than additions. Financing, too, must innovate. Green bonds, public-private partnerships and international climate finance can help bridge the gap, while local governments must mainstream NbS into zoning laws and city master plans.</p><p>The lesson from global success stories is simple but thoughtful: resilience is not built by fighting against nature but by working with it. Concrete walls can restrain water for a time, but restored wetlands, urban forests and green corridors last longer, cost less in the long run, and bring life back into our cities.</p><p>In a future of unpredictable floods, scorching heat and water insecurity, the strongest urban fortifications may not be steel and cement, but plants, trees, bushes, roots, leaves and rivers. If Pakistan holds this vision, it can turn its cities from brittle hot spots into green strongholds of resilience.</p>", "publisher": "The News International", "instances": ["As climate change increases the frequency and severity of urban shocks, including floods, heatwaves and water scarcity, cities globally face rising challenges.

It is intended to help the city brace for the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, and include nature-based solutions such as elevated sand dunes, restored coastal habitats and realigned parks and infrastructure. Concept projects at four locations, including three in the Point Loma-OB area, will move forward in the city\u2019s capital improvement program for initial engineering over the next year, funded by federal and state grants, according to the city:\u2022 Ocean Beach Dog Beach and OB oceanfront: Restore dune habitat near Smiley Lagoon and build a new path for pedestrians and cyclists fronted by elevated, vegetated dunes. The path would provide connection between the San Diego River Bikeway and the Ocean Beach Pier. \u2022 Sunset Cliffs: Trail enhancements, new native vegetation, drainage improvements and removal of the paved parking lots from the cliff, plus reconfiguration of a section of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, creating a new separated pedestrian path and making the street a single one-way southbound lane roughly between Guizot and Ladera streets, along with possibly charging drivers to park. \u2022 Tourmaline Surfing Park in Pacific Beach: Bury the existing shoreline protection feature to provide a core layer and top it with sand and native plants. The plan prioritizes a total of six pilot sites based on feasibility, resilience needs and environmental benefits, according to the city.", "A community workshop focused on the sites at Sunset Cliffs and Ocean Beach was held in June 2024. Scott McCaskill, a board member of the Ocean Beach Community Foundation, told the City Council that the plan for Sunset Cliffs \u201cdoes not seem well-thought-out at all. We have received nearly universal condemnation to the idea of installing any paid parking at the cliffs or OB. \u201dJavier Saunders of the Peninsula Community Planning Board also criticized the plan, which he said would push drivers off Sunset Cliffs Boulevard onto less-trafficked streets. \u201cRedirecting traffic through local residential streets will lead to increased traffic safety concerns,\u201d he said. Saunders also said nature-based solutions alone can\u2019t fight sea-level rise effectively at Sunset Cliffs, praising the Army Corps of Engineers for protecting them with more old-fashioned solutions in the 1970s. \u201cWhile natural-based solutions may provide some environmental benefit, they are inadequate on their own to protect public infrastructure and not a viable long-term solution to protect Sunset Cliffs,\u201d Saunders said. Councilwoman Jennifer Campbell, who represents the Ocean Beach/Sunset Cliffs area, emphasized that the projects in the plan are \"conceptual ideas. We are in the trying-to-figure-it-out phase. \u201dCity officials called the projects \u201chigh-level\u201d concept designs that could change significantly after the next steps, which include technical and feasibility studies, cost estimates and additional environmental analysis and community engagement, including workshops in each community where projects are proposed.

These include integrating nature into policies and plans, building technical capacity to develop project pipelines, and diversifying finance.</p><p>While NBS projects are growing, a critical gap remains: relatively few projects were implemented in cities, despite their potential to address urban challenges (though the World Bank and AfDB have recently been supporting more urban projects). Seventy percent of African cities face severe climate risks -- including flooding, extreme heat and mudslides -- while many already struggle with inadequate infrastructure. Additional investment in traditional solutions like dams and engineered drainage is needed, but integrating natural infrastructure, such as restoring and protecting forests in watersheds, can bolster resilience and reduce long-term costs.</p><p>Recognizing this, and to complement NBS investment preparation efforts of the World Bank and AfDB, WRI is launching the Green-Gray Infrastructure Accelerator, an initiative to support 11 cities across sub-Saharan Africa to integrate NBS with traditional \"gray\" infrastructure. The initiative will provide technical, policy and finance support, helping them lay the groundwork for their initial cohort of projects, while connecting others to financiers to scale existing efforts.</p><p>\"We often think of infrastructure in terms of roads, bridges and buildings -- just concrete and steel structures,\" said Ani Dasgupta, President &amp; CEO, World Resources Institute. \"But nature -- forests, trees, wetlands, coral reefs -- is just as vital.

They insisted on just and equitable global transitions that recognize Africa's circumstances, while calling for unity ahead of this year's 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil to amplify the continent's voice in shaping global climate decisions. In his closing remarks, Ethiopian President Taye Atske Selassie described Africa as a continent capable of providing solutions rather than waiting for external aid.

In his closing remarks, Ethiopian President Taye Atske Selassie described Africa as a continent capable of providing solutions rather than waiting for external aid. He emphasized the transformative potential of renewable energy to power communities, drive industrial growth and create livelihoods. Africa is not a victim of a crisis it never created, but a global center for climate solutions and green growth,\" he said, underscoring the continent's ambition to lead by example. Selassie highlighted the importance of nature-based solutions, citing Ethiopia's Green Legacy Initiative as a model for afforestation, watershed rehabilitation and land restoration. The summit reaffirmed support for continental programs such as the African Union Great Green Wall Initiative, demonstrating a shared commitment to turning Africa's vulnerabilities into leadership and reinforcing its role in shaping global climate policy, he said. The declaration, he added, is not a symbolic document but a plan for immediate and measurable action, with the AU's continental dashboard providing oversight to ensure accountability and transparency. Equity and justiceBankole Adeoye, AU commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, said Africa's climate finance approach is grounded in equity and justice. He called for investment that strengthens African communities and aligns with local priorities, rather than imposing external agendas. The climate summit showcased initiatives across the continent \u2014 from urban flood management to community renewable energy projects \u2014 demonstrating how local innovation, collaboration and determination are shaping practical climate solutions."]}, {"relevance_score": 29, "title": "Reports Summarize Sustainability Research Study Results from Beijing Normal University (Harnessing Nature: Evaluating Cost-effective and Globally Sustainable Solutions for Africa's Environmental Resilience)", "published": "2025-08-01", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>2025 JUL 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Economics Daily Report -- Current study results on Sustainability Research have been published.

Growing Resilience: Unlocking the Potential of Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa analyzes nearly 300 projects over the past decade to identify what works, key barriers, and strategies to scale up nature-based solutions (NBS) to promote green, resilient development.</p><p>The report shows a steady increase in the adoption of NBS projects, with the number of new projects initiated growing by an average of 15% annually between 2012 and 2021. These projects -- which include protecting and restoring forests, wetlands, floodplains and coral reefs, often in combination with traditional \"gray\" infrastructure -- are strengthening climate resilience while actively delivering co-benefits like job creation, biodiversity enhancement and social equity.</p><p>While interest in NBS is growing, the report finds that more investment is needed. Between 2012 and 2021, funding for NBS projects in Sub-Saharan Africa increased by 23% annually and raised more than $12 billion. While this is a positive step, the figure pales in comparison to Africa's $100 billion annual infrastructure financing gap.</p><p>\"Nature loss and climate risks are inherently linked, especially here in Africa,\" says Qimiao Fan, World Bank's Country Director for Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia and Uganda. \"We need to ensure that projects and policies comprehensively address the challenges and offer inclusive and effective solutions for the most vulnerable groups.\"</p><p>As climate risks like extreme heat, flooding and water scarcity intensify, Sub-Saharan Africa stands at the frontlines of the global climate crisis, with Kenya's floods and unprecedented heatwaves across the region a stark warning.</p><p>The report highlights several recommendations to increase adoption of NBS in the region. These include integrating nature into policies and plans, building technical capacity to develop project pipelines, and diversifying finance.</p><p>While NBS projects are growing, a critical gap remains: relatively few projects were implemented in cities, despite their potential to address urban challenges (though the World Bank and AfDB have recently been supporting more urban projects). Seventy percent of African cities face severe climate risks -- including flooding, extreme heat and mudslides -- while many already struggle with inadequate infrastructure. Additional investment in traditional solutions like dams and engineered drainage is needed, but integrating natural infrastructure, such as restoring and protecting forests in watersheds, can bolster resilience and reduce long-term costs.</p><p>Recognizing this, and to complement NBS investment preparation efforts of the World Bank and AfDB, WRI is launching the Green-Gray Infrastructure Accelerator, an initiative to support 11 cities across sub-Saharan Africa to integrate NBS with traditional \"gray\" infrastructure. The initiative will provide technical, policy and finance support, helping them lay the groundwork for their initial cohort of projects, while connecting others to financiers to scale existing efforts.</p><p>\"We often think of infrastructure in terms of roads, bridges and buildings -- just concrete and steel structures,\" said Ani Dasgupta, President &amp; CEO, World Resources Institute. \"But nature -- forests, trees, wetlands, coral reefs -- is just as vital. It supplies clean water, protects communities from disasters, and strengthens resilience.

Verra's VCS Program is the world's most widely recognised greenhouse gas crediting standard and is approved by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market.</p><p>Unlike other approaches, nature-based climate solutions deliver immediate impact. Operating across 1.6 million hectares of regenerative agriculture, the AgreenaCarbon Project and its carbon credits have enabled the reduction of 1.2 million tonnes of CO? and removal of 1.1 million tonnes of CO?.</p><p>Mandy Rambharos, the Chief Executive Officer of Verra, commented: \"The AgreenaCarbon Project is extremely important because it demonstrates how soil carbon projects can scale. It spans vast areas of land across multiple countries in Europe - from Ukraine to Spain - showing the breadth and reach of its impact. By implementing VM0042 and ensuring the right protocols, we can guarantee the quality and integrity of the carbon credits generated. This gives us confidence that these projects truly have the ability to scale.\"</p><p>Simon Haldrup, CEO and co-founder of Agreena, added: \"The verification of the AgreenaCarbon Project reaffirms Agreena as a leader in regenerative agriculture, proving that soil carbon sequestration can be measured, verified, and trusted at scale. This milestone empowers farmers - the true climate heroes - to adopt new practices through verified carbon credits, while giving corporate buyers the confidence to invest in meaningful climate action. Agreena is proud to be building the world's largest verified supply of soil carbon credits, bringing the first large-scale wave of high-quality credits to market.\"</p><p>Delivering immediate, scalable impact</p><p>Agreena's impact is directly felt by farmers. As Oleksandr Mustipan, a farmer at Agrain Group of Companies, said: \"Working with Agreena has truly been a game-changer. It enabled us to scale up regenerative practices more quickly and effectively than I ever could have alone. The Verra verification is another clear proof point of the seriousness and credibility of the AgreenaCarbon Project, built on the highest international standards. As a farmer, it's motivating to know that the work we do contributes to real climate impact and is part of a larger, meaningful effort.\"</p><p>The AgreenaCarbon Project, which has enrolled 1.6 million hectares of regeneratively farmed land, partners with farmers in the UK, Denmark, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Spain. By implementing regenerative practices that reduce and remove greenhouse gas emissions, farmers are delivering measurable climate impact and environmental benefits.</p><p>Now verified by Verra and an independent Validation/Verification Body (VVB), Agreena is able to issue Verified Carbon Units that meet the world's most rigorous standards - ensuring the integrity of every credit that will follow.

The declaration commits signatories<br/>to integrated approaches to combat climate impacts on water basins<br/>incorporating water-related measures into national climate<br/>policies,\" the minister added.</p><p>Babayev went on to add that water is the link that flows between<br/>the climate, biodiversity and desertification crisis.</p><p>\"These initiatives reflect the cooperative spirit of the Rio<br/>Trio and align closely with the goals of UNCCD. The Rio Trio<br/>initiative also highlights the need for harmonized data and<br/>knowledge-sharing platforms. By combining metrics from indices,<br/>maps, and national biodiversity strategies, we can simplify<br/>efforts, improve accountability, and base our policies on practical<br/>outcomes. Indigenous and local knowledge must play a central role<br/>in shaping these systems as their wisdom offers invaluable guidance<br/>for sustainable practices.</p><p>Our shared challenges are significant, but they also present<br/>opportunities to innovate and collaborate. By enhancing<br/>cross-convention synergies, we should promote sustainable land use<br/>practices, increase water efficiency through nature-based<br/>solutions, scale restoration efforts to combat land degradation,<br/>foster regional and international cooperation for sustainable<br/>ecosystems. In this spirit, Azerbaijan remains committed to<br/>translating the vision of Rio Trio initiative into tangible<br/>outcomes that benefits both people and the planet,\" he<br/>concluded.</p>", "publisher": "Regional Finance (English)", "instances": ["Today, as we face the challenges of the time, we are remindedof how closely linked our efforts are across the Rio Conventions. Climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation anddesertification are not separate issues. They are deeply connected,demanding integrated and unified responses. We share aresponsibility to align our strategies and create synergy. Integrated frameworks like the Rio Trio initiative represent ourcommitment to close the gaps and fostering solutions that willstrengthen the impact of our individual efforts. Azerbaijanrecognizes the power of nature-based solutions to address theinterlinked challenges of climate change, water shortage, andbiodiversity loss. We have introduced the first marine protectedarea in the Caspian Sea to safeguard critical ecosystem,\" hesaid. Babayev noted that COP29 presidency has been determined to putthe spirit of integration in the heart of its action agenda. We are working to establish connections across different forumsand sectors, recognizing that climate action is a cross-cuttingissue. The prime example of our approach is the COP29 initiative onwater. Water is essential to addressing land degradation anddesertification."]}, {"relevance_score": 12, "title": "Multilateral development banks hit record $137 billion in climate finance last year", "published": "2025-09-10", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">LUXEMBOURG, 11th September, 2025 (WAM) \u2013 Multilateral development banks (MDBs) delivered a record $137 billion in global climate finance last year \u2014 a 10% increase that underscores the growing scale of international climate investment.
