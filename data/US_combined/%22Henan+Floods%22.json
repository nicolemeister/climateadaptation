Comprehensive, culture-independent microbiome assessments are therefore needed to better characterize microbial risks in tap water. MethodsTo address this gap, we developed a cost-effective, citizen science-based approach for monitoring the tap water microbiome. Between December 2020 and August 2021, 50 household tap water samples were collected by volunteers across 19 provinces and regions in China, including several samples obtained before and/or after extreme weather events including the 2021 Henan Floods and Typhoon In-Fa. A low-biomass sampling protocol was developed and adopted, and DNA was extracted and analyzed via 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding targeting the V4 region. ResultsOf the 50 samples, 22 were successfully amplified and yielded DNA with a significant number of sequencing reads. High-throughput amplicon sequencing identified 7,635 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), revealing a diverse microbiome in household tap water. Opportunistic pathogens, including Mycobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Legionella, were detected in all PCR-positive samples. Alarmingly, post-typhoon samples from Changzhou showed a marked increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia coli. DiscussionAlthough based on a limited number of sequenced samples, this study highlights potential microbial risks in household tap water, particularly following extreme weather events.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The presence of multiple opportunistic and potentially pathogenic taxa underscores the limitations of traditional indicator-based monitoring. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of citizen science for microbial water quality survey, offering a complementary tool for national monitoring and informing future public health strategies for water safety.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping total microbial communities and waterborne pathogens in household drinking water in China by citizen science and metabarcoding.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ratings reflect QHR's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.</p><p>QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), remained at the strongest level as of year-end 2021. The capital and surplus increased by 7.1% to RMB 3.3 billion in 2021, underpinned by full retention of net profit. Going forward, AM Best expects the company to continue to receive financial support from its major shareholders and explore opportunities in capital markets to enrich its capital structure. Other supportive factors to the balance sheet strength include the prudent retrocession arrangements and the diversified investment portfolio focused on cash and fixed-income securities, albeit with a moderate exposure to debt-type alternative investments.</p><p>The company extended the profitable trend in 2021 with a return on equity of 6.5%, compared with the five-year (2017-2021) average of 2.1%. The company continues to commit resources and strengthen its business relationships with Chinese insurers and distribution partners to tap growth potential in traditional protection products and opportunities in financial reinsurance solutions to improve capital efficiency, while adjusting its risk appetite in long-term savings products in view of heightened challenges in asset-liability matching risk. The life reinsurance segment remains as the major driver of underwriting results. On the other hand, the non-life combined ratio increased in 2021, partially attributed to several large losses during the year, including the Henan floods and some commercial fire events in the overseas portfolio. Interest income from deposits, coupled with returns from bonds, equities and financial products, has continued to support the overall investment results over the past three years. Notwithstanding, unfavourable capital market conditions in the first three quarters of 2022 have put pressure on the valuations of the company's invested assets, albeit its investment yield remained on par with domestic reinsurer peers.</p><p>QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone. Over the past five years, the company has continued to strengthen its market presence. The non-life underwriting portfolio is diversified by product lines with a focus on Chinese risks as the company rebalanced the overseas book to improve business quality.</p><p>Negative rating actions could occur if QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation declines significantly due to adverse deviation from its business and capital plan, for example, much faster-than-expected expansion in underwriting and investment risks.

Interest income from deposits, coupled with returns from bonds, equities and financial products, has continued to support the overall investment results over the past three years. Notwithstanding, unfavourable capital market conditions in the first three quarters of 2022 have put pressure on the valuations of the company's invested assets, albeit its investment yield remained on par with domestic reinsurer peers. QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone.

(QHR) (China). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ratings reflect QHR's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.</p><p>QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation remained at the strongest level as of year-end 2020, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). The company's capital and surplus increased moderately from organic growth in net profit since 2019. Going forward, AM Best expects the company to continue to benefit from financial support from its shareholders and maintain its capital strength to support business expansion over the short to intermediate term. Other supportive factors to the balance sheet strength include the prudent retrocession arrangements and the diversified investment portfolio focused on cash and fixed-income securities, albeit with a moderate exposure to debt-type alternative investments.</p><p>QHR's net profit surged significantly in 2020 as a combined result of improved underwriting margin, and growth in investment income, as well as favourable capital gains. Return on equity improved to 6.9% in 2020 from 1.8% in 2019. The company continues to tap on growth potential in traditional yearly renewable-term business with underlying risks mainly in medical and critical illness products, while dynamically adjusting its risk appetite in long-term savings and financial reinsurance businesses in view of changes in the operating environment. Notwithstanding, AM Best expects the company's non-life underwriting result to face negative pressure from some major catastrophe and risk losses in 2021, including the Henan floods in China. However, the growing stream of investment income has contributed to support overall earnings over the past few years.</p><p>QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises, and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone.

It also is expected that QHR will maintain its solid risk-adjusted capitalisation with continued strong shareholder support.</p><p>Negative rating actions could occur if the company's risk-adjusted capitalisation declines significantly due to adverse deviation from its business plan, or if the company demonstrates a sustained deteriorating trend in its operating performance.</p><p>Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

What else they found: The report notes that financial costs are usually higher in richer countries because they have higher property values and can afford insurance. But some of the most devastating extreme weather events in 2021 hit poorer nations.These extreme weather events have caused severe human suffering from food insecurity, drought and extreme weather events causing mass displacements and loss of life, the report notes. What they're saying: \"The costs of climate change have been grave this year, both in terms of eyewatering financial losses but also in the death and displacement of people around the world,\" said report author Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's climate policy lead, in a statement. \"Be it storms and floods in some of the world's richest countries or droughts and heatwaves in some of the poorest, the climate crisis hit hard in 2021.\" By the numbers: 2021's most costly weather events, according to Christian Aid: Hurricane Ida[5] \u2014 $65 billion.European floods[6] \u2014 $43 billion.Texas winter storm[7] \u2014$23 billion.Henan floods (China)[8] \u2014 $17.6 billion.British Columbia floods[9] \u2014 $7.5 billion.France's \"cold wave\"[10] \u2014 $5.6 billion.Cyclone Yaas (India, Bangladesh)[11] \u2014 $3 billionAustralian floods[12] \u2014 $2.1 billion.Typhoon In-fa (China, Philippines, Japan) \u2014 $2 billion.Cyclone Tauktae[13] (India, Sri Lanka, Maldives) \u2014 $1.5billion. The big picture: Extreme weather events are the clearest way we're feeling climate change in our daily lives \u2014 and this year's ones are a preview of even more turbulent times, Axios' Andrew Freedman andKia Kokalitcheva[14] note. A study by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[15] (IPCC) earlier this year found an \"unequivocal\" connection between human-caused global warming and extreme weather. Worth noting: The National Intelligence Council of the U.S. warned in a November report[16] that 11 countries faced grave instabilities due to climate change: Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iraq, Nicaragua, North Korea and Pakistan. \"Diminished energy, food and water security in the 11 countries probably will exacerbate poverty, tribal or ethnic intercommunal tensions and dissatisfaction with governments, increasing the risk of social, economic, and political instability,\" the report notes. The bottom line: The COP26 climate summit[17] in Glasgow \"generated plenty of headlines, but without concrete emissions cuts and financial support the world will continue to suffer,\" Christian Aid's report states. \"One glaring omission from the outcome in Glasgow was a fund to deal with the permanent loss and damage caused by climate change,\" the study adds. \"This is one issue which will need to be addressed at COP27 in Egypt in 2022[18].\"Kramer noted \"it is clear that the world is not on track to ensure a safe and prosperous\" future.

The Biden administration\u2014including Kerry himself\u2014has explicitly promised not to make concessions to Beijing in return for climate cooperation. But despite that pledge, linkage remains a real trap. The CPP's unrelenting pursuit of political leverage at home and abroad invariably overrides its concern for the climate. <br/> Leading-emitter China keeps pushing to link its political priorities to other countries' climate priorities. And progressive groups keep pushing the administration to dance with the devil and accept this Faustian bargain[11]. But make no mistake: When foreign supplicants[12] collide with the CCP's self-interest, they will pay with both upfront concessions and wasted time, during which critical climate systems could be pushed beyond the point of no return. <br/> And there is little possibility of domestic accountability in China itself because the CCP harshly suppresses environmental and climate dissent. It won't even accept or air the professional assessments of its own environmental officials in key instances. Case in point: former China Central Television journalist Chai Jing, known as 'China's Rachel Carson.' Soon after being commended by Chinese Minister of Environmental Protection Chen Jining, her 2015 TED-style documentary, Under the Dome[13], was abruptly censored\u2014as were her personal communications and even Chen's own discussion of her[14]. Silencing China's Silent Spring-inspired movement before it could even begin to stimulate badly needed discussion speaks louder than any words. Moreover, even after the disastrous Henan floods, Chinese state media coverage after major Chinese weather disasters tends to avoid mentioning climate change[15], let alone acknowledging China's own emissions might be a factor influencing it. All the more reason Beijing's so-called progressive climate sweet talk is only for nave ears. <br/> Two other major traps loom large for the United States on the road to Glasgow's conference. One is getting sidetracked. Beijing loves to talk about dialogue but hasn't come close to making meaningful climate commitments\u2014which, in any case, the CPP will blatantly violate if it finds them inconvenient. The CCP has a long track record of breaking even the most binding of promises. Among the many examples are the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, registered at the United Nations as an international treaty, and Chinese President Xi Jinping's assurance, delivered at a public press conference with then-U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015, that China would not militarize key contested areas in the South China Sea[16]\u2014a pledge promptly invalidated by the People's Liberation Army's own actions even as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for 'dialogue and consultation[17].' And in the climate realm specifically, China has repeatedly backslid and not consistently honored key commitments[18] it made when it ratified the Montreal Protocol[19] 30 years ago in 1991. <br/> In harsh Leninist fashion, the CCP consistently puts itself before everything else, even the planet's future[20]. That doesn't mean it's always insincere when talking about the environment. China's leaders are well aware of the political and health costs of heavy pollution at home[21] and of the dangers increasingly frequent natural disasters pose\u2014especially to its vulnerable coastline. But the first priority will always be the party's own short-term survival. Future global goods typically come last. <br/> Another danger is unilaterally making climate sacrifices China doesn't reciprocate. Beijing wants to negotiate a costly toll gate en route to Glasgow by prompting the United States\u2014and Europe\u2014to bear disproportionate costs. Better yet, it prefers its major economic and strategic competitors lead decarbonization at great expense, both to render them less competitive and to pioneer best practices by trial and error so China can keep pursuing its preferred 'selfish superpower' path to free-riding 'second-mover' advantage. <br/> Between 2009 and 2019, China emitted nearly twice as much cumulative carbon dioxide as the United States\u2014a gap likely to widen further in coming years. Beijing around 1979 would have had reasonable moral capital to argue Washington should cut emissions first. But by now, China has clearly reached a level where the sheer scale of its emissions overwhelms arguments about emissions intensity and treating the world's second largest economy as a less developed country for climate purposes. China's scale of carbon dioxide emissions is now at least twice as large as that of the United States: In 10 years, it emits what the United States would in 20 to 25 years. And even its per capita carbon dioxide emissions already exceed those of key G-8 economies like Italy and the United Kingdom. <br/> Kerry and his team should remember that China's vague promise to peak coal use by 2030 is nowhere close to being reciprocal. To even begin to approach a level of commitments equivalent to the Biden administration's truly ambitious plans, China\u2014among other things\u2014would have to credibly commit to achieving a net zero carbon electricity system by 2035 or 2040. No such offer even appears on the table, leaving aside how credible one could possibly be in practice. <br/> Talking is fine in theory, but to be effective in reality, Washington needs to be coming from a position of strength and leverage. Presently, Chinese officials refuse to credit Kerry, Biden, or any other U.S. counterpart with any such leverage. That can and must change for the better. As we explained in our Foreign Affairs[22] article and our report for Rice University's Baker Institute[23], the United States must now pursue climate competition to generate that leverage. <br/> This approach is powerful and positive. Washington's strength is greatest when exercised in concert with others for the greater good. The U.S.-led climate coalition should start with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) industrial democracies and smaller coastal states like Pacific islands, which are often the first (and worst) affected by climate change. There is ample room for all genuinely cooperative partners to play a positive role. These climate allies should impose domestic carbon taxes in coordination with one another benchmarked to a negotiated standard. Based on OECD members alone, this carbon coalition would constitute the world's largest economic bloc and include China's most important export markets. <br/> Third, the United States must completely avoid making substantive climate-linked concessions on non-climate issues, such as Indo-Pacific security and human rights. Kerry and colleagues have promised that won't happen, but U.S. allies and partners clearly remain concerned it will. And CCP officials obviously believe they can coerce such an outcome. As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi[24] said on April 23, 'the United States cannot repeatedly challenge China's rights and interests on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong while expecting China to cooperate with it on issues it cares about.' Negotiation 101 and the school of hard knocks both teach that appearing to want something more than the other side as an 'ardent suitor' generates weakness and vulnerability. The Biden administration has not succeeded in dispelling this notion. That needs to change too. <br/> Finally, the United States must completely avoid making climate-related agreements it would honor that are premised on climate-related promises China might break. <br/> By the end of Kerry's visit, it should be overwhelmingly clear Beijing is trying to take Washington for a ride. This will be the time for a long overdue correction. Kerry can honestly declare he's done all he possibly could to attempt to cooperate with his direct counterpart\u2014special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua\u2014and other Chinese officials and that he's exhausted all current mutually productive avenues. <br/> What Kerry needs to do in the runup to COP26 is shift his focus to rallying a coalition of major industrialized democracies, vulnerable coastal states, and other responsible partners to compete with China and impose carbon taxes on its coal-intensive products. That's the only way to make the CCP change its climate-destructive ways for the good of all and to incentivize it to someday negotiate in good faith and deliver real results. <br/> Real pro-climate progress requires fundamentally shifting the CCP's calculus by actually altering the economic bottom line on which its power hinges. Climate competition\u2014specifically, leveraging the threat of carbon taxation\u2014is the only Archimedean lever powerful enough to incentivize a timely transformation. This paradigm-shifting approach would curtail China's latitude for exploitative geopolitical maneuvering and empower its sidelined reformers and environmentalists. <br/> Globally, climate competition supports a whole-of-coalition 'race to the top' for pro-climate actions, with the European Union carbon border tax proposal an extant example and U.S. energy and carbon storage technologies a promising way forward. Crucially, climate competition could also anchor the bipartisan domestic support necessary to keep Washington as a reliable long-term climate leader and partner of choice. Finally, it offers on-ramps for China itself to engage more decisively on climate change both domestically and internationally\u2014and to benefit accordingly. <br/> No silver bullet exists, but climate competition offers the most viable means of getting China on a much better road than it's currently committed to and preserving the planet for future generations. That's a legacy Kerry and the administration he represents should be proud to pursue for the good of all. <br/> [ 1]: <url

As the snow line moves higher and higher up the mountains and glaciers melt, we may see the extinction of more and more species, including those that are still undiscovered or understudied.

Now, I use social media to record and exhibit beautiful but fragile plant life to get more people to pay attention to alpine plants, as well as climate change and its impact on biodiversity.

He was a staunch believer that we should have a sustainable relationship with nature, only then can there be sustainable living. My father was an advocate of indigenous healthcare.</p><p>It was my parents who said to me that: \"If you really want to contribute back to society, you need to enter into policy making\". Through my studies in humanities and environmental science, I realized that it is important for indigenous communities to write and speak for ourselves, and to share our perspective and worldview through our own lens. It is important to raise our voice, because our voice matters.</p><p>My father's death in 2017 triggered in me an urgent need to learn traditional practices and their contribution towards climate action and biodiversity conservation, and to document them so that upcoming generations will know about these practices. Through the years I have interacted with numerous tribal communities in the state. Every tribe is unique but all their cultures are sustainable and respectfully intertwined with nature.</p><p>Climate change affects all of us but not equally. Tribal communities are the ones who have been in the frontlines of protecting the forest and nature through their way of living, traditional knowledge and practices, even at the cost of their lives, yet they are the ones who are most adversely affected due to the impact of the Climate Crisis.

It's been my all-time routine to be vigilant about waste management and meat-eating issues. In September 2019, I took part in the Climate Crisis Emergency Action Parade in Seoul. The slogan \"Climate Crisis, Not Global Warming\" touched me. The word 'climate crisis' was a wake up call that the reality in front of us is a crisis that ordinary people must work through together, not just experts or people in power</p><p>In 2020, I started the climate movement in Youth Climate Emergency Action. In 2021, we took direct action against Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction, a representative Korean company that is building coal power plants in various parts of Asia.

It's a fundamental human right.

Moreover, most Taiwanese have never heard of climate litigation or climate justice. Therefore, we endeavored to amplify the influence of our case and to ensure that our plaintiffs' voices got heard while the case was still pending. We collaborated with local environmental law groups to initiate a petition among lawyers advocating for adding citizen suit provision, hold forums allowing more people to understand climate justice, and publish articles.</p><p>In addition to climate litigation, I devoted myself to supporting our Distant Water Fishery project.

As a community organizer, these lessons have become my core values too. What matters most is supporting and enabling each other to act together so as to achieve our shared vision.</p><p>I hope that others would aspire for a better life, not just for survival. That they realize that they have the power to achieve this through persistent collective activism. We must be at the forefront of the struggle and confront the system that makes the people poor and miserable, thus perpetuating injustices.

I believe that we can overcome people's fears with exposure and I am very glad to see so many incredible trans women on many different platforms these days.

If you are a cis person, please be our ally because the trans community needs more allies who will stand up for us and who will speak out for what is right.

Games revenues increased by 12% to RMB43.0 billion, primarily driven by the increase in revenues from games such as Honour of Kings, PUBG Mobile, Valorant, Clash of Clans and Moonlight Blade Mobile, partly offset by the decrease in revenues from Peacekeeper Elite. Mobile games VAS revenues (including mobile games revenues attributable to our social networks business) increased by 13% to RMB40.8 billion, while PC client games revenues grew by 1% to RMB11.0 billion for the second quarter of 2021. Social networks revenues grew by 9% to RMB29.0 billion, mainly due to revenue growth from digital content services, as well as in-game virtual item sales.</p><p>Revenues from Online Advertising increased by 23% to RMB22.8 billion for the second quarter of 2021, reflecting rising demand from advertiser categories such as Internet services and consumer staples, as well as consolidation of Bitauto's advertising revenue, which outweighed weakness in education. Social and others advertising revenues grew by 28% to RMB19.5 billion, due to increased adoption of Mini Programs as landing pages, more video advertising inventories inside Weixin Moments, as well as revenue growth from our mobile advertising network. Media advertising revenues were RMB3.3 billion, broadly stable compared to the second quarter of 2020, as greater advertising revenues from our music apps offset lower news advertising revenues.</p><p>Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 40% to RMB41.9 billion for the second quarter of 2021 on a year-on-year basis. FinTech Services revenue growth primarily reflected increasing digital payment transactions. Business Services revenues increased rapidly year-on-year, due to digitalisation of public services and traditional industries, as well as consolidation of Bitauto's Business Services revenue.</p><p>Other Key Financial Information for2Q2021</p><p>EBITDA was RMB44.6 billion, up 10% YoY. Adjusted EBITDA was RMB50.3 billion, up 15% YoY.</p><p>Capital expenditures were\u00a0RMB6.9 billion, down 27% YoY.</p><p>Free cash flow was RMB17.3 billion, down 39% YoY.</p><p>As at June 30, 2021, net debt position totalled RMB21.0 billion. Fair value of our stakes in listed investee companies (excluding subsidiaries) totalled RMB1,446.0 billion, compared to RMB1,362.3 billion as of March 31, 2021, and RMB726.2 billion as of June 30, 2020.</p><p>Operating Metrics</p><p>Business Review and Outlook</p><p>Communication and Social</p><p>For Weixin, the active user base and engagement further increased, underscoring the vibrancy of our service and commerce ecosystem. Transaction volume generated from Mini Programs more than doubled year-on-year as we helped businesses thrive by facilitating management of their own channels and user relationships, while also enabling them to achieve higher profit margins than on marketplaces. Brands and merchants can: 1) acquire customers for their Mini Programs offline via QR Codes and Weixin Pay; 2) create and distribute content via their own Official Accounts and Weixin Groups, engaging users and driving repeat visits to their Mini Programs; 3) convert visits into sales with Mini Programs' powerful shopping functionalities; and 4) deepen user connections via Video Accounts and live streaming as additional touchpoints.</p><p>For QQ, young users are increasingly active in consuming entertainment content such as anime and comics. To cater to young users' need for immersive social and entertainment experiences, we enriched QQ's Augmented Reality camera effects for video content production and video chat. We also automated the in-app video editing process with smart templates and multimedia tools to drive more appealing user-generated content.</p><p>Digital Content</p><p>Our fee-based VAS subscriptions grew 13% year-on-year to 229 million. Video subscriptions increased 9% year-on-year to 125 million, benefitting from diversified content across sports, animated series, drama series and movies. Music subscriptions increased 41% year-on-year to 66 million, driven by Tencent Music Entertainment's effective marketing and by increased consumer willingness to subscribe for music services.</p><p>Games</p><p>We reinforced the IP of our key titles in China and overseas. We adapted Honour of Kings into the drama series, \"You Are My Glory\", which is the most-watched drama series on Tencent Video by video views per episode year-to-date. PUBG Mobile collaborated with internationally recognised brands such as Godzilla vs. Kong, McLaren and Line Friends to create crossover content. Clash of Clans released a major content upgrade in April 2021 and launched its nineth anniversary event in August 2021, retaining its ranking among the top 10 mobile games by DAU internationally. Valorant achieved 14 million MAU on its first anniversary.</p><p>We extended our presence in emerging genres through self-developed games. Alchemy Stars, developed by our Tourdog Studio, became Japan's most downloaded tactical RPG in July 2021, benefitting from its anime art style and unique tile-connecting gameplay. Light and Night, developed by our Aurora Studio, ranked as China's top dating simulation game by DAU in July 2021, enhancing our engagement with female players. Our first Survival, Open World, Crafting (SOC) game, Undawn, developed by our Lightspeed and Quantum Studios, has accumulated over 30 million pre-registrations in China to date.</p><p>We have sought to pioneer a healthy game playing environment in the game industry. In August 2021, we further tightened our game time and spending limits for Minors[3]\u00a0in China, beyond regulatory requirement. For Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite, we reduced Minors' daily game time limit to 1 hour on non-statutory holidays and to 2 hours on statutory holidays, versus regulatory requirement of 1.5 hours and 3 hours respectively. We also prevented in-game spending by players aged under 12. These measures will be rolled out in all of our games gradually. We are also cracking down on Minors misusing adult accounts, and transactions of adult accounts on third-party platforms. During the second quarter of 2021, players aged under 16 accounted for 2.6% of our China game grossing receipts. Among which, players aged under 12 accounted for 0.3%.</p><p>Online Advertising</p><p>We expanded our overall advertiser base by enhancing industry solutions and enabling merchants to better manage their private domain operations within our Weixin ecosystem. More advertisers adopted Mini Programs as landing pages for their Moments advertisements, leading to higher sales conversion and revenue growth. Advertisers increasingly recognised Official Accounts' capability in generating sales leads.</p><p>During the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, we provided integrated marketing solutions across Weixin, QQ, Tencent Video, Tencent Sports, Tencent News and other properties. Leveraging our strengths in social, long-form and short-form video distribution, as well as in content management, we outperformed other online platforms in terms of video views and user sharing.</p><p>FinTech</p><p>Daily active users and payment frequency grew at healthy year-on-year rates. SMEs are important contributors to, and beneficiaries of our payment ecosystem growth; we will continue to help SMEs benefit from greater mobile payment acceptance, by charging very low or zero payment take rate in certain cases, and by providing complementary resources and services to support their growth.</p><p>Cloud and Other Business Services</p><p>We utilise our cloud infrastructure, PaaS and SaaS technologies to assist digitalisation for public services and traditional industries. Enhancements to our technology and product development supported broad customer adoption of our platform and software services such as security, AI and data analytic services. The videolisation trend offers more opportunities for our video cloud solutions, and according to IDC, we ranked first in China in terms of video cloud solution revenue. We deepened connections between our communication and productivity SaaS tools (WeCom, Tencent Meeting and Tencent Docs) to support better collaboration within enterprises, as well as between enterprises and their users.</p><p>For other detailed disclosure, please refer to our website<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tencent.com/en-us/investors.htmlhttp://www.tencent.com/ir\">https://www.tencent.com/en-us/investors.htmlhttp://www.tencent.com/ir</url>, or follow us via Weixin Official Account (Weixin ID: Tencent_IR):</p><p>About Tencent</p><p>Tencent uses technology to enrich the lives of Internet users.</p><p>Our communication and social services, Weixin and QQ, connect users with each other and with digital content and services, both online and offline, making their lives more convenient.

Please go ahead.</p><p>MARCO LAI, FOUNDER AND CEO, LIZHI INC.: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) We are very pleased that all aspects of our business maintained robust growth in the second quarter of 2021. We are dedicated to the audio-centric globalization strategy and to bringing diversified audio products to a broader user base. Our continuous efforts to advance in-house technology development, optimize product features and improve user experiences resulted in a steady growth of our user base in the second quarter with total average mobile MAUs reached 60.9 million and average monthly paying users rose to 494 thousand. Driven by ongoing enhancements in our commercialization capability, our revenue in the second quarter has reached another record high of RMB559 million, up 59% year-over-year.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Our solid performance of core metrics during the quarter reaffirmed effectiveness of our strategy and the increasing efficiency in our execution, underscoring our competitiveness in the online audio market. In the second quarter, our audio-centric UGC community built on the LIZHI App to appeal to younger generations continued to demonstrate high levels of user engagement and interaction.</p><p>In addition, we have further improved integration of our pre-recorded content division and audio entertainment division, and effectively increased user penetration rate of audio entertainment to 14.6% in the second quarter of 2021 from 13.2% in the same quarter last year. This achievement also brings more space to improve paying user conversion, further strengthening our commercialization capabilities in audio entertainment and driving the strong growth in revenue.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) On the other hand, we have successfully expanded user base to younger and middle-aged cohorts in higher tier cities, supported by effective operations on our vertical podcast platform LIZHI Podcast. Through innovations on podcast features and development on multi-devices accessibility, we expect to further increase the influence of podcasting and diversify our audio ecosystem.</p><p>In the second quarter, we continued to leverage our livestream podcast feature to generate diverse content creation opportunities for original podcasters. We have also partnered with several brands and companies to devise exceptional livestream podcast programs, delivering unique listening experiences to audiences.</p><p>Furthermore, we are working to strengthen our foothold in the in-car audio market and expedite the implementation of our in-car audio products. These efforts include expanding collaborations with a wide range of leading companies and technology platforms and optimizing mobile applications catering to in-car usage scenarios, which greatly improved listening experiences across multiple terminals. We are seeing that users' listening time on LIZHI Podcast has increased substantially in the second quarter.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Turning to our globalization progress, our TIYA App, an audio-based social networking app targeting overseas markets, continued to grow rapidly, highlighted by growing user base with MAUs in June rising to more than 3.5 million, representing a 92% increase over average MAUs in the first quarter of 2021. In terms of our operational strategy for TIYA, we are committed to improving user engagement and user activeness through continuous optimization and iteration of product, as well as enrichment of interactive features.</p><p>In this June, the number of active groups on TIYA increased by more than 360% from this March, and the number of active chat rooms increased by more than 180% from this March. We are also seeing that the amount and diversity of social networking topics and interest groups on the platform are increasingly expanding, bringing more new users to join the platform and effectively enhancing TIYA's network effect.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Technological empowerment is a crucial driver for our vigorous business development. In the second quarter, we remained focused on advancing our core technology capabilities. For example, we are striving to make DOREME, our in-house developed audio technology solution, compatible with more in-car operating systems and Internet of Vehicles platforms.</p><p>Our goal is to ensure superior audio quality across different in-car systems and satisfy user demand for real-time audio interaction. Our AI technology is also driving our overall business development, including enabling a better recommendation mechanism and delivering a personalized audio experience across multiple devices. In the future, we will further refine our core technologies to support and empower our robust business growth.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Alongside driving the effective growth and strategic execution of various businesses, we also actively undertake corporate social responsibility as a content community platform. For example, on the National Disability Day, we released a short documentary film to highlight the stories of audio content creators with physical disabilities, who have showcased their vocal talents through creating audio programs titled \"see the world through ears\" on LIZHI App. We are also hoping to help young people with physical disabilities to create more value via voices through the influence of our platform.</p><p>In addition, during the Henan floods last month, leveraging the advantages of our voice platform, we launched various audio contents of \"Supporting Henan\" through all channels, rallied the power of voices to encourage content creators to publish the emergency rescue measures, and promoted psychological counseling contents and relevant science educational podcasts. We also showed our support and respect for rescue staff through various content features, delivering the heartwarming initiatives to a wider range of audiences through voice.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) In summary, we are pleased to see that LIZHI's global business continued to experience strong growth in the second quarter of this year, laying a solid foundation for our long-term growth. Going forward, we will remain steadfast in our commitment to globalization strategy, further promoting the development of our domestic business and unleashing the commercialization potential through effective operating strategies. We will further advance our podcast business development and explore diverse audio-applicable usage scenarios, bringing innovative podcast experiences to a broader user base.</p><p>In overseas market, we will continue optimizing our audio social products, providing an even better social networking experience to our users. Meanwhile, we will progressively explore various overseas markets and create more possibilities for the long-term development of our global business. Furthermore, we are committed to building a more competitive audio ecosystem to achieve sustainable long-term growth as we continue to advance our in-house core technology capabilities.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Thanks everyone. With that, I will now turn the call over to our COO, Mr. Zelong Li, who will discuss our business development in more details.</p><p>ZELONG LI, COO, LIZHI INC.: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. As Marco discussed, in the second quarter, we maintained strong growth momentum with a solid set of financial and operating results. I am happy to share with you a bit more on our operating achievements.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) First, in terms of our audio community on LIZHI App, our persistent efforts in optimizing audio entertainment products and audio creation tools improved overall user experiences, increased user activeness and stimulated user engagement in audio content creation. During the second quarter, users' monthly average total interactions on the platform reached 3.4 billion. As of June 30, cumulative pieces of audio content uploaded to our platform reached 293 million.</p><p>In the audio entertainment division, we conducted various operational campaigns to encourage content creators to participate in audio entertainment creation, which in turn attracted more users to join real-time audio interactions. This has further unleashed our audio entertainment business's commercialization potential, reflected by our growing audio entertainment user penetration rate which drives the paying user conversion. On the other hand, based on our effective user positioning, we continued to develop market-leading content categories catering to the younger generation.</p><p>Through strengthened content ecosystem and content operation strategy toward higher commercialization potential, such as ACG-centric interplay sessions and emotion accompanying programs, we have effectively increased user willingness to pay and further enhanced our commercialization capability in audio entertainment division.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) In terms of our global business, as an audio social platform targeting younger generation, TIYA keeps focused on optimizing product features to meet various social needs of users based on younger generation's interests and hobbies. In March 2021, we launched TIYA's Group function, which helps users with common interests be connected, enjoy real-time audio interactions, and become friends on our platform. The number of active groups on the platform has significantly increased.</p><p>In addition, we introduced mini-games such as Ludo and Sweet Crush into live chat rooms and launched a game-sharing function in conjunction with the theme of gaming, aimed at promoting effective communication and interaction among users and meet more user demands. Our continuous efforts in product optimization effectively improved user experience and user engagement, and we are gaining a growing number of new users from spontaneous invitations from friends on TIYA.</p><p>As of June 30, the number of TIYA-based user friendship connections increased by 120% from this March. Looking ahead, we will remain committed to executing our globalization strategy as we believe that the development of audio-based social networking business is able to bring more growth potential for the overall business.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) In terms of the development of our podcast business, we are committed to differentiating our competitive advantages through innovation of features and podcast content, including a series of livestream podcast programs to increase user activeness and interaction. For example, in June, in collaboration with the Aranya Theater Festival, we launched the \"Migratory Birds Live Radio\" project, which featured a 300-hour non-stop audio live streaming for the first time in China's online audio industry.</p><p>Built on a mix of live stream dialogues, voice recordings, and outbound dialing interactions, this pioneering livestream session comprehensively showcased the communication and theater creation activities of 300 theater lovers and practitioners. This event spotlights our horizon-broadening approach to merge livestream feature into podcast. Additionally, we leveraged this prestigious session to create highlight edition and exclusive podcast sessions available on our platform.</p><p>During the second quarter, we also hosted the \"Voices of Technology and Science Week\" online forum, China's first livestream podcast forum themed on science and technology. This event featured a number of renowned speakers discussing a variety of trending topics through livestream podcasts, greatly stimulating interactions among podcast listeners.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) In addition to our innovations in podcast content and product features, we have also formed more strategic collaborations to increase the popularity and availability of podcasts across multiple terminals. Recently, in cooperation with more leading automakers and Internet of Vehicles platforms, including WM Motor, Li Auto, Tencent WeScenario, and PATEO IoV platform, we worked to make LIZHI Podcast accessible in more vehicles, providing a diverse audio experience to a broader user base.</p><p>At the same time, we continuously optimize our product features to ensure a better in-car listening experience. We introduced car-mode for mobile app, enabling users to enjoy personalized podcast content supported by AI-powered content recommendation and distribution mechanism with only one-click. We believe that our in-car audio solutions and mobile apps can build synergies, encompassing podcast content across multiple devices spanning a variety of usage scenarios to bring podcast offerings to a wider range of users, and further enhance the influence of podcast in the industry.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Going forward, we remain committed to our mission and to driving the development of our worldwide business to build LIZHI into a leading global audio platform through our continuous efforts on audio innovation and technology advancement.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Thanks everyone. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Acting CFO, Ms. Chengfang Lu, who will discuss our financial results in more details.</p><p>CHENGFANG LU, ACTING CFO, LIZHI INC.: Thank you, Zelong, and hello everyone. I will now provide a brief overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>As we move forward with our expansion strategy, our operational and financial performance for the second quarter continued to demonstrate our strong growth trajectory and strengthened commercialization capabilities. We're also pleased to see gross margin expansion of 400 basis points year-over-year alongside our strong topline growth during the quarter. Looking ahead, we will remain focused on our globalization strategy and improving our operational and technological capabilities to foster our global audio ecosystem and deliver long-term sustainable growth.</p><p>In the second quarter, our total net revenues were RMB559.3 million, representing an increase of 59% from RMB350.9 million in the second quarter of 2020, mainly attributable to our growing user base and increase in the average spending of paying users in our audio entertainment products.</p><p>Cost of revenues was RMB400.5 million in the second quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 51% from RMB265.2 million in the second quarter of 2020.

The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in other professional service fee, partially offset by the higher salary and welfare benefits expenses.</p><p>Operating loss was RMB31.6 million in the second quarter of 2021, up by 26% from RMB25.0 million in the second quarter of 2020.

So, I will first go to Vincent Yu from Needham &amp; Company. So, please ask your question, Vincent.</p><p>VINCENT YU, ANALYST, NEEDHAM &amp; COMPANY: Thank you and thank you management for taking my question and congrats for the strong quarter results. I have three questions. The first question is, I think in terms of like on the recreation side, so have we been communicating with regulators on the rollout of recreation on the overall streaming industry? Can management give us a sense of company's expectation and the impacts on LIZHI's operational results?</p><p>And the second question is on the as apps themselves. So, can management share with us how big is the user base who use LIZHI or use LIZHI Podcast app in the car and the overall size of LIZHI Podcast app?</p><p>And the third question is, does the company see any material change in user behavior for TIYA App as the economy continues to reopen? And it is like the streaming hours have been changed or decreased or increased or maintained like can we get any sense? So, I will translate for myself into Mandarin. So, (spoken in Chinese).</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: I'll translate for Marco. So, Marco will answer the first question and our COO, Mr. Zelong Li, will answer the other two questions. So, Marco's answer it that like for recent years, the regulatory authorities have always attached importance to regulating the online entertainment industry, including the live streaming industry.</p><p>Tighter regulations may have some impacts and put pressures on some companies' business in the short-term. But we do believe that sound regulatory policies can standardize relative business operations, which is good for the long-term sustainable development of the entire industry.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) As an online audio company, we have always prioritized regulatory compliance and have been proactively and effectively communicating with regulators to have an accurate understanding of the relevant guidelines and requirements. In the last few quarters, we also have reported some information and we have [come out] some solutions regarding to the regulatory policies.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are earnestly conducting self-examinations of our internal compliance and data security measures to ensure that our business operations comply with the regulations.</p><p>MARCO LAI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) Based on our years of experiences in the industry, I think we have already had a relatively sound mechanism to meet the regulatory requirements. In the long-term, the online audio industry still has tremendous growth potential and LIZHI is committed to promoting stable and healthy development.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: I will translate for Mr. Zelong Li for the second and third questions. So, for the second questions, in terms of our in-car audio strategy, we are actually working to expand collaborations with a wider range of leading companies to make our in-car audio products accessible in more vehicles and then reach a broader user base. We have made significant progress recently in our co-operations with auto companies and have LIZHI Podcast launched on more in-car audio operating systems.</p><p>As of now, we have established collaborations with a total of 14 automakers. Besides those companies we have mentioned earlier, our in-car audio products have also been launched on vans and Audi's in-car operating systems through the IoV platforms.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) LIZHI Podcast has been operating for over half a year and now have performed well through our podcast innovations like live streaming podcasts and exclusive podcast episodes. We have effectively improved the average user time spent on LIZHI Podcast.</p><p>In the second quarter of 2021, the average daily time spent per user on LIZHI Podcast increased by around 10 minutes compared with the previous quarter, which also shows the effectiveness of our operational strategies and the improved user stickiness.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) In the future, we will continue to boost the development of LIZHI Podcast and our in-car audio business and increase the popularity of LIZHI Podcast by integrating into more in-car systems. We will also continue to enrich LIZHI Podcast content offerings to deliver more interesting content, meets users' demand with innovative podcast features and improve user stickiness.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) But at this moment, the user base for the in-car audio scenario and of the LIZHI Podcast is relatively small compared to our overall user base. We will share more data when that business grows to a certain scale.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) The third question is about the user behavior for the TIYA App, although most social activities are gradually returning to normalcy, but we are still seeing a lot of lasting changes in people's lifestyle brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, online entertainment and online social networking are gaining widespread popularity and TIYA maintained its strong growth momentum in the second quarter.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) As we continue to optimize TIYA's product features, TIYA's user activeness continued to increase reflected by an increase in the number of active chat rooms and the number of user friendship connections. Also, the user time spent on TIYA also improved compared to the previous quarter.</p><p>ZELONG LI: (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: (interpreted) From a long-term perspective, we believe the online social networking is becoming a trend in the way people socialize. The integration of audio into social networking activities provides users a differentiated form of social networking from an innovative perspective and satisfying more of their social networking needs. Going forward, we will continue to optimize TIYA's product features connecting more users through voices.</p><p>This concludes the answers for Needham's questions.</p><p>VINCENT YU: Thank you. (spoken in Chinese)</p><p>EFFY KANG: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Vicky Wei from Citi. So, please ask your question, Vicky.</p><p>VICKY WEI, ANALYST, CITI: (spoken in Chinese) So, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid quarter. So, will management share some color about revenue sharing ratio with hosts as industry peers continue to invest in audio live streaming? Thank you.</p><p>CHENGFANG LU: (spoken in Chinese) Thanks for the question from Vicky. Actually, we have diverse revenue sharing policies for content creators across different business divisions at different stages.</p><p>In the second quarter of this year, we achieved strong revenue growth, while we are also progressively adjusting our revenue sharing structure. In this quarter, our overall revenue sharing for content creators on our platform accounting around 65% of total revenue, representing a decline of about 4 percentage points year-over-year, which also effectively improved our gross margin.</p><p>And looking ahead, we will implement a comprehensive set of measures to calculate our content creators and keep a balance between the income growth of content creators and improvement of our profit margin by driving the topline growth.</p><p>For the content creators, we will adopt to various operational strategies, including traffic and creation support, attractive incentive policies and AI-driven content recommendations, among others, to enable content creators to attract more followers in wider popularity and increase their success on our platform.</p><p>On the user side, we will continue to focus on improving user engagements, promoting paying user conversion and increase users' willingness to pay to increase our overall revenue. I believe with our platform remains a good growth momentum, and our creators will experience a corresponding increase in income. And subsequently, this will allow us to further refine our revenue sharing structure.</p><p>In addition, we will continue to innovate new business model and explore more overseas markets, with growth potential to create new opportunities for our long-term and sustainable growth with higher profitability. Thanks.</p><p>VICKY WEI: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: There are no further questions now. So, I'd like to turn the call back over to the Company for closing remarks.</p><p>EFFY KANG: Thank you, once again, for joining us today.

Please go ahead, ma'am.</p><p>JINGJING DU, HEAD OF INVESTOR RELATIONS, ZHIHU INC.: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today are Mr. Yuan Zhou, Chairman and CEO of Zhihu; and Mr. Sun, Wei, our CFO. Before we start, we would like to remind you that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

In addition, a webcast replay of this conference call will be available on our website at ir.zhihu.com. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Sun, Wei, our CFO.</p><p>WEI SUN, CFO, ZHIHU INC.: Okay. Thank you, Jingjing. I'm pleased to deliver today's opening remarks on behalf of Mr. Zhou, Yuan, Founder and CEO of Zhihu. Thank you for joining Zhihu's 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. As one of the largest online content communities in China, we have always been committed to the development of our content-centric ecosystem through continuous community infrastructure enhancements, user base expansion and monetization capability improvement. Our fast-growing user base is primarily young and cross-generational, infusing our platform with vitality, while our content-centric monetization model differentiates us with sizable growth potential.</p><p>Against the backdrop of rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions, our distinctive model vibrant user community and the continuous accumulation of high-quality content serves as not only a moat in the competitive pan-entertainment arena, but as compounding driving forces propelling long-term sustainable growth of our user base and monetization channel.</p><p>In Q3, we delivered another solid set of financial and operating results with our average MAUs reaching 101.2 million, up 40% year-over-year, and average monthly viewers growing to 542 million. As of the end of the third quarter, the cumulative pieces of content on our platform reached 458.9 million, including 398.4 million questions and answers, representing a year-over-year increase of 43% and 38%, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, our average number of monthly active content creators increased to 3.6 million, of which, the average number of monthly video content creators increased 86% year-over-year. Meanwhile, our content-centric monetization initiatives continued to gain traction, evidenced by a 115% year-over-year increase in revenue to RMB 823.5 million, and a 110% year-over-year increase in average monthly paying members to 5.5 million.</p><p>During the second quarter, we upgraded our high-quality content assessment standard by introducing sense of fulfillment. We took further steps in Q3 to update the mechanism for content creation, distribution, consumption and platform interactions and made remarkable progress. High-quality content with characteristics of broadening horizon, providing solutions and resonating with mind was widely recognized by both users and content creators and helped drive the growth of our community.</p><p>In categories which carry more sense of fulfillment content, including engineering, economics and law, graphics and text views increased by 136%, 58% and 112% and related user engagement increased by 102%, 134% and 111%, all within just 2 months. The views of high-quality video content with a sense of fulfillment on our platform increased by over 140% in the 2 months. The implementation of the standard of a sense of fulfillment brought users with fulfilling content and prompt higher levels of user engagement on our platform. Before the final announcement of the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this year, under the topic of 2021 Nobel price tour, a Zhihu user has successfully predicted the sub-display with the highest probability of winning with supporting reasons. In addition to targeting a massive user base, in the quarter, we focused particularly on enriching content that met our new sense of fulfillment standard to appeal to various user communities. For example, in October this year, our published children's popular science cartoon book titled A Hundred Thousand Whys, was well received by young parents.</p><p>Beyond heightening user consumption, sense of fulfillment content also benefits creators by encouraging more user engagement and providing more opportunities for commercial income generation. A good example comes from SHEN Shao, Neo, one of our veteran digital content creator. He had accumulated more than 1,000 high-quality answers over the past 8 years on Zhihu, recently released detailed sharing of entry-level watch selections, which not only yield 13,000 upvotes, but also provided the creator with corresponding commercial income. Content creation on Zhihu's platform has now become an important income source for him.</p><p>The successful implementation of the new content standard not only provided our users with broadly expanded content coverage, but also demonstrated our differentiated value proposition in our ability to influence topic direction and discussion depths. For example, during the Tokyo Olympics, while many community platforms were just celebrating team victories or focusing on individual performances, the Zhihu community was having in-depth discussions on the reasons behind wins or loses. Prominent topics on Zhihu fell under threat, like \"how the Chinese women's volleyball team lost to the United States at 0 to 3\", where various perspectives were shared on strategies, rules, economics, etc. It's these types of discussions and the user interests that have given rise to Zhihu's nickname (foreign language), which means, master of skills or tactics.</p><p>After Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen lost the Ping-Pong Mixed Doubles during the Olympics, Zhihu users responded with intellectual curiosity and theories, Rather than emotionally-driven discussions, Zhihu's community gave rise to topics such as \"medal theory\" and \"Olympics Spirit\", which became the positive and guiding force of online discussion.</p><p>As we continue our efforts to improve creation, distribution and the consumption of our content with a sense of fulfillment, we have also preserved community compliance. Through proactive community governance and the scrutiny of non-compliance content, we strive to enhance user's trustworthiness by fostering a community characterized by sincerity, expertise and respect.</p><p>In Q3, heightening content timeliness provided users a better platform experience by enabling them to more quickly and easily find fulfilling content with timeliness within our massive content library. This was proven particularly effective with the devastating floods in Henan, which we shared in our previous call. More than 160 topics related to the Henan floods were generated within 10 days on Zhihu platform, with nearly 150 million page views. After the astonishing news of WU Yifan broke, Zhihu users carry out national in-depth discussions on associated legal factors under the table rules of entertainment industry and the fan economy. The average number of pieces of content with timeliness generated on our platform on a daily basis increased by 40% this September versus this April.</p><p>It is encouraging to see more and more users in our community consuming content with timeliness with the related DAU penetration rate exceeding 40% at the end of third quarter. To better satisfy user demand for high-quality content in various categories and diverse formats, we encourage creators with different specialties to work together and jointly introduce more content, especially videolized content. In Q3, the number of average monthly uploaded videos increased by 290% year-over-year. The average number of pieces of video content consumed per user under our video tab and core Q&amp;A scenario also continue to increase. As of the end of September, the number of DAUs who consume video content increased to 37%.</p><p>In October, we launched a new feature named, \"Joint Creation\", which allows text creators to authorize video creators to use their original answers as the basis for video script and share the copyright with them. Initiatives like this not only amplifies our high-quality content library, but also prompt more user engagement. A video named, \"Looking at the word through data, how far is the gap between SU Bingtian and bolt\", is an excellent case, demonstrating the synergy effect of content utilization through joint creation. This video was adapt from a blockbuster graphic and text content with 10,000 upvotes originally created by Chenqin, a 10-year Zhihu creator veteran. The video extension of this content was widely spread, receiving over 2 million views across our platform and gaining vast recognition inside and outside Zhihu's platform.</p><p>Driven by the abundant coverage, diversified formats, and improved timeliness of high-quality content, our user base maintained its high growth momentum. During the third quarter, our average MAUs exceeded 100 million, a record high. Average monthly viewers reached 540 million, and among which the penetration rate of MAUs increased to 18.7%. More than that, the value proposition of our community is steadily attracting users across ages and across regions, making our user base increase in a more balanced and healthy manner.</p><p>In Q3, the percentage of female users grew to 47% from 44% in the same period of last year. Along with the improvement of content timeliness, our user group of those who over 30 also grew steadily in both numbers and activeness, further solidifying our unique and vibrant community ecosystem. At the same time, expanding our content format capabilities enables us to satisfy younger generations' demands for learning, life and entertainment. In preparation for the school season starting in September, we launched a series of program titled First Lessons for University, where graduates were invited to share their valuable experiences and insights.</p><p>Delving into 6 relevant topics, the series resonated strongly with younger users, attracting more than 800 million views and the promising massive discussions. Geographically, the number of users in Tier 2 cities or below also continued to increase in Q3. Through expanding content category coverage, providing more content with timeliness and offering diversified consumption formats, we aim to create an inclusive platform where all users in our community can feel a sense of belonging.</p><p>Our massive and active user base infuses our communities with energy and constantly reinforces it by generating high-quality content, which in return, attracts more talented content creators to join us and make contributions. As of the end of Q3, the cumulative number of content creators on the Zhihu platform reached 53.1 million. By providing more and better tools, assistance and incentives for the content creators based on their differentiated capabilities and needs, we were able to help them improve their creation experience under the new standard and further gain recognition and user trust within our community. In addition to further upgrading the tools, \"video sectioning\" and \"match the Q&amp;A\" launched last quarter. We iterated the function to generate PPT video through OneClick. The Joint Creation feature launched in October was designed and aim to help creators improve their creation capabilities by allowing them to focus on what they do best.</p><p>For example, a high-quality answer about the brain with 41,000 upvotes generated by a Zhihu user, (foreign language) was adapted into a video by a video creator (foreign language) and received more than 4 million views. Supported by high-quality text content, the video named, \"how big is the impact of college entrance examination of future income\", \"how to quantify the long-term impact of poor scores in college entrance exams\", received more than 2.59 million views and more than 3,000 upvotes on our platform since its launch.</p><p>By the mid of November, thousands of graphics and text creators had participated in content authorization through Joint Creation, with the total accumulated authorized content exceeding 1.8 million pieces, which demonstrated that this is the right strategy to meet content creators most real and pressing needs.</p><p>Driven by the richness of high-quality content with a sense of fulfillment, the commercial value of our community and our young and cross-generational user base both maintained their growth momentum, further solidifying our community ecosystem.</p><p>In recognition of our increasing brand value in October, Zhihu was once again named in Kantar BrandZ list of \"top 100 Most Valuable Chinese Brands\" for 2021, ranking 7 places higher than last year. Underpinned by Zhihu's increasingly prominent brand and unique content-centric monetization model, our commercial efficiency has continuously improved. More brands and business partners are recognizing Zhihu as an important platform to gain visibility. As more content creators joined the Zhihu's ecosystem, we were able to cooperate with a huge number of commercial content creators in different specialties and together make achievements and share the benefits by expanding user coverage and improving commercial efficiency.</p><p>In Q3, revenue from CCS increased by more than 5x compared with the same period last year, reaching RMB 278 million. Average monthly paying members reached 5.5 million, representing 110% year-over-year growth. And the revenue from paid membership increased by 96% to RMB 178 million year-over-year.</p><p>Moving forward, we plan to further enrich high-quality content and strengthen our content-centric monetization solution, especially in categories, including e-commerce and vocational education, further enhancing our closed-roof ecosystem as well as increasing our value as a business partner.</p><p>Before our CFO provides highlights and additional color on our financial results, I would like to share with you some major progress we have made centering around our content ecosystem in Q3. To better serve our content creators and to improve their commercial and community influence, in September, we updated our Cheese Platform by using composite influence index and formally released the ranking of content creators on Cheese Platform. This platform is aimed to help content creators improve their monetization capability by providing a transparent transaction model, multitasking mode and effective data indicator assessment.</p><p>In the third quarter, the number of creators who achieved commercial income tripled compared to the same period of last year. Our creators may now increase their commercial income through 6 diversified channels, including commercial content, paying membership content, Recommended Goodies and consulting solutions, et cetera. The experience of ZHE Sanye, one of our Yan selection authors, is a great example of this. Through his urban story series, which attracted nearly 160,000 users, he was able to realize close to RMB 1 million income during the third quarter.</p><p>As an important platform influencing the young generation lifestyle and the consumption decisions, we have become the desirable platform with effective content-centric commercial solutions for thousands of brands and merchants in the fields of beauty, cosmetics, personal care, e-commerce, FMCG, vocational education, et cetera. In the third quarter, the number of brands and merchants that use our content-commerce solutions increased 200% compared to the same period of last year. And GMV on our platform reached a new high of nearly RMB 5 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 92% as of the end of third quarter.</p><p>We released our 2021 Zhihu Top 100 list at the end of October. The list comprises 100 products across various categories, including clothing, food, housing and travel, selected by participating Zhihu users based on their professional and personal experience as well as our big data analysis. Users are not only impressed by items like the \"pillow with the most upvotes\" , \"must eat snail powder\" and \"the handiest cookware\", but also enjoyed fulfilling content while reading through the selection experiences, leading to a mutual gain for both users and creators.</p><p>High-quality content with a sense of fulfillment is not only a key factor in inspiring the trustworthiness among users, content creators and the Zhihu community, it is also a determinant in strengthening Zhihu's industry-leading position. As we forge ahead, we will continue to encourage content creators to produce more high-quality and fulfilling content and help brands and merchants achieve healthy business growth.</p><p>We believe that the meaningful interplay between users, content and monetization is the driving engine in advancing our robust community ecosystem, reaching new heights and achieving sustained long-term growth.</p><p>This concludes the remarks from Mr. Yuan Zhou. I will now review and provide more details of our financial performance for Q3 2021.</p><p>As just mentioned, we achieved another strong quarter recording total revenue of RMB 823.5 million, which represented a year-over-year increase of 115%.</p><p>Our unique content-centric business model is increasingly showing its strength and ability to drive our business growth, keeping pace with our fast growing and vibrant user base.</p><p>In the third quarter, content-commerce solutions and paid membership combined to contribute over 55% of the total revenue. Our commitment to our content-commerce solutions strategy has continued to gain market awareness.</p><p>In Q3, content-commerce solutions contributed RMB 278.4 million to total revenue. This fivefold year-over-year increase caused content-commerce solutions as a percentage of total revenue to grow significantly. It is further underpinned by the continuous improvement of our commercial content ecosystem, as well as increasing recognition and growing demand from our diverse business partners and merchants. The number of our CCS customers tripled in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2020, as we broaden our coverage to encompass over 20 industries, Moreover, we also saw a significant increase in content creator participation in this business line, facilitated through our Cheese Platform, which launched in late May this year.</p><p>In the third quarter, the number of creators who have joined our Cheese Platform and achieved commercial income exceeded 10,000. We believe this demonstrates that we are on the right track and helping our content creators reach their commercial goals. Advertising in the third quarter maintained its strong momentum despite ad industry headwinds. In the quarter, advertising revenue was RMB 321.1 million, representing a 39% year-over-year increase. Underpinned by our advantage as a comprehensive content platform, an increasingly wide range of advertisers now consider us as a must-have marketing platform due to our ability to connect their adverts with our broad user base.</p><p>In the third quarter, companies from the field of e-commerce, personal care and cosmetics, automobile (including new energy and traditional brands), IT and 3C were our strongest growing contributors.</p><p>Our paid membership contributed RMB 178.3 million to total revenue in the quarter, representing an increase of 96% compared to the same period of last year. As of the end of the third quarter, our average monthly paying members reached 5.5 million, with a paying ratio of 5.4%. The strong momentum in this business line also benefited from enhanced content creator commercialization capabilities.</p><p>Other revenues mainly comprising the e-commerce and vocational education achieved year-over-year growth, exceeding 200% in the third quarter, increasing to RMB 45.7 million. Our e-commerce business continued its rapid growth momentum, with GMV exceeding RMB 1.4 billion in the quarter. As Zhou Yuan just mentioned, we made further strides to enhance our Recommended Goodies business. By bringing more fulfilling content and greater engagement to our commercial ecosystem, we can better meet our users' needs and create synergies with our other content-centric monetization approaches.</p><p>Our vocational education services business which primarily provides online vocational and professional training for adults, has had a great success with the self-paced courses, including those covering video production skills and the postgraduate entrance exam preparation.</p><p>We maintained a strong gross margin of 52% in the third quarter, while remaining dedicated to continuous investments in our content ecosystem.</p><p>The third quarter also witnessed improvements in operating efficiency as our total operating expenses of RMB 747.3 million declined as a percentage of total revenue, on both a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. Our operating expenses in the quarter were primarily composed of sales and marketing expenses and investments in human resources. Our user acquisition strategies leveraging our high-quality content library have proven themselves to be of great economic benefit. We've seen that content with timeliness, including content related to the Tokyo Olympics and the topics related to the start of the academic year and college recruitment not only drove organic incremental user growth but also effectively encourage user interactions in Zhihu community.</p><p>As a result, our non-GAAP adjusted net loss, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, was RMB 112.4 million in the third quarter 2021. As of September 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents, term deposits, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB 7.6 billion, compared with RMB 3.1 billion as of December 2020.</p><p>Finally, on to our financial outlook. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2021, the company expects total revenue to be in the range of RMB 1.01 billion to RMB 1.03 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of between 94.3% and 98.2%. As a reminder, this outlook reflects Zhihu's current and preliminary estimate and is subject to change.</p><p>This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready for the Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)</p><p>Our first question today, we'll come from Yiwen Zhang of China Renaissance.</p><p>YIWEN ZHANG, ANALYST, CHINA RENAISSANCE: I have 2 questions. First question is regarding our CCS business. We noticed there are a number of new products launched in the Double 11 promotion. For example, we have the Zhihu top 100 list. Can you share more color around what we did during this Double 11 campaign? And the second is our videolization strategy. Can you discuss in details from both supplier and the consumption side. For example, on the supply side with the joint operated program announced; on the consumption side, we noticed that the video cap and now the first on the home page. So can you give us any more details?</p><p>WEI SUN: Okay. I'll just answer the first question in Chinese, and Zhou Yuan will take number 2.</p><p>(foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Okay. So CFO, for just the first question. As we explained in the remarks, the CCS has improved a lot -- continues to improve a lot, especially in this quarter. We had a year-over-year increase of over 500x and a quarter-on-quarter increase of over 30%. And this is basically due to our constant construction of a good ecosystem for high-quality content on Zhihu. And also, we are playing in more and more profound influence over people's buying decisions, and there are more brands and merchants and units of commercials joining our platform, and you see that we have a much better ever-improving reputations in the market year-over-year.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] For this Double 11 sales gala specifically, we have launched activities such as top 100 list to promote and make recommendations on our community to help our users to make buying decisions and purchase the goods they want. And we are working together with e-commerce platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba, that covers a number of sectors, including clothing, food, traveling and living, and also our users are able to enjoy a sense of fulfillment during their decision-making process. The GMV we had as of the end of third quarter is RMB 4.97 billion, which represented a year-on-year growth of 92%, and our daily order number in Q3 increased by 31%. And also at the same time, what is worth noting is that Zhihu's take rate had increased by over 200%.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] At the same time, we continue to explore and develop our business models in terms of e-commerce. We will continue to have further business integrations with regard to our goods recommendations and brand building and our content commerce-based marketing activities by the merchants. So as to make the monetization more efficient, and also, we're exploring ways to have a close-loop e-commerce platform within our community and to further build on our self-branded businesses and brand building activities inside of our Zhihu platform.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, ZHIHU INC.: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] So this is from CEO, Zhou Yuan. We are very happy that you have noticed a difference in our product. Actually, this is not the final version, this just a grey version or better version that we just launched.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Just as I said, this is just a version for exploration for new practices, and it's not just for videos, it's more than videos. We want to launch this to improve our monitoring on the users on our community to try to understand their attention, their behaviors as well as their private traffic -- private domain traffic, and to understand their interactions and engagement on our community. And second, as you rightly pointed out, that is that we have a video tab on our home page. And third thing, I want to just keep it secret for the time being, because after we officially launched it in December, we will give you more details in due time. So all of these efforts are to try to make our user experience more simplified and more interesting.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] So since we are testing that we saw very nice feedbacks. So they're from the consumer side -- from the consumer side, from the consumption of the video, you see that we have very nice -- very nice metrics, including very nice VV and the retention rate as well as time spent and cardshow, they all have displayed very nice potentials. And we keep hitting the users for their feedback, and we have very quick updates and iterations of this better version that we have.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] From the content creation side of the story, you see that our daily uploads of videos increased by nearly 300 percentage points and our monthly active video content creators increased by 86%. And after we have pushed forward the standard sense of fulfillment for making video content, we have received very good support from the content creators, especially those who have high sense of creativity and great imaginations, who actively join us as a content creator for videos in the ecosystem.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] I want to say something more about Joint Creation. As you know that on the content creation part, we have very nice video makers together with very nice users who have nice views and ideas. So they work together through sharing copyright. They delivered very nice video content. So we believe that it is not only a new product, but it -- is also a new format of generation of content and consumption of content. And I also want to share 2 numbers with you, that is the consumption of videos as our community keeps increasing. The video consumption penetration rate in DAU for this quarter was 37% versus 30% in the last quarter.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question today will come from Ashley Xu of Credit Suisse.</p><p>ASHLEY XU, RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] It's mainly related to our lower-tier city penetration. Just want to understand how is our videolization helping us in these regions? And how is the user behavior different between higher and lower tier cities? And if you look forward, what's our plan and strategy to expand our penetration in lower-tier cities?</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] So the focus of our video is to focus on getting more videos with sense of fulfillment on our community, especially on the supply and consumption of such videos. We believe that this is some strategy that we will stick to for the longer term to differentiate ourselves and also to build our core competitiveness.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] In terms of sense of fulfillment, as a new standard that we propose for video content has been very well received and very well recognized by our users as proved by our survey recently.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] As we are cracking down low quality videos, the deal gives a more focus and priority to high-quality videos. You see that we have seen improved popularity of high-quality videos, especially those who has -- that has a sense of fulfillment as we improved our discovery and distribution mechanisms for those videos. There -- those videos have been saved for more time, shared for more time and has also help us to improve the retention rates of users, especially you see the second month retention rate for users have improved 1 percentage point this quarter.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] So the supply side of the video content, we have this Joint Creation mechanism as well as answers by videos. So all these are the upgrades to the product side and the tools side to help people provide more video content. So right now, our joint creation are increasing very quickly. We now have over 1.8 million authorizations of text and images for video making that helps us to translate more and more highly voted answers in text and images to highly voted videos. By way of example, the cooperation between (foreign language) and (foreign language), they delivered a 4 million viewed video by jointly -- by creating based on a highly voted answer with over 410 upvotes. So that is a very good example of how joint creation has been effectively working for us in the supply side of the content.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] On the consumption side of the video content, well, actually the consumers of the video are pretty much the same as the general users that we have in terms of the profiling of users, except that they are younger. Well, they have 3 percentage higher in terms of those who are under 30 years old for video consumption versus the general users. So on that -- I believe that this actually means that our video content is pretty much in line with those with the demands of those on our community, especially we had been able to cover more uses and cater their demands with our video content creation.</p><p>OPERATOR: And our next question today will come from Piyush Mubayi of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>PIYUSH MUBAYI, MD, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: The first on the third quarter, when I combine advertising and CCS, you grew 117% despite the pressures on the advertising market in general. Can you take us through the verticals that have come through very nicely for you for the quarter? And then looking at your guidance for the fourth quarter of almost 100% growth, could you give us the building blocks of that, both in terms of MAU as well as how strongly I expect advertisers to grow in the fourth quarter? And while this is very early, could you also look forward to that 2022, I realize it's very preliminary, but nonetheless, and give us a feel for the pace of growth you would expect on a preliminary basis, if possible?</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Thank you very much for your question. In terms of advertisement and advertisement verticals, well, for Q3, you see that the most affected sectors such as K-12 education and insurance, well, they used to have very small percentage points in our advertisement contribution, therefore the impact is very minimal to our business.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] If you look at the breakdown of advertisement verticals by sector, you see that e-commerce, consumer goods, internet services, IT, and CCS are the main sectors that we have advertisements from, and they all had very stable and nice growth of 80% year-on-year. And I think we benefited a lot because our merchant client -- the advertisement clients are switching their marketing expenses from traditional media platforms to some platforms like us, which we can produce very nice content and deliver nice and holistic content commerce solution.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] For automobiles and housing furniture, we have very a nice and innovative benefits and registered double-digit growth in those 2 sectors and more.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] So the above-mentioned factors put together accounted for over 60% of our advertisement.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] And we believe that going into the fourth quarter, we will continue to have very nice growth coming out of e-commerce, FMCG, 3C, IT and et cetera. And reasons that I explained before, that we, as a content community, are able to provide good platforms for people to build their brands to deliver very nice and quality content for the marketing efforts and to have a diversified advantages in helping the advertisers to market themselves.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Going into 2022, we believe that our total revenue will continue to grow in a fast pace and the percentage point has contributed from CCS and advertisement, will again account for about 70% to 75% of the total revenue we make.</p><p>WEI SUN: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Sorry, the percentage points actually means the number for Q4, not for 2022; I'm sorry.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question today will come from Natalie Wu of Haitong International.</p><p>YUE WU, RESEARCH ANALYST, HAITONG INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH LIMITED: (foreign language)</p><p>I will translate myself. And I have 2 questions here. The first 1 is a follow-up to the last question. So just wondering for our current fourth quarter outlook, almost triple-digit growth. Can you help us break down among each business line, specifically for the rest of 2, like membership and e-commerce and other business line revenue growth for the fourth quarter? And secondly, for the e-commerce business, we noticed that you have ramped up your 1P business recently, just wondering for our e-commerce GMV in the third quarter, how much comes from your 1P business, which initiated like, I think, this number? Also just curious how should we think of the strategic position for your 1P and 3P business going forward? And also future split for like GMV growth?</p><p>WEI SUN: Sorry, sorry, I was on mute just now.</p><p>(foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Well, as I mentioned in Q4, our revenue outlook will be 70% to 75% coming from CCS and advertisement together, and 20% for membership. And for the others, education, e-commerce and others coming together will be 5 percentage points. So furthermore on our e-commerce business, we believe that our e-commerce development will continue to center around good content, because we believe good content is good business. And we believe that one question is one street and one answer is a good shop. We keep -- we continue to help the consumers and users to identify those goods that are worth buying by our uploading systems to select the most reliable answers and then continue to help them with the transaction. And we believe that this is going to deliver very well and to bring benefits to both content creators merchants as well as Zhihu community as a whole.</p><p>And as I mentioned, the GMV we have for the third quarter is RMB 4.97 billion, and with the daily -- order increased on a daily basis of 31 percentage points and our take rate also increased by more than 100%. And all of those efforts are helping us to improve the monetization efficiency. And for our 1P business, we are trying now in helping the brands and also to help them to create content based marketing and promotion. And this is by far the final version of 1P e-commerce that we have -- revolutionizing the models as we going forward, and we believe that those will deliver better and better results going forward in the future.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Alex Yao of JPMorgan.</p><p>ALEX C. YAO, HEAD OF ASIA INTERNET AND NEW MEDIA RESEARCH, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: (foreign language)</p><p>So my first question is about the strategy to attract the content contributors on the video content side. Are we doing anything different compared to the content strategy on the picture and the text side. Particularly, China's video market is predominantly driven by entertainment or any content. So on the video content side, are we using this opportunity to broaden content jar and the coverage into entertainment already to content supply? Or are we sticking to our core platform and the community attributes and still focusing on the knowledge-based content drivers? And the second question is about the implementation of the PIPL, which took place on 1st of November. Are you guys seeing any difference before and after the implementation of PIPL? And how should we think about the impact on operation and monetization?</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Answer from CEO, Zhou Yuan. So for the first question, video is not the result. Video is not what we want to do by choice. It is a natural result of our strategy of running the community. We believe that video is indispensable part and parcel of our community, and by building a nice ecosystem, we are able to let the video content organically grow out of our good community.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Our video content creators, we believe that they are versatile, let us just call them a full stack of video content creator. They're very good at making videos, very good at answering questions. They can also do live streaming. And by utilizing different formats of content, they are able to deliver the best possible results and attract the most attention from the community.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] For the time being, you see a lot of upgrades in terms of the tours that we give to content creators and operational transformation that gives more attention to the video content. Actually answered by video is not just something new. We believe that video is just a more suitable format of people giving answers and this just grow very fast naturally. Second is the Joint Creation. I would believe that it is by no means using videos to replace text and images. We believe that by putting them all together, we could deliver one plus one is more than 2 kind of result in our community.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] These topics and discussions you see on our community covers all kinds of sectors. And with an umbrella principle that is a sense of the fulfillment. So by asking and encouraging content creators to make videos that can bring sense of fulfillment, you see very nice engagement and very nice growth.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] Now with regard to new regulations PIPL we believe that the purpose of having the businesses like us to be compliant as for the better good of the entire industry to make it healthy, to make it more sustainable for the longer term.</p><p>YUAN ZHOU: (foreign language)</p><p>[Interpreted] In terms of our own compliance efforts, we keep talking very frequently with the regulators. And I think this is a long-term thing. And our own internal practices or operations, we keep trying out good solutions for user experience and testing out the data and et cetera. We believe that this will virtually become a new normal, and we are -- we have always been proactive in cooperating with the regulators and make sure that we are coping with all the requirements.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jingjing for any additional or closing remarks.</p><p>JINGJING DU: Thank you once again for joining us today. And if you have any further questions, please contact our IR team directly, or TPG Investor Relations. Thank you all.

As we continue our efforts to improve creation, distribution and the consumption of our content with a sense of fulfillment, we have also preserved community compliance. Through proactive community governance and the scrutiny of non-compliance content, we strive to enhance user's trustworthiness by fostering a community characterized by sincerity, expertise and respect. In Q3, heightening content timeliness provided users a better platform experience by enabling them to more quickly and easily find fulfilling content with timeliness within our massive content library. This was proven particularly effective with the devastating floods in Henan, which we shared in our previous call. More than 160 topics related to the Henan floods were generated within 10 days on Zhihu platform, with nearly 150 million page views. After the astonishing news of WU Yifan broke, Zhihu users carry out national in-depth discussions on associated legal factors under the table rules of entertainment industry and the fan economy. The average number of pieces of content with timeliness generated on our platform on a daily basis increased by 40% this September versus this April. It is encouraging to see more and more users in our community consuming content with timeliness with the related DAU penetration rate exceeding 40% at the end of third quarter. To better satisfy user demand for high-quality content in various categories and diverse formats, we encourage creators with different specialties to work together and jointly introduce more content, especially videolized content.

With that said, I'll now hand over the call to Mr. Devesh Srivastava. Over to you, sir.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA, CHAIRMAN, MD &amp; CEO, GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA: Thank you. Thank you, Binay Ji. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to announce the financial performance for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. We would like to assure you that we are continuously taking all necessary measures to improve our overall profitability. The combined ratio goes to remain at an uncomfortable range, and it has been a constant endeavor to bring down our combined ratio of below 100.</p><p>Let me now take you through some of the key highlights of the financial performance. The gross premium income of the company was INR 8,374 crores for Q2 FY '22, as compared to INR 10,651 crores for Q2 FY '21. The investment income stood at INR 2,669 crores in Q2 FY '22 as compared to INR 2,767 crores in Q2 FY '21. Incurred claims ratio declined to 92% in Q2 FY '22 as compared to 101% in Q2 FY '21 due to our prudent approach.</p><p>Combined ratio in Q2 FY '22 remained flat at 122.2%, an versus 122.1% for Q2 FY '21. The adjusted combined ratio, by taking into consideration the policyholders' investment income, works out to 104.4% for H1 FY '22 as compared to 102.89% in H1 FY '21.</p><p>The company recorded profit before tax of INR 1,213.75 crores in Q2 FY '22 as against INR 412.28 crores in Q2 FY '21 and profit after tax of INR 1010.55 crores in Q2 FY '22 as against INR 230.05 crores in Q2 FY '21. Solvency ratio increased to 1.88% as on 30/9/2021 as compared to 1.63% on 30/9/2020. Net worth of the company, without fair value change account, increased to INR 22,691 crores as on 30/9/2021, as against INR 20,123 crores as on 30/9/2020. Net worth of the company, including fair value change account, increased to INR 55,088 crores as on 30/9/2021, as against INR 39,628 crores as on 30/9/2020.</p><p>On the premium breakup, domestic premium for H1 FY '22 is INR 15,616 crores and the international is INR 7,048 crores. The percentage split is domestic 69% and international, 31%. So there is a degrowth in the domestic premium by around 12%, while the international book has decreased by 19%.</p><p>We are seeing a gradual improvement in the external environment, and remain confident of improved performance going forward as we expect the combined ratio to going downwards in the coming quarters. Having given the highlights now, we will open the floor for questions from the interested parties. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We take the first question from the line of Sanketh Godha from Spark Capital.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA, VP, SPARK CAPITAL ADVISORS (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sir, the basic question which we have is a agree GWP in the current quarter is a negative number. So just wanted to understand why there is a derecognition of gross premium number with respect to crop in second quarter? And along with that, the -- another question with respect to GWP growth is that the health portfolio has seen a significant decline. And so is the fire segment. So sir, just wondering whether it is domestic market or overseas market led to the decline in these 2 line items.</p><p>So that's my first question. And the second question is just trying to understand why the commission ratio is almost 30 percentage in the current quarter, which usually doesn't happen to us. So just wondering why it led to such a high increase in the commission ratio to 30-odd percentage?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Sanketh, as you would have -- you have been following GIC quite -- for quite a long while. You would have seen that our entire endeavor was to get the agri portfolio back on track because it was getting out of hand. We had too much exposures in agri, and that was also biting us. Now when we pruned our portfolio last year, there was a substantial amount of premium that we let go, which was not making sense to us.</p><p>This year, what has happened is that because of the cutting down on the premiums last year, a fallout has happened. And that is the premium decrease, you see, of course, I'll request Mr. Hitesh Joshi, our General Manager, looking at agri to answer that. He can also pick up the health question because health is also his beat.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Sir, I understand it's a decline, but my question is why it is a negative number in the second quarter? So it is minus INR 328 crores in the second quarter, sir just failing to understand why it is a negative number in premium?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI, GM &amp; IR MANAGER, GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA: Yes, Sanketh, see, what happens at the beginning of the year in terms of, say, agri, first quarter bookings are essentially based on estimates, based on the treaties that are incepting on 1st April. So whatever are the premium projections of the companies for the current season, we try to apportion that in our premium recognition.</p><p>As we enter the second quarter, we get to know the exact ground level registrations of the farmer. And we come to know whether the business projections made by the various cedents under various treaties, whether they are acute or not. So when we got this data from the cedent, there was an underachievement. We are correcting. Actually, you are supposed to look the 2 quarters collectively, because first quarter is an estimate, and we don't know what is the exact figure that -- that clarity visibility comes only in the second quarter. That is why there is a degrowth.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Got it. Sir, even if I look quantity, the crop had declined 17 percentage, that is for half-to-half comparison. Sir, do we -- do you expect a similar even including Rabi, the decline will be of similar amount around 15 to 30-odd percentage?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes, I would say so as long as there is an intercompany interest rate balance parity in their market share. It may not be exactly like that, but broadly, it can be expected to remain same.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Have you lost market share in agri, sir?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Sorry?</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Have you lost market share to overseas or foreign reinsurers?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: No, whatever we have cut down on April, see, the domestic business is frozen at 1st April renewals. So then there is no further increase or decrease. That almost decides our market share. Barring the ground level higher or lower registration of the farmers. Does it help, Sanketh? Am I clear?</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Yes. Now you can -- it will be great if you can explain it on the health part -- so health and fire part?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes. In the health, actually, I think it was broadly explained in the first quarter also that whatever was this stipulation by the IRDAI in regard to the discontinuation of the capital gearing treaties or fixed margin treaties, there was a major treaty, which was not renewed and it will continue to impact us for the next 2 quarters as well.</p><p>Essentially, we did not renew a major contract on April 21 as vis-a-vis what was written at April '20. So it will have that lingering effect on all the 4 quarters. And that contract had a size of about 25% plus of our entire health portfolio.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: So should I assume, it is (inaudible), sir, because they discontinued the insurance treaty. Should I assume it is (inaudible)?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes, yes.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. Okay. And on fire, sir?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: One second.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Sanketh, can you repeat the question on fire, please?</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Even in case of fire, sir, in the quarter or even if I look at it on a YTD basis, in the quarter, it is a 32% decline. And it is a 16% or 17% decline in first half in the fire segment BWP where we have seen reinsurance rate hardening, domestic prices also moved up, economic activities improving. So we assume the fire will do well for the industry as a whole, and you will also benefit out of it. But for us, it is declining. So just wondering, the decline largely came from the overseas business because of our rating downgrade? Or is it largely driven by domestic business?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: There is a slight fall -- it's happening in the domestic market, is also because some of the products introduced by IRDA are coming out of the IIB rates. There are -- some of them are being priced differently and as per the regulatory permission. So that's one reason.</p><p>As regards the foreign, it could -- it's a bit regarding the consolidation of books where we have come out of some of the loss-making accounts. And you can see that has resulted in better solvency and improvement in the results.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Sir, can you touch upon on the part IIB rating? What -- which are exactly these products, whether these are large?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: As the performance-based rating for the property risk, it is based on the statistics, I mean, released by the IIB. So there are 3 products which were introduced by IRDA for the (inaudible), MSME segment. So that was basically government-driven where to give benefit to this MSME segment. The rates are more -- I mean, are more, you can say, more lenient and more favorable for encouraging business. So that can have a little bit of effect on the pricing over year.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. So those products will be what percentage of our total fire segment?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Sir, it will be very difficult to say because when we do treaties, we won't get this breakup.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And finally, on the commission ratio, while the commission ratio was so high in the current quarter, which is almost like 29 percentage. Sir, just wondering what led to that increase in the commission ratio in the current quarter?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Sanketh, are you talking about fire or talking about the overall?</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Overall commission ratio, which I calculate as the commission number mentioned in the result, which is around INR 2,161 crores divided by NWP number of INR 7,450 crores. The commission ratio comes to closer to 29 percentage. So last quarter, it was 18.6. And to the extent I know I never seen such kind of a high commission ratio in GICD for any quarter. So just wondering why the commission ratio has gone up because that is the single reason why the combined ratio came at 122 percentage despite loss ratio improved significantly.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: You're right. Sanketh, if you see the results, the commissions have only moved from 19% to 21% up to the half year.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Yes. But for the second quarter, I'm saying, sir, only for the second quarter?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Right. So I'll request our CFO, Ms. Jayashree Ranade to say a few words.</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE, CFO &amp; GM, GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA: Sanketh ji, there are certain adjustments in our fixed margin treaties regarding commission for the old years, which are closed -- finally closed in this year, and that's why those adjustments have given us increase in Motor Club, and those amounts are substantial, and that is why the impact is seen only in the second quarter. So these adjustments in fixed margin treaties commission adjustments in motor class in particular, have given us this increase in the commission.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. And nothing to do with health contracts now then?</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE: Health contracts are not very hugely impacted.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: But entire pain with respect to the fixed income contracts are done in second quarter? Or we can expect the same thing to flow through Q3 and Q4 also?</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE: I do not see so because we have closed these fixed margin contracts. And hence, the adjustments arose in the second quarter. So in the quarter. Hello. Sanketh ji?</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Yes, ma'am. Can you hear me?</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE: Even motor foreign, there has been -- yes.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Motor foreign, there is a significant growth, and that business is having a different cost structure and distribution aspect to it. So there is a higher cost attached to it. So that is what is contributing and it will at least contribute for the next -- until the end of the year.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Kailash Baheti from [Kalpataru].</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Can you hear me?</p><p>OPERATOR: Yes, sir, we can.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Okay. Sir, my first question is that what is the difference between market value and book value of quoted debt instruments, if you have that number handy as on 30th September?</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE: Debt instruments, we do record at market value in our books of accounts. These are all held to maturity and is recorded at cost. We record our equity and mutual funds at market value, and we book it at the fair value in our balance sheet. So that value has increased to INR 45,085 crores as on 30th of September 2021. Book value of 11 -- INR 12,694 crores -- book value of equity is INR 12,694 crores, and market value is INR 45,085 crores.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Yes. I understand that, that number is, I think, otherwise available. Generally, the insurance companies would have a very large debt portfolio, and it is not uncommon that to give confidence to the stakeholders, the number of unrealized gain on debt is also disclosed at least to the investors or in investor presentation. I understand GIC does not follow that, but I just wanted to check if that number is handy and would you like to share it?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Kailash, what you -- the figure you asked for to give you an exact number would be difficult. We can, however, try to give you something in the vicinity of that. We give an approximate number would that do?</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Yes.</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE: Yes. Kailash Ji, it is in the range of INR 3,500 crores in addition to our book value. So roughly our debt instrument portfolio is INR 53,016 crores. In addition to that, the fair value is around INR 56,500 crores.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: So INR 53,000 crores is book value and INR 56,500 crores roughly would be market value.</p><p>JAYASHREE RANADE: Cannot be exact, but it is around that figure.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: I understand, yes. You have also mentioned about benchmarking with global peers, et cetera. So who would you generally benchmark yourself with, in global peers?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Kailash ji, you see we are already ranked 13. That means essentially, there are 12 reinsurers who are larger than us. When you benchmark yourself, you would obviously benchmark yourself in the top 5, top 7 players in the world. Because if you see the figures, the top 20, 25 reinsurers, amongst them have about 85% of the global reinsurance premium.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Yes, I understand. So if I ask a follow-on question, what would be the average solvency of these top the top 12, 13 or 15 or whatever number you benchmark against, what would be their average solvency, if you have an idea?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Kailash ji, you see a solvency is something that reinsurers tend to have because, in the Western market, for example, the solvency required is 1. You should have assets and liabilities matched. So minimum solvency, 1 is what is required. In the Indian context, the regulator here states 1.5 as the minimum solvency. Now be that as it may, generally reinsurers would tend to have a solvency closer to 2, 1.75 to and in the thereabouts because a very high solvency also means that you're not using your capital efficiently.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Yes, I understand. And if you would look at -- and if you were to book your profit on investment income, then your solvency will probably become 3, 3.5 or whatever. And if you look at your performance, then you should be looking at the performance of your total network and not the network, which is net of the equity. That's my understanding. And what is your view on that?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Kailash ji, you're absolutely right. The moment we get the fair value into account and in tune with the global practices where you do take the market value of your investments into consideration, our solvency jumps. Definitely, it jumps. But then here the law of the land stage that you will calculate and compute your solvency based on the book value of your investment. Now since we have a very good book, which is built over almost 5 decades, Obviously, you can imagine the fair value is considerable. But that is a notional thing for us as far as the regulator is concerned.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: And what stops us from converting if I may ask -- and especially in the context, if I read the AM Best rating rationale, these guys are saying that your earlier business model was a significant amount of investment income and in view of the crash in the share market, the income from investment is uncertain, et cetera, et cetera. Of course, they have been proven completely wrong. But -- if you were to convert a part of your income into unrealized gain into income. Will that not help you significantly in your ratings?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: See, Kailash ji, if you see -- you're talking about the AM Best report, which obviously was based on our book value or the market value at 31st March last year. Now last year when COVID started creeping in and India went into a lockdown, I think around the 22nd or 23rd of March last year when the Prime Minister announced it. It was not only India that was affected by it. It was a global downturn and every market worth its salt was down and out. So were we.</p><p>But the point that you are trying to raise is that why don't we sell our -- I mean sell our equity to get that fair value out into our operations, the point being, would you do that and sell your family silver, we do sell and buy definitely, we do that, but only when we see good opportunities.</p><p>What is the need for us to go into distress selling. There are absolutely none. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever and will continue to be so. We are in no -- we know that our solvency is always there, which we can encash, but there is no need for us to do it. When we see an opportunity, we buy. When we see an opportunity, we sell. And that is what is going to be our strategy even going forward. So there's absolutely no need for us to get into any selling just for the sake of selling.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: I think I am not saying selling just for the sake of selling. My point was that as much as I understand of the insurance business and my understanding would not be that great. But still, when you are into competitive business overseas and if you are competing with reinsurers who are higher rated than you, can you obviously end up getting a business which is maybe have higher loss potential or lesser earning potential, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, ultimately, the family silver, which should be yielding results, it's not yielding results. That's the point I'm trying to make. And the business of insurance is to earn money for the stakeholders or shareholders. It is not just keep the family silver, hidden. And there has been -- there has been disruption of shareholders wealth as you would kindly appreciate.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Sir, reacting to your point regarding encashment of fair value in order to get a boosting in our rating, the rating agencies do fully factor in the unrealized value of the equity and debt portfolio or whatever. So the encashment is immaterial from the point of view of rating agency. Even if we encash our entire unrealized fair value, it will not impact rating.</p><p>Rating also looks at essentially 2, 3 factors apart from the balance strength. It also looks at the operating model, the profitability, the competitive dynamics and competitive strength of our company and the risk management of the company, and there are further subbranches and subtopics, which go into rating.</p><p>So if it were this simple for us to realize the fair value change and get our rating back, we would have certainly done it quite some time back. But I told you fair value is fully recognized in whatever rating they have given to us, but it is operating performance. And let me know that the investment income, which is the peculiar thing in the emerging market context, which on a book value basis in double digit for us is not a very common phenomena in the world and AM Best rating model doesn't give full credit for that.</p><p>Whichever countries are able to achieve underwriting profitability, they have not substantial investment income to cross subsidize, which is not the case with India. So there is a bit of peculiarity and what do you say odd man out kind of for the Indian economy and Indian insurance sector, which rating agency model doesn't fully factor in.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Rating agencies in India has been at longer hedge for a very long time. And even for the country, there is a problem with Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, et cetera. But I'm specifically quoting from the rating rationale of AM Best. They are saying that the investment income is uncertain because of the fall in share market, et cetera. And when I look at the financials of the company or strength of the company 3, when we used to be to A minus to today, I think that we are better on almost every aspect.</p><p>So what -- why are we not able to argue this out with the rating agency that you guys are stupid. And if they are hearing, I'm very happy that should hear and that our rating should be A minus or even higher and not where they have kept us.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Sir, as I mentioned, it is not only balance sheet strength, which is -- there are various parameters. And one of the important parameters, which they consider is also the country credit rating. So it usually acts as ceiling. Now, suppose if we go to another rating agency, almost any other rating agency that tends to be the ceiling. So I mean there are -- it is a multivariable situation. It is not merely balance sheet strength or encashment of fair value change or solvency or that is what is going to determine the rating.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: So it means to say that our rating was downgraded because of India rated?</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: No. No, there were 2 aspects. There was more than 30% drop in our fair value change, which resulted into their consideration of our balance strength at a couple of notches down as compared to what it was before the COVID, together with the overall -- overall loss for the corporation for the year 2021.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: No, exactly. That's the point I'm trying to make. That's what I'm trying to net that you are now at a very, very significantly higher level of fair value gain, which you never was.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Okay, I'll come to that. I'll come to that, sir. The point is that rating agencies are supposed to be forward-looking. They try to chart your path and they should be fairly convinced about your trajectory for the next 6 quarters. Before a better trend, you can -- you are probably seeing the offshoots of improvement, but they would like to wait longer, so that they are assured of the trend, and then there is no further -- there is no reversal. So they tend to react with a particular leg in terms of assuring themselves that there is a real trend towards improvement, though there are offshoots, but they would wait longer.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Understood. One or 2 other questions, small questions. One is that -- do we -- have we circulated any investor presentation before this call?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: It is uploaded on the website. I think that is what we usually do by our rating agencies.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Yes, the investor presentation is always there. I mean it's.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: We'll share with you separately, if we -- I mean there is no issue on that.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: No. But I have been trying to get it from the Bombay Stock Exchange website. And as much as I understand of the legal nuances, you cannot circulate anything. Prior to circulating sending it to the stock exchanges, and it's not appearing on the stock exchange. And the stock exchange takes just about 0.06 or 0.08 second to upload what you would have sent to them. So certainly, you would not have sense to them. Otherwise, it would have been appearing. And even on our website, I find our website to be very, very investor unfriendly. And I have put this in writing to you earlier also. It is extremely difficult to find it. Usually, everything would be under the Investors. And I do not find this under Investors before and I have been trying to find it, how Sanketh's has got it a mystery to me.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Sir, I cannot agree more. We are redesigning our website. Maybe in the next call, you will see different -- something different. You will straight land on the Investor page.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Yes, it's not there on the Investor page. And should there be...</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: We are redesigning, sir. We are redesigning our website.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: And therefore, you are probably giving advantage to the analyst community or shareholders, which is I can tell you, if I put a complaint to stock exchange, you would have a problem. So kindly put our house in order, I obviously, being a shareholder don't want any problem for the company. But this is the minimum. And I have been saying that this is not the first time I've said this, I said this for -- in many of my e-mails to you.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Sure, sir, we're looking to it.</p><p>KAILASH BAHETI: Kindly ensure that the information goes to shareholders first and then the analysts. And the stock exchange first. That's the rule. That's the SEBI rule. You cannot violate it.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: We'll look into it, and we'll rectify. Thank you for your guidance and inputs.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Madhukar Ladha from Elara Capital.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA, ANALYST, ELARA SECURITIES (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to understand on the motor side, also, we've seen a decline year-over-year in this quarter. And on fire as well, we're seeing a decline. How much of it is with respect to the international geographies, which we were any which way is exiting some of the onerous contracts? And how much of it is domestic? So can you split it between domestic growth and international?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Madhukar, as far as the fire portfolio is concerned, the domestic has almost being steady. There is not much of a change over the previous year.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: So year-over-year is flat. So all of the decline is coming from international?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Yes, indeed, indeed. The decline in the fire portfolio is from the international book.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: Right. And motor?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: On the motor, there is a growth. In fact, there's almost a 10% growth over 30th September last year.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: Yes, but that is looking at the first half number. If I look at the second quarter number, when we're seeing a decline of about 8.5% year-over-year and 2.6% Q-o-Q. And then talking about net written premium basis?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: I think that there is -- what is happening is the effect of this capital gearing treaties, which were discontinued. So it is getting offset by the -- what is happening on the motor side in terms of the commercial vehicle demand. So there are 2 trends. One is this -- and then if degrowth is more significant, then I think it is getting reflected in the figures. So I think in first quarter, this degrowth of the motor segment was not so very significant, but it is becoming more significant in the second quarter.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: In the first quarter, last year was quite bad. So there was almost a 50% year-over-year growth. If you look at it on a last year basis, plus almost 10%, 12% odd Q-o-Q growth again in motor last quarter. But this quarter, we are seeing a substantial decline, okay, may also be because of the base effect of last year partly.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes, I think we can agree to that, that there is a base effect.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: There's a little bit of base effect probably, but maybe you can split it between international and domestic.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: Mr. Ladha, does that answer your question?</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: Is the split available between international and domestic?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Madhukar, I can give it to you for the half year. If you're looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter, I can -- we'll have to dig it out.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: Okay, I'll take the half year number and then maybe I can get the quarter number later.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Okay. So the motor from 30th September last year to this year has moved for the foreign one now from INR 1,186 crores to INR 2,178 crores. And for the domestic book, it has moved from INR 2,671 crores to INR 2,170 crores.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: And that you're seeing is because of the capital gearing treaties exiting even on the motor side in the domestic side?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Yes, yes.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: And the international one is where you're paying the higher commissions?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: Okay. My final question is on this commission rate of 28% that we've seen in this quarter. Now what should be sort of the steady state commission ratio after taking into account some of the commission adjustments plus now you have the new motor treaty where you're paying slightly higher commission rates and also because you had some reversals in agri. My guess is that some bit of it is also -- yes, your net written premium has also come down because of that because of the agri reversal, right?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Agri reversal?</p><p>So Madhukar, what exactly was your question?</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: So what would be sort of your commission ratio? If we were to exclude these impacts or going forward, what can we expect?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: I think this question is fairly what you say it is very -- I mean, the range is very wide because it is a function of the composition of the portfolio in terms of proportional and nonproportional. So because proportional is commissioned, nonproportional is no commission. And what do you -- what you see is the aggregated figure. That is number one. Number two, we can have an upfront and fixed commission at a -- for a given class given contract, then it can likely to remain steady. As we try to incentivize the cedent to improve the performance and substitute fixed commission, with the sliding scale or what we call variable commission depending on the probability and incur in percentages, it can fluctuate quite a bit.</p><p>So there is no clear answer as to say, okay, say motor, let us say, foreign is maybe 23% is the right commission level. Commission level is negotiated on each contract every year based on the -- on a rolling basis, based on the trend and the trends in ICR in incur claim ratio. So -- and then this will vary across classes across geographies for a given cedent for the market. So for example, if you are looking at Greece motor, then Greece motor industry -- insurance industry has a peculiar profile. So that will throw up some common commission percentage.</p><p>And then that has to be tracked for the client experience, client contract structure and whether the profitability is assured or whether it is by of a sliding commission. So I think we are -- sorry, I don't think we can give you a very clear range for that matter because it will vary from class to class, contract to contract, geography, whether it is fixed or variable.</p><p>MADHUKAR LADHA: All right. Okay. Maybe when I meet you off-line, I can have a better discussion to understand this a little better.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Avinash Singh from Emkay Global.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, EMKAY GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. On the first 1 is on Life. Of course, in your overall scheme of things, you are more of a general reinsurance player, general insurance than Life, Life for segment. But majority of your Life book is domestic India. And if we see this year, it has sort of a cause significant damage, of course, it is COVID backdrop. So I mean what sort of retrocession you had utilized there? And what sort of a corrective steps you have taken or you have directed your -- the insurers in terms of the repricing using those contracts? And also what sort of price increases you have seen? And what sort of the competition you've seen the domestic range, that's number 1.</p><p>Second is more not to do with quarter half, again, sort of a repetitive in nature. If we were to look at the value creation and if I just go back to the IPO, look at the FY '17 numbers, it was like net worth x share value gains somewhere close to INR 18,000-odd crores and INR 29-odd thousand crores of fair value gain.</p><p>Even today, it's like a net worth is INR 22-odd thousand crores and fair value gain INR 33-odd thousand crores. So -- and in the meantime, because you fair value gains is largely on equity, equity market in these 4 years would have close to double. So in this backlog, it's very clear that over the full year or whatever sort of a dividend you would have paid is being paid more or less from that the fair value gains that you've realized. And overall for more than 4 years -- in the net-net the operating or I mean, the underwriting has continued to do sort of a negative contribution.</p><p>Now how in this sort of environment, it 4 years or 4.5 years, it's a pretty long time. So how do we see that rolled ahead? I mean how are we going to see that? Again, I'm not saying a 20% ROE or like -- but a profitable growth because this growth is definitely not profitable. And if you look at 4.5 years, almost -- no value creations in terms of underwriting. So these are my 2 questions.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Sure, Avinash. For our Life bit, I request our General Manager and are appointed actually for life. Mr. Vikash and Girija ma'am to take on the life question first.</p><p>GIRIJA SUBRAMANIAN, GENERAL MANAGER, GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA: So the Life department is actually contributes 23% to our entire GWP. And the claim ratio is high because of COVID this year. We've had unusually very bad claims ratio because of COVID death. And that is even now being reported for the COVID second wave, even now we're getting the COVID claims.</p><p>As far as the retrocession part is concerned, we do not have any specific retrocession in place because we write only to our appetite. But we have an earlier agreement with Hannover Re, where we had shared the business with Hannover Re. That was for an older period. We don't have any current retrocession protection in place for Life, and we don't intend to have one going forward.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: On that front, is that it -- I mean, again, I understand that your extent of balance sheet, but isn't it a risky strategy because, I mean, of course, COVID has been damaged across the globe. But lastly, I've been saying that, okay, you're largely -- largely are you saying, your part of on the Life side is mostly India centered. So that -- you have a very high geographical concentrate and you don't have a geographic diversification like many of the other global insurance will have. In that context, if we're not opting for retrocession, is that like, okay, -- you are putting your separate like 1 in 10 years or so?</p><p>GIRIJA SUBRAMANIAN: You take it.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: So right now, as ma'am has pointed out correctly, there is no retro-session arrangement. But yes, there's an order agreement with Hannover Re, where the Life Re does have a reinsurance outward as well as reinsurance inward arrangement. Retrocession can be looked at in the future. Right now, it still would be a bit difficult to find out the turret price and enter into a retrocession arrangement with reinsurers in the event of such adverse experience that we have faced. What was the other question, sorry?</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: Yes. Related to this, I mean, so what steps have you taken with your domestic life insurance, I mean, have you sort of increased your insurance prices for the new treaties what sort of market development you are seeing?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes. So wherever action can be taken. We are taking actions, for example, wherever GIC still has an agreement where new business has been written, rates are being modified on a treaty to treaty basis to take care of the adverse experience. Unfortunately, for treaties, where GIC no longer writes new business. Unfortunately, we have to wait out this period of collaterality because the rates for life insurance contracts are guaranteed for the longer term. This is applicable to individual products. On the group side, where we like mostly 1-year business, when the group some up for renewal or we receive new quotations under group stomach for renewal or we receive new quotations under group , the rates right now are currently at quite a high multiple to what GIC was quoting earlier.</p><p>So there are steps being taken on the rate side to ensure that the rates do increase. However, the rates definitely would not increase to the extent of the losses that we have seen in COVID because once it wears off the actual impact of COVID or in other words, the impact of COVID on the life expectancy of the Indian population can be found out. Right now, it is slightly volatile to make an exact and accurate prediction on how the future is going to be.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: Okay. Okay. And just quickly on this one. So if I say that, okay, you would have many treaties for individual protection business with the life insurers. Broadly, your experience has been uniform for COVID across the treaties or has it been like without naming? Has the experience been sort of very diverse in different treaties as far as COVID is concerned?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Not necessarily, the experience has been mostly uniform. Unfortunately, what we can call as COVID deaths would be the death claims reported by cedents where the explicit cause of debt is COVID. However, what we have observed, there are a lot many claims which have been reported with multiple causes of death such as respiratory problem and et cetera, et cetera, which might be COVID. So that has probably comorbidities are fitted with COVID, but the cause of death is not -- is recorded COVID.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: Okay. Okay. So yes, so overall death experience -- overall death experience, let's put all the death together over this last H1. So has it the experience -- uniform across treaties like a wide divergence you have seen? I mean I just want to understand that if at all.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Cedent and across treaties whether it is individual or group, the experience has been adverse, it would be difficult to pinpoint a particular treaty where we have observed that the experience has been quite good. Experience has mostly been uniform. Obviously, there is a range, but the range is not that material for us to call a particular treaty to be performing as per expectation.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: Got it. Got it. Okay. So now the second question on that is what is the road ahead because last 4.5 year almost sort of no profitability or rather negative profitability, whatever profit has come because of the gain booking. So what's the road ahead?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: See, Avinash Ji, it is a fact that because of the investment on that the Indian market generates, most companies have been operating at a combined ratio of more than 100, which means it is their investment income that is subsidizing their operations. Now post listing and in every investor call that we have had, the investors have very clearly requested and asked GIC to work towards a model where you start earning money from your operations.</p><p>Exactly what your point also is that as a sustainable model, that is the way forward. So as we said in our opening remarks as well, we are working towards it. Loads of steps have been taken for our underwriting. So that our underwriting becomes profitable. And the investment income that we have is only the icing on the cake thereafter. So we are taking steps on it. We have made good progress. We have tried to, especially the domestic market, where we are a very dominant player, we have tried to bring in a lot of measures to ensure that the treaties that we write are profitable.</p><p>Those efforts are ongoing. They are unrelenting. And we have set for ourselves a certain target by which time we have to get a combined close to 100 and then below 100. So that is something that is on already.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: Okay. Okay, sir. And in the backdrop, I mean considering that, okay, like cross has been sort of it has come as a big sort of growth, but at the same type of pressure profitability. So I mean, do you foresee -- I mean that, okay, you would be completely experienced from sort of in the core or direct certain instructions or program of the government because, I mean, not really Ayushman Bharat because that had a little bit relatively smaller, but particularly like the crop insurance.</p><p>It has been a challenge for you. I mean, we have given you top line growth, but profitability from that would pressure over the many years. So in that context, I mean, do you see realistically that will be completely spared from the government interventions?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Avinash ji, if you look at Ayushman Bharat that you spoke about, we have been very, very selective in whatever we have written.</p><p>AVINASH SINGH: Yes, sir, that's very small. That's why it's I said. But I said like crop. Crop has been a big underwriting profit sort of, I would say, a drag over the last 3, 4 years.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Yes, yes. So in crop insurance, we have, as I said, we have taken a lot of measures to streamline the portfolio and make it crop insurance is a prime example. A portfolio that was very large, had a huge exposure on our books was hurting us, and we have taken all the measures we could. And today, when you look at it, the crop insurance has a combined almost close to 100 in our half yearly closing.</p><p>This is all a result of whatever we have done to prune the portfolio. We have shared back premium. And now even within that, when we see that there are certain areas that are bad, which can lead to losses, like states like Tamil Nadu, which have given -- have been giving us losses year-on-year. We try to avoid that. And we have successfully avoided it.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question is from the line of Sanketh Godha from Spark Capital.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Just 2 follow-up questions. One is the combined ratio or loss ratio, what you have reported on 92 percentage in the current quarter. How much was it impacted by the CAT events across the domestic and the overseas market and likely impact of Chennai floods in second half numbers. So that is my first question.</p><p>And the second question is that is it fair to assume that incrementally entire motor fees and health fees in domestic market will be only obligated business because given the capital gearing treaty is now completely discontinued?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: So Sanketh ji, for the first part, I'll request our non-life actuary to answer. And Sanketh, you said the Chennai and what else, what other things did you say?</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: No, no. I just wanted to take out of the 92% loss ratio that you reported in the second quarter. How much was due to -- or what is the contribution done from some CAT events, both domestic and overseas?</p><p>VIKASH KUMAR SHARMA, APPOINTED ACTUARY OF LIFE INSURANCE, GENERAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA: Yes. Domestic property portfolio has been good. But only on foreign side, we had to actually keep some reserve for certain international events. So that is the hurricane Ida, the Henan floods from China and the European floods. So that is the reason that foreign portfolio, we are seeing a higher incurred loss ratio. But we hope that because this is a quarter where you have not -- the premiums have not come in and you have actually kept a higher provision. So -- by December, this loss ratio should actually come down. But this is basically for the fire. I mean, the property foreign portfolio and domestic portfolio has been good. It has performed by similar in similar lines with Q1.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. And likely impact of Chennai flood too early to say, but if you can give a fair idea of what earnings because now our excel starts at INR 500 crores. So just wondering, we can expect a similar kind of a number to hit our P&amp;L or it can be lower than INR 500 crores.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: Sir, it's too early to say what will be the impact of Chennai flood because we have the information yet not yet not started trickling in.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Sir, to the previous question -- previous response that Ida floods, U.S, China floods and European floods put together combined what is the net impact on the profitability for first half or second half?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: We have kept to the tune-up about 100 million, that is INR 760-odd crores as a reserve for these CAT events, international CAT events.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: And how couldn't you are that this will be sufficient? Or do you need to provide more of these is a likely release, sir?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: The confidence comes from the fact that we have been reviewing these events that are happening. So we have a -- we actually reserve for them separately. So it's most likely that it will not exceed this -- the numbers, the reserves that we have kept. So it's likely that going forward, if the reporting is not happening to that extent, we will be releasing this. So we have about -- in the last 4 years, whatever international CAT events have occurred. We have about 20, 25 numbers, which we track.</p><p>So we actually also look at the territory where that has happened and what is our exposure in that territory. So there are multiple factors that we look into. So we are quite confident that this reserve should be sufficient to actually take care of the claims that may flow in.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: The center 760 was provided in Q2 only, right? or 1H number?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: No, this is an extra reserve that has come in Q2 this time, this quarter.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. Okay. And the other question which I asked regarding how to model the incremental motor and health business in the domestic market. Should we limit our sense to the obligatory part given the capital gain in treaty are getting discontinued, and clearly, they will get to 0 in clinically. So we should assume that 5% of the obligation will be the only line item which we driving the motor and health domestic business?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes, that will be correct. By and large, these are classes which are not RI driven. There may not be a separate outside of obligatory requirement from the cedents. So predominantly obligatory. Just going back a little, you mentioned about retro at segment point being INR 500 crores. Now it is increased to INR 1,250 crores for Indian business.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. So INR 1,250 crores, we will take the hit on our books and beyond but only it will go to the retro, guys, right, sir?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Just 3 years period reach from 250 to 500, 500 to INR 1,250, right, sir? I remember last couple of years back to INR 50 crores. Now it is -- last year, it was INR 500 crores. Now you are saying it is INR 1,250 crores. So our skim in the game or our potential loss if there are big in the domestic market will be as high as 50-odd crore?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Yes.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: So any rationale, sir, for doing so because that seems to be a little aggressive strategy.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: No, it looks aggressive because the base is moving like that, but it also depends on the course that the premium that the market is charging for this cover. Because it is 2 primary what in our parlance, we call it is likely to get hit easily. Entire purchase that we have in place. So this is a cost benefit analysis that we carried out internally and decided to retain it.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: How much premium savings you have done, because you move INR 500 crores to INR 1,250 crores?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: Something like 45% of the premium? 750. So it will be something like INR 400 crores a premium savings outgo.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay, INR 400 crores.</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: INR 350 crores to INR 400 crores.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: Okay. Okay. Okay. Fine. And finally, sir, a small update. We made some reserves with respect to business discontinuity claims, which could likely hit in European market because of the case of spending, I believe, in U.K., sir, just wondering, are we done with that or still it is spending?</p><p>HITESH JOSHI: COVID U.K., is it developed?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: No, it is developing yet. It is developing.</p><p>SANKETH GODHA: And we have reserves of around GBP 100 million, if I'm not wrong?</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: It's not pound, so it's a dollar. So we have about 700 -- so that is basically -- we have about INR 760 crores. So that comes to about USD 100 million.</p><p>OPERATOR: Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand the conference back to the management for closing comments.</p><p>DEVESH SRIVASTAVA: So thank you, everyone, for the interest shown. As is fairly evident, we have worked hard, and we are making incremental gains as well. So we are prepared for the future, we are working towards the plan and the indications that we get from our figures, it's very hard thing for us. We will continue to charge this part, and we look forward to having more such interactions. Anything that you would want further from us, please feel absolutely free to write to us, to give us a call to mail us, we'll be happy to respond and answer your queries. Thanks again for your time today. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you very much. On behalf of General Insurance Corporation of India, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining.

Before we start the presentation, we would like to remind you that it includes forward-looking statements, which are underlined by a number of risks and uncertainties and may not be realized in the future for various reasons. Information about general market conditions is coming from a variety of sources outside of Tencent.</p><p>This presentation also contains some unaudited non-IFRS financial measures that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of the company's financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. For a detailed discussion of risk factors and non-IFRS measures, please refer to our disclosure documents on the IR section of our website.</p><p>Now let me introduce the management team on the call tonight. Our Chairman and CEO, Pony Ma, will kick off with a short overview; President, Martin Lau, will discuss strategy review; Chief Strategy Officer, James Mitchell, will speak to business review; and the Chief Financial Officer, John Lo, will conclude with financial discussion before we open the floor for questions.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Pony.</p><p>HUATENG PONY MA, CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, TENCENT HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Wendy. Good evening. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. In the second quarter, we enhanced our services and achieved healthy growth across our businesses, particularly Business Services and advertising, while our game revenue benefited from international growth.</p><p>Now let me go through the headline number -- financial numbers for the quarter. Total revenue was RMB 138 billion, up 20% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. Gross profit was RMB 63 billion, up 18% year-on-year and stable quarter-on-quarter. Non-IFRS operating profit was RMB 43 billion, up 14% year-on-year and stable quarter-on-quarter. Non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was RMB 34 billion, up 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>For our key services, we generally retain our first place position in activities, including social games, long-form video, music, literature, payment, and mobile utilities. And we believe we gained market share in cloud services.</p><p>Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat was 1.25 billion. Mobile devices MAU of QQ was 591 million. Martin and James will discuss our strategy to help view economy and society as well as focus across different businesses.</p><p>Now I will hand over to Martin for the strategic review.</p><p>CHI PING LAU, PRESIDENT &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TENCENT HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Pony, and good evening and good morning to everybody. Today, I would like to share with you the encouraging progress of our communication and productivity SaaS products, which are generating user and social value despite contributing very little revenue to us for now.</p><p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have seen accelerated demand for digitization across industries. Our communication and productivity SaaS product suite, namely WeCom, Tencent Meeting, and Tencent Docs, assisted this digitization process and contribute to the growth of the economy.</p><p>We'll keep this by leveraging a number of our capabilities developed over the years: First, our advanced technologies and domains such as AI, real-time communications, and security; second, our proven experience in operating large-scale Internet services with robust performance and reliability; third, our ubiquitous coverage and deep engagement with consumers via Weixin and QQ, which facilitates industries building direct connection with their users; and fourth, our vertical solutions for providing business services, including cloud services to key industries through our own product innovation and partnerships.</p><p>By helping industries digitize, we believe we deliver critical benefits to different stakeholders. For SMEs, we have significantly lowered the barrier for technology adoption. They can leverage our products to increase customer engagement themselves as well as to enhance cost efficiency without making significant IT investments on their own.</p><p>For public services, when they enable real-time and direct connection with citizens and enterprises, we also facilitate productivity enhancements through improving their workflows and increasing their collaboration efficiency. For individual users, we help reduce their traveling burden and enhance convenience. We also enable instant access to and sharing of vital information.</p><p>Going through the different products, WeCom enabled better connections within enterprises and with consumers externally. WeCom offers collaboration tools for enterprises to enhance management efficiency. It is deeply integrated with Weixin chats, Mini Programs, and Weixin Payments. Enterprises can use WeCom as a back end to communicate with and serve customers on Weixin, enabling convenient and efficient customer management on one single platform.</p><p>All customer relationship will be retained by enterprises and will be preserved even after the frontline staff's departure. Examples of how we can assist digitization include, for the government, we can support the Seventh National Population Census, the first digitized census in China's history. WeCom enabled around 7 million census tickers to submit a massive amount of data online in a secured and reliable way, and facilitated the efficient management and coordination of this large and mobile workforce.</p><p>In the public education sector, WeCom has been increasingly adopted as a software for enhancing communications and operations management of schools. WeCom enables real-time and direct communications between teachers and parents, where teachers can benefit from WeCom's CRM functionality, while parents can interact with teachers using the parent's own regular Weixin accounts and app. WeCom also provide tools for education bureaus and schools to manage their day-to-day operations more efficiently.</p><p>In the business sector, we have been upgrading tools in WeCom to enhance the private domain operations of retailers and brands as we improve their resources management. We believe these tools can help retailers and brands increase sales and improve cost efficiency.</p><p>Now turning to Tencent Meeting, the most used stand-alone cloud conferencing app in China. Tencent Meeting has achieved double-digit growth in both MAU and time spent per user in June 2021 compared with December 2020. We're increasing its penetration in medical and public education sectors, leveraging our vertical solutions, and expanding industry partnerships.</p><p>To enrich our solutions for meeting rooms, Tencent Meeting supports a wide range of hardware from around 30 partner vendors. We upgraded the growth quality by launching our self-developed voice solution, Tencent's Ethereal Audio. With enhanced AI-based noise cancellation, our solution enables speech capture from up to 12 meters away in standard meeting rooms.</p><p>Examples of how Tencent Meetings assist digitization includes the large enterprises, for example, such as state grid cooperation with China and China Communications Construction company. We customize solutions compatible with their existing IT systems and equipment for efficient collaboration. This illustrates our capabilities in supporting enterprises with vast operations and sophisticated requirements. For large-scale conferences, we deliver secure, reliable and high-performance solutions, among which we have supported China importing export fair or known as the Canton Fair for 3 consecutive events since April 2020.</p><p>Finally, Tencent Docs is now the leading cloud-based productivity suite in China with spreadsheet, Word processing, and slide deck applications. It also allows easy sharing of files via Weixin and QQ. Building on its initial success in education sector, Tencent Docs is gaining popularity in traditional sectors such as finance, media, and legal. This reflects increasing functionality of the service as well as its unique user experience for collaborated data collection and sharing.</p><p>In July 2021, student volunteers used Tencent Docs as a real-time collaborative tool for helping rescue our people track in Henan floods via data collection, editing and sharing. Our infrastructure and operations support Tencent Docs to deliver reliable performance in such an extreme situation with the documents edited over 300,000 times and accessed to over 2.5 million times within 24 hours, and in that process, saved many life.</p><p>Now with that, I will pass to James to talk about our business review.</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER &amp; SENIOR EVP, TENCENT HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Martin. For the second quarter of 2021, our revenue grew 20% year-on-year. VAS represented 52% of our revenue, within which the game subsegment was 31% and the social network subsegment, 21%. Online advertising was 17%, and FinTech and Business Services reached 30% of our total revenue.</p><p>For value-added services, segment revenue was CNY 72 billion for the quarter, up 11% year-on-year and stable quarter-on-quarter. Social network subsegment revenue increased 9% year-on-year to CNY 29 billion, reflecting moderate growth of digital content subscriptions and in-game item sales.</p><p>Total VAS subscriptions grew 13% year-on-year to 229 million. Video subscriptions increased 9% to 125 million, benefiting from our diversified content across sports, animated series, drama series, and movies. For example, our animated series, Land of Warriors as well as Battle Through the Heavens Season 4 attracted wide audience bases.</p><p>Music subscriptions expanded 41% to 66 million, driven by the TME's effective marketing and by increased consumer willingness to subscribe for music services.</p><p>Games subsegment revenue increased 12% year-on-year to CNY 43 billion. Our international games revenue grew 29% to CNY 11 billion, or 37% in constant currency terms. Mobile games VAS revenue increased 13% year-on-year to CNY 41 billion, with higher ARPU and paying user ratios. Revenue growth was primarily driven by Honor of Kings and Moonlight Blade Mobile in China and by PUBG Mobile and Clash of Clans internationally. PC client game revenue increased 1% year-on-year to CNY 11 billion, as international growth from Valorant and Warframe offset domestic softness from Dungeon and Fighter.</p><p>Turning to Weixin. Mini Programs GMV more than doubled year-on-year as our decentralized commerce environment helps businesses drive their own channels and their own user relationships, while also enabling them to achieve higher profit margins than on other channels.</p><p>Summarizing how the Weixin ecosystem can deliver success for our partners, brands and merchants can acquire customers for their Mini Programs off-line via QR codes and Weixin Pay. They can create and distribute content by their own off-line accounts in Weixin groups, engaging their users and driving repeat visits to Mini Programs.</p><p>With powerful shopping functionalities such as single merchant membership rewards, Mini Programs can convert visits into transactions. And we're also developing video accounts and live streaming as additional touch points for deepening user connectivity.</p><p>For Q2, we enhanced the camera capabilities so as to provide better augmented reality experiences in user-generated content production and video chat. We automated the in-app video editing process, encouraging users to generate and share more appealing video content.</p><p>Turning to games, we reinforced the IP value of our leading titles. We adapted Honor of Kings into a drama series, You Are My Glory, which is now the most watched drama series on Tencent Video by video views per episode year-to-date. Honor of Kings also released a series of popular skins.</p><p>PUBG Mobile collaborated with the movie, Godzilla vs. Kong, to create crossover content. And we revamped PUBG Mobile's battlefield design and combat features in July, increasing average user time spent.</p><p>For Clash of Clans, we released a major content upgrade in April and launched the ninth anniversary event in August. Supercell is developing 3 new games based on the Clash IP, including the turn-based strategy game Clash Quest, which has begun beta testing in Scandinavia.</p><p>Valorant achieved 14 million monthly active users on its first anniversary, benefiting from the game's competitive gameplay, robust technology, and eSports activities. Riot is developing a mobile version of Valorant.</p><p>We're also extending our presence in newly emerging games genres. Alchemy Stars, developed by our Tourdog Studio, was the most downloaded tactical RPG in Japan in July, benefiting from its anime art style, unique tile-connecting gameplay and narrative created by a reputable Japanese scriptwriter.</p><p>Light and Night, developed by our Aurora Studio (sic) [Northern Lights Studio], became China's top dating simulation game by DAU in July, with particular popularity among female players due to its storyline.</p><p>Our first survival open world crafting game, Undawn, developed by the Lightspeed &amp; Quantum Studios, has accumulated over 30 million preregistrations in China to date, ahead of its release on mobile.</p><p>As a leader in the game industry, we have, for many years, sought to foster a healthy game-playing environment. We believe playing appropriate games in moderation can provide players with experiences such as teamwork, leadership, and skills mastery, enhance their familiarity and facility with software and, in some cases, represent a first step toward acquiring coding skills.</p><p>In 2017, we pioneered a system helping parents manage minors' game activity. In 2018, we introduced the strictest in-game measures in the China industry, with mandatory real name verification and stringent game time and spending limits.</p><p>Earlier this month, we further tightened our game time spending limits beyond regulatory requirements, initially for Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite and in future for our other games. We reduced the time limit for minors to 1 hour per day on non-statutory holidays, and 2 hours per day on statutory holidays. And we prevented in-game spending by players aged under 12. We're also cracking down on minors misusing adult accounts and transactions of adult accounts and third-party platforms.</p><p>To fully implement a healthy game environment in China, we've advocated industry-wide coordinated discussion around regulating minors' total time spend across game, further researching age-based game classification systems and/or potentially restricting under 12-year olds from playing games altogether. During the second quarter, under 16-year olds accounted for 2.6% of our China game grossing receipts and under 12-year olds accounted for 0.3%.</p><p>Moving to Online Advertising. Total revenue was CNY 23 billion in the second quarter, up 23% year-on-year as growth in Internet services, consumer staples, and automobile sectors outweighed weakness in education.</p><p>Since May, the China Online Advertising industry has been impacted by the sharp decline of ad spend from K-9 after-school tuition services and, to a lesser extent, by regulation of launch screen advertisements. Conversely, Apple's IDFA changes appear to have had less impact in China than widely expected. We expanded our overall advertiser base by enhancing industry solutions, enabling merchants to better manage their private and main operations within Weixin.</p><p>During the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, we provided integrated marketing solutions across Weixin, QQ, Tencent Video, Tencent Sports, and Tencent News. Leveraging our strengths in social long-form and short-form video distribution as well as in content management, we believe we outperformed other online platforms in terms of video views and user sharing and activity.</p><p>Our social and others advertising revenue increased 28% year-on-year to CNY 20 billion, primarily driven by Weixin properties, in particular, Mini Programs as well as our mobile ad network.</p><p>For Moments advertising, more advertisers adopted Mini Programs as landing pages, leading to higher sales conversion and thus, revenue growth. Video ad inventories contributed close to half of Moments revenue. Ad revenue inside Mini Programs also doubled year-on-year, following the growth in Mini Programs' GMV.</p><p>Official accounts revenue grew to the release of inventories in notification fees, and increasing recognition of Official Accounts rolled in generating sales leads. Our media advertising revenue was stable year-on-year, as increased monetization of our music apps offset weakness in our advertising on our news app.</p><p>Looking at FinTech and Business Services. Segment revenue was CNY 42 billion, up 40% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, with Business Services growing at a notably rapid rate. Within FinTech, year-on-year revenue growth was mainly driven by mobile payment volume growth. The number of consumers using our payment services and the number of payment transactions per consumer each increased.</p><p>We believe the SMEs play a valuable role enriching our payment ecosystem and generating payment user engagement and we, in turn, seek to help SMEs benefit from greater mobile payments acceptance by charging very low or even zero payment take rates in certain cases, and by our commitment of resources and services to support SMEs growth. We're also researching new opportunities in the payment industry, such as participating as a pilot in the digital yuan project, where we're supporting WeBank in developing and testing its new interface within the PBOC's digital yuan e-RMB application.</p><p>For Business Services, our revenue grew at a rapid rate year-on-year as we helped digitalization of public services in traditional industries. We experienced an increasing number of customers adopting our platform and software services such as security, AI, and data analytics.</p><p>Video cloud solutions are an important and rapidly growing Platform-as-a-Service segment. And according to IDC, we ranked first in China in terms of video cloud solution revenues.</p><p>During the quarter, we integrated our real-time communication, instant messaging, and CDN infrastructure into a unified solution called RT1 network. For developers, RT1 enhances their efficiency by providing a one-stop software development kit for audio and video path solutions. For Tencent Cloud, RT1 expands cross-selling opportunities and increases cost efficiency.</p><p>With that, I'll pass to John to discuss the financial review.</p><p>SHEK HON LO, CFO &amp; SENIOR VP, TENCENT HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, James. Hello, everyone. For the second quarter of 2021, total revenue was CNY 138.3 billion, up 20% year-on-year or 2% quarter-on-quarter. Gross profit was CNY 62.7 billion, up 18% year-on-year or stable quarter-on-quarter. Net other gains were CNY 20.8 billion, up 141% year-on-year or 6% quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>This mainly included non-IFRS adjustments relating to our invested companies, number one; net fair value gains, reflecting increased valuations of investees, in particular, in the sectors of transportation, services, FinTech Services and local services; number two, net gains on deemed disposal and disposal of certain investee companies. These were partially offset by fair value losses or impairment against certain investees.</p><p>Operating profit was CNY 52.5 billion, up 34% year-on-year or down 7% quarter-on-quarter. Net finance costs were CNY 1.9 billion, down 3% year-on-year or up 42% quarter-on-quarter. The 3% year-on-year decrease was a result of lower ForEx losses, partly offset higher interest expenses due to higher amount of indebtedness. The Q-on-Q increase reflected ForEx losses in the second quarter versus ForEx gains last quarter.</p><p>Share of losses of associates and joint ventures was CNY 3.9 billion compared to CNY 295 million a year ago. This resulted from non-IFRS adjustments of certain associates and increased investments in community group buying initiatives by certain associates, as well as losses recognized from certain associates. On a non-IFRS basis, we shared losses of CNY 449 million this quarter compared to share of profit of CNY 658 million a year ago.</p><p>Interest tax -- income tax expense was CNY 3.7 billion this quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.9%. IFRS net profit attributable to shareholders was CNY 42.6 billion, up 49% year-on-year or down 11% quarter-on-quarter. Diluted EPS was CNY 4.387, up 28% year-on-year or down 11% quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>Now I'll share our non-IFRS financials. For the second quarter, operating profit was CNY 42.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year or largely stable quarter-on-quarter. Net profit after NCI was CNY 34 billion, up 13% year-on-year or 3% quarter-on-quarter. Diluted EPS was CNY 3.504, up 12% year-on-year or 3% quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>Moving on to gross margin. The overall gross margin was 45.4%, down 0.9 percentage points both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. By segment, gross margin for VAS was 52.9%, down 0.8 points year-on-year and 2.2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year decline was mainly due to lower contribution from privileged subscriptions and PC games, which carry relatively higher margins. The sequential decline was also due to lower revenue contributions from PC games and higher revenue mix of lower-margin digital content services with increased content costs.</p><p>Gross margin for Online Advertising was 48.8%, down 2.6 percentage points year-on-year or up 3.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year decrease was mainly due to increased bandwidth and server costs, sequential increase mainly benefited from mix shift to higher-margin owned and operated inventories.</p><p>Gross margin for FinTech and Business Services was 32%, up 3.1 percentage points year-on-year and stable quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year increase reflected improvement in gross margin of Business Services and mix shifts within FinTech service.</p><p>On operating expenses. Selling and marketing expenses were CNY 10 billion, up 29% year-on-year or 17% quarter-on-quarter. Both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increase mainly reflected increased market spending on Business Services, digital content services and games, including marketing spend associated with subsidiaries we consolidated over the past year.</p><p>As a percentage of revenues, S&amp;M expenses was 7% of revenues, broadly stable compared to the second quarter of 2020. R&amp;D expenses were CNY 12.8 billion, up 30% year-on-year or 14% quarter-on-quarter. R&amp;D expenses represented 9% of revenues.</p><p>G&amp;A expenses, excluding R&amp;D, were CNY 9.8 billion, up 48% year-on-year or 28% quarter-on-quarter. Both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increase reflected retail staff force. Excluding share-based compensation, it increased by 37% year-on-year or 10% quarter-on-quarter. At quarter end, we had approximately 94,000 employees, up 33% year-on-year or 6% quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>Let's take a look at the operating and net margin ratios. For the second quarter, net non-IFRS operating margin was 31%, down 1.8 percentage points year-on-year and 0.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Non-IFRS net margin was 25.4%, down 1.8 percentage points year-on-year or largely stable quarter-on-quarter.</p><p>Finally, I will share some key financial metrics for the quarter. Total CapEx was CNY 6.9 billion, down 27% year-on-year or 10% quarter-on-quarter, within which operating CapEx was CNY 5.9 billion, down 29% from the high base in the second quarter of 2020 as we advance procurement and amidst the pandemic at that time. Nonoperating CapEx decreased 11% year-on-year to CNY 1.1 billion, reflecting lower spending on land use rights and data center construction.</p><p>Free cash flow for the quarter was CNY 17.3 billion, down 39% year-on-year or 48% quarter-on-quarter. Net debt position was CNY 21 billion compared to net cash of CNY 5.6 billion last quarter, mainly due to a net cash outflow for M&amp;A activities and 2020 dividends of CNY 12.5 billion, partly offset by free cash flow generation.</p><p>The fair value of our shareholdings and listed investee companies, excluding subsidiaries, was approximately CNY 1.45 trillion or USD 224 billion at the end of the second quarter.</p><p>Thank you. We shall now open the floor for questions.</p><p>WENDY HUANG: (Operator Instructions) Please invite the first question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: May we invite the first question from Hanjin -- sorry from Alicia Yap from Citigroup.</p><p>YIK WAH YAP, MD &amp; HEAD OF PAN-ASIA INTERNET RESEARCH, CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is related to the advertising. So how should we think about this overall ad revenue growth in the second half of this year given there are more advertiser adopting the Mini Programs as the landing pages, which will help Moments advertising that lead to higher revenue opportunity. But in the meantime, there are regulatory headwinds on limiting this launch screen app and also overall macro weakness that might lead to some cautious ad spending.</p><p>So any colors on the near-term ad revenue growth outlook, and also the longer-term ad revenue opportunity given further integration of these video account and Moments that you're going to have within your Mini Programs ecosystem?</p><p>Second question very quickly is you mentioned about you're deploying more of your technology and expertise to help the SME, the public service, and also the enterprises with Tencent Docs and all these cloud-based productivity solution. How should we think about these -- any complementary service that could evolve and develop around this software that could translate to future business opportunity?</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: So Alicia, on your first question around advertising, I think you summarized the puts and takes fairly well. Taking a long-term strategic view, we're very happy with our position and how it's evolving, particularly in a couple of areas. One being, as you alluded to, the increasing adoption of Mini Programs by enterprises within Weixin, which helps us in a number of ways. First, it means that advertising within Weixin has more of a performance component, more akin to a search environment or a marketplace environment rather than the media environment, which is beneficial for advertising activity within Weixin Moments, within Weixin Official Accounts and elsewhere.</p><p>And then secondly, the Mini Programs themselves constitute advertising inventory. So we mentioned that the advertising revenue within the Mini Programs themselves, which is quite substantial, more than doubled year-on-year during the second quarter. And overall, you can see that our advertising gross margins improved somewhat from the first quarter to the second quarter due to a mix shift from our lower-margin ad network business toward our higher-margin Weixin properties.</p><p>Then secondly, from an inventory perspective, we're seeing good growth in video accounts, DAU, and time spent. And that growth has benefited from the addition of high-quality content such as the Olympics in recent weeks. And over the longer term, when we monetize that video accounts inventory, and we know from the experience of other short video services that both the ad loads and the CPMs can be attractive, relative to other advertising properties.</p><p>So those are 2 structural drivers over the longer term, the Mini Programs adoption and the video account inventory creation. In the near term, our expectation is the overall online ad industry will experience slower growth in the third quarter than the second quarter, and that is partly because of the full quarter impact of a very sharp reduction in advertising by K-9 after-school tuition services, to a lesser extent, the negative effect on the supply side from the flash screen advertising regulation changes and then potentially a deceleration in overall consumer activity as well. So that's on the advertising side.</p><p>CHI PING LAU: Now in terms of the productivity software side, I think these are services, which we don't monetize directly at this point in time, but we believe the category, a lot of value to the customers. And over time, they'll be valuable commercial products as well. But more immediately, right, a lot of these solutions, when they are deployed by enterprise customers, it actually help us to open the door and as a result, can help us to sell our cloud services as well as our ad services to these companies. That's the immediate benefits.</p><p>And then over time, if you look at the U.S. market, right, each one of the product that we have actually has got a very successful commercial product in the U.S. For example, Tencent Meeting, the counterpart is Zoom. And if you look at WeCom, it's partly Salesforce, partly Shopify. And Tencent Docs, it's Google Docs and Microsoft Office. And these services all have their own monetization and business models. And I think over time, while we don't charge at this point in time, at the time, we may develop value-added service and for certain customers who want to use these value-added services, there will be some kind of a commercial solution.</p><p>And looking further into the future, these solutions also have to build an ecosystem of SaaS software. So there will be other SaaS software who can actually rely on our productivity too and provide their services to the enterprise customers, and we can actually derive some value from there as well.</p><p>So all in all, we believe that at this point in time, it's a very valuable suite of service from a user value perspective. Over time, they would help us to generate commercial value as well.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Han Joon Kim from Macquarie.</p><p>HAN JOON KIM, DIRECTOR &amp; HEAD OF INTERNET &amp; MEDIA RESEARCH OF ASIA, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: The first question really goes to kind of -- there's been a lot of regulatory developments in the market. Are there any in particular that you want to call out as things that might have been different from the way that you were envisioning in a few months or a few quarters ago, and how that might impact our strategic initiatives or priorities and so forth? So if you can just kind of call out 1 or 2 of them, that would be great.</p><p>And that dovetails into my second question, which is around [perpetual] tax that I think the industry has been benefiting from over the years. And I think some of your peers in the market have indicated that perhaps some of those perpetual treatment might be slowing to ebb away. So I just wanted to get some impression from how your conversations with the regulators have been about the idea that you redeploy your capital into investing for the benefit of society, and whether you think that's still valid and that the perpetual tax treatment should remain for us on an ongoing basis.</p><p>CHI PING LAU: I think if you want to identify a regulatory action, it's probably sort of around the after-school tuition frame, which is actually impacting a pretty big advertiser group on our advertising and across the industry. And we're seeing part of the impact this quarter and we're going to be seeing the entire impact of -- full quarter impact next quarter. And that essentially take away a big buyer of advertising today on our platforms and the inventories that's due there. So over time, we'll be able to fill up the inventory with other advertisers. But there will be an impact initially.</p><p>So I think that's the most direct impact. But I think there's going to be a lot of questions with respect to regulations, so I might as well just sort of answer the more systemic view, right? I think that the point we want to make is that number one, we felt that regulation on Internet is a global trend, and it's not just limited to China. It's actually happening in the U.S., in Europe. But China, it's a bit ahead in terms of the execution of a more structural regulation framework. And I think this should be expected because the regulation has been actually quite loose over an industry like the Internet, considering its size and the importance.</p><p>Now secondly, I would like to say in terms of the regulators, the regulators are very focused on identifying and rectifying industry misbehaviors and also establishing regulations, they emphasize compliance, social responsibility as well as fair and proper behavior. And we should expect in the future -- in the near future, more regulations should be coming.</p><p>Thirdly, what I would go -- to go from -- our understanding is that the government actually wants to foster a long-term sustainable development of the Internet industry. The government does recognize the importance on the economic side and social side of the Internet industry and also the contribution of the industry to global competitiveness. So that's why it does want to foster a long-term healthy environment.</p><p>Fourthly, I would say our attitude during this wave of regulation is that we want to embrace this new environment fully, and we want to establish ourselves as fully compliant. And we felt that this is actually going to be good for us and for the entire industry over the long run.</p><p>And on a relative basis, we felt we are also quite well positioned to embrace the regulatory environment because we have been fully compliant with all regulations. This has always been our operating philosophy. And our strategy has always been trying to create value for users. And we have always been quite self-restrained in terms of monetization. We have run our platforms so that we establish open platforms to support individual enterprises and entities.</p><p>And we have also, all along the way, quite emphasized social responsibility and emphasized we want to use our tech for good. So given all these factors, right, I would say there will be short-term uncertainties and there are a lot of new regulations that will be coming, but we are pretty confident that we can be compliant. And over the long run, it would actually position the industry for healthy growth, and we'll be a beneficiary of that. John?</p><p>SHEK HON LO: In relation to tax, I think the tax rebate has been reducing generally over time by implementing more detailed categorization of key software enterprise. Beforehand, the group has about 4 to 5 companies, which were qualified for key software enterprise. Well, for last year, we still had but the number reduced by quite a lot.</p><p>We only accrued tax at preferential rate of 10% when we are sure that we can get it normally, in the subsequent year. We also accrued withholding tax when we generated profits as opposed to some of our peers, which accrued when they need to remit money. As you can see, the effective tax rate for 2020 was about 11% and the first half of 2021 was about 11% as well.</p><p>We expect that the effective tax rate for the entire year will be at similar level. On the face of it, the tax seemingly is very low, taking into account of a lot of non-IFRS adjustments such as nontaxable book profits on deemed disposal, disposal or other value valuation gains on investment. If we take out all this -- all the non-IFRS adjustment that is what are the noises and withholding tax as well, the effective tax rate would have been approximately low teens for 2020 and mid-teens for 2021. All in all, the total tax rate differential would be around 3%.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>GARY YU, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have one follow-up on regulation. I appreciate the fact that management has been proactive in kind of talking to the regulator and self-regulate some of the practices in the market. Based on our conversation with the regulator, do we see the risk of more kind of drastic measures that the regulator may impose on the gaming industry? So for example, we try to limit restriction on time for minors or below 12. Is there any discussion on teenagers, about 18 years old in terms of time spent on games? So that's my question on regulation.</p><p>CHI PING LAU: On games, I think that the key issue at this point in time is still the amount of time and the amount of money that the minors spend on games. And this is an area that we are very focused on. And as a result, as you can see in our latest pronouncements, we have put in a number of different measures that James had already talked about.</p><p>But there is one issue, which I think we proactively think up to the regulators, which is about the total amount of time and money that minors spend on games. Because right now, I think a lot of the regulations is actually around each game. But if you look at across the industry, and most of the people are -- when they have concerns, they're concerned over minors spending too much time on games as a category. So if we can actually find a way to regulate the total amount of time that's spent across different games, that would address the problem.</p><p>And it actually requires -- it's a complicated issue requiring consensus of the regulator as well as the industry, if it requires a regulation. It also requires a system to police it. But from the practicality perspective, it's actually doable. So this is one thing that we felt we would want to take up to the industry and the regulator to discuss. And if that can be achieved, and I think most of the criticism on the gaming industry, it will be resolved.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Robin Zhu from Bernstein.</p><p>ROBIN ZHU, SENIOR ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I guess, a couple of questions, please. The first one is there's been a lot of reports about the opening of the ecosystems between yourselves and peers in the industry. Can management just talk a little bit about the impacts -- or, first of all, the -- whether this is happening, whether there's a time line for it to happen and, subsequently, the likely impact that you think will happen to -- for Tencent business or the opportunities that might open up?</p><p>The other one is that -- just a focus on video accounts. I think James mentioned that DAUs and time spent have been going out. Could you just share some thoughts on the monetization strategy here? At what point in the development of video accounts or what other prerequisites for monetization of video accounts to happen? Where are you on content depth and creative depth and so on?</p><p>CHI PING LAU: Yes. In terms of the ecosystem, I think our ecosystem is fundamentally open. And the priority of our ecosystem is actually helping smaller companies and SMEs and brands and merchants to be successful.</p><p>Now if you look at our ecosystem right now, it's fundamentally open. Links are -- not a lot of things are blocked. Users can always copy-paste. Some links are not particularly enhanced with rich presentation. And why is that the case, right? Now the ecosystem, if you look at our Weixin ecosystem, it's really built on the principle that it allow individuals, SMEs, brands, and merchants to engage with their users directly and in an untethered way. When -- and we have actually always uphold that principle and we have built a lot of different tools, and we're putting a lot of guidelines and rules of operations in order to support this vision.</p><p>Now when platforms actually interact with platforms, different questions arose. It becomes much more complicated. Platforms do not offer individual services. They actually sort of have to have a lot of other merchants behind them, right? In a lot of cases, in some cases, there are like millions or tens of millions of merchants behind these very large and dominant platforms. And the platform rules are very different from ours.</p><p>So that actually raised a lot of complicated questions such as will users [be spent], especially when other platforms with a lot of resources can offer subsidies. How do we deal with counterfeits and content piracy? How do we deal with commercial policies, which are completely different? For example, we don't charge any take rate on our merchants and the brands, right, but other platforms do. So how do we reconcile that?</p><p>So we felt these are very complicated questions and need to be discussed and resolved over time, and it's really not the most important priority for our vision. And if these questions are not handled well, then it will be bad for our users, it will be bad for the brands and merchants on our platform. So we want to handle these questions in a very cautious way.</p><p>Now in terms of Video Accounts, I would say Video Accounts has been growing quite nicely and healthily in terms of DAU and time spent per DAU as well as the number of content contributors. The Olympics content was also a positive for Video Accounts. Right now, we are very focused on increasing the content -- improving the content ecosystem, including increasing the high-quality content, as well as enhancing our core capabilities such as our recommendation engine.</p><p>Monetization is not a focus for now. We know that at some point in time, there will be monetization because monetization mechanism is actually well established in that industry. But for now, our focus is not on monetization.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from John Choi from Daiwa Capital Markets.</p><p>HYUNGWOOK CHOI, RESEARCH ANALYST, DAIWA CAPITAL MARKETS AMERICA INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I have a question on your online games and then another follow-up on the regulation. So on online games, I think you guys mentioned earlier that China market was about 8%. I understand last year was also a pretty high base. But as we go into the second half this year with the more tighter regulatory environment targeting the minors, how should we think about the gaming growth, particularly for the domestic market? I do understand that we do have a few games in the pipeline, but it seems like the pipeline could be a bit more softer depending on the delays.</p><p>And a quick follow-up on the regulatory front. I think, Martin, you mentioned that while you guys are compliant more with the regulations, would this have somewhat impact on how we execute our business, meaning that should we be seeing more of a slower business growth opportunity within your different businesses as you guys try to comply to the new regulatory standards?</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: John, so on your first question around our game business outlook then. We did quantify the impact of not generating revenue from users aged 12-years old and under, which is 0.3% of our China again, revenue and therefore, a smaller percentage of aggregate game revenue.</p><p>And then, on the positive side, I think you made some comments about a soft game pipeline, which is not our perception. We're actually quite positively excited about our game pipeline within China. And then without China, outside China, we have what we think is also a fairly healthy robust game pipeline. And we've seen some success recently, really for the first time in Japan and Korea with our tactical RPG. We're seeing good traction, again, arguably for the first time with a console-first game in the form of Pok\u00e9mon Unite.</p><p>So I think it's an uncertain environment. There's lots of moving pieces. But overall, we believe we have a very high-quality game pipeline, both inside China and internationally.</p><p>CHI PING LAU: In terms of regulations, I would say there will definitely be short-term adjustments that are needed for the different businesses. But on the other hand, the long-term strategy, I think, for us, is actually very intact. We have always executed our strategy around creating services that has user value, that help businesses and industries, and then also create social value. And in that process, we invest in these services, we monetize in a very self-restrained way. And I think that strategy will continue.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Alex Yao from JPMorgan.</p><p>ALEX C. YAO, HEAD OF ASIA INTERNET AND NEW MEDIA RESEARCH, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: First question is on long-term financial impact from increasing the more social response initiative to take social responsibilities. In this quarter, you guys announced 2 more initiatives to social responsibility. Number one is the suspension of minor monetization for people under 12 years old. And then number two is the -- you will charge very low to 0 payment take rate for some cases. As you take on more and more of those social responsibilities, how should we think about impact on your long-term margin structure?</p><p>And then secondly, I have a follow-up on Martin's comments around more regulation coming to the market. Can you share with us your thoughts on the directions and the areas of future regulatory direction, or the areas that you expect to see more regulatory managers?</p><p>CHI PING LAU: Well, on the last question, we have already provided the framework. I think it will be coming from all different regulator entities as well as on different segments of the industries. And we think there will be quite a few coming out. So we can't provide a clinical analysis of that until they come out.</p><p>Now in terms of the impact on our business. If you look at the under 12-year old, it's only 0.3% of our total revenues. So it's actually sort of very little. In terms of our SME benefits, by and large, it would slow down the growth of revenue, but I think it will be well within that scope.</p><p>In terms of longer term impact, I would say our margin profile has always driven by our overall strategy of a combination of different components. One is monetization of profitable businesses, which usually the monetization from our side is actually a restraint. And then, we'll have free services, which could be monetized over time. And then we also have loss-making businesses, which by now are actually quite significant, but they would actually over time hopefully, narrow losses and over time, be able to generate some profit.</p><p>This overall strategic mix has been actually been quite consistent over the past many years, and we intend to keep this strategy stable, which means that our earnings profile, I would say, over time would continue to be relatively stable, although there will be some short-term fluctuations.</p><p>Now in terms of the SSB investment, right, of CNY 50 billion, it will be -- again, I want to emphasize that, funded from a non-IFRS profit in which we actually sort of have a pretty big pool. IFRS profit pool, yes, so it will not impact our non-IFRS profit.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Natalie Wu from Haitong International.</p><p>YUE WU, RESEARCH ANALYST, HAITONG INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH LIMITED: Just wondering actually your FBS, Financial Business Services line actually grew very fast this quarter. Just wondering how much of the growth is led by commercial payment, and how much is led by the cloud. And how should we see the future trend of this line? And also, if -- just wondering, if the gross margin profile of cloud is similar with the FinTech business?</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: So on your question, Natalie, then both the commercial payment and the cloud were the 2 primary contributors to the growth. Within cloud, we saw very rapid, very substantially above-market growth infrastructure service and then more rapid growth Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service. And that translated into the margin where, as John mentions, the gross margin for cloud improved year-on-year. That's not because we're at the stage on focusing on margin optimization yet, rather, it's because there was a gentle mix shift from Infrastructure-as-a-Service towards Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service.</p><p>So we're still focused on maximizing client penetration and growing our market share, and helping industries digitize rather than on profitability, but the gross profit margin did improve notably year-on-year for Business Services because of the mix shift to PaaS and SaaS.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Garrett Wang from Citic Securities.</p><p>GARRETT WANG: In the first half year, I noticed that there is some reorganization of our management team. Some management team from IEG and PCG is now leading China Literature (inaudible) 2Qand some other business department. And since that we are focusing more on the content field, can the management team work out through demand strategy and the purpose of the human resource reorganization besides that the Internet traffic is reaching its upper limit? Under this background, what is the priority of our content investment? And can you give us some hints of our layout on the [Shenzhen] or Metaverse?</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: Thank you for the questions, Garrett. So on your second question, the Metaverse is a topic of great interest to us, albeit a longer term rather than an immediate opportunity. And we believe there's a number of potential pathways to the Metaverse, including very popular existing games that are highly social in nature, new games that are yet to be created as well as existing social networks that can become more Metaverse-like progressively over time.</p><p>We also think that there's certain skill sets or attributes that will be highly beneficial to companies seeking to provide a Metaverse environment, including experience of handling huge numbers of users interacting with each other, with which is akin to communications and social networking, including managing digital economies between users, which is akin to online games.</p><p>And then also including the ability to take physical world assets such as human faces or buildings or mountains and digitize them in order to populate the Metaverse with people and with objects at a high speed. And we're pursuing all of those paths, and we believe that we're one of really a handful of companies globally that have all of those capabilities in terms of the social network expertise, in terms of the experience managing online games, and in terms of the ability to take real-world assets and digitize them for Metaverse purposes. So that's on the second question.</p><p>In terms of your first question, it is an interesting and astute observation. And I think your conclusion is correct, that we are looking for opportunities to continually reinforce upstream content presence, whether that's in digital literature, whether that's in video and film and TV series, whether that's in cartoons, comic and so forth.</p><p>And we also believe that there's increasing opportunities for synergies between the different media formats in China. And you can see that very clearly from the fact that -- when we released the drama series based on Honor of Kings and that actually accretes to the popularity of the underlying Honor of Kings game. And so you can have a different media interpretations of the same underlying IP, which is they're high-quality will self-reinforce each other. You can also see it in the fact that one of the China Literature's IPs, the Douluo Dalu is now seeding a wide range of animated series, drama series, mobile games and so forth. And with each iteration, and the popularity of the IP, that the respect for the IP in the market appears to deepen and grow.</p><p>So that's a very healthy trend. And we think that by moving people within our sort of content-centric groups and by ensuring that what has historically been more platform-centric products become increasingly mindful of the opportunities around content, then we're in a very good position to really help drive that change in China.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from William Packer from Exane BNP Paribas.</p><p>WILLIAM HENRY PACKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MEDIA EQUITY RESEARCH, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Firstly, now you've further developed your reinvestment plans, could you perhaps -- which you communicated it last quarter, could you provide more details on the scale of investment you're planning for 2021, perhaps narrowing the range of guidance of 0% to 22% non-GAAP EPS growth?</p><p>And then secondly, I wondered if you had any thoughts to share on 2022 in the context of both reinvestment plans and regulatory factors. Can you return to trend profit growth? Or is that too soon?</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: So William, unfortunately, we typically don't provide guidance. And we did so last quarter as a means of signaling that there could be a deceleration in growth because of the reinvestments in our short video and in our game business and in enterprise.</p><p>And at this point in time, I think what's more important is really to measure whether we are or are not delivering on those reinvestments, meaning that from our perspective, when we look at our enterprise initiatives, the fact that our Business Services revenue growth accelerated so sharply, the fact that we're seeing very strong user growth for Tencent Docs, and for WeCom, and for Tencent Meeting give us a degree of confidence that we're moving in the right direction.</p><p>For our investments in game studios and game content, the fact that our international game revenue growth grew 37% year-on-year, the fact that we're, for the first time, successfully penetrating the Nintendo Switch opportunity, the first time moving into the Japanese market, give us a degree of confidence we're moving in the right directions for games. And then for short video, the increases in DAU and time spent on the Weixin video accounts, we believe signal that we're moving in the right direction.</p><p>So in terms of where that shakes out from a bottom line perspective in the next 2 quarters or the next 6 quarters, there's a huge number of moving parts. Some of them are within our control. Some of them are outside our control. But we're less focused on those short-term moving parts, and we're more focused on what are the businesses we are building 5, 10 years from now.</p><p>And we firmly believe that if you look at our enterprise software suite, we have the products to with analogues of Zoom and Shopify and arguably Microsoft Office in China, which is a very good place to be. If you look at our video accounts, we have an opportunity to drive longer-term advertising revenue growth at substantial scale. If you look at our game business, we have the opportunity to aggressively reposition this from a primarily China-centric business to a truly global business and therefore, more than triple our addressable market for the game business group.</p><p>So that's our focus really around that longer-term opportunity rather than optimizing for the next 2 or 6 quarters.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Eddie Leung from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.</p><p>EDDIE LEUNG, MD IN EQUITY RESEARCH AND ANALYST, BOFA SECURITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: The first question is a follow-up question on advertising and regulation. We have a ramp of various -- from various media data there could be tightening in data connections and data privacy policy. So just wondering what could be the potential impact on the different marketing solutions under your platform. Should we expect certain marketing solutions to have less an impact than others?</p><p>And then secondly, a follow-up question on James. You just mentioned about, for example, some of the overseas game opportunities. So just wondering, when we expand our presence in overseas, is actually game development -- are we going to focus on mobile games? And how much we are actually looking at, as you mentioned, right, console games and other opportunities such as PC genes? We also noticed that you just established a couple of studios in U.S. So this is kind of like along that line.</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: Yes. Thank you. So on your first question about data collection and using data to target advertising, I think we've always been well known in the industry for being very thoughtful and judicious about the extent to which we use consumer data for our targeting purposes.</p><p>And I won't go into all of the details here. But I think at a high level, our assumption is that there could be fairly substantial changes in terms of the regulations around the use of data for advertising targeting purposes before those would have any meaningful negative impact on us simply because we have not been in nearly as aggressive as our Western peers or some of our local peers in terms of the granularity and the specificity of the ad targeting that we employ relative to the user data that we would potentially have access to. So that's on the first question.</p><p>On the second question, I think it was specifically around whether we're focused on mobile games globally or on PC and console games as well as mobile. And the answer is the latter. I think if you look at one of our biggest international game successes in the last year is Riot Games' Valorant, which is a PC-first game. One of our big game successes last quarter is Pok\u00e9mon Unite, which is a Nintendo Switch console game.</p><p>Pulling back a little bit, then I think that in years gone by, it would have required effectively a tripling of headcount and a tripling of effort in order to address PC and console as well as mobile at the same time. But that's decreasingly the case for a few reasons.</p><p>One is that the architecture of PC, Xbox, and PlayStation is increasingly convergent around x86. And meanwhile, the architecture of mobile and Switch is increasingly convergent around chipset design. And as a result, studios like TiMi that have been very much mobile-first find it easier to port to Switch than would have been the case when mobile and Nintendo architecturally are further apart.</p><p>And then secondly, there's a perfusion of software tools, including our investee, Epic's Unreal Engine, that simplify the process of developing for multiple platforms simultaneously.</p><p>And thirdly, within Tencent, we've made a number of investments, often acquisitions, of what were historically work for higher studios outside China with a number of specializations, but one of the specializations was helping a great game on PC become a great game on console or mobile or vice versa. So I think for all of those reasons, we are addressing our PC console and mobile together internationally, and we'll be increasingly doing so going forward.</p><p>OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Thomas Chong from Jefferies.</p><p>THOMAS CHONG, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is about the online video landscape. Just want to get a sense about the regulatory environment in long form video. Are we seeing that is relaxing and we should expect more long-form drama series and variety shows to come out in the second half?</p><p>And my second question is about -- just a follow-up on the previous questions on the international gaming side. Given that we have seen quite a very strong growth momentum in international games, just want to get a sense about our strategies going forward. Should we expect this more to be driven by in-house development or M&amp;A? And on that front, can management give us some color about the international gaming revenue contribution in Q2 as well as the long-term KPI?</p><p>JAMES GORDON MITCHELL: So why don't I address the international games question. We actually disclosed the international game revenue for 2Q, and you can back out, it's, I think, 25% of games segment revenue. And we also disclosed that the revenue grew 37% year-on-year in constant currency terms.</p><p>In terms of the strategy, then I think it's very much a content-first strategy in China, because of the QQ and Weixin distribution platforms with historically focused on both distribution and content creation, although increasingly shifting to content creation over time versus outside China. It's much more purely content-driven.</p><p>In terms of where the revenue and where the growth is coming from, then it's primarily existing studio, although supplemented periodically by acquisitions that we think can fill a particular hole or bring us a new technology capability we previously lacked. So looking at our international game revenue in the second quarter then, one big piece is games that we create in China, such as PUBG Mobile, such as Arena of Valor, and we export to the rest of the world.</p><p>A second big piece, relatively similar in size is games created by outside China, by some of our very successful investee studios outside China such as Riot with League of Legends and Valorant, such as Supercell with Clash of Clans and Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.</p><p>And then a smaller component is other studios outside China that are at more of an incubation stage or have released one big game previously and are now at work on their second game. So that's as far as our international games are concerned.</p><p>I mean with regard to online video, Martin may supplement me, but I think that as you're probably aware, in the first half of this year, there was some content constraints related to the July 1 celebration. And so it's possible that there may be more drama series appearing, or we have experienced more successful drama series already this summer.</p><p>On the flip side, I think that there's been some issues with variety shows and therefore, there's some dislocations to the variety show output in the second half of the year. You're probably aware that historically, variety shows tend to monetize primarily through advertising versus drama series monetize primarily through subscriptions. So our video business is increasingly subscription-driven, and I think that will remain true going forward.</p><p>WENDY HUANG: Thank you. Operator, we are closing the call now. Thank you, everyone.

That's how much rain fell in Zhengzhou in a single hour on 20 July, a record for mainland China. <br/>Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province and a city of 10 million, lies in central China. It is not normally a wet place. Annual rainfall is around 600mm, only slightly more[1] than fell on the city on that one day in July. Other parts of the province were also affected. According to official data[2], at least 302 people died and 55 went missing in the resulting floods province-wide. The media and official statements labelled it a 'once in a thousand years' event, or in one case 'once in five thousand years[3]'. Experts from the National Meteorological Centre complained these were not scientific descriptions. The language reflected the shock people were feeling. </p><p><br/>Abroad, extreme weather events usually result in more discussions about climate change. So, with China having committed to carbon neutrality, did these floods boost awareness of climate change? Was the climate angle missing? In the day or two after the floods, reports mainly focussed on the flooding of tunnels on Zhengzhou's underground line 5 and Jingguang Road, where people had been trapped. Readers were also informed about the causes of such an intense cloudburst, and why the risks had not been foreseen. The media were repeating explanations provided by local and national meteorologists, focusing on the preceding weather conditions and the local terrain. No link with climate change was drawn. Recommended International media, such as the Economist[4], pointed out that the climate change angle was missing from media coverage within China. But once the initial shock and concerns had eased, broader analyses appeared, which included climate change. <br/>Some commercial media outlets adopted a climate perspective first, discussing how climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent and more intense globally. While they didn't make a specific link with the Henan floods, they did refer to how these incidents increase discussion of climate change overseas. For example, a Yicai article[5] described how Nature magazine connected climate change and extreme precipitation events after 2018's Hurricane Florence. While Beijing News quoted[6] a foreign meteorologist who blamed the summer's floods in western Europe on climate change. Most of the experts featured in those articles came from international research institutions, intergovernmental organisations or NGOs. Little was heard from Chinese researchers or government officials. Flood damage in Xinxiang city, Henan (Image: Simon Song / Alamy) Official media outlets, managed directly by the Party and government, were a little slower. However, the close links those outlets have with official research institutions meant that reports from the China News Service and the Guangming Daily featured comments from the National Climate Centre[7] and members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering[8]. <br/>So, although the climate angle did receive coverage, the flooding did not heat up the climate debate. Data from Baidu shows that searches and instances in news coverage of the term 'cloudburst' rocketed after the Zhengzhou flooding and remained high for a week. But there was little change in searches for the term 'climate change' - two small peaks, but remaining low. The ignored climate goal behind carbon neutrality The concept of carbon neutrality is now well-known in China, but is often understood as a development strategy, a trend in investment and technology, rather than what it actually is: an emissions reduction target. The point of reducing emissions is to reduce the climate risks arising from global warming, a major one being more frequent and intense extreme weather. <br/>While it is not hard to find reports that, to varying degrees, draw the link between extreme weather events and climate change, the connection between carbon neutrality and climate change is missing. This creates a problem: carbon neutrality is generally regarded as a new 'national policy', originating with central government and being propagated from the top down -to state-owned enterprises and local governments, then onwards to private firms. But while the public are aware of the policy, they are not aware of the reasons behind it, and government efforts to raise awareness of climate risks are limited. Recommended So, shortly after the Henan floods, and with the public not yet understanding climate risks, a bizarre theory[9] went viral: that while climate change might be bad news for Europe and the US, it would be good for China, as historically Chinese dynasties flourish in warm and wet conditions. <br/>Authoritative publications such as the National Climate Change Assessment[10] and the Climate Change Green Book[11], have emphasised that the damage done by climate change outweighs any benefits. The spread of misleading information shows that when scientific knowledge is not effectively communicated, rumours and pseudoscience fill the gap. <br/>Achieving carbon neutrality will be a tough fight, requiring the participation of all parts of society. If we are to shift to low-carbon working and living, we need to communicate about climate risks, and why it is necessary to cut carbon emissions to reduce those risks. <br/>Better understanding of climate risks will also help with adaptation and preparation. Climate change means more frequent and intense extreme weather events, striking at unexpected times in unexpected places. The shocking scenes in Henan were not a one-off. That same month, cloudbursts and glacier melt caused flooding[12] in the Taklamakan Desert, the driest place in China, inundating a Sinopec exploration site. Experts have said[13] that climate change makes it necessary to 'raise awareness of disasters and change the existing understanding'. How to improve climate communications? Increasing understanding of climate risks is a long-term undertaking. The coverage of the Henan floods points to some near-term actions we could take. <br/>In China, wider awareness of climate risks will require the participation of state media. Not long ago, those outlets provided widespread coverage of carbon neutrality, popularising the concept across society as a whole. But the reporting on the floods shows no signs of an effort to link the intense rainfall with climate risks, or to link carbon neutrality with the reduction of those risks. That was a missed opportunity. <br/>'Official' scientists - those working for public bodies, such as government departments, universities and research institutions - are usually the voices most trusted by the Chinese public. But in coverage of the floods, they were less visible than scientists from overseas, international bodies, or NGOs. Widening understanding of climate science needs those official scientists to be more active communicators. <br/>Some communication techniques could also help. After the floods, Chinese scientists did mention that climate change could exacerbate extreme weather, but always stressed that there wasn't enough evidence to link climate change with this particular incident. Scientists should remain professionally cautious, but how to talk about the uncertainties of climate science? Recommended Climate change communication experts warn[14] that while uncertainty is the impetus that drives climate research forward, for the public it is a barrier to action. For ordinary people, the repeated emphasis of the uncertainties reduces the persuasiveness of scientific information, in turn reducing the inclination of government and the public to act. <br/>In its handbook[15] on climate communication, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) suggests that when explaining links between climate change and extreme weather, scientists should emphasise established findings and consensus, and avoid overly technical language. The IPCC's recently published Sixth Assessment Report[16] shows that, since the 1950s, rainfall has become more frequent and more intense in the vast majority of regions, and that climate change, caused by human activity, is likely to be the main cause. That is a scientific consensus worthy of emphasis. <br/>International experience shows that using the attention generated by extreme weather events as an opportunity to talk about the underlying science can raise public understanding of climate change and its associated risks, and in turn boost emissions reductions and adaptation. This is not about taking advantage of a disaster. It is about ensuring that when the next 'unthinkable' disaster occurs, our losses will not be so grave. <br/>The author wishes to thank Wu Yunong and Jiang Mengnan for data collection and analysis. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13675220\">https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13675220</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13853652\">https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13853652</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210721A00ZA300\">https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210721A00ZA300</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/31/amid-extreme-weather-china-avoids-mention-of-climate-change?frsc=dg%7Ce\">https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/31/amid-extreme-weather-china-avoids-mention-of-climate-change?frsc=dg%7Ce</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yicai.com/news/101117953.html\">https://www.yicai.com/news/101117953.html</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bjnews.com.cn/detail/162695380514130.html\">https://www.bjnews.com.cn/detail/162695380514130.html</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ccchina.org.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=56949\">http://www.ccchina.org.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=56949</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.gmw.cn/gmrb/html/2021-07/23/nw.D110000gmrb_20210723_5-10.htm\">https://epaper.gmw.cn/gmrb/html/2021-07/23/nw.D110000gmrb_20210723_5-10.htm</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/L22Y2sZdEh07At-CWGYZeA\">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/L22Y2sZdEh07At-CWGYZeA</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cma.gov.cn/2011xzt/2015zt/20151127/2015112705/201511/t20151127_298446.html\">http://www.cma.gov.cn/2011xzt/2015zt/20151127/2015112705/201511/t20151127_298446.html</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/xwbfbh/wqfbh/39595/42117/xgbd42124/Document/1668852/1668852.htm\">http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/xwbfbh/wqfbh/39595/42117/xgbd42124/Document/1668852/1668852.htm</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixin.com/2021-07-30/101748597.html\">https://www.caixin.com/2021-07-30/101748597.html</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDU1Mzg3Mw==&amp;#38;mid=2651339802&amp;#38;idx=1&amp;#38;sn=d9a8f94bf00f3336560d1d87a9c41858&amp;#38;chksm=bdbf9e648ac81772103f7504e8f4ffc15c52d3b76b64d5685c33bbb786d51a7d94500fe65777\">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDU1Mzg3Mw==&amp;#38;mid=2651339802&amp;#38;idx=1&amp;#38;sn=d9a8f94bf00f3336560d1d87a9c41858&amp;#38;chksm=bdbf9e648ac81772103f7504e8f4ffc15c52d3b76b64d5685c33bbb786d51a7d94500fe65777</url> [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/dl/coin_uncertainty-handbook.pdf\">https://yaleclimateconnections.org/dl/coin_uncertainty-handbook.pdf</url> [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2017/08/Climate-Outreach-IPCC-communications-handbook.pdf\">https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2017/08/Climate-Outreach-IPCC-communications-handbook.pdf</url> [ 16]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://chinadialogue.org.cn/en/climate/ipcc-report-will-scientists-latest-warning-inject-urgency-into-climate-negotiations/\">https://chinadialogue.org.cn/en/climate/ipcc-report-will-scientists-latest-warning-inject-urgency-into-climate-negotiations/</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "Newstex Blogs", "instances": ["The media were repeating explanations provided by local and national meteorologists, focusing on the preceding weather conditions and the local terrain.

Mr Brant had raised questions over potential failures from authorities in relation to the floods. There was a year's worth of rain in Zhengzhou in just three days, leaving 14 people dead and more than 500 commuters trapped when the city's subway system flooded during rush hour. The hashtag #BBCSpreadsRumours began circulating on Weibo and was later promoted by Chinese state media. The Henan Chinese Communist Party Youth League later called on its more than one million followers to seek out Mr Brant and call the police if he was found. But angry residents mistakingly restrained journalist Mathias Boelinger in the street. The BBC said its reporters had been subjected to online hate while other outlets had been harassed on the ground in 'attacks which continue to endanger foreign journalists'. However, Mr Zhao slammed the BBC, saying it deserved to be'unpopular with the Chinese public'. He said: 'Do you know that the Chinese netizens refer to BBC as 'Bad-mouthing Broadcasting Corporation'. 'Having long been clinging to its ideological bias against China, BBC has produced fake news time and again, spread false information on issues related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Covid-19, attacked and vilified China in serious deviation from the professional ethics of journalism. 'Everything happens for a reason.' Western media coverage has threatened to undermine such a position by dismissing calls for press freedom as a cover to 'fabricate fake news'. Mr Zhao continued: 'Robin Brant, BBC journalist stationed in Shanghai, continued to put ideology above facts in his report about the torrential rain in Henan, turning a blind eye to the fact that the Chinese government has been sparing no efforts in conducting rescue work, and local residents have been volunteering help. 'Some Western media should ask themselves as to why their reports have caused public outrage in China.'

(@zlj517) July 29, 2021[3] Mr Zhao's comments were picked up by tabloid newspaper and Beijing mouthpiece The Global Times. Editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said such resentment of foreign media was 'completely justifiable'. However, he said physical harassment of reporters would only fuel biased reporting. Earlier in 2021, The Global Times criticised the BBC over a documentary it released about original Covid-19 epicentre Wuhan and its return to normality. It accused the BBC and reporter John Sudworth of using a grey footage filter to 'deliberately create a depressing and dark atmosphere'. Mr Sudworth fled China for Taiwan earlier in 2021 over fears for his safety. Mr Zhao said foreign correspondents 'enjoy an open and free reporting environment in China'. But press freedom groups say the space for overseas reporters to operate is tightening, with journalists followed on the streets, suffering harassment online and refused visas.

Global transformational change is urgently needed in agricultural production and consumption patterns, say experts. In July, a video[1] went viral on social media in Argentina showing people walking across what looks like a desert. But it isn't a desert. This is the bed of the Paran River, part of the second-largest river system in South America. Normally the stream rises in Brazil and reaches the sea via the River Plate, draining a vast watershed covering all of Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina. Normally the water volume flowing to the Atlantic roughly equals[2] that of the Mississippi River. </p><p><br/> What's happening now is not normal. The drying up of large stretches of river comes as the most severe drought since 1944 afflicts the region. No relief is expected in the short term. According to forecasts[3] from Argentina's Ministry of Public Works, the lack of rain will last for at least another three months. <br/> Besides damaging crops, the drought also means barge-hauled grains can't get to market cheaply[4], forcing Argentina to support commodities transport with $10.4 million, and costing the nation's grain farmers and exporters $315 million[5]. It's likely consumers will ultimately foot the bill. <br/> The Paran region is experiencing 'a veritable environmental holocaust,' says Rafael Colombo[6], a member of the Argentinian Association of Environmental Lawyers. <br/> The multiple causes, he states, include 'a complex and diversified series of anthropomorphic interventions, associated with the expansion of agro-industrial, ranching, forest, river and mining extractivism over the last 50 years.' Add to that the impact of global human-caused climate change. <br/>Due to lack of rain at the source of the So Francisco River, Brazil's Sobradinho reservoir is experiencing the worst drought in its history. Image by Marcello Casal Jr/Agncia Brasil (CC BY 3.0 BR). A world of hurt <br/>Extreme weather impacts can be expected to dot various parts of the planet every year, but the Paran watershed drought isn't an outlier in 2021. Instead, it represents the new normal as major regional bread baskets around the globe are assaulted by unusually high temperatures that exacerbate simultaneous record droughts, bringing disastrous wildfires. Floods, too, are unprecedented this year: While the Paran endured record drought, the neighboring Amazon watershed in Manaus, Brazil, was battered by unprecedented June deluges[7]. <br/> These planet-wide events all combined are having a detrimental impact on crops and livestock, and though it is too early to calculate the full cost, the world will likely see significant price hikes[8] in coming months on everything from tomatoes to bread to beef. <br/> 'Unprecedented' looks to be the theme best describing 2021's extreme weather events: In mid-July, China's Henan province, one of the country's most populous regions, was hit by a year's worth of rain \u2014 640 millimeters (more than 2 feet) \u2014 in just three days, a phenomenon 'unseen in the last 1,000 years[9].' <br/> At least 71 people died[10] and 1.4 million people fled the floods, even as China braces for more heavy rain. The deluge also impacted 972,000 hectares[11] (2.4 million acres) of cropland, and \u2014 while much of that region's grain crop had been harvested previously \u2014 processing, storage and transportation of summer grains could be affected, with floodwaters damaging flour factories. <br/> China isn't alone. In late July, parts of India saw 594 mm (23 inches)[12] of rain in just days, while Manila and outlying provinces in the Philippines[13] were inundated by torrential rains, causing mass evacuations and crop damage. <br/> Extreme heat waves and drought have smashed records across the U.S. West, from southern California to Nevada and Oregon. As the unprecedented mega drought deepens, California's water regulators this week took a highly unusual step: forbidding thousands of farmers[14] from extracting water from major rivers and streams for irrigation. The drought is surely going to be bad news for spaghetti lovers: California grows more than 90% of America's canned tomatoes and a third of the world's supply. Expect much higher prices and 'cue the tomato hoarding[15].' <br/>Don Pedro Reservoir in California (the brown areas should be covered in water). The deepening unprecedented mega drought there means thousands of farmers who annually extract water from rivers and streams for irrigation will be unable to tap those sources this year. Image by Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay. As mega fires again burn across the U.S. West in 2021, firefighting resources are being stretched to the limit. Forest Service NW via Twitter. <br/>Meanwhile, 91 wildfires [16]are currently raging across the U.S., devastating ecosystems and infrastructure. Three million acres have burned so far this year, with the fire season far from over, while during the same period last year only 2.1 million acres burned. Western U.S. climate change-induced mega fires are also having adverse agricultural commodities impacts, with farmers and ranchers now saddled with skyrocketing fire insurance rates, often increasing by tens of thousands of dollars. '[T]he trend has sent shock waves through California's agricultural regions[17],' says online environmental news service Grist. Those exorbitant insurance rates could push some farms out of business, or make agriculture too risky to insure. <br/> Farther east, in Colorado and Utah, cattle ranchers are feeling the pain too. As their drought worsens, many have reluctantly decided to cull their herds[18]. 'Everyone is gonna be selling their cows, so it's probably smarter now to do it, while the price is up, before the market gets flooded,' said[19] Buzz Bates, a rancher from Oab, Utah. <br/> The West's drought has also created ideal conditions for grasshopper eggs to hatch, leading to widespread infestation and crop loss. 'I can only describe grasshoppers in expletives,' said[20] one Oregon farmer. 'They are a scourge of the Earth They just destroy the land, destroy the crops.' <br/>Locust in Indonesia. Major infestations hit Africa last year and the U.S. this year. Image by Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay. The specter of global hunger <br/>Drought this year is exacerbating hunger in some of Earth's poorest countries. Southern Madagascar is experiencing its worst drought in four decades. Maliha, 38 years old and a single mother of eight, told Reliefweb[21]: 'Since the rain stopped, the children are not eating regularly. I give them whatever I can find, like cactus leaves. With this diet, they have diarrhea and nausea, but we have no choice. At least it doesn't kill them.' <br/> According to World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley, the food crisis in Madagascar has been building[22] for years: 'There have been back-to-back droughts which have pushed communities right to the very edge of starvation.' More than 1 million Madagascans have been left 'food insecure,' without access to 'sufficient, safe and nutritious food,' he said[23]. <br/> He's emphatic as to the reason: 'This is not because of war or conflict; this is because of climate change.' <br/> As disaster follows disaster, some evoke tales of the 10 plagues found in the Old Testament, sent by God to punish humanity for its evil. Not even the plague of locusts is missing: Just a year ago, the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen suffered the largest desert locust outbreak[24] in 25 years, triggered by record rains. In Ethiopia alone more than 356,000 tons of cereals were lost, leaving almost 1 million people food insecure. <br/>Women wait to receive emergency hot meals for their malnourished children in the village of Sihanamaro, Androy region, southern Madagascar.

Commodities impacted planetwide <br/>Extreme weather continues slamming crops[25] across the world at a time when food prices are already near the highest in a decade[26]. The list goes on: Flooding in China's key pork-producing region has raised the threat of animal disease. Devastating rains in the EU are raising fears of widespread fungal diseases in grains. And in the High Plains along the U.S.-Canada border, grains and livestock are at risk as predicted deepening drought[27] keeps commodities brokers and farmers on edge. Russia, another global bread basket, is also hot and dry, and wheat crop expectations have fallen[28]. <br/>Brazil is one of the most important agricultural exporters in the world. But prolonged drought[29] there is causing concerns for 2021's second corn crop[30]. Drought and rare freezing weather are hurting coffee-growing regions too, which are suffering some of their coldest weather in 25 years. On July 29, a wide area of Brazil even saw snow[31]. (Climate chaos, while it produces substantially more heat records, also sometimes generates extreme cold.) The coffee harvest will be damaged. World coffee prices are rising[32]. <br/> Other crops could be impacted, as Brazil is the planet's biggest exporter of sugar, orange juice and soybeans. 'There's no other country in the world that has that kind of influence on the world market conditions \u2014 what happens in Brazil affects everyone,' Michael Sheridan, director of sourcing and shared value at Intelligentsia Coffee, a Chicago-based roaster and retailer, told[33] Bloomberg. <br/>Flooded area in the town of Qingshanqiao in Ningxiang, Hunan, China in 2017.

Such events did occur in the past, but are now becoming increasingly more frequent, stressing communities and entire nations. Image by srinivasa krishna via Flickr[36] (CC BY 2.0[37]). Feast or famine: Profiting from disaster <br/>As elsewhere, Brazil's climate disasters are regionalized, only damaging harvests in some places, but not others. In unaffected areas, farmers are doing well, even better than expected because world commodity prices have climbed, partly because of droughts around the planet. And as is so often the case in the commodities market, one farmer benefits from another's disaster, though the big commodities traders have the versatility and economic power to weather whiplash weather \u2014 at least for now. <br/> The Brazilian government's statistics authority, IBGE, is expecting a 'record-breaking harvest[38] of grains, cereals and oilseeds in 2021.' Agribusiness outside the drought-affected Paran region is jubilant. Maurilio Biagi Filho, whose family owns vast sugar plantations, says[39] that it is 'very rare' for high agricultural prices to coincide with record production. 'When that happens, it's extraordinary,' he adds. <br/> A similar phenomenon is evident in the U.S., where the fortunes of two very different corn belts have emerged. The U.S. Southeast is experiencing 'great summer weather' (cool and wet), while the Northwestis facing 'a terrible drought' (hot/dry weather). 'The crux of the matter is the crop is being damaged in the West, andimproving in the East,' comments one farming media[40] source. <br/>Mauri\u0301lio Biagi Filho, one of Brazil's largest agribusiness magnates, is expecting a big boost in income this year due to a hike in world commodity prices caused by the nation's droughts. Image courtesy of JornalCana. <br/>This mixed economic picture comes with a caveat: As 2021 unfolds and the global climate crisis deepens year-on-year, forecasts[41] say fewer and fewer farmers may benefit, with extreme weather disasters and failed harvests proliferating. <br/> In the 1990s, a Woods Hole Research Center scientist, describing impending climate chaos, put it this way: 'Think of a pot of cool water on the stove. Add heat to the pot and keep adding it. The water will start to move, swirling in increasingly erratic and intensifying patterns. Small bubbles arise, then bigger bubbles appear as you add energy to the system, until you're at a rolling boil. That's a good metaphor for global climate change: as emissions rise, extreme weather events pop up more often, randomly and unpredictably everywhere.' <br/>Climate chaos breeds food insecurity and political instability <br/>The downside to the current hike in commodity prices is already becoming clear for many: With millions of poor people hit by climate disasters, governments in financially strapped countries are having to provide food relief. 'Food inflation is the last thing governments need right now,' Carlos Mera, an analyst at Rabobank, told[42] the Financial Times. <br/> Higher food prices often generate political unrest, even in countries where dissent is firmly repressed. In early July, protesters took to the streets[43] in southwestern Iran, chanting anti-regime slogans and demanding greater access to water for drinking, for farmlands and their cattle. <br/> But the climate crisis shows no sign of easing: On June 22, Nuwaiseeb, Kuwait, recorded temperatures of 53.2 Celsius (127.7 Fahrenheit). In neighboring Iraq and Iran, temperatures didn't lag far behind. All-time records were broken in Turkey too (where wildfires are incinerating farm animals[44]), and in both Northern Ireland and northern Japan. Moscow was hit by a historic heat wave[45] in June, with temperatures soaring to 34C (93F), a 120-year record. These heat waves are bad news for global food supplies and prices \u2014 and for national security. <br/> High food prices, caused partly by climate change-driven drought[46], are believed to have been a key factor behind the unrest that spread across[47] a swath of the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, generating the Arab Spring. <br/> Prescient journalist Ross Gelbspan, writing in 1997[48], warned the world of the perpetual 'coming state of emergency,' a deepening and disruptive climate change abyss \u2014 an extreme weather maelstrom into which food production systems, whole populations, governments and countries would fall and fail, bringing hunger, human misery, civil unrest and war. <br/>Carlos Mera, a senior analyst at Rabobank, a Dutch banking and financial services company, on a trip to Brazil to analyze the coffee harvest, dialing in to a teleconference in 2019. Image via Twitter. Climate breakdown <br/>The consensus is growing: Today, almost all scientists and policymakers (besides the politicians aligned with fossil fuel interests) agree that the underlying cause of the current climate crisis is a hundred years \u2014 less than a nanosecond in the planet's history \u2014 of human activity, pumping billions of tons[49] of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. <br/> Recently, a draft report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scheduled to be published at the beginning of next year, was obtained[50] by the AFP news agency. AFP says the report reads as 'by far, the most comprehensive catalogue ever assembled of how climate change is upending our world.' The IPCC warns that the devastating impacts of global warming will be painfully obvious before a child born today turns 30. <br/> Just like Rafael Colombo, the Argentine environmental lawyer, the IPCC points to a witch's brew of anthropomorphic influences: greenhouse gas emissions, degradation of land under intensive agriculture, deforestation, overuse of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, overgrazing, and over extraction of water for farming and other uses. But still, emissions rise along with population and the reckless use of resources. <br/>Soy plantation abutting tropical forest in Brazil. Deforestation and land degradation due to aggressive agribusiness expansion are among anthropomorphic impacts in the Amazon region \u2014 impacts that also include increasing drought brought by climate change.

An urgent need for 'transformational change' <br/>The draft IPCC report states[51]: 'We need transformational change operating on processes and behaviors at all levels: individual, communities, business, institutions and governments. We must redefine our way of life and consumption.' <br/> Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, associate professor at the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, says vastly improved farming techniques are the way forward. He told Mongabay there must be 'greater investments in R&amp;#38;D and 'climate-smart' agriculture to compensate for the climate change 'headwind.'' He emphasized, 'These investments need to be done now \u2014 or yesterday.' Generating higher output from 'climate-smart plants' would allow humanity to 'sustain historical growth rates in [crop] production without having to increase inputs.' <br/> Colleen Doherty, an associate professor of biochemistry at North Carolina University, takes a similar approach, suggesting that 'climate-smart' agriculture could be achieved partly by creating far more resilient plants. 'We have to breed crops for conditions that we don't even know right now what they are going to be.Things are changing so rapidly that we need to be able to anticipate what the problems are before they happen,' she said, adding with cautious optimism: 'We've barely touched the potential of plants.' <br/> If such an approach is to work, it must deliver much more than improved technology has achieved in the last couple of decades. A recent paper, 'Anthropogenic climate change has slowed global agricultural productivity growth[52],' shows that climate change has wiped out seven years of improvements in agricultural productivity over the past 60 years. Ortiz-Bobea, the paper's lead author, said that 'the slowdown effect' may well intensify, as 'global agriculture is growing increasingly vulnerable to climate change' and 'global warming is accelerating.' <br/> A very different method for confronting the crisis is laid out by the regenerative agriculture movement. Its proponents are skeptical of scientists' capacity to breed more resilient plants. 'Despite billions of dollars being spent on research and media hype there is not one major crop that has benefited from genetically engineered modifications to make them significantly more resilient to drought,' Andr Leu, international director of Regeneration International, told Mongabay, though biotechnology companies and researchers do claim some progress in that field of development. <br/>Woman stands outside her home destroyed by floods in Kenya.

Extreme weather events, including floods and droughts are becoming more frequent and more intense as the climate crisis deepens. With the current COVID-19 crisis and locusts invasion, flooding exacerbates the food security situation in the country. Image  Greenpeace[54]. <br/>Answers will not emerge from laboratories, he argues, but by working with rural communities who have acquired an unrivaled knowledge of local ecosystems through centuries of experience. 'There are numerous published studies showing that increasing agro-biodiversity through a mix of crop species and varieties, along with farmer-led participatory breeding, increases drought and extreme climate weather resilience,' he said. 'These systems are now working globally on every arable continent.' Moreover, advocates say regenerative agriculture can 'substantially mitigate climate change[55]' by sequestering significant greenhouse gas emissions. <br/> As yet, neither approach is translating into the 'transformational change' that the draft IPCC report calls for, largely because governments worldwide have yet to act aggressively to address the scale of the catastrophe unfolding planetwide at breakneck speed. And few analysts hold out much hope this will change at the vital COP26[56] climate summit this November in Scotland. <br/> Meanwhile, the situation continues to deteriorate: Forecasts[57] released this month by the International Energy Agency predict the world will record 'the highest levels of carbon dioxide output in human history' this year. <br/> Many scientists and policymakers fear that the very survival of the human species is now at risk. The draft IPCC report warns: 'Life on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems. Humans cannot.' <br/>Dried-out rice fields in the Anosy region of southern Madagascar. As food insecurity worsens globally, national security could be threatened in many countries.

thing, the destruction of wordsDon't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.' -George Orwell, 1984 [H/t Anna Krylov] </p><p><br/><br/>Number of the Week: - About 1,200 cubic meters per second in 1804 <br/><br/><br/>THIS WEEK: <br/><br/>By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) <br/><br/>Floods and Droughts: The Ahr River is a relatively short river roughly 89 kilometers (55 mi) arising in the steep terrain of Rhine Land, Germany, which borders Luxembourg and Belgium. It forms the steep Ahr Valley running east, noted for producing red wines from vineyards terraced in the hillside. Before emptying into the Rhine River, the Ahr broadens out providing flatter land for growing fruits and vegetables. Like all steep river valleys, such as those in West Virginia, the Ahr Valley is subject to flash floods. The last catastrophic one was in 1910. <br/><br/>Beginning July 13, major flooding occurred in Germany and Belgium and to a lesser degree in Holland. According to reports, including The Sunday Times, officials in 'Germany knew the floods were coming, but the warnings didn't work. Weather scientists say a 'monumental failure of the system' is directly to blame for the death and devastation triggered by a month's worth of rain that fell in two days this week.' <br/><br/><br/><br/>According to a July 23, 2021, post on the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) <br/><br/>What information did EFAS provide in relation to the recent flood events affecting the Rhine and Meuse river basins? <br/><br/><br/>On 9 and 10 July, flood forecasts by the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service indicated a high probability of flooding for the Rhine River basin, affecting Switzerland and Germany. <br/><br/>The following day, subsequent forecasts also indicated a high risk of flooding for the Meuse River basin, affecting Belgium. The magnitude of the floods forecasted for the Rhine River basin increased significantly in this period. <br/><br/><br/>The first EFAS notifications for the Rhine River basin were sent to the relevant national authorities starting on 10 July. The first EFAS notifications for the Meuse River basin were sent to the relevant national authorities starting on 12 July. With the continuously updated forecasts, more than 25 notifications were sent for specific regions of the Rhine and Meuse River basins in the following days until 14 July. <br/><br/>After the flood, the climate change chorus immediately sprang into action, blaming carbon dioxide-caused climate change, without evidence. German officials parroted the same excuse, also claiming that EFAS covers only large rivers. The response from EFAS was: <br/><br/><br/>'Does EFAS forecast floods only for large rivers? <br/><br/>'EFAS aims at predicting floods for large rivers and their tributaries but provides as well flash flood predictions for smaller scale rivers. In the case of the Meuse and Rhine river flood events both, predictions for the large-scale river sections of the Rhine and Meuse as well as the flash flood predictions for many of the small-scale tributaries of these river basins indicated a high probability of flooding or flash flooding, respectively.' <br/><br/>Why did officials ignore warnings from the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS)? One can only speculate, but it may be the same problem as to why New Orleans officials did not order evacuation of the city before hurricane Katrina caused flooding of the city through Lake Pontchartrain. They were afraid of a false positive - evacuating the city and not having a flood. The officials then blamed climate change and the Bush Administration for their failure. <br/><br/><br/><br/>We are seeing similar issues with the drought in the US western states. Four years ago, many western states experienced heavy rains. For example, water flowed over the emergency spillway Oroville Dam in California, even after the main spill was repaired and operating. The water caused flooding of communities downstream. The flooding was blamed on human-caused climate change. Now the drought is blamed on human-caused climate change. For government officials, it is far easier to blame climate change than to accept responsibility for failure to act when appropriate or to acting inappropriately. <br/><br/>These false claims give rise to the false belief that cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will prevent extreme weather events. The deception is twofold. First, there is no causal link between CO2 and extreme weather events. The second deception is that reducing CO2 would result in cooling, with a subsequent reduction of extreme weather events. In fact, extreme weather events are a characteristic of cooler climate. <br/><br/><br/>See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Science, Policy, and Evidence, Changing Weather.

His essay was motivated by the heat wave in the US Northwest and Canadian Southwest, but uses an analogy of flooding, which is appropriate for the flooding in Europe. After explaining the analogy, he states: <br/><br/><br/><br/>This situation is a good example of the golden rule of climate attribution: the more unusual and extreme the event, the greater the proportion of the event is due to natural variability rather than global warming. <br/><br/>That is, climate change is slow and moderate: compare 50 years of slight warming with the 6 months of natural change between July and January. Therefore, fast changes must be due to natural variability. In discussing FAR, he writes: <br/><br/><br/>'Unfortunately, there are serious flaws in their approach: climate models fail to produce sufficient natural variability (they underplay the black swans) and their global climate models don't have enough resolution to correctly simulate critical intense, local precipitation features (from mountain enhancement to thunderstorms). On top of that, they generally use unrealistic greenhouse gas emissions in their models (too much, often using the RCP8.5 extreme emissions scenario). And there is more, but you get the message. (I am weather/climate modeler, by the way, and know the model deficiencies intimately.)' <br/><br/>Currently, black swans apply to financial events. But they were important in the development of the scientific method. At one time philosophers in Europe asserted deductive logic could be used to uncover things about the natural world. The argument went along the lines: All swans are white; therefore, if it is a swan, it must be white. <br/><br/><br/>In 1697, black swans were discovered in Australia. The discovery exposed the mistaken assumption, leading to the realization that the assumption must be thoroughly tested against all physical evidence and even if the assumption is not refuted deductions from it are only tentative. <br/><br/>As Mass states, the extreme emissions scenario of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are unrealistic. The Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP 8.5) results in a calculated CO2-caused warming of the earth's surface of 8.5 watts per meter squared. According to calculations being used for the upcoming IPCC report, this would result in a surface warming of 2.5 to 4.9 degrees C (4.5 to 8.8 degrees F). There are thousands of 'climate science' reports based on this unrealistic assumption. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Mass concludes his essay with a practical warning: <br/><br/>'Many of the climate attribution studies are resulting in headlines that are deceptive and result in people coming to incorrect conclusions about the relative roles of global warming and natural variability in current extreme weather. Scary headlines and apocalyptic attribution studies needlessly provoke fear. Furthermore, incorrect, and hyped information results in poor decision-making.  <br/><br/>'Here in Washington State, several politicians fixate on climate change as the cause of current environmental events, while neglecting key actions needed to ensure we are adapted to the current climate (such as restoring our forests, dealing with problematic power infrastructure, improving water quality). And some media outlets (like a certain major newspaper in Seattle) are aiding such ineffective leaders by pushing an often uninformed and exaggerated climate-change narrative. <br/><br/><br/>'There is little doubt that the Earth is warming and that human emissions are a contributing factor, but many of the extreme events being blamed on global warming are predominantly the result of natural or other causes (such as changes in land use). If the Earth continues to warm, by the end of the century the impacts of global warming on extremes will increase substantially, something I have shown in my own research. <br/><br/><br/><br/>'We need to worry about climate change and take steps in both mitigation (reduce greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation. But hype and exaggeration of its impacts only undermine the potential for effective action.'

The total nameplate generation is 27,879 MW of which 79.5% is hydro and 10.5% (2930 MW) is wind. <br/><br/>This week was another exciting time for those who balance the load having to increase and decrease hydro power with changes in wind power. Midday on the 18th wind power was near zero, went up to 1000 MW for a brief time on the morning of the 19th, then back down to less than 200 MW at midday then up to about 2200 MW at midnight. It has fluctuated between 1000 and 2300 MW from the early morning of July 20 to shortly after midnight on July 21. Since then, it hit zero twice and has not been above 1500 MW (about 50% of nameplate capacity). A rough estimate is that wind has been erratically generating about 20% of nameplate capacity from July 22 to midnight July 24. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In Master Resource, Robert Bradley has a post based on Tom Bethell's essay 'The Electric Windmill.' In a the 'Appropriate Community Technology Fair,' sponsored by the Federal Government in 1979, Bethell took a close look at the demonstration of a wind turbine. It was using electricity from the grid to operate, not generating electricity to the grid. Such is the nature of the 'alternative energy' zealots in government. <br/><br/>Such actions prompt TWTW to state: The critical issue about wind power is not so much the cost of electricity to the consumer when wind is generating electricity; more importantly, it is the cost of electricity to the consumer when wind is not generating electricity. Why should the taxpayer subsidize expensive machines that raise the cost of reliable electricity when they undermine the financial viability of reliable generation?

Then the 'Annual Summary Report of Coral Reef Condition 2020/2021' by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) came out. It stated: <br/><br/>'Over the 35 years of monitoring by AIMS, the reefs of the GBR have shown an ability to recover after disturbances. <br/><br/><br/>'In 2021, widespread recovery was underway, largely due to increases in fast growing Acropora corals. <br/><br/>'Survey reefs experienced low levels of acute stressors over the past 12 months with no prolonged high temperatures or major cyclones. Numbers of outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on survey reefs have generally decreased; however, there remain ongoing outbreaks on some reefs in the Southern GBR.' <br/><br/><br/><br/>The reef has the highest coral cover in 36 years of surveys. UNESCO backed down from the 'in danger' classification but kept the 'critical' classification. It is important that much of the AIMS research is done in the field, in the water, and not a fly-by which many other 'experts' use. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. <br/><br/>******************* <br/><br/>Life Flourishing in Acidic Oceans? About 400 million years ago, carbon dioxide levels were very high, perhaps 7 to 10 times greater than they are today. In attempting to establish a relationship between a carbon-silicon cycle and temperatures, a study traces a carbon-silicon cycle over three billion years. What is particularly interesting about the study is the sudden profusion of life both on land and in the water that occurred about 400 million years ago. <br/><br/><br/>This research indicates that the claim that increasing CO2 will harm marine life is highly questionable. See links under Changing Seas <br/><br/>******************* <br/><br/>Holocene Cooling: A study of the tree line across most of Russia shows a cooling starting about 9000 years ago. The abstract states: <br/><br/><br/>'Over most of Russia, forest advanced to or near the current arctic coastline between 9000 and 7000 yr. B.P. and retreated to its present position by between 4000 and 3000 yr. B.P. Forest establishment and retreat was roughly synchronous across most of northern Russia.' <br/><br/>This finding supports the research of H.H. Lamb and recent assertions by the International Commission on Stratigraphy of cooling starting about 8200 years ago. The finding that forests were at or near the coastline of the Arctic Ocean 9000 years ago prompts the question: How did the polar bears survive? The Arctic sea ice must have been largely melted. Of course, those who do not believe the exaggerations used by the Biden administration to declare a 'climate crisis' have no such question.

Using reconstructed flow rates of the river by local historians he estimates that: <br/><br/><br/><br/>'However, both [the recent flood and a 1910 flood] are far overshadowed by the disaster of 1804, whose water discharge, with a peak discharge of about 1,200 m3/s, was twice as massive as the 1910 event. Compared to the current flood, the factor is almost threefold. <br/><br/><br/>From ice cores, the estimate CO2 level in 1800 is 283 ppmv (parts per million volume). In 2021, the maximum (May) estimate from Mauna Loa is 419. How does the 48% increase in CO2 work out in calculating the Fractional Attribution of Risk (FAR) for the 1804 event?

Since mountain peaks are smaller than these grid boxes, mountains in climate models, including the Sierra Madre, are shorter than in reality.

We show that these differences can be resolved by making mountains in climate models as high as in reality.' <br/><br/><br/>[SEPP Comment: Given the way the Central American Mountains disturb atmospheric circulations; one can only speculate how much the closing of the Central American Seaway about 3 million years ago changed the ocean circulations.

Selon eux, il est urgent d'oprer un changement global dans les modes de production et de consommation agricoles. En juillet, une vido[1] est devenue virale sur les rseaux sociaux en Argentine. </p><p>On y voyait des personnes traversant ce qui ressemblait  un dsert, ce qui n'tait en fait pas le cas. Il s'agissait du lit du fleuve Paran, qui fait partie du deuxime plus grand systme fluvial d'Amrique du Sud. En temps normal, le cours d'eau prend sa source au Brsil et rejoint la mer via le Rio de la Plata, entranant un vaste bassin versant couvrant tout le Paraguay, le sud du Brsil et le nord de l'Argentine. Habituellement, le volume d'eau qui s'coule vers l'Atlantique est  peu prs gal[2]  celui du fleuve Mississippi. <br/> Ce qui se passe actuellement n'est pas normal. L'asschement de vastes tronons de rivire survient alors que la rgion est frappe par la scheresse la plus grave depuis 1944 et aucune amlioration n'est prvue  court terme. Selon les prvisions[3] du ministre argentin des travaux publics, la pluie ne reviendra pas avant au moins trois mois. <br/> En plus d'endommager les cultures, la scheresse empche les crales transportes par barges d'atteindre le march de faon abordable[4], ce qui oblige l'Argentine  subventionner le transport des produits de base  hauteur de 10,4 millions de dollars et co\u00fbte 315 millions de dollars[5] aux producteurs et exportateurs de crales du pays. Il se peut que les consommateurs finissent par devoir payer l'addition. <br/> La rgion de Paran connat un vritable holocauste environnemental, dclare Rafael Colombo[6], membre de l'Association argentine des avocats pour l'environnement. <br/> Selon lui, les causes multiples comprennent une srie complexe et diversifie d'interventions menes par l'Homme, associes au dveloppement de l'agro-industriel, de l'levage intensif, de la dforestation, des barrages et de l'exploitation minire au cours des 50 dernires annes. Ajoutez  cela les consquences du changement climatique mondial caus par l'Homme. <br/>En raison du manque de pluie  la source du fleuve So Francisco, le rservoir de Sobradinho au Brsil connat la pire scheresse de son histoire.

Un monde de souffrances <br/>On peut s'attendre  ce que des phnomnes mtorologiques extrmes se produisent chaque anne aux quatre coins de la plante, mais la scheresse du bassin versant du Paran n'est pas une aberration en 2021. Au contraire, elle reprsente la nouvelle normalit alors que les principaux greniers  bl rgionaux du monde entier sont assaillis par des tempratures exceptionnellement leves qui intensifient des scheresses record simultanes, entranant des incendies de fort dsastreux. Cette anne, les inondations sont elles aussi sans prcdent. Alors que le Paran a connu une scheresse record, le bassin versant de l'Amazone voisin,  Manaus (Brsil), a t frapp par des dluges sans prcdent en juin[7]. <br/> Tous ces vnements plantaires combins ont un impact ngatif sur les cultures et le btail, et bien qu'il soit trop t\u00f4t pour en calculer les frais, les prix de tous les produits augmenteront probablement de manire significative[8] dans les mois  venir ; des tomates au pain, en passant par le b\u0153uf. <br/> Sans prcdent semble tre le mot qui dcrit le mieux les vnements mtorologiques extrmes de 2021. Mi-juillet, dans la province chinoise du Henan, l'une des rgions les plus peuples du pays, il est tomb l'quivalent d'une anne de pluie,  savoir 640 millimtres en trois jours seulement, du jamais vu au cours des 1 000 dernires annes[9]. <br/> Au moins 71 personnes[10] sont mortes et 1,4 million de personnes ont fui les inondations, alors que la Chine se prpare  de nouvelles pluies abondantes. Le dluge a galement touch 972 000 hectares[11] de terres cultives et, bien qu'une grande partie de la rcolte cralire de cette rgion ait dj t faite, la transformation, le stockage et le transport des crales d't pourraient tre affects car les eaux de crue endommagent les usines de farine. <br/> La Chine n'est pas le seul pays touch. Fin juillet, certaines rgions de l'Inde ont relev 594 millimtres[12] de pluie en quelques jours, tandis que Manille et les provinces priphriques des Philippines[13] ont t inondes par des pluies torrentielles, entranant des vacuations massives et des dgts aux cultures. <br/> Les vagues de chaleur et la scheresse extrmes ont battu des records dans tout l'ouest des tats-Unis, du sud de la Californie au Nevada et  l'Oregon. Alors que cette scheresse exceptionnelle sans prcdent s'aggrave, les autorits californiennes charges de la rglementation des eaux ont pris cette semaine une mesure tout  fait inhabituelle,  savoir l'interdiction pour des milliers d'agriculteurs[14] d'extraire de l'eau des principales rivires et ruisseaux pour irriguer. La scheresse va certainement tre une mauvaise nouvelle pour les amateurs de spaghettis. En effet, la Californie produit plus de 90 % des tomates en conserve des tats-Unis et assure un tiers de l'approvisionnement mondial. Attendez-vous  des prix beaucoup plus levs et  une accumulation de tomates[15]. <br/>Le Rservoir de Don Pedro en Californie (les zones marron devraient tre sous l'eau). La scheresse exceptionnelle sans prcdent ne fait que crotre et annonce que des milliers d'agriculteurs qui extraient chaque anne l'eau des rivires et des ruisseaux pour irriguer ne pourront pas exploiter ces sources cette anne.

Forest Service NW via Twitter. <br/>Pendant ce temps, 91 incendies de fort[16] font actuellement rage aux tats-Unis et dtruisent les cosystmes et les infrastructures. Cette anne, un peu plus d'un million d'hectares a br\u00fbl jusqu' prsent, la saison des incendies tant loin d'tre termine. A la mme priode l'anne dernire, seuls 850 000 hectares avaient br\u00fbl. Les graves incendies provoqus par le changement climatique dans l'ouest des tats-Unis ont galement des rpercussions ngatives sur les produits agricoles. En effet, les agriculteurs et les leveurs doivent dsormais faire face  des tarifs d'assurance incendie qui montent en flche, augmentant souvent de plusieurs dizaines de milliers de dollars. Cette tendance a provoqu un norme choc dans les rgions agricoles californiennes[17], indique le service d'informations environnementales en ligne Grist. Ces taux d'assurance exorbitants pourraient pousser certaines exploitations  la faillite, ou rendre l'agriculture trop risque pour tre assure. <br/> Plus  l'est, dans le Colorado et l'Utah, les leveurs de btail souffrent galement. A mesure que la scheresse s'aggrave, nombre d'entre eux ont dcid  contrec\u0153ur d'abattre leurs troupeaux[18]. Tout le monde va vendre ses vaches, il est donc probablement plus intelligent de le faire maintenant, pendant que le prix est lev, avant que le march ne soit inond, a dclar Buzz Bates, un leveur venant de Moab, dans l'Utah. <br/> La scheresse qui svit dans l'Ouest a galement engendr des conditions idales pour l'closion des \u0153ufs de sauterelles, entranant une infestation gnralise et des pertes de rcoltes. Je ne peux que jurer en parlant des sauterelles, a dclar[19] un agriculteur de l'Oregon. Elles sont un vritable flau Elles ne font que dtruire la terre et les cultures. <br/>Un criquet en Indonsie. D'importantes infestations ont touch l'Afrique l'anne dernire et les tats-Unis cette anne. Image de Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay. Le spectre de la faim dans le monde <br/>La scheresse de cette anne aggrave la faim dans certains des pays les plus pauvres de la plante. Le sud de Madagascar connat sa pire scheresse depuis quatre dcennies. Maliha, 38 ans et mre clibataire de huit enfants, a dclar  Reliefweb[20] : Depuis que la pluie a cess, les enfants ne mangent pas rgulirement. Je leur donne ce que je trouve, des feuilles de cactus par exemple. Avec ce rgime, ils ont la diarrhe et des nauses, mais nous n'avons pas le choix. Au moins, a ne les tue pas. <br/> Selon le directeur gnral du Programme alimentaire mondial, David Beasley, la crise alimentaire  Madagascar existe[21] depuis des annes. Il y a eu des scheresses successives qui ont conduit les communauts  la limite de la famine. Plus d'un million de Malgaches se sont retrouvs en situation d'inscurit alimentaire, sans accs  une nourriture suffisante, saine et nutritive, a-t-il dclar[22]. <br/> Il est catgorique quant  la raison : Ce n'est pas  cause des guerres ou des conflits, c'est  cause du changement climatique. <br/> Alors que les catastrophes s'enchanent, certains voquent les Dix Plaies d'Egypte envoyes par Dieu pour punir l'humanit de sa mchancet. Mme l'invasion de criquets ne manque pas  l'appel. En effet, il y a tout juste un an, la Grande Corne de l'Afrique et le Ymen ont connu la plus grande invasion de criquets plerins[23] depuis 25 ans, dclenche par des pluies record. Rien qu'en thiopie, plus de 356 000 tonnes de crales ont t perdues, laissant prs d'un million de personnes en situation d'inscurit alimentaire. <br/>Des femmes attendent de recevoir des repas chauds d'urgence pour leurs enfants souffrant de malnutrition dans le village de Sihanamaro, dans la rgion Androy, au sud de Madagascar.

Les produits de base touchs dans le monde entier <br/>Les conditions mtorologiques extrmes continuent de toucher lourdement les cultures[24] du monde entier, alors que les prix des produits alimentaires sont dj presque  leur niveau le plus lev depuis dix ans[25]. La liste est longue. Les inondations dans la principale rgion de production porcine de Chine ont accentu la menace de maladies animales. Les pluies dvastatrices en Europe renforcent la crainte de la propagation de maladies fongiques dans les crales. Et dans les High Plains, le long de la frontire entre les tats-Unis et le Canada, les crales et le btail sont menacs par l'aggravation prvue de la scheresse[26] qui inquite les courtiers en marchandises et les agriculteurs. La Russie, autre grenier  bl du monde, connat galement un climat chaud et sec, et les prvisions de rcolte de bl ont chut[27]. <br/> Le Brsil est l'un des plus importants exportateurs de produits agricoles au monde. Mais la scheresse qui persiste[28] dans le pays suscite des inquitudes quant  la deuxime rcolte de mas[29] de 2021. La scheresse et les rares geles affectent galement les rgions productrices de caf, qui connaissent les tempratures les plus froides de ces 25 dernires annes. Le 29 juillet, la neige est mme tombe[30] sur une grande partie du Brsil. (Mme si le chaos climatique entrane davantage de records de chaleur, il peut parfois gnrer des froids extrmes). La rcolte de caf sera endommage et les prix du caf sont en hausse[31] dans le monde entier. <br/> D'autres cultures pourraient tre touches, le Brsil tant le premier exportateur de sucre, de jus d'orange et de soja de la plante. Aucun autre pays au monde n'a autant d'influence sur les conditions du march mondial. Ce qui se passe au Brsil affecte tout le monde, a dclar  Bloomberg Michael Sheridan, directeur de l'approvisionnement et de la valeur partage chez Intelligentsia Coffee, un torrfacteur et distributeur bas  Chicago. <br/>Zone inonde dans la ville de Qingshanqiao  Ningxiang, province de Hunan, en Chine, en 2017.

La scheresse qui a svi dans certaines rgions de l'Inde a plong les agriculteurs et les leveurs dans une situation dsespre pendant la majeure partie de cette anne. De tels vnements se sont dj produits par le pass, mais ils sont aujourd'hui de plus en plus frquents, stressant des communauts et des nations entires. Image de srinivasa krishna via Flickr (CC BY 2.0). Festin ou famine : profiter des catastrophes <br/>Comme ailleurs, les catastrophes climatiques au Brsil sont rgionalises et endommagent les rcoltes qu' certains endroits. Dans les zones non touches, les agriculteurs s'en sortent bien, mme mieux que prvu car les prix des produits de base dans le monde entier ont grimp, en partie  cause des scheresses qui ont frapp la plante. Et comme souvent sur le march des produits de base, un agriculteur profite du malheur d'un autre, alors que les grands ngociants en produits de base ont la polyvalence et le pouvoir conomique ncessaires pour faire face  des conditions mtorologiques dfavorables, pour l'instant du moins. <br/> L'Institut brsilien de gographie et de statistiques (IBGE) s'attend  une rcolte record[32] de grains, de crales et de plantes olagineuses en 2021\u2033. L'agro-industrie en dehors de la rgion de Paran, touche par la scheresse, jubile. Maurilio Biagi Filho, dont la famille possde de vastes plantations de sucre, affirme qu'il est trs rare que des prix agricoles levs concident avec une production record. Quand cela arrive, c'est extraordinaire, ajoute-t-il. <br/> Un phnomne similaire se manifeste aux tats-Unis, o\u00f9 deux ceintures de mas voluent de manire trs diffrente. Le Sud-Est des tats-Unis connat un temps estival formidable (frais et humide), alors que le Nord-Ouest est confront  une terrible scheresse (temps chaud et sec) Selon une source mdiatique agricole[33], le n\u0153ud du problme est que la rcolte est endommage  l'Ouest alors qu'elle s'accrot  l'Est. <br/>Maurlio Biagi Filho, l'un des plus grands magnats de l'agroalimentaire brsilien, s'attend  une forte augmentation des revenus cette anne en raison de la hausse des prix des produits de base dans le monde provoque par les scheresses au Brsil. Image offerte par JornalCana. <br/>Ce tableau conomique contrast s'accompagne d'une mise en garde. En effet,  mesure que l'anne 2021 s'coule et que la crise climatique mondiale s'aggrave d'anne en anne, les prvisions[34] annoncent que de moins en moins d'agriculteurs pourraient percevoir des bnfices car les catastrophes climatiques extrmes et les mauvaises rcoltes se multiplient. <br/> Dans les annes 1990, un scientifique du Woods Hole Research Center, qui disait le chaos climatique imminent, avait dclar : Imaginez une casserole d'eau froide sur la cuisinire. Rchauffez la casserole sans interruption. L'eau commence  bouger,  tourbillonner de manire de plus en plus irrgulire et intense. De petites bulles apparaissent, puis de plus grosses bulles  mesure que vous ajoutez de l'nergie au systme, jusqu' ce que l'eau bout. Il s'agit d'une bonne mtaphore du changement climatique mondial.  mesure que les missions augmentent, des phnomnes mtorologiques extrmes apparaissent de manire plus rcurrente, alatoire et imprvisible, partout. <br/>Le chaos climatique engendre l'inscurit alimentaire et l'instabilit politique <br/>Le revers de la mdaille de la hausse actuelle des prix des produits de base se fait dj ressentir chez beaucoup de monde. Avec des millions de dmunis touchs par les catastrophes climatiques, les gouvernements des pays en difficult financire doivent fournir une aide alimentaire. La hausse des prix des aliments est la dernire chose dont les gouvernements ont besoin en ce moment, a dclar au Financial Times Carlos Mera, analyste chez Rabobank. <br/> La hausse des prix des aliments entrane souvent des troubles politiques, mme dans les pays o\u00f9 la dissidence est fermement rprime. Dbut juillet, des manifestants sont descendus dans les rues[35] du sud-ouest de l'Iran, scandant des slogans contre le rgime et rclamant un meilleur accs  l'eau pour la consommation, pour les terres agricoles et pour leur btail. <br/> Mais la crise climatique ne montre aucun signe d'amlioration. Le 22 juin, Nuwaiseeb, au Kowet, a enregistr des tempratures de 53,2 degrs. Dans les pays voisins, l'Irak et l'Iran, les tempratures taient  peine moins leves. Des records historiques ont galement t battus en Turquie (o\u00f9 les incendies de fort ont tu des animaux d'exploitation), ainsi qu'en Irlande du Nord et dans le nord du Japon. Moscou a t frappe par une vague de chaleur historique en juin, avec des tempratures atteignant les 34 degrs, un record jamais atteint en 120 ans. Ces vagues de chaleur ne sont pas favorables  l'approvisionnement et aux prix des denres alimentaires dans le monde, ni  la scurit nationale. <br/> La hausse des prix des aliments, cause en partie par la scheresse suite au changement climatique[36], est considre comme l'un des principaux facteurs  l'origine de l'instabilit qui s'est rpandue dans une grande partie du Moyen-Orient et de l'Afrique du Nord en 2011, provoquant le Printemps arabe. <br/> En 1997, le journaliste visionnaire Ross Gelbspan mettait le monde en garde contre le perptuel tat d'urgence  venir, un abme de changement climatique de plus en plus grave et dstabilisant, un maelstr\u00f6m mtorologique extrme dans lequel les systmes de production alimentaire, des populations entires, des gouvernements et des pays s'effondreraient, provoquant la faim, la misre humaine, les troubles civils et la guerre. <br/>Carlos Mera, analyste snior chez Rabobank, une socit nerlandaise de services bancaires et financiers, en voyage au Brsil pour analyser la rcolte du caf, en train de se connecter  une tlconfrence en 2019. Image via Twitter. La panne climatique <br/>Le consensus est de plus en plus large. Aujourd'hui, la quasi-totalit des scientifiques et des responsables politiques (hormis les hommes politiques qui dfendent les intrts des combustibles fossiles) s'accordent  dire que la cause sous-jacente de la crise climatique actuelle est l'activit humaine de ces cent dernires annes (moins d'une nanoseconde dans l'histoire de la plante) et le rejet de milliards de tonnes[37] de gaz  effet de serre dans l'atmosphre. <br/> L'agence de presse AFP a rcemment obtenu un projet de rapport du Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'volution du climat (GIEC) de l'ONU, dont la publication est prvue au dbut de l'anne prochaine. Selon l'AFP, ce rapport constitue de loin, le catalogue le plus complet jamais assembl sur la faon dont le changement climatique bouleverse notre monde. Le GIEC avertit que les effets dvastateurs du rchauffement climatique seront cruellement perceptibles avant qu'un enfant n aujourd'hui atteigne l'ge de 30 ans. <br/> Tout comme Rafael Colombo, l'avocat argentin spcialiste de l'environnement, le GIEC pointe du doigt un ensemble d'influences d'origine humaine : missions de gaz  effet de serre, dgradation des terres cause par l'agriculture intensive, dforestation, utilisation excessive d'engrais minraux et de pesticides, surpturage et extraction excessive de l'eau pour l'agriculture et d'autres usages. Et pourtant, les missions augmentent avec la population et l'utilisation inconsidre des ressources. <br/>Plantation de soja  c\u00f4t d'une fort tropicale au Brsil. La dforestation et la dgradation des terres dues  l'expansion agressive de l'agrobusiness font partie des impacts de l'Homme dans la rgion amazonienne. Ces impacts incluent galement la scheresse croissante due au changement climatique. Image de Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay. Les scheresses dans le monde dtruisent des sicles de progrs humain, privant d'eau les cultures, limitant les moyens de subsistance et la survie. Image offerte par Petterik Wiggers / PAM ONU. Un besoin urgent de changement transformationnel <br/>Le projet de rapport du GIEC plaide : Nous avons besoin d'une transformation radicale des processus et des comportements  tous les niveaux : individus, communauts, entreprises, institutions et gouvernement. Nous devons redfinir notre mode de vie et de consommation. <br/> Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, professeur agrg  l'cole d'conomie applique et de gestion Charles H. Dyson de l'universit Cornell, estime que des techniques agricoles considrablement amliores rsoudraient le problme. Il a dclar  Mongabay qu'il fallait investir davantage dans la recherche et le dveloppement et dans une agriculture intelligente sur le plan climatique afin de d'insuffler un vent contraire au changement climatique. Il a soulign que ces investissements doivent tre raliss maintenant. La production accrue de plantes intelligentes sur le plan climatique permettrait  l'humanit de maintenir les taux de croissance historiques de la production [vgtale] sans avoir  augmenter les intrants. <br/> Colleen Doherty, professeure agrge de biochimie  l'universit de Caroline du Nord, adopte une approche similaire, suggrant que l'agriculture intelligente sur le plan climatique pourrait se faire en partie en crant des plantes beaucoup plus rsistantes. Nous devons slectionner des cultures qui pourront faire face  des conditions dont nous ignorons l'volution  l'heure actuelle. Les choses changent tellement rapidement que nous devons tre capables d'anticiper les problmes avant qu'ils ne surviennent, a-t-elle dclar, ajoutant avec un optimisme prudent : Nous avons  peine effleur le potentiel des plantes. <br/> Pour qu'une telle approche fonctionne, il faut qu'elle apporte bien plus que ce que les nouvelles technologies ont permis de raliser au cours des deux dernires dcennies. Un article rcent, intitul Le changement climatique anthropique a ralenti la croissance de la production agricole[38], indique que le changement climatique a effac sept annes d'amlioration de la productivit agricole au cours des 60 dernires annes. Ortiz-Bobea, l'auteur principal de l'article, a dclar que l'effet de ralentissement pourrait bien s'intensifier, car l'agriculture mondiale devient de plus en plus vulnrable au changement climatique et le rchauffement de la plante s'acclre. <br/> Le mouvement de l'agriculture rgnratrice propose une mthode compltement diffrente pour faire face  la crise. Ses adeptes sont sceptiques quant  la capacit des scientifiques  slectionner des plantes plus rsistantes. Malgr les milliards de dollars dpenss dans la recherche et le battage mdiatique, il n'y a pas une seule culture importante qui ait bnfici de modifications par gnie gntique pour la rendre nettement plus rsistante  la scheresse, a dclar  Mongabay Andr Leu, directeur international de Regeneration International, bien que les entreprises de biotechnologie et les chercheurs revendiquent certains progrs dans ce domaine de dveloppement. <br/>Une femme se tient devant sa maison emporte par les inondations au Kenya.

En mai, 40 000 personnes ont t dplaces, des centaines de vies ont t perdues, des cultures ont t dtruites et du btail s'est noy. Les phnomnes mtorologiques extrmes, notamment les inondations et les scheresses, deviennent plus frquents et plus intenses  mesure que la crise climatique s'aggrave. Avec la crise actuelle du COVID-19 et l'invasion de criquets, les inondations enveniment la situation de la scurit alimentaire dans le pays. Image  Greenpeace. <br/>Selon lui, les rponses ne viendront pas des laboratoires, mais de la collaboration avec les communauts rurales qui ont acquis une connaissance unique des cosystmes locaux grce  des sicles d'exprience. De nombreuses tudes publies indiquent que l'augmentation de l'agro-biodiversit par le biais d'un mlange d'espces et de varits de cultures, ainsi que la slection participative mene par les agriculteurs, augmentent la rsistance  la scheresse et aux conditions climatiques extrmes, a-t-il dclar. Ces systmes fonctionnent dsormais  l'chelle mondiale sur tous les continents arables. De plus, les dfenseurs de l'agriculture rgnrative affirment qu'elle peut attnuer considrablement le changement climatique[39] en pigeant d'importantes missions de gaz  effet de serre. <br/> Pour l'instant, aucune des deux approches ne se traduit par le changement transformationnel que le projet de rapport du GIEC avait rclam, en grande partie parce que les gouvernements du monde entier n'ont pas encore pris de mesures radicales pour faire face  l'ampleur de la catastrophe qui se produit  une vitesse fulgurante sur la plante. Et peu d'analystes ont espoir que cela changera lors de l'indispensable sommet sur le climat COP26 qui se tiendra en novembre en cosse. <br/> Pendant ce temps, la situation continue de se dtriorer. Selon les prvisions[40] publies ce mois-ci par l'Agence internationale de l'nergie, cette anne les plus hauts niveaux de production de dioxyde de carbone de l'histoire seront enregistrs. <br/> De nombreux scientifiques et responsables politiques craignent que la survie mme de l'espce humaine ne soit dsormais en danger. Le projet de rapport du GIEC prvient : La vie sur terre peut se remettre d'un changement climatique majeur en voluant vers de nouvelles espces et en crant de nouveaux cosystmes. L'humanit ne le peut pas. <br/>Rizires assches dans la rgion d'Anosy, dans le sud de Madagascar.
