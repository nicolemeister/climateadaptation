Both can be expected to negatively impact pig health, whereas the use of wooded areas can limit such issues as trees provide shelter and promote water evaporation. To investigate this, we compared the health of pigs kept in grassland and agroforestry plots from 8 weeks of age until slaughter. Two batches of pigs were used, which were kept in groups of six boars, with four groups per treatment for each batch. As expected, sunburn was significantly less common for the agroforestry treatment than for the grassland treatment, although severe sunburn was absent overall. Growth and feed disappearance were significantly greater in the agroforestry treatment, without affecting feed conversion, body condition score or faecal consistency. The treatments had a statistically significant but limited effect on some other measured variables. Ear damage and body lesions were somewhat more frequent in the agroforestry treatment than in the grassland treatment (significantly so for the body lesions and tending towards significance for ear damage). Furthermore, gait scores were slightly but significantly worse in the agroforestry treatment than in the grassland treatment for most of the experiment, although the opposite relation was found during the last weeks. Gait scores may have reflected terrain conditions more than leg health, as no difference between the treatments was found when pigs were later re-scored when on concrete. Several of the expected health issues were either completely or nearly absent, including tail damage (even though tails were undocked), swellings, ecto- and endoparasites, melena, hematochezia, nasal discharge and reduced cleanliness.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In conclusion, we found that the agroforestry treatment protected fattening pigs from sunburn and increased their growth, whilst some other health aspects were affected negatively but only to a marginal extent. Overall, health status was good for both treatments, likely in part due to the use of pigs and plots that had no history of pathogen build-up, and the fact that all pigs had access to rootable soil preventing a redirection of damaging behaviour to other pigs.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Health and performance of fattening pigs reared in grassland and agroforestry systems in a temperate maritime climate.

Two batches of pigs were used, which were kept in groups of six boars, with four groups per treatment for each batch. As expected, sunburn was significantly less common for the agroforestry treatment than for the grassland treatment, although severe sunburn was absent overall. Growth and feed disappearance were significantly greater in the agroforestry treatment, without affecting feed conversion, body condition score or faecal consistency. The treatments had a statistically significant but limited effect on some other measured variables. Ear damage and body lesions were somewhat more frequent in the agroforestry treatment than in the grassland treatment (significantly so for the body lesions and tending towards significance for ear damage). Furthermore, gait scores were slightly but significantly worse in the agroforestry treatment than in the grassland treatment for most of the experiment, although the opposite relation was found during the last weeks. Gait scores may have reflected terrain conditions more than leg health, as no difference between the treatments was found when pigs were later re-scored when on concrete. Several of the expected health issues were either completely or nearly absent, including tail damage (even though tails were undocked), swellings, ecto- and endoparasites, melena, hematochezia, nasal discharge and reduced cleanliness.", "To investigate this, we compared the health of pigs kept in grassland and agroforestry plots from 8 weeks of age until slaughter.

The National Center for Vegetation Cover Development and Combating Desertification (NCVC) leads national efforts to advance agroforestry in the Kingdom through several landmark projects, most notably the development of an action plan to promote agroforestry. The initiative aims to enhance environmental sustainability, foster social and economic development, encourage investment, and ensure the sustainable management of forests. NCVC also strengthens community partnerships by involving local communities in protecting vegetation cover and developing natural resources, while supporting national targets aligned with the Saudi Green Initiative and the Saudi Vision 2030 through combating desertification and expanding sustainable environmental practices. -- SPA 15:02 Local Time 12:02 GMT 0037Link to Image"]}, {"relevance_score": 63, "title": "Agroforestry: The green revolution that can empower farmers and save our planet", "published": "2025-08-25", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Small-scale farmers across the globe are struggling with mounting challenges, from climate change to food insecurity and biodiversity loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, soil degradation, and extreme weather events have turned farming into an increasingly risky endeavour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Traditional methods of mono-cropping and overreliance on chemical fertilizers are proving unsustainable, threatening both rural livelihoods and the health of our planet.

The \"Model Rules for Felling of Trees in Agricultural Lands\"released by the Ministry of Environment, Forest &amp; Climate Change have great significance for the region. The objective of the model rules is to enhance the ease of doing business in agroforestry and incentivise farmers to integrate trees into their farming system without facing undue procedural hurdles. The central government has acknowledged the crucial role played by agroforestry in diversifying livelihoods and increasing agricultural resilience. </p><p>Because of its critical role in carbon removal from the atmosphere, the government has also promoted agroforestry for increasing tree cover outside forests for mitigation of climate change impact. The double benefit for the increasing tree cover outside forests is that felling of trees in forests for timber is reduced, which also prevents forest degradation and destruction in the long run. The Model Rules envisage a regulatory framework for the promotion, maintenance, and felling of trees and certification of timber produced from non-forest land, thereby encouraging landowners, farmers, and stakeholders to adopt agroforestry practices while ensuring sustainable resource management. It also emphasises that effective market linkages are essential for creating economic opportunities and fostering sustainable agroforestry practices by connecting plantations with wood-based industries and consumers, thereby ensuring that the efforts of landowners and farmers result in tangible financial benefits. It highlights that agroforestry has the ability to enhance farmer incomes, improve soil organic carbon, conserve water resources, and significantly contribute to India's carbon sequestration goals, thereby promoting sustainable agricultural productivity and resilience. While these critical roles of agroforestry have been articulated into a set of Model Rules, indigenous communities in the region can take pride in the fact that their traditional knowledge about land classification, the role of agroforestry in the conservation of biodiversity, the conservation of water bodies, underground water sources, and meeting their timber need for household purposes and earning income from produce from agroforestry in a sustainable manner. The proposed establishment of a streamlined regulatory framework under the Model Rules to simplify procedures for tree felling, transit, and certification, thereby incentivising private participation and creating opportunities for farmers and stakeholders to adopt agroforestry practices, is expected to end bureaucratic red tape through the introduction of an online application in the case of securing a permit for felling fewer than ten trees in an agroforestry. The Model Rules insist that there is a need to promote high-value timber species, enabling India to achieve self-reliance in timber production and emerge as a global leader in sustainable timber markets. While adopting these rules, states in the northeast have to ensure that the introduction of high-value timber species does not lead to the replacement of local trees and shrubs in traditional agroforestry, which are essential to maintain the local biodiversity and environment. Implementation of these rules must not be without institutionalisation of checks and balances. The risk of overexploitation cannot be ignored, as market linkage also leads to profit maximisation by different stakeholders. In traditional agroforestry the use of trees as timber is controlled by certain rules and norms set by the communities which they have been observing for generations. Although these norms are more applicable in respect of community agroforestry, individual households also observe some of these while managing their individual agroforestry in their backyards or that raised in the homestead land. Public consultation and expert advice will provide pragmatic solutions as to what specific high-value timber species would be suitable for agroforestry of a particular agro-economic zone. The rules framed for adoption in the Northeastern states need to be specific about the conservation of the rich biodiversity of traditional agroforestry. The responsibility of procurement of high-value timber species based on an inventory prepared after consultation with community members and agroforestry experts being entrusted to the community will ensure maintaining the natural character of agroforestry of a particular village or area. Involving private parties from outside the state and the region who have no knowledge of a traditional agroforestry in the introduction of high-value timber species could lead to the replacement of tree species which are important for the particular agroforestry and traditional use of local people as private suppliers and timber traders, as the interest of profit maximization could push for the replacement of such trees even at the cost of the loss of rich biodiversity. Imparting digital literacy to communities in the region will be essential to enable them to utilise the online application system and prevent middlemen from exploiting them in the name of submittingonline applications and obtaining permission to fell trees in their agroforestry for commercial use. The ease of doing business in agroforestry cannot be at the cost of the loss of important species found in traditional agroforestry in the region.

While these critical roles of agroforestry have been articulated into a set of Model Rules, indigenous communities in the region can take pride in the fact that their traditional knowledge about land classification, the role of agroforestry in the conservation of biodiversity, the conservation of water bodies, underground water sources, and meeting their timber need for household purposes and earning income from produce from agroforestry in a sustainable manner. The proposed establishment of a streamlined regulatory framework under the Model Rules to simplify procedures for tree felling, transit, and certification, thereby incentivising private participation and creating opportunities for farmers and stakeholders to adopt agroforestry practices, is expected to end bureaucratic red tape through the introduction of an online application in the case of securing a permit for felling fewer than ten trees in an agroforestry. The Model Rules insist that there is a need to promote high-value timber species, enabling India to achieve self-reliance in timber production and emerge as a global leader in sustainable timber markets. While adopting these rules, states in the northeast have to ensure that the introduction of high-value timber species does not lead to the replacement of local trees and shrubs in traditional agroforestry, which are essential to maintain the local biodiversity and environment. Implementation of these rules must not be without institutionalisation of checks and balances. The risk of overexploitation cannot be ignored, as market linkage also leads to profit maximisation by different stakeholders. In traditional agroforestry the use of trees as timber is controlled by certain rules and norms set by the communities which they have been observing for generations. Although these norms are more applicable in respect of community agroforestry, individual households also observe some of these while managing their individual agroforestry in their backyards or that raised in the homestead land. Public consultation and expert advice will provide pragmatic solutions as to what specific high-value timber species would be suitable for agroforestry of a particular agro-economic zone.", "The proposed establishment of a streamlined regulatory framework under the Model Rules to simplify procedures for tree felling, transit, and certification, thereby incentivising private participation and creating opportunities for farmers and stakeholders to adopt agroforestry practices, is expected to end bureaucratic red tape through the introduction of an online application in the case of securing a permit for felling fewer than ten trees in an agroforestry.

The collected data were analyzed using thematic, descriptive, and inferential methods. Farmers adopted various AF practices in different home gardens (36 %), scattered trees in croplands (29.71 %), boundary tree planting (16 %), and hedgerows (2.29 %). The major barriers to AF adoption were the lack of extension services (98.3 %), limited land (97 %), and inaccessible markets (94 %). A binary logistic regression analysis was adopted, and it was positively influenced by wealth level (p &lt; 0.01), level of education, size of the farm, slope of the farmland, extension relations, and farming experiences (p &lt; 0.05) and negatively by distance from home to farmland (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of the net profit margin also showed that practice adopters had higher profitability rates than non-adopters (16.54 % vs. 9 %), and the AF reported economic benefits to smallholder farmers in the study area.

Crop yields (black gram and mustard) were recorded at varying distances from the tree base. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance (ANOVA) under factorial randomized block design and principal component analysis (PCA) for multivariate analysis. Fine root length and biomass peaked at 1.5 m distance and 0.15-0.30 m depth, with higher values in winter. Bulk density increased with depth and distance, while SOC and nutrient levels were highest near the tree (0.5-1.0 m) and surface layers (0-0.15 m). Available N and P sharply declined with distance and depth; K showed milder variation. Crop yields increased up to 25% with distance from the tree, indicating reduced competition. The PCA highlighted optimal root growth and nutrient availability between 1.0 and 1.5 m distance and 0.15-0.45 m depth.

The news editors obtained a quote from the research from College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences: \"Forty-six surface soil samples were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) to quantify the concentrations of Arsenic (As), Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn), Barium (Ba), Strontium (Sr), and Titanium (Ti). Quantitative indices including the Contamination Factor (Cf), Geo-accumulation Index (I-geo), Soil Pollution Index (SPI), and Enrichment Factor (EF), were computed. Results showed significant soil variability effects on PTEs distributions. Average concentrations (mg/kg) of PTEs were: Ti (4570.", "Moreover, As presented moderate contamination across all soil types, with the exception of Luvisols where SPI = 1. 53 and I-geo = 2. 29 were observed. According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"EF confirmed that the sources of PTEs are of geogenic origin, although localized anthropogenic influences were detected, especially for Luvisols (EF = 3. 4 and 2 for Zn and Pb respectively) likely due to the use of organic amendments. In conclusion, the findings highlight soil heterogeneity role in shaping PTEs risks, recommending soil-specific management practices and further research on phytoremediation potential using indigenous agroforestry species.

Soil profiles (0-100 cm, 0-20 cm, and 20-100 cm) were analyzed to assess vertical SOC and soil water stocks interactions and driving factors. Results revealed that macadamia-based agroforestry systems reduced significantly SOC stock compared to primary forest (261 t/hm2) but enhanced soil water stock. Among intercropping systems, macadamia+dasheen plantation exhibited the highest recovery of SOC and soil water stock. Surface soil layers (0-20 cm) showed strong SOC-water coupling, whereas this relationship weakened in deeper layers (20-100 cm). Simultaneously, woody above-ground biomass directly increased SOC stock, while specific leaf area and leaf phosphorus content regulated SOC stock directly or indirectly via woody above-ground biomass. Conversely, herb above-ground biomass negatively influenced SOC stock in surface soil layer, but had no significant effect in the deeper layer. Woody above-ground biomass exhibited a consistent negative influence on soil water stock across all soil layers, with the standardized path coefficients of -1.23 (0-100 cm), -1.153 (0-20 cm), and -1.23 (20-100 cm).

Agricultural crop productivity across different agroforestry patterns showed that paddy in boundary planting (13.49 t/ha) produced yields statistically similar to the sole paddy crop (13.60 t/ha). This demonstrates that integrating trees into agricultural lands, when managed, does not significantly affect crop productivity. Tree growth performance varied across planting patterns, with scattered planting recording the highest tree girth and volume, whereas the bund pattern showed the lowest.

According to news reporting originating from Wuhan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Cropland use transformation (CUT) not only increases grain production but also considerably impacts regional ecosystem carbon sinks. However, comprehensive studies exploring connections between CUT and ecosystem carbon sinks are limited.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, Basic Research Operating Expenses of Central Universities, China. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Wuhan University, \"We constructed an indicator system and transformation framework for CUT by considering explicit and implicit dimensions. Moreover, we analyzed changes in the CUT in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYB), as well as the trends in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Structural equation modeling was used to explore the direct and indirect impacts of CUT on NEP. The MLYB lost approximately 0.82-0.86 x 103 km2 of cropland annually, with the cropland being primarily transformed into construction and forest land. The proportion of the three major grain crops showed fluctuating increases. The average NEP in the MLYB from 1999 to 2019 was 549.36 gC/m2/yr, while the capacity of ecosystem carbon sinks gradually weakened, with approximately 29.96 % of the area showing a highly significant degradation trend, and 19.42 % showing a significant degradation trend. In terms of explicit CUT indicators, the total effect of the cropland area on NEP was negative, with a direct effect of-0.21, an indirect effect of 0.10, and a total effect of-0.11. The overall effect of the cropping structure on NEP was positive, with a direct effect of 0.21, an indirect effect of 0.02, and a total effect of 0.23. Regarding implicit CUT indicators, the input of agricultural production factors directly inhibited ecosystem carbon sinks, with an effect value of-0.62. Cropland output directly promoted NEP, with an effect value of 0.65.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study explains the relationship between CUT and ecosystem carbon sinks, providing a scientific basis for advancing green agriculture in China.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Impact of Cropland Use Transformation On Ecosystem Carbon Sinks In a Typical Agroforestry Mixed Region: an Analysis From Explicit and Implicit Perspectives.

A sampling rate of 10% was applied in seven villages in the Commune of Djoum. These interviews were supplemented by floristic inventories carried out on 69 plots of 40 x 60 m for a total area of 15.84 ha. The data collected allowed us to calculate various diversity and ecological indices, woody biomass and carbon stock, to which various statistical tests and Analyzes of variance were applied. The floristic potential is made up of 8,355 individuals divided into 177 species, 153 genera, 47 families, and classified into 3 woody groups, namely introduced, preserved and perennial species. The Shannon index between land use types varies from 2.15 bits in palm agroforests to 3.9 bits in forests while it is 2.81 bits in cocoa agroforests. The forests of the UFA and the peripheral SAFs share 42 forest species out of 63 inventoried species, ie 66.7% of forest species preserved in cocoa agroforests, proof of the effectiveness of the conservation potential of these SAFs in the region. The largest diameter class is [10-20] cm while the largest height class is the stratum of [5-10] m. Tree density and basal areas are highest in forests with 110.51 stems/ha and 42.08 m2/ha. Three types of architectural profiles for cocoa-based SAFs and two types of architectural profiles for oil palm-based SAFs were identified with a typology that shows 4 groups of TUTs based on ecological interactions. Forests are the type of land use that stores the most carbon (115.81 tC/ha) compared to 93.54 tC/ha for palm agroforest and 58.8 tC/ha for cocoa agroforests. Gradients of diversity, density and complexity vary with proximity to the forest concession.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These results could be considered as effective and quantifiable tools for the certification of numerous cash crops such as cocoa and oil palm, which will make it possible to promote this endogenous knowledge scientifically and in the development of various programs and publications. technical notes.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Characterization and Ecological Importance of Cocoa and Oil Palm Agroforestry Systems On the Outskirts of a Forest Concession In Southern Cameroon.

A study assessing the impact of CC on agroforestry was carried out in Iran, spanning across semi-arid, semi-humid, and humid climates. Data were collected from 204 households using surveys to understand the socioeconomic characteristics, land use, and agroforestry. The results indicated significant differences in farming experience and land holdings (p &lt; 0.01) across regions. Agroforestry was more prevalent in semi-arid regions, with alley cropping being the most common practice. Farmers' attitudes toward continuing agroforestry were positive, although there was a general lack of information about the practice. The primary sources of information were other farmers and extension experts. Species diversity in agroforestry varied by region, with apples, walnuts, and poplars being the most common in semi-arid regions, while species diversity was generally lower in humid regions. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, adaptation strategies, such as altering crop and tree species to those more resilient to climate change, have been employed. The farm size assigned for the agroforestry systems in the semi-arid region was 0.86 ha, which was higher than that assigned in other regions. Farmers in the semi-arid regions rely on a greater diversity of species to mitigate CC impacts than those in other regions.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This approach enhances the sustainability of agroforestry by optimizing resource use and maintaining agricultural productivity.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Adaptive Agroforestry-mitigating Climate Change Impacts By Farmers' Perception In Different Climate Conditions In Iran.

According to news originating from Morogoro, Tanzania, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Insect-mediated pollination is a crucial ecosystem service that supports crop yields and wild plant populations, contributing to global food security and ecosystem stability. However, the alarming decline in insect pollinators, largely driven by agricultural practices, has raised global concern.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Sokoine University of Agriculture, \"As the human population grows, the pressure on crop production intensifies, necessitating sustainable farming practices. Agroforestry, an agricultural system that integrates woody plants with crops, has the potential to enhance crop production while providing a favorable environment for insect pollinators. However, empirical studies on the impact of agroforestry on insect pollinators in tropical Africa are scarce. This study addresses that gap by examining whether tropical agroforestry increases insect pollinator abundance and species richness compared to non-agroforestry systems and how that is affected by season and elevation. We studied sixteen pairs of agroforestry and non-agroforestry farms located along elevation gradients in northern Tanzania over wet and dry seasons.

We can aim for one million jobs in the forestry sector within the next three to four years,\" Minister Yassierli said in Bandung, West Java, on Tuesday. To achieve this goal, he emphasized the need for collective efforts from relevant stakeholders, particularly in enhancing the quality and competence of human resources. One of the key initiatives by the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of Forestry is the implementation of training programs focused on green jobs. These include agroforestry, social forestry, and the application of modern forestry and agricultural technologies. Yassierli noted that agroforestry holds significant potential for job creation while simultaneously utilizing forests as sources of food, energy, and water to support community welfare--aligning with President Prabowo Subianto's Astacita vision. Yassierli, who also serves as a professor at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), stated that the agroforestry training program has now entered its third phase. The program currently involves 388 participants, including graduates of the State Forestry Vocational School (SMKKN), village youth, and residents from Serang, Medan, Padang, Majalengka, and West Bandung District. We will strengthen this program and develop its ecosystem and business model. There will also be processing and downstreaming, which will undoubtedly have a significant impact. Ultimately, it comes down to work ethic--we will be more productive if we manage agroforestry and social forestry efficiently,\" he said.", "We can aim for one million jobs in the forestry sector within the next three to four years,\" Minister Yassierli said in Bandung, West Java, on Tuesday.

The results of the PSM indicate an increase in revenues of about 8 million VND ha-1 yr-1 (about 325$) per household when adopting agroforestry, but a counterintuitive outcome regarding erosion. This outcome is likely due to an improperly selected farmer control group, which is located on less erosion-prone land, as well as the presence of immature trees in agroforestry systems, whose canopies have not yet contributed to reducing erosion.

Soil samples were collected from two land use practices: agroforestry adoption (90) and non-agroforestry adoption (30) at 0-30 cm depth from two locations (Busia and Kakamega counties). Results showed variations in soil characteristics between the study locations. Soils in Kakamega contained higher concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), exchangeable cations, and micronutrients. On average, agroforestry adoption significantly (P 0.05) improved soil physicochemical properties. Under agroforestry adoption, bulk density (BD) reduced by 21% (from 1.4 to1.1 g cm-3), while (SOC) increased by 75% (0.8-1.4%), P by 80% (3.0-5.4 mg kg-1), exchangeable K by 256% (0.3-8.0 cmol kg-1), Ca by 100% (1.0-2.0 cmol kg-1), S by 50% (0.2-0.3 mg kg-1), and Cu by 18% (2.8-3.3 mg kg-1). Agroforestry adoption significantly increased K and Cu levels above the critical thresholds of 0.4 cmol kg-1 and 1.0 mg kg-1, respectively, at both locations. Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucocephala influenced soil BD, pH and P (4.3.-7.0 mg kg -1), exchangeable K (0.4-0.7 cmol kg-1), Mg (0.1-0.2 cmol kg-1), and Mn (13.5-25.2 mg kg-1) at both locations, while Calliandra calothyrsus significantly increased SOC in Kakamega only.

According to news originating from Nanchang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Agroforestry systems can improve land use efficiency and increase the output of agricultural and forestry products.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangxi Natural Science Foundation. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanchang Institute of Technology: \"In this study, a camphor forest-winter rapeseed composite system was used as the research object from 2023 to 2024. A randomized block experiment was used to set different slopes, S1, S2, and S3 (5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, and 15\u00b0), and camphor forest densities D1, D2, and D3 (row spacing of 1.5 m x 1.5 m, 1.0 m x 1.5 m, 1.0 m x 1.0 m) to compare a single crop (CK) of winter rapeseed and analyze its growth status. This study showed that slope and camphor forest density significantly affected the growth indicators of winter rapeseed. Among the intercropping treatments, S1D2 (5\u00b0, 1.0 m x 1.5 m) performed best. In the late growth period of winter rapeseed (flowering to maturity), the treatment increased leaf area index, relative chlorophyll content, root system indicators (length, surface area, volume), theoretical yield, and actual yield, and it increased the aboveground biomass per unit area. Although the actual yield of intercropping on slopes S1, S2, and S3 was 2.52%, 2.82%, and 1.72% lower than that of monocropping, respectively, the ground surface was exposed and idle in winter after the camphor trees were cut down in September.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Intercropping winter rapeseed with camphor trees can improve land utilization and increase surface coverage.

Among the main actions is the creation of Popular Technological Reference Units - UPRTS, spaces for sustainable productive arrangements that serve as showcases so that families can know and replicate good practices in their areas. Popular units of technological reference also serve as learning spaces of how agroforestry work. Implementation is a partnership between leaderships of EMBRAPA EVRAPA SEASING PROJECTS AND TECHNICIANS, where the community works to plant and cultivate these small areas. The main objective is that other families in the region can learn in practice how to implement their agroforestry and replicate experiences. The arrangements composed, so far, and for the most part, are agroforestry systems composed of species that already have demand for consumption of families and local market, such as acai, banana, cupuacu and cocoa, with locally demanded species, such as Rambutao, Uxi, Red Cedar, Freijo, Tapereba, Bacuri, Andiroba and Pequi.

The two systems were established on relatively steep slopes, 37 % and 65 % slope, respectively. Crop performance and soil fertility were measured in different positions relative to the fruit tree-grass rows over 4-5 years and compared with sole-crop maize. The results showed that maize height, grain yield, and leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations were significantly higher at the upslope than downslope side of tree-grass rows. For example, the grain yields were 30-35 % higher at the upslope than downslope side. Regarding soil fertility, there was a tendency that SOC, total N, total phosphorus (P), available P, and available potassium (K) were higher at the upslope than downslope side of tree-grass rows. Thus, the forage grass strips played an important role in trapping N and other nutrients, and enhanced nutrient use efficiency within agroforestry at the steeply sloping study sites.

The results showed that maize height, grain yield, and leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations were significantly higher at the upslope than downslope side of tree-grass rows. For example, the grain yields were 30-35 % higher at the upslope than downslope side. Regarding soil fertility, there was a tendency that SOC, total N, total phosphorus (P), available P, and available potassium (K) were higher at the upslope than downslope side of tree-grass rows. Thus, the forage grass strips played an important role in trapping N and other nutrients, and enhanced nutrient use efficiency within agroforestry at the steeply sloping study sites.

This study utilized inventory data to estimate the variability and range of carbon stocks in Chakras and Ajas at different stages and other typical land uses in the area. Data were collected through an extensive field survey comprising 171 measurement plots, 4.592 trees, 731 palms, and various crops.

Additionally, two other land uses (primary forest and an expert-identified best agroforestry - Model Chakra) were included, although they were not statistically defined. The results indicate that on average, Chakras/Ajas have more AGB carbon than pastures and monocultures (25.5 vs. 4.38 MgCha-1). The best Chakras and Ajas can achieve a carbon mitigation potential comparable to secondary forests, with a maximum of 105.6 MgCha-1, further emphasizing the need to support these traditional practices.

The world drinks about 2 billion cups of coffee a day . However, a European Union law might soon affect your favorite coffee beans - and the farmers who grow them.Starting in 2026, companies selling coffee on the European Union market will have to prove that their product is\"deforestation-free .\" That means every bag of beans, every jar of ground coffee and every espresso capsule must trace back to coffee plants on land that hasn't been cleared of forest since Dec. 31, 2020.</p><p><br/>The new rules, found in what's known as the EU Deforestation Regulation , are part of a wider effort to ensure European consumption doesn't drive global deforestation.<br/>However, on the ground - from the coffee hills of Ethiopia to the plantations of Brazil - the rule change could transform how coffee is grown, traded and sold.<br/>Why the EU is targeting deforestationDeforestation is a major driver of biodiversity loss and accounts for about 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions . And coffee plantations, along with cocoa, soy and palm oil production, which are also covered by the new regulations, are known sources of forest loss in some countries.<br/>Under the new EU Deforestation Regulation, companies will be required to trace their coffee to its exact origin - down to the farm plot where the beans were grown - and provide geolocation data and documentation of supply chain custody to EU authorities.<br/>They will also have to show proof, often through satellite imagery, that any open land where coffee is grown was forest-free before the 2020 cutoff date.<br/>The rules were initially set to go into effect in early 2025 but were pushed back after complaints from many countries . Governments and industry groups in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia warned of trade friction for small farms , and the World Trade Organization has received complaints about the regulations.<br/>Most companies must now comply by Dec. 30, 2025. Small enterprises get until June 30, 2026.<br/>Potential winners and losersThe coffee supply chain is complex. Beans are grown by millions of farmers, sold to collectors, then move through processors, exporters, importers and roasters before reaching grocery shelves. Adding the EU rules means more checkpoints, more paperwork and possibly new strategies for sourcing coffee beans.<br/>Small farms in particular could be vulnerable to losing business when the new rules go into effect. They could lose contracts or market access if they can't provide the plot-level GPS coordinates and nondeforestation documentation buyers will require. That could prompt buyers to shift toward larger estates or organized co-ops that can provide the documentation.<br/>If a farm can't provide precise plot coordinates or pay for mapping services, it could end up being excluded from the world's largest coffee market .<br/>Larger coffee growers already using systems that can trace beans back to specific farm plots could gain a competitive edge.<br/><br/>Global forest area by type and distribution in 2020, according to a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization assessment.FAOThe new regulations also include stricter oversight for countries considered most likely to allow deforestation, which could slow trade from those regions. As a result, buyers may shift to regions with lower deforestation risk.<br/>Even outside Europe, big buyers are likely to prioritize beans they can trace to nondeforested plots, potentially dropping small farms that can't provide plot-level proof. That could reduce availability and raise the price of some coffee types and put farms out of business. In some cases, the EU regulations could reroute undocumented coffee beans into markets such as the U.S.<br/>Helping small farms succeedFor small farms, succeeding under the new EU rules will depend on access to technical support and low-cost tools for tracing their crop's origin. Some countries are developing national systems to track deforestation, and they are pushing the EU to invest more in helping them.<br/>Those small farms that can comply with the rules, often through co-ops , could become attractive low-risk suppliers for large buyers seeking compliant crops.<br/>The change could also boost demand for sustainability certifications, such as Rainforest Alliance , 4C Common Code or Fairtrade , which certify only products that don't contribute to deforestation. But even certified farms will still need to provide precise location data.<br/>Agroforestry's potentialArabica coffee, the most common variety sold globally, naturally evolved as an understory shrub, performing best in cooler tropical uplands with good drainage and often partial shade. That points to a way farmers can reduce deforestation risk while still growing coffee: agroforestry.<br/><br/>Farmers check on coffee beans at a small agroforestry operation in Kenya. The coffee bushes were planted among trees that provide shade.World Agroforestry Centre/Joseph Gachoka via Flickr , CC BY-NC-SAAgroforestry involves planting or conserving shade trees in and around coffee plots to maintain the tree canopy.<br/>In agroforestry systems, shade trees can buffer heat and drought, often reducing evaporation from soil and moderating plants' water stress . Several field studies show lower evaporative losses and complementary water use between coffee and shade trees. In some contexts, this can lower irrigation needs and reduce fertilizer demand . Practical tools such as World Coffee Research's Shade Catalog help farmers choose the right tree species for their location and goals.<br/>Agroforestry is common in Ethiopia , where Arabica originated , and in parts of Central America, thanks to long traditions of growing coffee in shade and specialty demand for the products.<br/>Under the new EU rules, however, even these farms must prove that no forest was cleared after 2020.<br/>Why this matters to coffee drinkersFor European coffee drinkers, the new EU rules promise more sustainable coffee. But they may also mean higher prices if compliance costs are passed down the supply chain to consumers.<br/>For coffee lovers elsewhere, changes in global trade flows could shift where beans are sold and at what price. As EU buyers bid up beans that can be traced to nondeforested plots, more of those\"fully verified\" coffees will flow to Europe. U.S. roasters may then face higher prices or tighter supply for traceable lots, while unverified beans are discounted or simply avoided by brands that choose to follow EU standards.<br/><br/>MENAFN02092025000199003603ID1110006098<br/></p>", "publisher": "MENAFN - Business & Finance News (English)", "instances": ["Helping small farms succeedFor small farms, succeeding under the new EU rules will depend on access to technical support and low-cost tools for tracing their crop's origin.

Utilizing 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, the study unveiled a profound impact of intercropping on the rhizosphere soil microbial community. Specifically, the abundance of certain bacterial communities such as Actinomycetes, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi, as well as fungal communities like Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, underwent significant changes under intercropping conditions. Within the bacterial community, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Myxococcola, and Chloroflexi increased notably by approximately 33.3%, 50%, and 50%, respectively, while Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria decreased significantly by 16.7% and 20%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Concurrently, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota in the fungal community showed a significant increase in relative abundance by 10% and 5%, respectively. Functional predictions further indicated enhanced metabolic activities related to nitrogen fixation and chitin decomposition.Moreover, intercropping led to a marked increase in soil nutrient content, including organic matter, available potassium, alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen, and sucrase activity, which are crucial for the advancement of biogeochemical processes. In terms of plant growth, P. odoratum under intercropping exhibited significant advantages, with increased plant height, ground diameter, and biomass. Notably, the ground diameter increased by 9.75% and biomass by 28.8%. Additionally, the chemical composition of P. odoratum underwent changes, with polysaccharides, total flavonoids, and total saponins showing increases of 1%, 32.9%, and 13.9%, respectively, whereas total phenolic content decreased by 19.0% (p &lt; 0.05).

Following the selection of subtopics, 66 articles were selected and analyzed. The analysis revealed that research on AFSs in the Amazon highlights interactions among traditional knowledge, innovations, and sustainability. The analysis of research published between 1996 and 2023 indicated growth in studies with an interdisciplinary focus, primarily from Brazil. However, internationalization, collaborative networks, and funding factors contribute to the prominence of foreign institutions. Research studies often address topics such as species diversity, agrobiodiversity, and tree growth in agroforestry intercrops. In this context, homegarden agroforestry (HAF) emerges as one of the main subjects of study, encompassing multifunctional environments, richness diversity, and ongoing experimentation with plant species. The choice of species for AFSs is influenced by factors such as labor, personal preferences, and market demands, although loggers and commercial forestry systems tend to have lower diversity, contrasting with HAF. AFSs implementation methods vary according to financing, management, and the farmer's education and gender.

Local canopy cover had contrasting effects: it negatively impacted bird richness, abundance, and bat activity in more open landscapes (&lt;55 % tree cover), but positively in forested landscapes (&gt;80 % tree cover). Notably, these interactions were significant when considering the landscape tree cover at small spatial scales (250 m), but not at 500 m or 1000 m.", "We studied birds and bats in 28 smallholder cacao agroforests in the Peruvian Amazon, comparing two regions with contrasting levels of agricultural intensification.

According to news reporting from the Department of Agroforestry Sciences by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Aim of study: The objective of this study was to evaluate the soil quality of a Mediterranean periurban forest landscape in Palencia (Northern Spain) using the Soil Biological Quality-arthropod index (QBS-ar index). Area of study: Palencia (Northern Spain), UTM 30N coordinates: X: 370265, Y: 4646195), 865 m.a.s.l. Three plots were established in different managed biotopes: secondary grassland, shrubland and young Mediterranean oak forest in Palencia.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Department of Agroforestry Sciences: \"These plots were characterized based on stand and soil composition. In each plot, five soil samples (three undisturbed and one disturbed for measuring soil parameters, and another disturbed for microarthropod identification) were collected following a systematic sampling. Microarthropods from the disturbed samples were extracted using Berlese-Tullgren devices and taxonomically identified. Various indicators were assessed with this samples: QBS-ar index (reflecting soil quality based on the soil microarthropod community), observed taxonomic richness (Sobs), Shannon's diversity index (Hsw), Pielou's evenness index (Ep), dominance, and IndVal (specificity- fidelity). Soil parameters were analysed in situ: surface stoniness (SuS), leaf litter weight (Lw), and in the laboratory with the following parameters: soil humidity (Hu), bulk density (Bd), real density (Rd), porosity (P), sample stoniness (SoS), percentage of litter (Lc), soil texture (T), and organic matter (OM). The main variables that caused variations in these indicators by biotope were identified through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and analysed using generalized linear models (GLMs). Main results: Soil microarthropods collected revealed 14 major taxa; mites (Acari) were the most abundant (44%), followed by hymenopterans (34%) and springtails (Collembola) (15%), with the rest underrepresented (&lt; 2%). The IndVal index showed ants as indicators of the secondary grassland and shrubland. With respect to soil characteristics Lc, Hu, P, and OM, were notably higher in the forest. The analyses showed no significant differences between biotopes for the QBS-ar, Sobs and Hsw indices. The mean of the QBS-ar index was 63.88, that of Sobs was 5.44, and that of Hsw was 1.07. In all cases, p-values were &gt; 0.28, indicating that there were no relevant variations between biotopes. However, the evenness indicator (Ep), with an average of 0.66, was significantly higher in the shrublands. In addition, modelling showed higher evenness as understory was more developed (p-value &lt; 0.01).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Research highlights: The QBS-ar index increased as the woody plant community develops, soil community evenness was higher by shrub height, therefore understory could play a protective/facilitation role for soil arthropofauna. Likewise, although the biological communities change according to soil characteristics, the diversity and abundance were not influenced by the soil characteristics.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Microarthropods communities as indicators of soil quality in a Mediterranean periurban forest using the QBS-ar index.

Bregal Sphere will invest in an expansion of the Project, aiming to double the Project's size, enabling the distribution of 4. 4 million trees over the next five years and the restoration of more than 5,000 hectares of degraded land. The Project will seek to engage over 4,000 additional smallholder farmers and is forecast to remove approximately 1. 3 million tons of CO2 equivalent by 2039.

Established in 2010 by PUR, a leading developer of nature-based solutions projects with over 16 years of experience, Jubilaci\u00f3n Segura was first launched to address the urgent need for landscape restoration in regions heavily affected by deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practices. Building on a long and successful track record of close collaboration with two of the largest coffee and cocoa cooperatives in the San Mart\u00edn region, Acopagro, and Oro Verde, PUR has developed a community-driven model that blends reforestation with resilient, diversified agricultural systems. Agustin Silvani, Managing Partner at Bregal Sphere, commented, \"We are proud to partner with PUR to scale up their pioneering agroforestry models that aim to transform traditional coffee and cocoa production into sustainable and resilient carbon sinks. Through our investment and long-term engagement, we seek to double the scale of impact and position the Jubilaci\u00f3n Segura project for high-integrity carbon markets with positive impacts for farmers, the climate, and biodiversity. This is a pivotal role private capital can play in climate action - scaling proven climate solutions. Meike Carmen Willems, Country Manager, Peru at PUR, stated, \"This partnership allows us to amplify the positive impacts of an operation we have built over the past 14 years. With Bregal Sphere's investment, we can scale our work with smallholder farmers, restore vital ecosystems, and deliver high-integrity climate benefits at a time when the world urgently needs them. To enhance the resilience of its investment, Bregal Sphere secured innovative insurance coverage from specialist insurer CFC to mitigate external risks associated with carbon removal projects.", "Bregal Sphere invests targeted capital with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial return.

Notably, high-temperature pyrolysis induced consumption of oxygen-containing functional groups while promoting aromatic structure formation. The sorption behavior of diethyl phthalate, a representative plasticizer, on CHAs was well described by both Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The CHAs exhibited remarkable sorption performance for diethyl phthalate, with a maximum sorption capacity reaching 3345 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> as determined by the Langmuir model.

Experts unanimously warned that without immediate action, Punjab would continue to face severe climate-related threats, including devastating floods and prolonged droughts. They recommended models such as urban forestry, agroforestry, community-based plantations, and carbon credit forestry as viable solutions. Mahmood Akhtar Cheema of IUCNPakistan stressed the role of technology in expanding forest cover. 'IUCN stands ready to transfer its global expertise to Pakistan, and Punjab's efforts in this direction are commendable,' he said, adding that no forestry plan can succeed without community participation. He further noted that Punjab's recent conservation efforts in forestry and wildlife had produced results 'beyond expectations. She highlighted that the Punjab government, under the chief minister's leadership, is pursuing a comprehensive environmental policy. She underscored initiatives such as the Clean Punjab campaign, plantation drives, renewable energy programmes, environmental funds, and air pollution mitigation measures as key steps toward a greener province.", "'The remaining land lies under private ownership.

Its early funding commitments were to combat synthetic fertilizer use in industrial corn production. In June 2025, Bayer and Kimitec announced two next-generation biologicals: Ambition Complete Gen2 (enhancing nutrient absorption and resiliency to stress) and Ambition Secure Gen2 (improving calcium uptake and fruit firmness). These will be part of Bayer's Crop Performance Enhancer portfolio, which is currently undergoing regulatory approval. In June 2025, DSM-Firmenich announced its Bovaer feed additive that reduces methane emissions. Bovaer has been shown in over 150 trials domestically and internationally to reduce livestock methane emissions by as much as 45%. Bovaer has been approved by over 65 countries for use, is effective within 30 minutes of feeding, and is a safe, scalable, and practical climate mitigation opportunity for farmers. In May 2025, Indigo Agriculture announced that Microsoft purchased 60,000 soil carbon credits from its fourth and largest carbon crop from the Climate Action Reserve. After the 2024 deal, this partnership delivers benefits for regenerative agriculture through more adoption created for regenerative agriculture and quantifiable climate, soil, and water benefits across the US for long-term carbon storage.</p>", "publisher": "MENAFN - Press Releases (English)", "instances": ["Growing demand for organic and sustainable produce is pushing farmers to adopt eco-friendly solutions.
