We all rely on fruit and vegetables grown in regions that are increasingly affected by extreme weather and resource stress. Some projections suggest that if current practices continue, global agricultural productivity could fall by up to 30% by 2050. Crops that provide around 70% of the world's calories, could see average yield drops of over 10% [1]. It is clear that current farming models are no longer viable, and we need to build a new one that works for both people and planet. The Support GapResearch from the European Alliance for Regenerative Agriculture (EARA) found that regenerative farms produce comparable yields to conventional ones, while using 62% less synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and 76% fewer pesticides[2]. These are meaningful improvements that reduce environmental impact and cut input costs for farmers. But switching to regenerative methods is not without complications. It comes with costs, new risks, and the need for new skills. Farmers need clear incentives, access to advice and long-term financial support for the transition to succeed. Whilst progress has been made, there remains a lack of options to help commercial farmers de-risk and adopt lower GHG emission inputs.", "There are not enough resources to ensure the commercial change needed for the future of sustainable farming. Creating Models to Accelerate ChangeThat's why we launched our Farmer Innovation Fund, a scalable model designed to help our ingredient suppliers transition to regenerative practices. It provides tailored, financial support for projects addressing key agricultural challenges, including soil health, water efficiency, biodiversity, crop resilience, and carbon reduction. We funded projects including SVZ, who are expanding its use of the HIDRIX on-demand irrigation system to optimise water use and reduce emissions, research into orange tree carbon sequestration in Brazil, and Agrarias Manchegas' transition to becoming a fully functioning smart farm. From Projects to LandscapesThis transition is bigger than any single company or farm, and everyone has a part to play in safeguarding the future supply of fruit and vegetables. To scale regenerative agriculture, we need a collaborative approach. That means bringing together farmers, NGOs, policymakers, industry, and companies to build a framework fit for purpose.

By working with nature instead of against it, we can reduce pressures on farmers while protecting the land for the next generation,\" stated Nathaniel Barrett, President and CEO of AgriTec. \"Education is just as important as innovation. Our role is to help farmers see what's possible when soil health comes first, and to support them as they put those principles into practice.\"This segment will highlight AgriTec International's remarkable shift from conventional product sales to a strategy centered on nurturing soil health from the ground up. Viewers will learn about innovative liquid soil amendments, biologicals, and fertilizers that work in harmony with nature to promote long-term fertility, rather than just short-term boosts. The program will demonstrate how AgriTec International's emphasis on farmer education and support allows growers to unlock existing nutrients within their soil, leading to robust crops, increased yields, and enhanced profitability, all while safeguarding the land for generations to come. This approach helps farmers navigate critical industry challenges, including the rising costs of traditional inputs and the increasing demand for sustainable practices.The focus will be on AgriTec International's \"soil first\" philosophy, illustrating how a deep understanding of soil biology can reduce dependency on synthetic chemicals and foster a more resilient agricultural system.

In some cases, RA often also includes broader efforts to balance environmental, economic, and social welfare principles. The term regenerative in the context of agricultural practices first appeared in the early 1980s and was mainly associated with organic production practices. Regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices. ROA is often cited as building on RA practices and sometimes used interchangeably with RA. Since the mid-2010s, research and advocacy focused on RA and ROA have increased sharply.</p><p>Despite the growing popularity of RA and ROA labeling and marketing claims, neither term has been formally codified in either federal or state statutes or regulations. There also is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Regenerative farming principles have not been formally identified and are not enforceable under existing federal programs or certification standards subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite a lack of consensus about how to define regenerative and the absence of federal enforceable certification standards, several food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives.</p><p>Uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims about foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable product claims may create challenges for farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers. While there are no statutory, regulatory, or formal administrative definitions of RA and ROA, many of the soil-related practices incorporated into private sector initiatives are consistent with soil health principles recommended by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). These NRCS conservation practice standards often share with the organic agriculture sector the common goal of optimizing soil health but differ from USDA National Organic Program regulations and federal certification standards that prohibit certain practices and external inputs for products labeled organic (such as the use of certain synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). USDA has administered climate and carbon sequestration initiatives that share some practices and goals with private RA and ROA initiatives. Regardless of what practices are required under various private sector initiatives, federal labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, such as those under the authorities of FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, still apply.</p><p>Congress has debated regenerative farming and its potential role in improving soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure or achieving other goals. Congress has conducted hearings on RA, and some Members have introduced bills and resolutions involving RA and ROA, although few bills have attempted to define either term. In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 would have identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or other practices as determined by the USDA Secretary. H.R. 9631 included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products and a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products based on USDA-certified organic production methods.

In some cases, RA includes broader efforts to balance environmental, economic, and social welfare principles. The term regenerative in the context of agricultural practices first appeared in the early 1980s associated mainly with organic agricultural practices. Accordingly, regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices.</p><p>Among food manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, interest is increasing in RA and ROA as well as other related sustainable consumer product labeling and marketing claims. Some policymakers also have shown interest in regenerative farming as a way to potentially improve (i.e., regenerate) soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure, among other environmental and societal goals. For example, H.Res. 1234 (117th Congress) expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services.\" Congress has conducted hearings on RA, although few bills have attempted to define regenerative or promote the term's use. Some policymakers have expressed concern about efforts to advance RA, when related objectives (e.g., use of certain pesticides and chemicals in food production) could result in limited options for agricultural production practices./1</p><p>To date, RA and ROA have not been defined in statute, and regenerative farming principles are not enforceable under existing federal or state programs or policies. There also are no federal or state certification standards or rules for what can be defined as RA or ROA practices subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)./2</p><p>There also is no clear scientific definition of or agreement on the types of farming practices and product standards that might qualify as regenerative. This lack of consensus complicates the ability of food producers, manufacturers, and retailers to make certain labeling and marketing claims about food products. In contrast, the term organically produced agricultural product has a federally recognized and enforced statutory definition, and USDA administers an organic certification program./3</p><p>Food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Definitions and marketing claims under these initiatives vary, depending on the food product sold and the specific goals and objectives of the group promoting the initiative. Some RA and ROA initiatives are broadly focused on certain minimally applied production practices, and others are highly prescriptive and specify wide-ranging and explicit practices intended to achieve certain production and environmental outcomes. Some initiatives include a wide range of social welfare outcomes, such as assurances of farmer profitability and minimum salaries and benefits for workers, promotion of locally sourced foods, and considerations of Indigenous agricultural practices and animal welfare protections. Aside from general labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, private sector efforts are not verifiable or enforceable by federal or state rules. Farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers may find it challenging to navigate uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims on foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable food product claims.</p><p>* * *</p><p>1 U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, Past Breakthroughs and Future Innovations in Crop Production, hearing, 119th Cong., 1st sess., July 22, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=\">https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=</url> 118519.</p><p>2 Since the start of the second Trump Administration, both the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have announced reorganization and restructuring plans.

The 119th Congress may also consider related legislative efforts and policies, such as promotion of regenerative farming principles by the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) congressional caucus, which has a stated goal of \"advancing regenerative and precision agriculture and environmental efforts.\"/4</p><p>Terms and Definitions</p><p>Absence of Uniform RA and ROA Definitions</p><p>Some federal legislation and state initiatives have proposed definitions of RA and ROA, but no such defined terms have been codified in federal or state laws and regulations to date. In addition, there is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Currently, companies that label or market foods as regenerative are likely participating in various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Foods labeled and marketed as regenerative under these initiatives are not certified or governed by any federal or state program, although some private sector initiatives may include regenerative practices and outcomes outlined in some federal programs and policies, such as standards and requirements comprising some USDA conservation and. organic certification programs, along with a focus on efforts to balance environmental, social, and economic principles. In addition, federal laws and regulations govern the labeling and marketing of food products to ensure foods sold in the United States are properly labeled and are not misbranded; however, current federal guidance does not specifically address \"regenerative\" food product labeling claims./5</p><p>USDA scientists note that RA \"seems to be defined differently by different people\" and that most definitions are \"based on the goal of regenerating soil\" and largely include practices that are \"in line with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)'s soil health principles\" and share a common goal with organic agriculture (i.e., optimizing soil health)./6</p><p>NRCS conservation practices include minimizing tillage, maximizing the amount of time roots are growing in soil, and adding organic amendments to soil (e.g., manures, crop and cover crop residues)./7</p><p>NRCS conservation practice standards are broadly applicable to most conventionally produced agriculture and may differ from those under USDA-certified organic agriculture regulations that prohibit certain practices and external inputs (such as the use of synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). Some researchers define RA according to NRCS principles: \"keeping soils continuously covered, minimizing soil disturbance, increasing biological diversity, keeping living roots in the soil, and integrating livestock\" to ensure soil health and carbon sequestration and reduce inputs while \"not sacrificing profitability.\"/8</p><p>* * *</p><p>4 See Sen.

In practice, they acknowledge that the regenerative label \"has been applied to nearly anything that improves farm outcomes and minimizes environmental impact.\"/9</p><p>This includes common agricultural and soil health practices intended to boost crop yields, mitigate production risks, improve soil conditions, increase input efficiency, reduce synthetic inputs, support new crop development, or enable new or alternative revenue streams (e.g., carbon credits or products marketed as organic or locally produced). The text box above illustrates some of the farming practices that may be considered to be regenerative.</p><p>ROA initiatives generally include RA farming practices (see text box above) as a base requirement that is supplemented by organic agricultural practices and standards. While some ROA initiatives require practices and standards under USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) regulations and federal certification process,/10 ROA initiatives, in most cases, reference practices associated with various private sector organic certification programs. Accordingly, ROA initiatives may include practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity, among other practices, including planting perennials, developing pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporating agroforestry systems, planting vegetative barriers, and implementing practices that may develop soil organic matter. The Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) notes that the leading regenerative practices cited by existing initiatives are reduced tillage, integration of livestock, use of cover crops and crop rotation systems, and low to no application of external inputs (such as chemicals and biotechnology). According to OFRF, current initiatives' leading desired outcomes include improved soil health and fertility, increased carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and improved water health and economic well-being of communities. OFRF claims that the aim of minimizing external inputs while maximizing ecological practices is captured in the principles of organic agriculture./11</p><p>Ambiguity about what is meant by RA and ROA has made it difficult to develop legislation on this topic and has raised concerns about potential misleading or deceptive claims related to the sustainability and environmental benefits of a product or practice claiming to be regenerative./12</p><p>Despite the lack of clarity, some food companies and retailers continue to incorporate sustainability and regenerative initiatives into their global supply chains.</p><p>* * *</p><p>9 Shane Thomas, \"If Every Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company, Then No Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company,\" Upstream Ag Insights, May 10, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340\">https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340</url>.</p><p>10 The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 was enacted as part of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624, Title XXI; 7 U.S.C.

Most researchers cite the Rodale Institute - a nonprofit organization that supports organic farming research, practices, and education - as among the first to formally coin the phrase \"regenerative agriculture\" in the early 1980s. Others cite earlier work by the National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) and other groups./13</p><p>Some acknowledge general contributions in the early 20th century by soil scientist George Washington Carver of Tuskegee University,/14 among other pioneers of sustainable, organic, and alternative agriculture./15</p><p>Overall, regenerative farming has become one among several terms used to describe farming systems that seek to balance agricultural production with environmental goals./16</p><p>The following definition of RA is attributed to Robert Rodale of the Rodale Institute in 1983:/17</p><p>'Regenerative agriculture is one that, at increasing levels of productivity, increases our land and soil biological production base. It has a high level of built-in economic and biological stability. It has minimal to no impact on the environment beyond the farm or field boundaries. It produces foodstuffs free from biocides. It provides for the productive contribution of increasingly large numbers of people during a transition to minimal reliance on non-renewable resources.'</p><p>Historically, the Rodale Institute promoted regenerative farming as creating a \"permanently sustainable system,\" mainly through the use of organic farming and \"nonmainstream\" farming methods./18</p><p>This included \"avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides\" in exchange for \"more natural fertilizers and totally biological approaches to insect control,\" as well as growing a mixture of annual and perennial wild plants instead of monocropping annual crops, thus reducing the need for tillage and weed control. Similarly, NACD's promotion of regenerative farming cited efforts to \"slow the advance of desertification and soil salinization, reduce the loss of prime farmlands and fragile topsoils,\" support wildlife habitats, and reduce waste and water contamination, as well as \"in general, make rural America a far more healthy, satisfying, and financially rewarding place to live.\"/19</p><p>The Rodale Institute also has advocated for adding \"regenerative components to the present [farming] system in a bit-by-bit way.\"/20</p><p>* * *</p><p>13 R.

Most current ROA-recommended practices tend to be associated with private organic certification programs rather than with federal NOP certification standards and policies. These private sector programs may include practices similar to those required under NOP (e.g., cover cropping, crop rotation, low- to no-till farming, composting, and reduced use of persistent chemical pesticides and fertilizers), but they often include additional practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity. In private programs, soil health practices (such as the development of soil organic matter) may include, for example, the \"addition of perennials, development of pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporation of agroforestry systems, [and] vegetative barriers,\" among other practices./21</p><p>In 1985, Rodale defined ROA as a practice that \"improves the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them\" and as a \"holistic systems approach to agriculture that encourages continual on-farm innovation for environmental, social, economic and spiritual wellbeing.\"/22 ROA was said to be distinct from sustainable agriculture since it \"takes advantage of the natural tendencies of ecosystems to regenerate when disturbed\"; is \"marked by tendencies towards closed nutrient loops, greater diversity in the biological community, fewer annuals and more perennials, and greater reliance on internal rather than external resources\"; and is \"aligned with forms of agroecology practiced by farmers concerned with food sovereignty the world over.\"/23</p><p>Unlike RA and ROA, sustainable agriculture is defined in statute for the purposes of USDA program implementation (see the text box below). Although this term is defined in statute, multiple interpretations of sustainability are used to market food products and there is limited federal guidance regarding sustainable food labeling and packaging claims.</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions</p><p>While research and initiatives focused on RA and ROA have increased since the mid-2010s, the meaning of each term varies depending on the group defining, certifying, and promoting such product claims. How RA and ROA are defined has led to tension./24 In general, such definitions vary depending on whether labeling a product as regenerative is determined by the use of specific farming practices (i.e., process-based) or certain desired goals (i.e., outcome-based) or both./25</p><p>* * *</p><p>21 Regenerative Organic Alliance, \"Why RegenerativeOrganic?,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/\">https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/</url>.</p><p>22 USDA's National Agricultural Library (NAL), oral history interview with Robert Rodale in 1989, available at Rodale Institute, \"Regenerative Organic Agriculture: Beyond Sustainable,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/</url>.</p><p>23 Rodale Institute, Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change, 2014, <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf</url>.</p><p>24 Janet Ranganathan et al., \"Regenerative Agriculture: Good for Soil Health, but Limited Potential to Mitigate Climate Change,\" World Resources Institute, May 12, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;\">https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;</url> David Bronner, \"Regenerative Agriculture: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" All-One Blog, Dr. Bronner's, March 11, 2024, <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;\">https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;</url> and Keith Paustian et al., Climate Mitigation Potential of Regenerative Agriculture Is Significant!, Regenerative Agriculture Foundation, June 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document\">https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document</url>.</p><p>25 See, for example, Peter Newton et al., \"What Is Regenerative Agriculture?

Process-based RA (or ROA) definitions may explicitly exclude certain practices, such as those that negatively impact soil health and biodiversity as well as those that use synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, biotechnology, intensive tillage, monocropping, concentrated animal feeding systems, or soilless production systems (e.g., hydroponic and aquaponic). Overall, a process-based RA definition is based on an actual or perceived relationship between a process and a particular outcome./28</p><p>In contrast, examples of outcome-based RA definitions may include claims such as enhanced soil health (e.g., regarding structure, organic matter, and fertility); improved ecosystem function (e.g., water quality and pasture quality); increased biodiversity; carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; improved farm productivity (e.g., better crop yields and crop resilience) and profitability; reduced waste; improved human health (e.g., food safety, access, and nutritional quality); and improved animal health and welfare, among other social or community well-being benefits./29 In general, outcome-based RA is accepting of all of the processes that lead to a desired outcome; if the approach includes multiple outcomes, then any process used would have to contribute to (or at least not hinder) the accomplishment of all outcomes./30</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism</p><p>Advocates of RA and ROA claim the benefits of implementing regenerative practices include improved soil quality and resilience, sequestration of carbon in soil, climate change mitigation, improved crop yields and ecosystem services, reduced runoff and subsequent soil and water resource degradation, minimized pesticide residues and exposure, reduced energy use, improved biodiversity conservation, and enhanced food security./31 In addition to environmental benefits, other research suggests possible benefits include enhanced food nutritional quality and improved human health as well as food availability and affordability if food is produced locally./32 Other research claims economic and social benefits, including improved farmer profitability from reduced input costs, risk mitigation, and higher output value; enhanced local food production; food security; and employment./33 Although regenerative farming is generally more labor-intensive than conventional farming, the labor costs might be offset by lower input costs elsewhere, such as reduced agrochemical and energy inputs and possible higher farm income.</p><p>* * *</p><p>28 Some studies have examined outcomes using combined (or stacked) practices based on different growing or geographic conditions.

In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or \"any other highly effective and evidence-based vegetative or management practice, as determined by the Secretary, based on an annual review, that significantly reduces agricultural greenhouse gas emissions or assists producers in adapting to, or mitigating against, increasing weather volatility.\" Practices identified in H.R. 598 were part of broader efforts to address climate-related concerns.</p><p>Another 118th Congress bill, H.R. 9631, included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products - those that use an \"integrated approach to farming and ranching rooted in the principles of soil health leading to improved target outcomes\" and \"in a manner that fosters community and social wellness.\" H.R. 9631 also included a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products as those that also meet additional requirements and production methods described in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.6501 et seq.). H.R. 9631 proposed these definitions for the purposes of establishing a Food as Medicine program promoting foods that are regeneratively produced, organically produced, or both.</p><p>Committees in the 117th Congress conducted a series of hearings on RA in 2022./40 Also in the 117th Congress, H.Res. 1234 would have expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems.\" H.Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility.\" H.Res. 1234 claimed \"regenerative practices and sustainable agriculture works to restore ecosystems, combat climate change, build soil health, prevent erosion, and improve water quality,\" among other benefits.</p><p>Other introduced legislation would have amended USDA conservation programs to include RA but did not specifically define RA-related terms or practices. For example, in the 118th Congress, H.R. 5951/S. 3023 suggested that, at minimum, RA training would cover conservation practices that \"improve soil health, reduce production inputs, and regenerate soil, farmland, and nearby ecosystems,\" as well as organic and diversified practices (such as perennial cropping systems, agroforestry or silvopasture systems, livestock integration into cropping systems, and prescribed grazing) and practices that mitigate climate impacts and draw on \"traditional ecological knowledge\" from various producer groups.</p><p>State Government Example</p><p>In January 2025, the California State Board of Food and Agriculture (CSBFA) finalized its recommendations to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) on defining RA for the purpose of the state's agricultural policies and programs./41 See the text box below.</p><p>* * *</p><p>40 See, for example, U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, \"Soil Health Practices and Programs that Support Regenerative Agriculture,\" hearing, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., September 14, 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/LC69492/text;\">https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/LC69492/text;</url> and U.S. Congress, House Oversight and Reform Committee, Subcommittee on Environment, \"Regenerative Agriculture: How Farmers and Ranchers are Essential to Solving Climate Change and Increasing Food Production,\" hearing, 117th Cong., 2nd sess., July 19, 2022, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/115012\">https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/115012</url>.

The proposed definition is intended as \"continuous implementation of practices that over time minimize inputs and environmental impacts and further enhances the ecosystem while maintaining or improving productivity, economic contributions and community benefits.\" This approach is said to have been informed \"by the traditions and innovations from the original Indigenous stewards of the land.\" The definition is not intended for use in certification.</p><p>Source: CDFA, Staff Draft: Defining Regenerative Agriculture for State Policies and Programs. The proposed draft definition references policies and practices at USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service; the California Department of Pesticide Regulation; and various University of California research initiatives.

CDFA's definition does not include organic certification as a base requirement to qualify as regenerative, despite related efforts to increase transition from conventional to organic agriculture in the state./42 To date, these recommendations have not been codified in state law. No other state government has initiated similar efforts to officially define RA or ROA.</p><p>International Examples</p><p>Sustainable agriculture and RA topics are being debated and examined within a variety of international forums and intergovernmental organizations, including the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p><p>The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has set broad sustainability goals since the 1970s, resulting in efforts to address sustainable agriculture and resilient agroecosystems. Some earlier efforts encompassed objectives spanning ethics and fairness, resource protections, biodiversity, economic viability, rural and socioeconomic development, and social responsibility./43 Decades later, these topics continue to be debated. For example, sustainable and regenerative production were topics at the 2023 Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its subsidiary agreement, the Paris Agreement./44 Among other outcomes, COP28 identified a target related to food and food systems involving the need for \"implementation of integrated, multi-sectoral solutions, such as land use management, sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems\" and \"attain[ment of] climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increas[ed] sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition for all\" by the year 2030./45 The COP28 decision on the Paris Agreement's global goal on adaptation sets an identical 2030 target./46 Although RA has been said to be closely aligned with the UNSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that seek to \"promote sustainable agriculture\" (SDG-2),/47 the term is not explicitly referenced in the SDGs.</p><p>WTO's 1995 Agreement on Agriculture does not reference sustainable agriculture or RA but includes multiple references to agro-environmental issues. These include the need to protect the environment, support research and infrastructural works associated with environmental programs, and make allowances for \"special treatment reflecting factors of non-trade concerns, such as food security and environmental protection,\" including payments to agricultural producers that are \"part of a clearly-defined government environmental or conservation program.\"/48 WTO members continue to discuss how to facilitate sustainable agriculture within the global trade system,/49 and industry groups continue to propose ways to incorporate sustainability goals as part of agricultural subsidies subject to WTO commitments and obligations under the agreement./50 Previous multilateral agricultural trade talks, such as those at the WTO 12th Ministerial Conference in 2021-2022, discussed but did not implement possible sustainable trade liberalizations, among other topics./51</p><p>* * *</p><p>42 Rebekah Weber, \"California Creates Guidance for Regenerative Agriculture - A Mixed Bag,\" California Certified Organic Farmers, January 14, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ccof.org/news/california-creates-guidance-for-regenerativeagriculture-a-mixed-bag/;\">https://www.ccof.org/news/california-creates-guidance-for-regenerativeagriculture-a-mixed-bag/;</url> and Brad Hooker, \"In Defining Regenerative Ag, CDFA Ignites Debate over California's Farming Future,\" Agri-Pulse, September 13, 2023.</p><p>43 Heinrich Wohlmeyer and Theodor Quendler, eds., The WTO, Agriculture and Sustainable Development (Routledge, 2017), pp. 244-245, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351282123\">https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351282123</url>.</p><p>44 Conferences of the Parties (COPs) are convened under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992, and seek to identify and assess climate measures (see UAE Consensus COP 28 UAE, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/;\">https://www.cop28.com/en/;</url> and UNFCCC, \"The Paris Agreement,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement</url>).

For Zimmerman and Walberg, no-till progressed to cover cropping, which then went to including cereals and specialty crops, rotating crops, and grazing livestock on cover crops, as well as experimenting with other aspects of regenerative farming, all while continuing to reduce chemical and fertilizer inputs. \u201cEverything just kept connecting and we kept going down that road, and pretty soon here you are doing all these different things that the conventional farmer isn\u2019t doing,\u201d Zimmerman said.

Their partnership is more than a business venture, it's a testament to collaboration and core values.</p><p>\u201cWe \u2019 re bringing together different conservation practices to create a regenerative farming system,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>\u201cWe hope to show it \u2019 s possible to naturally grow crops and raise animals through diversity. \u201d</p><p>Their commitment to the process of regenerative farming, along with help from NRCS programs and personnel, is proving to be a winning combination.</p><p>A different approach</p><p>Regenerative agriculture takes a different approach compared to conventional methods.</p><p>Regenerative methods look at how all the parts of the process fit and work together. It looks at the system as a whole, not individual pieces. Its aim is to let natural processes take the lead, with management decisions made to enhance or restore those processes. The use of external inputs, especially synthetic forms, are minimized or eliminated completely.</p><p>\u201cIt \u2019 s this very complex system of nature taking care of nature,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is based on five key principles; keeping the soil covered, increasing diversity, minimizing soil disturbance, maintaining living roots and integrating livestock.</p><p>The Wests look to incorporate these principles in all their decisions.</p><p>From their rotational grazing system, diversity in crops and animals, use of chickens as pest control, and unique fertilizer, they are practicing what they preach.</p><p>Jim began researching regenerative agriculture in the early 2000s while still in military service with the Marine Corp.</p><p>He wanted to understand the chemistry and biology behind it.</p><p>Books, articles, podcasts, videos, he took in all the information he could find. He also began to make his own observations from his travels with the military.</p><p>Having been stationed around the world in places like the Philippines, Korea, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, the experiences piqued his curiosity. Having learned from each one, he was curious as to why certain things worked in some areas and not others.</p><p>\u201cI watched the land here \u2014 not just our place \u2014 because everybody who \u2019 s using land has a vision for what they want to do and I \u2019 m not going to fault their vision,\u201d said Jim. \u201cI think we can do ag a lot better in the US. I just thought, \u2018There \u2019 s got to be a better way. \u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a landowner to come in with plans for regenerative farming and soil health \u2014 is not very common,\u201d said NRCS Brady Resource Team Leader, Haden Keyser. \u201cWhen Jim and Stephen came to me with this idea, the research and knowledge they have on this system gives me hope they are going to be successful. \u201d</p><p>All in the family</p><p>The journey for Sunrise W Land and Cattle began after Jim retired from military service.</p><p>He was able to acquire his grandfather's 600-acre ranch to combine with property he already owned. The move not only honored his family's history but sparked a vision he and Stephen had for their own operation. They were also able to purchase another piece of property just a mile down the road.</p><p>With the land they wanted under their control, all that was left was to install the system they had envisioned.</p><p>Stephen's agricultural knowledge and expertise, coupled with Jim \u2019 s decades of experience and leadership, has created a synergy. This drives innovation and progress on every inch of the property.</p><p>Even the name of the ranch, Sunrise W, has meaning and purpose.</p><p>\u201cW of course, our last name is West,\u201d said Jim. \u201cThe arc on top \u2014 I taught my kids there \u2019 s five C \u2019 s to living a good life: candor, competence, compassion, courage, and core values. If you \u2019 ll notice, there \u2019 s five rays to the sun. And so that became our cattle brand. \u201d</p><p>They are quick to point out a silent partner that plays a significant role as well.</p><p>\u201cMom doesn \u2019 t come out too often. She still works a job in San Antonio,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cBut she \u2019 s our CFO. Everything runs through her. At the end of the day she keeps my dad and I grounded for sure. \u201d</p><p>NRCS Partnership in Restoring the Land</p><p>Initially on their own, the property was so heavily covered in mesquite, that the first two years were spent clearing portions of the land. The invasive brush was removed mechanically, stacked and the piles burned to give them a blank canvas to start from.</p><p>Looking for information about the flood prevention dam on the property, the Wests came to the NRCS office in Brady. The conversation soon turned to conservation and the plan they had in mind. From that starting point, the Wests have worked closely with NRCS.</p><p>Now, the focus is on improving their pastures.</p><p>The Wests have been able to implement conservation practices that complimented their regenerative program.</p><p>The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has been the main source of NRCS program participation for the Wests.</p><p>EQIP offers technical and financial assistance for working agriculture lands. It helps farmers and ranchers maintain or improve production while conserving natural resources. NRCS works one-on-one with producers to develop a conservation plan that outlines practices and activities to solve on-farm resource issues. EQIP helps make conservation accessible.</p><p>For the Wests, this included practices such as fencing, water development, additional brush clearing and grass seeding. Through EQIP, they have been able to install infrastructure that allows their operation to run smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSo, the NRCS has been one, a great resource of knowledge, then also has been a great resource in getting these projects \u2014 on the ground,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cIt can be very labor intensive when it comes to having to move animals every single day and having the water for them as well. \u201d</p><p>The Wests utilize a management intensive grazing system. In this system, the cattle are concentrated on a small area for a short time. The goal of this system is better grazing utilization, encouraging livestock to eat everything within the grazing area. Livestock are moved often, most times daily. Adequate fencing and water sources make the process easier. The area is then left ungrazed for the remainder of the year, allowing it to rest before it is grazed again the next year.</p><p>NRCS has also been helpful with grass mixes and plantings.</p><p>Both for their regenerative system and grazing rotations, grass is vitally important. All five principles of regenerative agriculture can be tied back to grass, specifically it \u2019 s abundance and diversity. After brush removal and as a way of rejuvenating the soil, the Wests have experimented with many different seed mixes.</p><p>\u201cWe put together a list of seeds and ask what they think,\u201d said Jim. \u201cNRCS has been great in helping us get the right mix. \u201d</p><p>Outside the box</p><p>For regenerative agriculture systems that try and minimize outside inputs, especially synthetic products like insecticides and fertilizers, more natural options are preferred.</p><p>Following their regenerative goals, Jim and Stephen have incorporated practices that aren \u2019 t exactly traditional.</p><p>\u201cThe unique thing about this ranch is the incorporation of worm tea and chickens to help microorganisms and soil health,\u201d said NRCS Brady district conservationist Walt Broyles. \u201cYou typically do not see that on rangeland for our cattle operations. \u201d</p><p>Chickens provide many benefits to the Wests \u2019 program.</p><p>They utilize a mobile coop to house their chickens on pasture. It follows the cattle in rotation through the pastures, 2-3 days behind. The coop houses several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens.</p><p>The chickens fill multiple roles.</p><p>Manure is a natural fertilizer that benefits pasture grasses and is a resource that is abundant in livestock operations. This is especially the case in intensively managed systems like the Wests \u2019 that concentrate animals on smaller acres. The chickens scratch through the cattle manure, spreading it out and making the coverage more uniform. They also eat insects that are attracted to it. By following the cattle closely in rotation, the chickens take care of the insects before they become a problem. This is especially true of flies, which are a common problem for livestock producers.</p><p>They also provide a product that can be sold, eggs.</p><p>Being raised on pasture, input for production is lower and the eggs fetch a premium price being cage-free and organic.</p><p>Worm tea is a practice that is not common but shows promise as a fertilizer alternative.</p><p>Worms perform the important task of decomposition. As they process materials, they return important nutrients back to the soil and boost microbial activity. This in turn benefits other soil microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and protozoa. All of these parts and organisms combined form a healthy, fertile soil.</p><p>\u201cEarthworms are nature \u2019 s way of putting biology back into the soil,\u201d explains Jim, \u201cwhich is exactly what we want. \u201d</p><p>The Wests have taken this beneficial natural process and have adapted into making their own worm tea.Worm tea is made by taking the decomposed materials from worms, called worm castings, adding water, and allowing it to \u201cbrew\u201d. Though this is an oversimplification, the process allows the beneficial microorganisms to reproduce and form a natural liquid fertilizer that is readily absorbed by plants.</p><p>The Wests have a large bin of approximately 100,000 worms that they collect the castings from. The bin is filled with compost and mixed with a blend of grains that is food for the worms. They collect the castings once a week from the bottom of the flow-through bin. From there, the castings go into what the Wests call the brewer. It can best be described as a super-sized Keurig machine. The container is filled with water and aerated for 24 hours, allowing the microorganisms in the castings to multiply. The product at the end of the process is a nutrient and microorganism dense, all-natural fertilizer. They then spray the liquified worm tea onto their pastures.</p><p>\u201cWe have been accused of being odd,\u201d said Stephen with a chuckle.</p><p>All of these conservation measures, both traditional and new, combine to form a regenerative system that is benefitting both the land and the operation.</p><p>A Bright Future Ahead</p><p>Looking ahead, the Wests are hoping their approach can become a model others can learn from and replicate.</p><p>Jim and Stephen are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and experience with fellow landowners. They hold classes, participate in interviews, and create videos to educate and inspire others to embrace regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn \u2019 t trade it. You know, just seeing the difference,\u201d said Jim. \u201cMy ultimate goal is that whoever we deal with believes we \u2019 re providing more nutritious food and that we \u2019 re taking care of both them and the land and animals at the same time. And that \u2019 s really what drives me. \u201d</p><p>Keyser, who calls himself one of the Wests \u2019 biggest fans, is excited to see how their land responds.</p><p>\u201cThey want people to come up to their fence and ask, \u2018What are you doing over there? \u2019 and find success so they can share what they \u2019 re doing. They \u2019 re not afraid to work \u2014 and they believe in this,\u201d said Keyser.</p><p>Broyles, too, admires the Wests \u2019 out-of-the-box approach. \u201cThese systems they have here\u2014it \u2019 s how hard do you want to work? It \u2019 s a daily basis. \u201d</p><p>For the NRCS, \u201cHelping people help the land\u201d is the motto that we strive to achieve with every producer and conservation plan we implement.

(CSE: ERTH) on the successful commissioning of its Beiseker granulated fertilizer facility, hailing it as a transformative milestone for both the company and the sustainable agriculture sector. Upon reaching full capacity, the new Beiseker plant is expected to generate up to CAD $15.6 million in annual revenues with gross margins exceeding 30%. As one of ESGFIRE's standout investments in regenerative agriculture, Replenish's achievement validates the scalable business model we championed and underpins our confidence in the company's robust cash flow potential and industry leadership in sustainable fertilizer solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beiseker commissioning</emphasis>In this first phase of operations, Replenish's Beiseker facility has begun producing the company's proprietary granulated fertilizers, with ongoing ramp-up aimed at 2,000 tonnes per month of throughput at full scale. These volumes translate into a run-rate of approximately $13\u2013$16 million in annual revenue at 30%+ gross profit margins, supporting a healthy ~$4 million gross profit stream. Such economics are expected to yield strong free cash flows for Replenish, enabling the company to self-fund growth and debt reduction initiatives.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward looking projections with Debolt</emphasis>Beyond the immediate financial metrics, the commissioning of the Beiseker facility solidifies ReplenishNutrients' position as a leader in regenerative agriculture. The company has pioneered a patented, zero-waste fertilizer technology and established distribution across over a million acres of North American farmland \u2013 achievements that set it apart in a sector long dominated by traditional incumbents. This new facility is more than just an increase in production; it's a proof point that sustainable agriculture innovations can be scaled profitably. \"Beiseker is more than a facility \u2014 it's a blueprint for what comes next,\" Replenish CEO Neil Wiens noted in the company's release, a sentiment we echo at ESGFIRE. We view this successful start-up as a template for Replenish's scalable growth model, with an additional project (DeBolt) in the development pipeline that can replicate this model across new regions. In particular, Replenish's upcoming DeBolt facility in Alberta is planned to produce up to 50,000 tonnes per year of regenerative fertilizer with similar margins and pricing as Beiseker translating into additional potential annual revenues of ~CA$30 million. We anticipate hearing further updates on DeBolt's progress soon, as it represents the next major step in Replenish's expansion strategy. With the global shift toward regenerative farming gaining momentum, Replenish is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on rising demand for environmentally friendly nutrient solutions. The consistent 30%+ margins and field-proven efficacy of its products not only advance sustainable soil health but also demonstrate that green innovations can deliver attractive returns. ESGFIRE also highlights the fact that ReplenishNutrients have a scalability in licensing their plant model to external actors, a feature they are almost unique with in the agtech sector.ReplenishNutrients has proven itself as a flagship ESGFIRE portfolio company by uniting profitability with sustainability. The Beiseker facility's commissioning marks a turning point \u2013 it validates Replenish's ability to execute at scale and generate meaningful cash flow while healing the soil. This accomplishment strengthens our confidence in Replenish's growth trajectory and reaffirms our investment thesis. We believe today's milestone foreshadows significant value creation ahead, as Replenish continues to expand its market reach and set new benchmarks in regenerative agriculture. ESGFIRE remains as optimistic as ever about Replenish's future and we are excited to soon see developments like DeBolt further contribute to its success.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About ESGFIRE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESGFIRE is an investment company and research firm that focuses on ESG companies with either an environmentally friendly service or product.

(CSE: ERTH) on the successful commissioning of its Beiseker granulated fertilizer facility, hailing it as a transformative milestone for both the company and the sustainable agriculture sector. Upon reaching full capacity, the new Beiseker plant is expected to generate up to CAD $15. 6 million in annual revenues with gross margins exceeding 30%. As one of ESGFIRE's standout investments in regenerative agriculture, Replenish's achievement validates the scalable business model we championed and underpins our confidence in the company's robust cash flow potential and industry leadership in sustainable fertilizer solutions. Beiseker commissioningIn this first phase of operations, Replenish's Beiseker facility has begun producing the company's proprietary granulated fertilizers, with ongoing ramp-up aimed at 2,000 tonnes per month of throughput at full scale. These volumes translate into a run-rate of approximately $13\u2013$16 million in annual revenue at 30%+ gross profit margins, supporting a healthy ~$4 million gross profit stream.

The company has pioneered a patented, zero-waste fertilizer technology and established distribution across over a million acres of North American farmland \u2013 achievements that set it apart in a sector long dominated by traditional incumbents. This new facility is more than just an increase in production; it's a proof point that sustainable agriculture innovations can be scaled profitably. \"Beiseker is more than a facility \u2014 it's a blueprint for what comes next,\" Replenish CEO Neil Wiens noted in the company's release, a sentiment we echo at ESGFIRE. We view this successful start-up as a template for Replenish's scalable growth model, with an additional project (DeBolt) in the development pipeline that can replicate this model across new regions. In particular, Replenish's upcoming DeBolt facility in Alberta is planned to produce up to 50,000 tonnes per year of regenerative fertilizer with similar margins and pricing as Beiseker translating into additional potential annual revenues of ~CA$30 million.", "The consistent 30%+ margins and field-proven efficacy of its products not only advance sustainable soil health but also demonstrate that green innovations can deliver attractive returns. ESGFIRE also highlights the fact that ReplenishNutrients have a scalability in licensing their plant model to external actors, a feature they are almost unique with in the agtech sector. ReplenishNutrients has proven itself as a flagship ESGFIRE portfolio company by uniting profitability with sustainability. The Beiseker facility's commissioning marks a turning point \u2013 it validates Replenish's ability to execute at scale and generate meaningful cash flow while healing the soil. This accomplishment strengthens our confidence in Replenish's growth trajectory and reaffirms our investment thesis. We believe today's milestone foreshadows significant value creation ahead, as Replenish continues to expand its market reach and set new benchmarks in regenerative agriculture. ESGFIRE remains as optimistic as ever about Replenish's future and we are excited to soon see developments like DeBolt further contribute to its success.

The main objective: to reduce the yield gap, which is currently around 36%. To this end, the company conducts trials in more than 200 locations in the country, which allow to better characterize its hybrids and know their behavior in different environments. In this way, it generates specific agronomic recommendations that are complemented with products to protect the crop throughout its life cycle. All this knowledge is transferred to the producer through digital tools such as FieldView and Bayer Expert, which facilitate planning and decision making in the field."]}, {"relevance_score": 17, "title": "National Public Television's All Access with Andy Garcia Features Kiss the Ground, Showcasing the Transformative Power of Regenerative Agriculture", "published": "2025-08-27", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">(GlobeNewswire) - The award-winning storytelling program, All Access with Andy Garcia, has chosen to feature Kiss the Ground, a leading nonprofit promoting regeneration and healthy soil as a viable solution for our wellness, water, and climate crisis.

In some cases, RA often also includes broader efforts to balance environmental, economic, and social welfare principles. The term regenerative in the context of agricultural practices first appeared in the early 1980s and was mainly associated with organic production practices. Regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices. ROA is often cited as building on RA practices and sometimes used interchangeably with RA. Since the mid-2010s, research and advocacy focused on RA and ROA have increased sharply.</p><p>Despite the growing popularity of RA and ROA labeling and marketing claims, neither term has been formally codified in either federal or state statutes or regulations. There also is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Regenerative farming principles have not been formally identified and are not enforceable under existing federal programs or certification standards subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite a lack of consensus about how to define regenerative and the absence of federal enforceable certification standards, several food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives.</p><p>Uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims about foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable product claims may create challenges for farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers. While there are no statutory, regulatory, or formal administrative definitions of RA and ROA, many of the soil-related practices incorporated into private sector initiatives are consistent with soil health principles recommended by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). These NRCS conservation practice standards often share with the organic agriculture sector the common goal of optimizing soil health but differ from USDA National Organic Program regulations and federal certification standards that prohibit certain practices and external inputs for products labeled organic (such as the use of certain synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). USDA has administered climate and carbon sequestration initiatives that share some practices and goals with private RA and ROA initiatives. Regardless of what practices are required under various private sector initiatives, federal labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, such as those under the authorities of FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, still apply.</p><p>Congress has debated regenerative farming and its potential role in improving soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure or achieving other goals. Congress has conducted hearings on RA, and some Members have introduced bills and resolutions involving RA and ROA, although few bills have attempted to define either term. In the 118th Congress, H.R. 598 would have identified 32 different farming conservation practices considered to be regenerative agricultural practices, or other practices as determined by the USDA Secretary. H.R. 9631 included a definition of regeneratively produced agricultural products and a definition of regeneratively-organically produced agricultural products based on USDA-certified organic production methods. In the 117th Congress, H.Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility.</p><p>\" H.Res. 1234 also</p><p>expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems.\" To date, Congress has not enacted legislation defining RA or ROA, and no introduced legislation has proposed to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims of foods labeled as regenerative or produced using regenerative agricultural practices.</p><p>Congress may continue to discuss a next farm bill, and whether to establish federal definitions of RA and/or ROA could be a topic of interest. Congress may consider whether to incorporate farming practices considered to be regenerative into existing USDA conservation standards and product marketing schemes and whether to establish a federal regulatory framework to oversee marketing claims for food products labeled as regenerative. The 119th Congress may also consider related legislative efforts, such as promotion of regenerative farming principles by the Make America Healthy Again congressional caucus, which has a stated goal of \"advancing regenerative and precision agriculture and environmental efforts.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents</p><p>Terms and Definitions ... 2</p><p>Absence of Uniform RA and ROA Definitions ... 2</p><p>Early Efforts to Define Regenerative Farming ... 4</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions ... 6</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism ... 8</p><p>Federal, State, and International Activities ... 10</p><p>Congressional Legislative Examples ... 10</p><p>State Government Example ... 11</p><p>International Examples ... 12</p><p>Private Sector Activities ... 13</p><p>Efforts to Substantiate Nonfederal Labeling Claims ... 13</p><p>Selected Industry Initiatives ... 14</p><p>Federal and Private Sector Shared Criteria ... 17</p><p>USDANRCS National Conservation Practice Standards ... 17</p><p>Climate and Carbon Sequestration Initiatives ... 19</p><p>USDA National Organic Program Standards ... 20</p><p>Federal Food Product Labeling Requirements ... 22</p><p>Considerations for Congress ... 24</p><p>Possible Farm Bill Reauthorization ... 24</p><p>Make America Healthy Again Efforts ... 25</p><p>Tables</p><p>Table 1.

Accordingly, regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) combines RA with organic production practices.</p><p>Among food manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, interest is increasing in RA and ROA as well as other related sustainable consumer product labeling and marketing claims. Some policymakers also have shown interest in regenerative farming as a way to potentially improve (i.e., regenerate) soil biodiversity, fertility, and structure, among other environmental and societal goals. For example, H.Res. 1234 (117th Congress) expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services.\" Congress has conducted hearings on RA, although few bills have attempted to define regenerative or promote the term's use. Some policymakers have expressed concern about efforts to advance RA, when related objectives (e.g., use of certain pesticides and chemicals in food production) could result in limited options for agricultural production practices./1</p><p>To date, RA and ROA have not been defined in statute, and regenerative farming principles are not enforceable under existing federal or state programs or policies. There also are no federal or state certification standards or rules for what can be defined as RA or ROA practices subject to oversight by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)./2</p><p>There also is no clear scientific definition of or agreement on the types of farming practices and product standards that might qualify as regenerative. This lack of consensus complicates the ability of food producers, manufacturers, and retailers to make certain labeling and marketing claims about food products. In contrast, the term organically produced agricultural product has a federally recognized and enforced statutory definition, and USDA administers an organic certification program./3</p><p>Food companies and retailers have adopted policies to label and market some food products as regenerative or as regenerative organic based on criteria developed under various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Definitions and marketing claims under these initiatives vary, depending on the food product sold and the specific goals and objectives of the group promoting the initiative. Some RA and ROA initiatives are broadly focused on certain minimally applied production practices, and others are highly prescriptive and specify wide-ranging and explicit practices intended to achieve certain production and environmental outcomes. Some initiatives include a wide range of social welfare outcomes, such as assurances of farmer profitability and minimum salaries and benefits for workers, promotion of locally sourced foods, and considerations of Indigenous agricultural practices and animal welfare protections. Aside from general labeling requirements and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, private sector efforts are not verifiable or enforceable by federal or state rules. Farmers, consumers, researchers, and policymakers may find it challenging to navigate uncertainty about what is meant by RA and ROA and how to interpret marketing claims on foods labeled as regenerative compared with other sustainable food product claims.</p><p>* * *</p><p>1 U.S. Congress, House Committee on Agriculture, Past Breakthroughs and Future Innovations in Crop Production, hearing, 119th Cong., 1st sess., July 22, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=\">https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=</url> 118519.</p><p>2 Since the start of the second Trump Administration, both the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have announced reorganization and restructuring plans.

In addition, there is no widely accepted consensus about how to define these terms. Currently, companies that label or market foods as regenerative are likely participating in various private sector (nongovernmental) initiatives. Foods labeled and marketed as regenerative under these initiatives are not certified or governed by any federal or state program, although some private sector initiatives may include regenerative practices and outcomes outlined in some federal programs and policies, such as standards and requirements comprising some USDA conservation and. organic certification programs, along with a focus on efforts to balance environmental, social, and economic principles. In addition, federal laws and regulations govern the labeling and marketing of food products to ensure foods sold in the United States are properly labeled and are not misbranded; however, current federal guidance does not specifically address \"regenerative\" food product labeling claims./5</p><p>USDA scientists note that RA \"seems to be defined differently by different people\" and that most definitions are \"based on the goal of regenerating soil\" and largely include practices that are \"in line with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)'s soil health principles\" and share a common goal with organic agriculture (i.e., optimizing soil health)./6</p><p>NRCS conservation practices include minimizing tillage, maximizing the amount of time roots are growing in soil, and adding organic amendments to soil (e.g., manures, crop and cover crop residues)./7</p><p>NRCS conservation practice standards are broadly applicable to most conventionally produced agriculture and may differ from those under USDA-certified organic agriculture regulations that prohibit certain practices and external inputs (such as the use of synthetic chemicals, sewage sludge, and biotechnology). Some researchers define RA according to NRCS principles: \"keeping soils continuously covered, minimizing soil disturbance, increasing biological diversity, keeping living roots in the soil, and integrating livestock\" to ensure soil health and carbon sequestration and reduce inputs while \"not sacrificing profitability.\"/8</p><p>* * *</p><p>4 See Sen.

In practice, they acknowledge that the regenerative label \"has been applied to nearly anything that improves farm outcomes and minimizes environmental impact.\"/9</p><p>This includes common agricultural and soil health practices intended to boost crop yields, mitigate production risks, improve soil conditions, increase input efficiency, reduce synthetic inputs, support new crop development, or enable new or alternative revenue streams (e.g., carbon credits or products marketed as organic or locally produced). The text box above illustrates some of the farming practices that may be considered to be regenerative.</p><p>ROA initiatives generally include RA farming practices (see text box above) as a base requirement that is supplemented by organic agricultural practices and standards. While some ROA initiatives require practices and standards under USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) regulations and federal certification process,/10 ROA initiatives, in most cases, reference practices associated with various private sector organic certification programs. Accordingly, ROA initiatives may include practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity, among other practices, including planting perennials, developing pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporating agroforestry systems, planting vegetative barriers, and implementing practices that may develop soil organic matter. The Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) notes that the leading regenerative practices cited by existing initiatives are reduced tillage, integration of livestock, use of cover crops and crop rotation systems, and low to no application of external inputs (such as chemicals and biotechnology). According to OFRF, current initiatives' leading desired outcomes include improved soil health and fertility, increased carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and improved water health and economic well-being of communities. OFRF claims that the aim of minimizing external inputs while maximizing ecological practices is captured in the principles of organic agriculture./11</p><p>Ambiguity about what is meant by RA and ROA has made it difficult to develop legislation on this topic and has raised concerns about potential misleading or deceptive claims related to the sustainability and environmental benefits of a product or practice claiming to be regenerative./12</p><p>Despite the lack of clarity, some food companies and retailers continue to incorporate sustainability and regenerative initiatives into their global supply chains.</p><p>* * *</p><p>9 Shane Thomas, \"If Every Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company, Then No Company Is a Regenerative Ag Company,\" Upstream Ag Insights, May 10, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340\">https://upstream.ag/p/if-every-company-is-a-regenerative-agcompany-then-no-company-is-a-regenerative-ag-company-4bcb8c340</url>.</p><p>10 The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 was enacted as part of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-624, Title XXI; 7 U.S.C.

Most researchers cite the Rodale Institute - a nonprofit organization that supports organic farming research, practices, and education - as among the first to formally coin the phrase \"regenerative agriculture\" in the early 1980s. Others cite earlier work by the National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) and other groups./13</p><p>Some acknowledge general contributions in the early 20th century by soil scientist George Washington Carver of Tuskegee University,/14 among other pioneers of sustainable, organic, and alternative agriculture./15</p><p>Overall, regenerative farming has become one among several terms used to describe farming systems that seek to balance agricultural production with environmental goals./16</p><p>The following definition of RA is attributed to Robert Rodale of the Rodale Institute in 1983:/17</p><p>'Regenerative agriculture is one that, at increasing levels of productivity, increases our land and soil biological production base. It has a high level of built-in economic and biological stability. It has minimal to no impact on the environment beyond the farm or field boundaries. It produces foodstuffs free from biocides. It provides for the productive contribution of increasingly large numbers of people during a transition to minimal reliance on non-renewable resources.'</p><p>Historically, the Rodale Institute promoted regenerative farming as creating a \"permanently sustainable system,\" mainly through the use of organic farming and \"nonmainstream\" farming methods./18</p><p>This included \"avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides\" in exchange for \"more natural fertilizers and totally biological approaches to insect control,\" as well as growing a mixture of annual and perennial wild plants instead of monocropping annual crops, thus reducing the need for tillage and weed control. Similarly, NACD's promotion of regenerative farming cited efforts to \"slow the advance of desertification and soil salinization, reduce the loss of prime farmlands and fragile topsoils,\" support wildlife habitats, and reduce waste and water contamination, as well as \"in general, make rural America a far more healthy, satisfying, and financially rewarding place to live.\"/19</p><p>The Rodale Institute also has advocated for adding \"regenerative components to the present [farming] system in a bit-by-bit way.\"/20</p><p>* * *</p><p>13 R.

Most current ROA-recommended practices tend to be associated with private organic certification programs rather than with federal NOP certification standards and policies. These private sector programs may include practices similar to those required under NOP (e.g., cover cropping, crop rotation, low- to no-till farming, composting, and reduced use of persistent chemical pesticides and fertilizers), but they often include additional practices related to soil health, animal welfare, and social equity. In private programs, soil health practices (such as the development of soil organic matter) may include, for example, the \"addition of perennials, development of pollinator and wildlife habitats, incorporation of agroforestry systems, [and] vegetative barriers,\" among other practices./21</p><p>In 1985, Rodale defined ROA as a practice that \"improves the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them\" and as a \"holistic systems approach to agriculture that encourages continual on-farm innovation for environmental, social, economic and spiritual wellbeing.\"/22 ROA was said to be distinct from sustainable agriculture since it \"takes advantage of the natural tendencies of ecosystems to regenerate when disturbed\"; is \"marked by tendencies towards closed nutrient loops, greater diversity in the biological community, fewer annuals and more perennials, and greater reliance on internal rather than external resources\"; and is \"aligned with forms of agroecology practiced by farmers concerned with food sovereignty the world over.\"/23</p><p>Unlike RA and ROA, sustainable agriculture is defined in statute for the purposes of USDA program implementation (see the text box below). Although this term is defined in statute, multiple interpretations of sustainability are used to market food products and there is limited federal guidance regarding sustainable food labeling and packaging claims.</p><p>Process-Based and Outcome-Based Definitions</p><p>While research and initiatives focused on RA and ROA have increased since the mid-2010s, the meaning of each term varies depending on the group defining, certifying, and promoting such product claims. How RA and ROA are defined has led to tension./24 In general, such definitions vary depending on whether labeling a product as regenerative is determined by the use of specific farming practices (i.e., process-based) or certain desired goals (i.e., outcome-based) or both./25</p><p>* * *</p><p>21 Regenerative Organic Alliance, \"Why RegenerativeOrganic?,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/\">https://regenorganic.org/why-regenerative-organic/</url>.</p><p>22 USDA's National Agricultural Library (NAL), oral history interview with Robert Rodale in 1989, available at Rodale Institute, \"Regenerative Organic Agriculture: Beyond Sustainable,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/</url>.</p><p>23 Rodale Institute, Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change, 2014, <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/wpcontent/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf</url>.</p><p>24 Janet Ranganathan et al., \"Regenerative Agriculture: Good for Soil Health, but Limited Potential to Mitigate Climate Change,\" World Resources Institute, May 12, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;\">https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soilhealth-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change;</url> David Bronner, \"Regenerative Agriculture: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" All-One Blog, Dr. Bronner's, March 11, 2024, <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;\">https://info.drbronner.com/all-one-blog/2024/03/regenerativeagriculture-good-bad-ugly/;</url> and Keith Paustian et al., Climate Mitigation Potential of Regenerative Agriculture Is Significant!, Regenerative Agriculture Foundation, June 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document\">https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document</url>.</p><p>25 See, for example, Peter Newton et al., \"What Is Regenerative Agriculture?

Regarding sustainable agriculture, USDA cites various \"proven practices,\" including climate resilience, soil health, livestock health and animal husbandry, community vitality, health and well-being of people, ecological pest management, biological diversity, and innovative technologies and enterprises.

Process-based RA (or ROA) definitions may explicitly exclude certain practices, such as those that negatively impact soil health and biodiversity as well as those that use synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, biotechnology, intensive tillage, monocropping, concentrated animal feeding systems, or soilless production systems (e.g., hydroponic and aquaponic). Overall, a process-based RA definition is based on an actual or perceived relationship between a process and a particular outcome./28</p><p>In contrast, examples of outcome-based RA definitions may include claims such as enhanced soil health (e.g., regarding structure, organic matter, and fertility); improved ecosystem function (e.g., water quality and pasture quality); increased biodiversity; carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; improved farm productivity (e.g., better crop yields and crop resilience) and profitability; reduced waste; improved human health (e.g., food safety, access, and nutritional quality); and improved animal health and welfare, among other social or community well-being benefits./29 In general, outcome-based RA is accepting of all of the processes that lead to a desired outcome; if the approach includes multiple outcomes, then any process used would have to contribute to (or at least not hinder) the accomplishment of all outcomes./30</p><p>Claimed Benefits and Criticism</p><p>Advocates of RA and ROA claim the benefits of implementing regenerative practices include improved soil quality and resilience, sequestration of carbon in soil, climate change mitigation, improved crop yields and ecosystem services, reduced runoff and subsequent soil and water resource degradation, minimized pesticide residues and exposure, reduced energy use, improved biodiversity conservation, and enhanced food security./31 In addition to environmental benefits, other research suggests possible benefits include enhanced food nutritional quality and improved human health as well as food availability and affordability if food is produced locally./32 Other research claims economic and social benefits, including improved farmer profitability from reduced input costs, risk mitigation, and higher output value; enhanced local food production; food security; and employment./33 Although regenerative farming is generally more labor-intensive than conventional farming, the labor costs might be offset by lower input costs elsewhere, such as reduced agrochemical and energy inputs and possible higher farm income.</p><p>* * *</p><p>28 Some studies have examined outcomes using combined (or stacked) practices based on different growing or geographic conditions.

The proposed definition is intended as \"continuous implementation of practices that over time minimize inputs and environmental impacts and further enhances the ecosystem while maintaining or improving productivity, economic contributions and community benefits.\" This approach is said to have been informed \"by the traditions and innovations from the original Indigenous stewards of the land.\" The definition is not intended for use in certification.</p><p>Source: CDFA, Staff Draft: Defining Regenerative Agriculture for State Policies and Programs.

Some earlier efforts encompassed objectives spanning ethics and fairness, resource protections, biodiversity, economic viability, rural and socioeconomic development, and social responsibility./43 Decades later, these topics continue to be debated. For example, sustainable and regenerative production were topics at the 2023 Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its subsidiary agreement, the Paris Agreement./44 Among other outcomes, COP28 identified a target related to food and food systems involving the need for \"implementation of integrated, multi-sectoral solutions, such as land use management, sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems\" and \"attain[ment of] climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increas[ed] sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition for all\" by the year 2030./45 The COP28 decision on the Paris Agreement's global goal on adaptation sets an identical 2030 target./46 Although RA has been said to be closely aligned with the UNSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that seek to \"promote sustainable agriculture\" (SDG-2),/47 the term is not explicitly referenced in the SDGs.</p><p>WTO's 1995 Agreement on Agriculture does not reference sustainable agriculture or RA but includes multiple references to agro-environmental issues.

Res. 1234 would have expressed \"support for regenerative agriculture and other conservation practices to support more sustainable and resilient agriculture, and compensating farmers for providing environmental services\" and resolved to \"support and fund programs that provide resources to agricultural scientists and other public interest scientists to work with farmers to identify innovations, the replicability of regenerative practices, and sustainable and resilient systems. H. Res. 1234 referred to RA as a \"system of farming and ranching principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches the soil, and purifies watersheds, all while increasing in-farm fertility. H. Res.", "3023 suggested that, at minimum, RA training would cover conservation practices that \"improve soil health, reduce production inputs, and regenerate soil, farmland, and nearby ecosystems,\" as well as organic and diversified practices (such as perennial cropping systems, agroforestry or silvopasture systems, livestock integration into cropping systems, and prescribed grazing) and practices that mitigate climate impacts and draw on \"traditional ecological knowledge\" from various producer groups.

Building off current ranch-level best practices, this initiative will provide new pathways and resources to help accelerate regenerative grazing for ranchers, like those who are invaluable to McDonald's U.S. supply chain. NFWF's selected partner organizations will work with ranchers to help improve grazing land management, protect and restore grasslands and other natural ecosystems, safeguard water, and upgrade ranch infrastructure such as fencing and water systems.<br/>\"The benefits of grassland conservation are far-reaching,\" said Jeff Trandahl, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer at NFWF. \"When cattle are managed to optimize multiple ecological and economic values, the land holds more water, grows better grass and supports more wildlife. Conservation practices voluntarily adopted by ranchers can improve the productivity of grasslands, increase ranching profitability and strengthen the vitality of rural communities across the United States.\"<br/>As part of this initiative, NFWF will manage and invest conservation funding to advance ranchers in their voluntary conservation efforts. NFWF is collaborating with its conservation partners across America's grasslands to identify impactful landscape-scale projects that will generate the greatest possible benefits to both wildlife populations and the productivity of vital U.S. ranch lands.

Today, McDonald's USA is announcing its participation in an initiative that helps demonstrate its continued commitment to responsible beef sourcing and stewardship of natural resources. McDonald's USA is excited to unveil its largest investment in regenerative agriculture to date with the launch of the Grassland Resilience and Conservation Initiative, along with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as well as key McDonald's U. S. suppliers. This initiative will invest more than $ 200 million over the next seven years to help promote and accelerate regenerative grazing practices, habitat restoration, water and wildlife conservation on cattle ranches spanning 4 million acres across up to 38 states.", "Through the Grassland Resilience and Conservation Initiative, participating ranchers will have the opportunity to leverage tools and resources to help them improve wildlife habitats, conserve water, and enhance soil health. McDonald's USA also believes that this initiative will help boost its U. S. supply chain resilience, including by providing participating ranchers economic returns such as incentive payments. Certain McDonald's USA suppliers, including Cargill, Golden State Foods, Lopez Foods, OSI and The Coca-Cola Company have elected to provide funds to NFWF alongside McDonald's USA. NFWF will independently award competitive grants to organizations that will assist participating ranchers in adopting practices that advance wildlife conservation and regenerative agriculture. As a brand that serves more than 90% of Americans every year, we recognize the responsibility we have to help safeguard our food systems for long-term vitality,' said Cesar Pina, Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, North America. 'Through our support of this initiative, McDonald's USA is demonstrating the power of partnership between the public and private sectors and that feeding the population and stewarding our natural resources can coexist. Many ranchers take pride in serving as stewards of the land, taking care of their communities to help create a better and brighter future. Building off current ranch-level best practices, this initiative will provide new pathways and resources to help accelerate regenerative grazing for ranchers, like those who are invaluable to McDonald's U.

It looks at the system as a whole, not individual pieces. Its aim is to let natural processes take the lead, with management decisions made to enhance or restore those processes. The use of external inputs, especially synthetic forms, are minimized or eliminated completely.</p><p>\u201cIt \u2019 s this very complex system of nature taking care of nature,\u201d said Jim.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is based on five key principles; keeping the soil covered, increasing diversity, minimizing soil disturbance, maintaining living roots and integrating livestock.</p><p>The Wests look to incorporate these principles in all their decisions.</p><p>From their rotational grazing system, diversity in crops and animals, use of chickens as pest control, and unique fertilizer, they are practicing what they preach.</p><p>Jim began researching regenerative agriculture in the early 2000s while still in military service with the Marine Corp.</p><p>He wanted to understand the chemistry and biology behind it.</p><p>Books, articles, podcasts, videos, he took in all the information he could find. He also began to make his own observations from his travels with the military.</p><p>Having been stationed around the world in places like the Philippines, Korea, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, the experiences piqued his curiosity. Having learned from each one, he was curious as to why certain things worked in some areas and not others.</p><p>\u201cI watched the land here \u2014 not just our place \u2014 because everybody who \u2019 s using land has a vision for what they want to do and I \u2019 m not going to fault their vision,\u201d said Jim. \u201cI think we can do ag a lot better in the US. I just thought, \u2018There \u2019 s got to be a better way. \u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a landowner to come in with plans for regenerative farming and soil health \u2014 is not very common,\u201d said NRCS Brady Resource Team Leader, Haden Keyser. \u201cWhen Jim and Stephen came to me with this idea, the research and knowledge they have on this system gives me hope they are going to be successful. \u201d</p><p>All in the family</p><p>The journey for Sunrise W Land and Cattle began after Jim retired from military service.</p><p>He was able to acquire his grandfather's 600-acre ranch to combine with property he already owned. The move not only honored his family's history but sparked a vision he and Stephen had for their own operation. They were also able to purchase another piece of property just a mile down the road.</p><p>With the land they wanted under their control, all that was left was to install the system they had envisioned.</p><p>Stephen's agricultural knowledge and expertise, coupled with Jim \u2019 s decades of experience and leadership, has created a synergy. This drives innovation and progress on every inch of the property.</p><p>Even the name of the ranch, Sunrise W, has meaning and purpose.</p><p>\u201cW of course, our last name is West,\u201d said Jim. \u201cThe arc on top \u2014 I taught my kids there \u2019 s five C \u2019 s to living a good life: candor, competence, compassion, courage, and core values. If you \u2019 ll notice, there \u2019 s five rays to the sun. And so that became our cattle brand. \u201d</p><p>They are quick to point out a silent partner that plays a significant role as well.</p><p>\u201cMom doesn \u2019 t come out too often. She still works a job in San Antonio,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cBut she \u2019 s our CFO. Everything runs through her. At the end of the day she keeps my dad and I grounded for sure. \u201d</p><p>NRCS Partnership in Restoring the Land</p><p>Initially on their own, the property was so heavily covered in mesquite, that the first two years were spent clearing portions of the land. The invasive brush was removed mechanically, stacked and the piles burned to give them a blank canvas to start from.</p><p>Looking for information about the flood prevention dam on the property, the Wests came to the NRCS office in Brady. The conversation soon turned to conservation and the plan they had in mind. From that starting point, the Wests have worked closely with NRCS.</p><p>Now, the focus is on improving their pastures.</p><p>The Wests have been able to implement conservation practices that complimented their regenerative program.</p><p>The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) has been the main source of NRCS program participation for the Wests.</p><p>EQIP offers technical and financial assistance for working agriculture lands. It helps farmers and ranchers maintain or improve production while conserving natural resources. NRCS works one-on-one with producers to develop a conservation plan that outlines practices and activities to solve on-farm resource issues. EQIP helps make conservation accessible.</p><p>For the Wests, this included practices such as fencing, water development, additional brush clearing and grass seeding. Through EQIP, they have been able to install infrastructure that allows their operation to run smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSo, the NRCS has been one, a great resource of knowledge, then also has been a great resource in getting these projects \u2014 on the ground,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cIt can be very labor intensive when it comes to having to move animals every single day and having the water for them as well. \u201d</p><p>The Wests utilize a management intensive grazing system. In this system, the cattle are concentrated on a small area for a short time. The goal of this system is better grazing utilization, encouraging livestock to eat everything within the grazing area. Livestock are moved often, most times daily. Adequate fencing and water sources make the process easier. The area is then left ungrazed for the remainder of the year, allowing it to rest before it is grazed again the next year.</p><p>NRCS has also been helpful with grass mixes and plantings.</p><p>Both for their regenerative system and grazing rotations, grass is vitally important. All five principles of regenerative agriculture can be tied back to grass, specifically it \u2019 s abundance and diversity. After brush removal and as a way of rejuvenating the soil, the Wests have experimented with many different seed mixes.</p><p>\u201cWe put together a list of seeds and ask what they think,\u201d said Jim. \u201cNRCS has been great in helping us get the right mix. \u201d</p><p>Outside the box</p><p>For regenerative agriculture systems that try and minimize outside inputs, especially synthetic products like insecticides and fertilizers, more natural options are preferred.</p><p>Following their regenerative goals, Jim and Stephen have incorporated practices that aren \u2019 t exactly traditional.</p><p>\u201cThe unique thing about this ranch is the incorporation of worm tea and chickens to help microorganisms and soil health,\u201d said NRCS Brady district conservationist Walt Broyles. \u201cYou typically do not see that on rangeland for our cattle operations. \u201d</p><p>Chickens provide many benefits to the Wests \u2019 program.</p><p>They utilize a mobile coop to house their chickens on pasture. It follows the cattle in rotation through the pastures, 2-3 days behind. The coop houses several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens.</p><p>The chickens fill multiple roles.</p><p>Manure is a natural fertilizer that benefits pasture grasses and is a resource that is abundant in livestock operations. This is especially the case in intensively managed systems like the Wests \u2019 that concentrate animals on smaller acres. The chickens scratch through the cattle manure, spreading it out and making the coverage more uniform. They also eat insects that are attracted to it. By following the cattle closely in rotation, the chickens take care of the insects before they become a problem. This is especially true of flies, which are a common problem for livestock producers.</p><p>They also provide a product that can be sold, eggs.</p><p>Being raised on pasture, input for production is lower and the eggs fetch a premium price being cage-free and organic.</p><p>Worm tea is a practice that is not common but shows promise as a fertilizer alternative.</p><p>Worms perform the important task of decomposition. As they process materials, they return important nutrients back to the soil and boost microbial activity. This in turn benefits other soil microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and protozoa. All of these parts and organisms combined form a healthy, fertile soil.</p><p>\u201cEarthworms are nature \u2019 s way of putting biology back into the soil,\u201d explains Jim, \u201cwhich is exactly what we want. \u201d</p><p>The Wests have taken this beneficial natural process and have adapted into making their own worm tea.Worm tea is made by taking the decomposed materials from worms, called worm castings, adding water, and allowing it to \u201cbrew\u201d. Though this is an oversimplification, the process allows the beneficial microorganisms to reproduce and form a natural liquid fertilizer that is readily absorbed by plants.</p><p>The Wests have a large bin of approximately 100,000 worms that they collect the castings from. The bin is filled with compost and mixed with a blend of grains that is food for the worms. They collect the castings once a week from the bottom of the flow-through bin. From there, the castings go into what the Wests call the brewer. It can best be described as a super-sized Keurig machine. The container is filled with water and aerated for 24 hours, allowing the microorganisms in the castings to multiply. The product at the end of the process is a nutrient and microorganism dense, all-natural fertilizer. They then spray the liquified worm tea onto their pastures.</p><p>\u201cWe have been accused of being odd,\u201d said Stephen with a chuckle.</p><p>All of these conservation measures, both traditional and new, combine to form a regenerative system that is benefitting both the land and the operation.</p><p>A Bright Future Ahead</p><p>Looking ahead, the Wests are hoping their approach can become a model others can learn from and replicate.</p><p>Jim and Stephen are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and experience with fellow landowners. They hold classes, participate in interviews, and create videos to educate and inspire others to embrace regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn \u2019 t trade it. You know, just seeing the difference,\u201d said Jim. \u201cMy ultimate goal is that whoever we deal with believes we \u2019 re providing more nutritious food and that we \u2019 re taking care of both them and the land and animals at the same time. And that \u2019 s really what drives me. \u201d</p><p>Keyser, who calls himself one of the Wests \u2019 biggest fans, is excited to see how their land responds.</p><p>\u201cThey want people to come up to their fence and ask, \u2018What are you doing over there? \u2019 and find success so they can share what they \u2019 re doing. They \u2019 re not afraid to work \u2014 and they believe in this,\u201d said Keyser.</p><p>Broyles, too, admires the Wests \u2019 out-of-the-box approach. \u201cThese systems they have here\u2014it \u2019 s how hard do you want to work? It \u2019 s a daily basis. \u201d</p><p>For the NRCS, \u201cHelping people help the land\u201d is the motto that we strive to achieve with every producer and conservation plan we implement. The Wests and their work helps tie real life experiences and meaning to the words of an organization dedicated to preserving it.</p>", "publisher": "Impact News Service", "instances": ["Jim, a retired Marine and patriarch of the family, and Stephen, with a college degree in agriculture, enjoy pushing the boundaries of traditional farming practices.

With the global shift toward regenerative farming gaining momentum, Replenish is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on rising demand for environmentally friendly nutrient solutions.

Of the 50 companies, FAIRR's study found that 18 (36%) quantified company-wide RA targets; 8 (16%) discussed RA metrics and data; 4 (8%) set baselines to measure progress; and 4 (8%) set targets to financially support farmers in deploying regenerative practices. Other studies corroborate that most labeling schemes do not tend to monitor or evaluate the environmental and social benefits of their programs; others note the need for more and higher-quality information given the proliferation of labels and the potential to confuse consumers./54 These types of findings have caused some to question whether the food industry's adoption of RA and other related sustainability practices has generated expected environmental and societal benefits./55</p><p>Definitions vary among different producer groups. For example, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) has called for RA to be \"defined as any production system that minimizes environmental impacts, maximizes production and increases the productivity of soil over time.\"/56 AFBF's broader policy goals related to sustainability, which include RA, focus on the ability of U.S. farmers and ranchers to lead on \"climate-smart practices that reduce emissions, enrich the soil and protect our water and air, all while producing more food, fiber and renewable fuel\" through \"voluntary, market-driven programs.\"/57 Field to Market, an agricultural membership organization, similarly addresses both agricultural sustainability and regeneration by promoting a systems-based approach that \"sequesters carbon in the soil and intentionally improves soil health, biodiversity, water quality and air quality while ensuring the viability of farm production.\"/58 The International Fresh Produce Association (IFPA) defines RA \"as a suite of sustainable farming practices that are holistic and outcome-based, improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, optimizing water use, and building climate resilience,\" including \"practices such as minimal soil disturbance, cover cropping, diverse crop rotations, and integrated pest and nutrient management,\" and supports \"voluntary and incentive-based transitions to and scaling of RA.\"/59</p><p>Selected Industry Initiatives</p><p>To facilitate the food industry's RA adoption, a network of food companies - including Nestle, Danone, Unilever, and PepsiCo - released a global framework in 2023 on how to help businesses implement regenerative practices. As defined by the group, RA refers to \"an outcome-based farming approach that protects and improves soil health, biodiversity, climate, and water resources while supporting farming business development.\"/60 The framework covers four impact areas - water, soil, biodiversity, and climate - and recommends actions such as conducting risk screening assessments, selecting and measuring outcomes, adopting RA-related principles and practices, and monitoring and assessing progress. In 2020, a different private sector agribusiness task force composed of financial institutions, food manufacturers, and farmer organizations - including Bayer AG, McCain Foods, McDonald's Corporation, Mondelez International Inc., and PepsiCo - released an action plan to accelerate the adoption of regenerative farming.</p><p>* * *</p><p>52 See, for example, R.

For example, ADM's RA initiative is based on five land management principles: (1) minimizing soil disturbance; (2) maintaining living roots in soil; (3) continuously covering bare soil; (4) maximizing diversity with an emphasis on crops, soil microbes, and pollinators; and (5) responsibly managing inputs, including nutrients and pesticides./62 Cargill's initiative supports farmers who adopt \"regenerative soil health practices,\" such as planting cover crops, reducing tillage, optimizing nutrients, managing grazing, and implementing agroforestry practices./63 The General Mills (GM) initiative is part of its broader effort to reduce GHG emissions and address water resources in priority watersheds, among other projects that deliver \"positive environmental, social and economic outcomes.\"/64 GM's practices include minimizing soil disturbance and promoting soil health (e.g., by planting cover crops and reducing tillage); improving water quality (e.g., through water management and infiltration); promoting biodiversity (e.g., wildlife and beneficial organisms); restoring ecosystems and forests (e.g., through nutrient cycling, water infiltration, and pest suppression); and promoting adaptive grazing and livestock feed management.</p><p>Some food companies work directly with food retailers (Walmart and Whole Foods Market, for example) that have adopted regenerative initiatives as a way to market foods they sell. Walmart's RA initiative requires producers to follow certain production principles, including soil and nutrient management (e.g., through planting cover crops and implementing conservation tillage, crop rotation, and nutrient management systems); pest management (e.g., implementing integrated pest management or planting diverse flowering native or naturalized plants); and water and land management and priority area protection (e.g., abstaining from using recently converted land and placing land in an agriculture conservation easement to protect, restore, and enhance wetlands, grasslands, and forests)./65 Whole Foods Market's initiative requires foods to be produced using practices that improve soil health through improved biodiversity, minimize soil disturbance, maintain a living root system year-round, maximize soil cover to protect against erosion and improve water retention, and integrate strategic rotational grazing and other animal management practices to improve soil fertility through increased microbial density and organic matter (i.e., animal manure)./66</p><p>* * *</p><p>61 Sustainable Markets Initiative, Agribusiness Task Force, Scaling Regenerative Farming: Levers for Implementation, December 2023, accessible through <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sustainable-markets.org/taskforces/agribusiness-task-force/\">https://www.sustainable-markets.org/taskforces/agribusiness-task-force/</url>.</p><p>62 ADM, \"Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture/\">https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture/</url>.</p><p>63 Cargill, \"Cargill RegenConnect(R),\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenconnect.cargill.com/;\">https://regenconnect.cargill.com/;</url> and Cargill, \"Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture\">https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture</url>.</p><p>64 General Mills, \"Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.generalmills.com/how-we-make-it/healthier-planet/environmental-impact/regenerative-agriculture\">https://www.generalmills.com/how-we-make-it/healthier-planet/environmental-impact/regenerative-agriculture</url>.</p><p>65 Walmart, \"Walmart Policies and Guidelines: Sustainable Row Crop Position Statement - Sustainable Products at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S.,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#sustainable-row-crop-position-statement\">https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#sustainable-row-crop-position-statement</url>.</p><p>66 Whole Foods Market, \"Our Commitment to Regenerative Agriculture,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-in-action/environmental-stewardship/regenerative-agriculture\">https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-in-action/environmental-stewardship/regenerative-agriculture</url>.

In addition to the programs discussed here, there are numerous private RA and ROA certification programs worldwide./67</p><p>These types of food labeling initiatives represent a subset of food labeling and packaging claims spanning a wide range of product attributes for foods, which are often referred to as food process labels. They are used by marketers to distinguish and create a unique brand for their products with the goal of increasing sales and company profits./68 Process labels usually cover a range of attributes (e.g., the types of practices and ingredients used to produce a product) but may also include certain environmental or societal objectives and certain seals of approval. Examples of product attributes include those attesting to a product's food safety, quality, freshness date, nutrition, or cleanliness, as well as natural, healthy, organic, fair trade, sustainable, kosher, halal, humane animal treatment, bee- or bird-safe, local, and carbon offsetting claims, among other \"free-of\" claims (e.g., biotechnology-free, cage-free, free-range, and dolphin-free)./69 Some researchers have raised concerns about the extent and scale of such food labeling claims./70</p><p>Attributes used to market products that meet specific environmental performance criteria are also referred to as \"ecolabels,\" covering both food and non-food products./71 Ecolabels may be owned or managed by government agencies, but most U.S. food and beverage ecolabeling and certification schemes are voluntary and initiated by private industry, food retailers, and nongovernmental organizations. Compliance with voluntary labeling claims or certification standards may often be self-enforced by the producer or may be verified by the organization to which the producer belongs or by an independent third party. Such product labels and certifications are generally not subject to direct federal or state regulation or oversight unless a product is found to violate food safety laws or other general container or packaging requirements intended to facilitate interstate or international commerce./72</p><p>* * *</p><p>67 Certifiers include but are not limited to Certified Regenerative by A Greener World (see A Greener World, \"A Greener World Collaborates with Whole Foods Market to Validate Regenerative Claims,\" press release, February 12, 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://agreenerworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Whole-Food-Market-Certified-Regenerative-by-AGWpress-release-FINAL.pdf);\">https://agreenerworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Whole-Food-Market-Certified-Regenerative-by-AGWpress-release-FINAL.pdf);</url> FoodChain ID, \"Regenerative Agriculture Standard,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodchainid.com/certification/sustainability/regenerative-farming/;\">https://www.foodchainid.com/certification/sustainability/regenerative-farming/;</url> Regenified, <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenified.com/;\">https://regenified.com/;</url> Ecological Outcome Verified (see Land to Market, \"Ecological Outcome Verification(TM),\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.landtomarket.com/eov\">https://www.landtomarket.com/eov</url>); Regenerative Organic Certified (see Rodale Institute, \"Regenerative Organic Certified(R),\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/regenerative-organiccertification/);\">https://rodaleinstitute.org/regenerative-organiccertification/);</url> Real Organic Project (ROP) (see ROP, Real Organic Project Standards, <url normalizedValue=\"https://realorganicproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ROPStandards_Final.pdf);\">https://realorganicproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ROPStandards_Final.pdf);</url> and Certified Naturally Grown, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.naturallygrown.org/\">https://www.naturallygrown.org/</url>, among others such as Demeter, Regeneration International, Naturland, and Bioland.</p><p>68 Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), \"Process Labeling of Food,\" October 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cast-science.org/publication/process-labeling-of-food-consumer-behavior-the-agricultural-sector-and-policyrecommendations/;\">https://cast-science.org/publication/process-labeling-of-food-consumer-behavior-the-agricultural-sector-and-policyrecommendations/;</url> and Elise Golan et al., Economics of Food Labeling, AER-793, USDA ERS, January 2001, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=41204\">https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=41204</url>.</p><p>69 Tufts University, Decoding Food Labels, August 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"https://sustainability.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/DecodingFood-Labels.pdf;\">https://sustainability.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/DecodingFood-Labels.pdf;</url> and CRS In Focus IF10650, Understanding Process Labels and Certification for Foods.</p><p>70 Center for Science in the Public Interest, Food Labeling Chaos, 2010, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cspinet.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/resource/food_labeling_chaos_report.pdf;\">https://www.cspinet.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/resource/food_labeling_chaos_report.pdf;</url> and Jason Czarnezki et al., \"Creating Order Amidst Food Eco-Label Chaos,\" Duke University, 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1314&amp;context=delpf\">https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1314&amp;context=delpf</url>.</p><p>71 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines ecolabels as marks placed on product packaging intended to help consumers and institutional purchasers identify those products that meet specific environmental performance criteria and are therefore deemed \"environmentally preferable\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts/introductionecolabels-and-standards-greener-products\">https://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts/introductionecolabels-and-standards-greener-products</url>).

Most private sector RA initiatives broadly reference agricultural practices and standards similar to USDA's national conservation practice standards developed and maintained by NRCS. Some private sector ROA initiatives broadly share some of the practices and standards under USDA's NOP. Various federal laws and regulations govern the labeling and marketing of food products to ensure foods sold in the United States are properly labeled and not misbranded.</p><p>Although there are no statutory, regulatory, or formal administrative definitions of RA and ROA, many of the soil health practices incorporated into most private sector initiatives are consistent with NRCS soil health principles. NRCS conservation practice standards and the organic agriculture sector often share the common goal of optimizing soil health. However, the full suite of approved NRCS conservation practice standards include activities that may be prohibited under USDA-certified NOP regulatory standards. Regardless of what regenerative farming practices are required under various private sector initiatives, federal labeling requirements, such as those under the authorities of FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), still apply.</p><p>USDANRCS National Conservation Practice Standards</p><p>A conservation practice standard describes when, where, and why a practice is applied, as well as the minimum planning criteria required in order to achieve the desired environmental improvement./74 Standards are developed by NRCS at a national level and then tailored to state- and local-specific requirements based on resource conditions and laws that may be more restrictive than national criteria./75 NRCS maintains close to 200 national conservation practice standards./76 These practice standards are based on scientific research and are reviewed and updated on a five-year cycle or earlier based on scientific and technological advancements. New and revised standards are available for public comment through the Federal Register.</p><p>Conservation practice standards are used by NRCS when providing technical assistance to individual farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners to address natural resource concerns on their operations. NRCS provides free technical assistance through field offices in nearly every U.S. county and territory./77 Technical assistance generally results in a conservation plan that includes specific conservation practices that, if applied according to the standard, would address or improve natural resources on the operation. Table 1 includes selected examples of national NRCS conservation practices for crops, providing a generic description of the practice.</p><p>* * *</p><p>73 For example, ISO, Online Browsing Platform, \"ISO 14020:2022(en) Environmental Statements and Programmes for Products - Principles and General Requirements,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:14020:ed-3:v1:en\">https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:14020:ed-3:v1:en</url>.</p><p>74 USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), \"Conservation Practice Standards Information,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/getting-assistance/conservation-practices\">https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/getting-assistance/conservation-practices</url>.</p><p>75 The technical guides, developed by NRCS and published at a geographically specific level, are known as Field Office Technical Guides (FOTGs).

The table is limited to crop-related practices. Livestock- and forestry-related practices are also included at the NRCS website cited above. The conservation practice code refers to practices eligible for financial assistance under NRCS's Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Groups of practices (\"bundles\") and enhanced conservation practices (\"enhancements\") are eligible for financial assistance under NRCS's Conservation Stewardship Program. Bundles and enhancements have different codes and may be found at USDA, NRCS, \"CSP Enhancement and Bundles,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives/csp-conservation-stewardship-program/csp-enhancements-andbundles\">https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives/csp-conservation-stewardship-program/csp-enhancements-andbundles</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Some but not all private sector RA and ROA initiatives explicitly reference USDA conservation practice standards, and most private sector initiatives broadly reference conservation practices without directly referencing NRCS standards or specific requirements./78 While many of the NRCS practice standards may meet the goals of RA and ROA, the specifics of how the practice is implemented may not. For example, as shown in Table 1, NRCS conservation practices highlight recommendations involving a series of conventional no-till and reduced till practices, which are widely considered regenerative practices. Some have questioned whether no-till and reduced tillage practices could result in the need for increased pesticide and synthetic fertilizer applications that may harm soil health and public safety; others dispute such ideas./79</p><p>Following the development of a conservation plan, an agricultural producer may choose to apply for federal financial assistance to offset the cost of implementing the plan and prescribed practices. Federal conservation programs are voluntary and typically cover a portion of the cost to implement an approved conservation plan and related practices./80 As such, implementation of NRCS conservation practices is voluntary. If financial assistance is provided through a federal conservation program, then, in accordance with a contract, the producer agrees to implement approved conservation practices according to the NRCS standards. NRCS will certify successful completion of the practices under contract, according to the standards, before making payments. Program participants are obligated to maintain conservation practices for the life of the practice.</p><p>Climate and Carbon Sequestration Initiatives</p><p>Some have identified improved soil health and carbon sequestration as potential benefits of RA and ROA agricultural practices that could help mitigate agricultural GHG emissions and make food systems more resilient./81 The United States does not have a singular policy to mitigate agricultural GHG emissions, although some individual programs and policies could contribute to such goal. In general, U.S. agricultural policies that address climate change and GHG mitigation promote voluntary and incentive-based actions rather than mandatory or regulatory approaches. Policy approaches have included investing in climate-related research, including mitigation and adaptation, as well as USDA conservation and technical assistance programs that may work to reduce agricultural GHG emissions, increase carbon dioxide removals from the atmosphere, sequester carbon, and adjust to weather variability. USDA's Climate Change Adaptation Plan, issued in 2022 under the Biden Administration, outlined how USDA is taking steps to manage risks and integrate consideration of climate adaptation and resilience into its policies and programs but did not directly reference RA or ROA./82</p><p>* * *</p><p>78 See, for example, A Greener World, \"Certified Regenerative by AGW Standards,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/certified-regenerative/certified-regenerative-standards/;\">https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/certified-regenerative/certified-regenerative-standards/;</url> and Regenified, \"Regenified's 6-3-4 Verification Standard,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://regenified.com/about-us/#verification-standard-container\">https://regenified.com/about-us/#verification-standard-container</url>.</p><p>79 See, for example, Friends of the Earth, Rethinking No-Till: The Toxic Impact of Conventional No-Till Agriculture on Soil, Biodiversity, and Human Health, April 2025, <url normalizedValue=\"https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Report_NoTill_Report.pdf\">https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Report_NoTill_Report.pdf</url>.

Congress has since repealed and reallocated IRA funding for federal conservation programs to similar conservation programs but without the requirement that funds be used for climate change specific practices./83 USDA created climate-focused initiatives, such as the Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities (PCSC) under the Biden Administration, which was renamed the Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP) initiative under the second Trump Administration./84 The PCSC/AMP initiative financed partnerships that supported the production and marketing of \"climate-smart commodities.\" Climate-smart commodities refers to agricultural (farm, livestock, and forestry) commodities produced using a subset of NRCS conservation practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon./85 USDA also has funded research efforts related to climate change and carbon sequestration through its research mission area agencies./86 Research initiatives have included activities such as the USDA Climate Hubs, which deliver geographically specific research to agricultural producers and professionals./87 In addition, the following text box describes USDA's implementation of the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which was enacted as part of the FY2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act (FY2023 appropriations; P.L. 117-328, Division HH).

For example, Regenerative Organic Certified requires USDA-certified organic as base certification plus additional soil health, animal welfare, and social welfare requirements (often referred to as USDA Organic Plus). Under such ROA initiatives, other requirements outside NOP may include, but are not limited to, animal welfare protections; development of pollinator and wildlife habitats; incorporation of agroforestry systems and vegetative barriers; promotion of locally sourced foods; considerations of Indigenous agricultural practices; and social equity considerations, such as farmer and farmworker protections./95 There is limited information comparing NOP requirements with those of private certification programs.</p><p>There is debate about whether USDA-certified organic foods provide additional benefits to the environment and consumers compared with conventionally produced foods. USDA's National Agricultural Library (NAL) examined scientific literature to study whether organically produced foods might be more nutritious (i.e., contain more vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients), more environmentally friendly (i.e., have fewer negative impacts on soil resources, water quality, energy consumption, and climate change), or safer (i.e., contain fewer pesticides or antibiotic and hormone residues) compared with conventionally produced foods./96 Based on its examination of peer-reviewed literature in 2008, NAL concluded there was evidence that organically produced foods, in general, may convey benefits to the environment and may contain fewer chemical residues compared with conventionally produced foods./97 NAL was not able to conclude that organically produced foods were more nutritious than conventionally produced foods,/98 and subsequent research has not definitively settled this question./99</p><p>Federal Food Product Labeling Requirements</p><p>Most RA and ROA initiatives and proposals administer private label certification schemes that specify a food product's adherence to the initiative's regeneration goals. These private labeling requirements are in addition to existing general federal labeling requirements.</p><p>FDA and FTC share responsibility for regulating food labeling and advertising./100</p><p>* * *</p><p>95 Some specific examples include requiring that animals have access to outdoors and natural daylight and ensuring a diverse workforce and worker protections.</p><p>96 Mary Gold, \"Should I Purchase Organic Foods?,\" USDA, NAL, October 2008, archived at <url normalizedValue=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220351/http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/faq/BuyOrganicFoodsIntro.shtml\">https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220351/http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/faq/BuyOrganicFoodsIntro.shtml</url> (hereinafter Gold, \"Should I Purchase Organic Foods?\").</p><p>97 See \"Part D (Are organic foods more environmentally friendly than non-organic foods?)\" and \"Part C (Are there fewer pesticide residues on organic foods than on conventionally grown foods?),\" in Gold, \"Should I Purchase Organic Foods?.\" 98 See \"Part B (Does organically-grown food contain more or better nutrients),\" in Gold, \"Should I Purchase Organic Foods?.\"</p><p>99 See, for example, Vanessa Vigar et al., \"A Systematic Review of Organic Versus Conventional Food Consumption: Is There a Measurable Benefit on Human Health,\" Nutrients, vol. 12, no. 3 (March 2020), <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fnu12010007\">https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fnu12010007</url>; and Crystal Smith-Spangler et al., \"Are Organic Foods Safer or Healthier Than Conventional Alternatives?,\" A Systematic Review, Annals of Internal Medicine, vol. 157. no. 5 (September 4, 2012), <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-157-5-201209040-00007\">https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-157-5-201209040-00007</url>.</p><p>100 Federal Trade Commission (FTC), \"Memorandum of Understanding Between the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration,\" May 1971, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cooperation-agreements/memorandum-understanding-between-federal-trade-commission-food-drug-administration\">https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cooperation-agreements/memorandum-understanding-between-federal-trade-commission-food-drug-administration</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Pursuant to a formal agreement between the two agencies, FDA regulates food labeling and packaging, and FTC regulates food advertising./101 Laws and regulations governing the labeling and marketing of food products under FDA's jurisdiction include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). FFDCA (21 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.301 et seq.) regulates food labeling, ensuring foods (including dietary supplements) sold in the United States are safe, properly labeled, and include accurate nutrition information./102 FFDCA prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded foods and dietary supplements, including foods bearing labels that contain a false or misleading claim./103 FDA therefore could take action against any RA or ROA claim that is found to be false or misleading, but FDA does not define RA or ROA and does not provide any guidance on how to make such claims in a manner that is not false or misleading. FDA's implementing regulations set out the general requirements that apply to all food labels, which include a statement of identity, the net quantity, a list of ingredients, nutrition labeling, and any required allergen labeling./104 Under FDA laws and regulations, FDA is not required to preapprove labels for food products. FPLA (15 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.1451-1461; 16 C.F.R. Part 500) directs FDA and FTC to require that all consumer commodities be labeled to disclose net contents, identity of the commodity, and the name and place of business of the product's manufacturer, packer, or distributor in order to prevent consumer deception.</p><p>Other FTC authorities prohibit unlawful, \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\" (Sec.5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act; 15 U.S.C. Sec.45(a))./105 Under this authority, FTC prohibits \"any false advertisement\" with regard to food products that is \"misleading in any respect.\"/106 FTC thus could take action against a misleading RA or ROA claim used in food advertising. FTC, however, generally does not take action against a marketing claim that complies with FDA regulations because FTC has \"traditionally accorded great weight to FDA's scientific determinations in matters of nutrition and health.\"/107 It is unclear if FTC would similarly defer to FDA's judgment regarding RA and ROA claims that are found to be false or misleading.</p><p>* * *</p><p>101 While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the labeling of most food products, USDA regulates the labeling of certain meat, poultry, and egg products.

NLEA requires that most foods bear nutrition labeling and that food labels bearing nutrient content claims and certain health messages comply with specific requirements.</p><p>103 21 U.S.C.

Green Guides do not address RA or ROA claims, but some groups have asked FTC to address these in any future updates to the guides./109 The most recent revision to date, in 2012, did not address claims such as sustainable, natural, and organic.</p><p>Considerations for Congress</p><p>Possible Farm Bill Reauthorization</p><p>Congress may continue to consider a new farm bill, and whether to incorporate regenerative farming practices into various U.S. federal policies may be of interest. In the 118th Congress, farm bill legislation introduced by leadership in the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture - H.R. 8467, as ordered to be reported, and S. 5335, respectively - would have reauthorized existing USDA conservation and organic programs but did not propose expanding these programs to include RA or ROA principles./110</p><p>Regenerate America - a U.S. coalition promoting RA to rebuild America's soil - has recommended changes to farm bill legislation to direct conservation funding to support soil health and transition to RA, prioritize soil health in USDA research and education programs, amend USDA farm loan and crop insurance programs to address investment in soil health management systems, and support infrastructure and processing throughout the marketing supply chain./111 The Natural Resources Defense Council also has recommended establishing a \"transition program to fund comprehensive investments in regenerative and certified organic agriculture\" to incentivize regenerative stewardship and create \"market and operational capacity for regenerative growers\" and fund RA research and extension./112 The World Economic Forum has recommended supporting sustainable farming through a \"flexible stack of financial and nonfinancial services,\" such as loans and crop insurance; upfront payments or guarantees to offset transition costs; and technical assistance, data services, and access to equipment and inputs./113</p><p>* * *</p><p>108 16 C.F.R.

Of the 50 companies, FAIRR's study found that 18 (36%) quantified company-wide RA targets; 8 (16%) discussed RA metrics and data; 4 (8%) set baselines to measure progress; and 4 (8%) set targets to financially support farmers in deploying regenerative practices. Other studies corroborate that most labeling schemes do not tend to monitor or evaluate the environmental and social benefits of their programs; others note the need for more and higher-quality information given the proliferation of labels and the potential to confuse consumers. /54 These types of findings have caused some to question whether the food industry's adoption of RA and other related sustainability practices has generated expected environmental and societal benefits.", "18, no. 1 (2015), pp. 17-49, https://cdn. wildapricot. com/196137/resources/Documents/v18i1/Ross-Pandey-Ross. pdf; and Lillianna Byington, \"Big Food Turns to Regenerative Agriculture to Meet Sustainability Goals,\" Food Dive, May 2019, https://www. fooddive. com/news/big-food-turns-to-regenerative-agriculture-to-meet-sustainability-goals/552804/.

In addition, Key Carbon's subsidiary, EU Soil Carbon Corp, will fund the expansion of InSoil's carbon farming business, which provides farmers with further technical and financial support in implementing regenerative practices.\"As farmers across Europe face headwinds from climate change and global regulatory dynamics, financial and agronomic support from projects like these are critical to achieving the systemic shifts that achieve real impact in carbon sequestration and a more resilient food system that doesn't leave the stewards of our lands in the dust,\" said Laimonas Noreika, CEO of InSoil. \"Through this agreement with Key Carbon, we will be able to reach more farmers, accelerate climate-positive outcomes, and deliver the kind of high-integrity credits the carbon market increasingly demands. As institutional interest in nature-based solutions continues to grow, our work with Key Carbon will represent a model for blending sustainable finance with climate impact, and turning soil into both a climate solution and a revenue stream for European farmers.\"Luke Leslie, CEO of Key Carbon, said: \"Corporate appetite for carbon credits is increasingly shifting towards high-integrity, removal-based and localised solutions to meet the evolving compliance standards. Our partnership with InSoil will provide increased access to funding for farmers, enabling the transition to regenerative agriculture and growing Key Carbon's supply of high-quality carbon credits. With its deep agronomic expertise and strong local networks, InSoil is uniquely positioned to deliver meaningful environmental outcomes and ensure the integrity of carbon credit generation.

In a royalty agreement, InSoil has received a \u20ac3. 7 million investment from Key Carbon to scale its operations across one million hectares of European farmland by 2026, enabling the sequestration of over 35 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This milestone marks InSoil's (formerly HeavyFinance) largest funding to date and is one of Europe's largest financial commitments to climate-resilient farming practices. VILNIUS, Lithuania and VANCOUVER, BC, June 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -InSoil, a climate finance company, andKey Carbon, a leading financier within the voluntary carbon market, have entered into a \u20ac100 million agreement to enable climate-critical transitions to regenerative agriculture across one million hectares of European farmland. The multi-year partnership, InSoil's largest raise to date and one of Europe's largest financial commitments to climate-resilient farming, grants Key Carbon royalty rights to InSoil'sGreen Loansfinancing model, which offers zero-interest loans to farmers adopting regenerative agricultural practices in return for a fixed share of carbon credits. In addition, Key Carbon's subsidiary, EU Soil Carbon Corp, will fund the expansion of InSoil's carbon farming business, which provides farmers with further technical and financial support in implementing regenerative practices. As farmers across Europe face headwinds from climate change and global regulatory dynamics, financial and agronomic support from projects like these are critical to achieving the systemic shifts that achieve real impact in carbon sequestration and a more resilient food system that doesn't leave the stewards of our lands in the dust,\" said Laimonas Noreika, CEO of InSoil. \"Through this agreement with Key Carbon, we will be able to reach more farmers, accelerate climate-positive outcomes, and deliver the kind of high-integrity credits the carbon market increasingly demands.

The 20 organizations are: the Platform for Agriculture and Climate Transformation, Transformational Investing in Food Systems (TIFS), Practical Farmers of Iowa, Minnesota Farmers Union, Walton Family Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, University of Minnesota Forever Green Initiative, Funders for Regenerative Agriculture, Zero Foodprint, Healing Soils Foundation, Environmental Defense Fund, Food System 6, CREO, Fractal Agriculture, Zell Family Office, McKnight Foundation, Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, Desert Bloom, PepsiCo, and Potlikker Capital. Capital is flowing into regenerative agriculture, but it's often fragmented and uncoordinated,\" said Ivana Gazibara, the TransCap Initiative's Director of Prototyping. \"The capital orchestrator is a shared platform to move from one-off solutions to coordinated investment portfolios that reflect the complexity and ambition of the agricultural transition we need. Agriculture and business both need to be sustainable to be successful in the long run,\" said Morgan Snyder, Senior Program Officer, Walton Family Foundation. \"We're proud to support this effort to design a financial architecture that's shaped by the people who know the land, the communities, and the challenges firsthand. Regenerative agriculture isn't just good for the soil it's good business,\" said Anne Schwagerl, Vice President at Minnesota Farmers Union. \"Done right, it can build a thriving, resilient, and profitable agricultural economy that benefits farmers, rural communities, and the environment.", "The 20 organizations are: the Platform for Agriculture and Climate Transformation, Transformational Investing in Food Systems (TIFS), Practical Farmers of Iowa, Minnesota Farmers Union, Walton Family Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, University of Minnesota Forever Green Initiative, Funders for Regenerative Agriculture, Zero Foodprint, Healing Soils Foundation, Environmental Defense Fund, Food System 6, CREO, Fractal Agriculture, Zell Family Office, McKnight Foundation, Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, Desert Bloom, PepsiCo, and Potlikker Capital.

New technology also helps conserve water and reduce livestock methane gas emissions. According to an October 2024 Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities report, more than 21,000 enrolled farm producers and operations of all sizes voluntarily implement climate-smart production practices. These include conservation tillage, soil carbon amendment, growing cover crops and prescribed grazing. Affected commodities include fruits, vegetables, grains, livestock, hemp and timber. Funds are paid out over the five-year lifespans of the projects. Modeling success The Heifer Ranch Center for Regenerative Agriculture in Perryville, Ark., is a recognized model for how regenerative agriculture farming principles and practices can successfully heal the environment while producing at scale. The 1,200-acre ranch is an accredited Savory Global Network Hub with the Savory Institute, the world's largest and longest-operating grassland rehabilitation organization. Recently, Heifer Ranch also received certification from the Audubon Ranching Conservation Ranching Program. It monitors and recognizes ranches that regenerate grasslands, which provide healthy habitat for declining bird species. \"The center's focus is to train farmers and food system actors how to incorporate regenerative principles to manage the complexity of working with nature towards ecosystem health,\" says Director of Regeneration Donna Kilpatrick, who oversees all of Heifer Ranch's agricultural operations. In addition, \"Our mission is increased biodiversity, farmer profitability and farmer quality of life.\" This year, Heifer Ranch will host day-long and multiday training programs for farmers and those interested in regenerative food systems. The in-depth sessions are taught by staff experts and guest instructors who are leaders in their respective fields. Also, the ranch's free, instructional YouTube videos reach a worldwide audience. Its curriculum covers a variety of topics including holistic livestock and grazing management; sheep and poultry production; regenerative land management; and beekeeping. Because transitioning from conventional farming methods - often implemented for generations - can seem overwhelming, Kilpatrick recommends implementing one or two regenerative agriculture principles to start. Another tip: \"Find a community of other regenerative farmers to connect with for peer-to-peer learning, idea sharing and support,\" she says. Suzanne Hunt is co-owner of her family's seventh-generation farm and certified sustainable winery, Hunt Country Vineyards in Branchport, N.Y. She is also\u00a0vice president, policy for Generate Upcycle, a global leader in sustainable infrastructure for food waste, compost and wastewater. \"Every generation has to figure out how to be successful during the historic challenges of their time, and ours is climate change,\" Hunt says. Over the past two decades, the farm and winery have implemented a number of science-based practices. These include enhancing soil health, growing a diversity of crops, maintaining the farm's natural wild and pollinator habitats and investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. Mulch, compost and biochar increase soil carbon levels and moisture and nutrient holding capacity. Nearly all heating, cooling and electricity used throughout the operation are generated onsite via solar and geothermal systems. Some farm vehicles operate on electricity, and visitors can charge their EVs on five chargers. Wide-scale adoption of regenerative agricultural practices requires a multifaceted, long-term commitment of resources and collaborative partnerships, Bonnie says. \"The hope is that accomplishments survive the pendulum swings of Washington and regenerative agriculture's approach becomes just the way farmers and ranchers do business in the future,\" he says.</p>", "publisher": "University Wire", "instances": ["Kit Bernardi| Studio Gannett\u2022The terms sustainable, climate-smart and regenerative have cropped up over the years to describe agricultural practices that restore land health and address climate change's environmental impact.

This year, Heifer Ranch will host day-long and multiday training programs for farmers and those interested in regenerative food systems. The in-depth sessions are taught by staff experts and guest instructors who are leaders in their respective fields. Also, the ranch's free, instructional YouTube videos reach a worldwide audience. Its curriculum covers a variety of topics including holistic livestock and grazing management; sheep and poultry production; regenerative land management; and beekeeping. Because transitioning from conventional farming methods - often implemented for generations - can seem overwhelming, Kilpatrick recommends implementing one or two regenerative agriculture principles to start. Another tip: \"Find a community of other regenerative farmers to connect with for peer-to-peer learning, idea sharing and support,\" she says. Suzanne Hunt is co-owner of her family's seventh-generation farm and certified sustainable winery, Hunt Country Vineyards in Branchport, N. Y. She is also\u00a0vice president, policy for Generate Upcycle, a global leader in sustainable infrastructure for food waste, compost and wastewater. \"Every generation has to figure out how to be successful during the historic challenges of their time, and ours is climate change,\" Hunt says.", "These include enhancing soil health, growing a diversity of crops, maintaining the farm's natural wild and pollinator habitats and investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. Mulch, compost and biochar increase soil carbon levels and moisture and nutrient holding capacity. Nearly all heating, cooling and electricity used throughout the operation are generated onsite via solar and geothermal systems. Some farm vehicles operate on electricity, and visitors can charge their EVs on five chargers. Wide-scale adoption of regenerative agricultural practices requires a multifaceted, long-term commitment of resources and collaborative partnerships, Bonnie says. \"The hope is that accomplishments survive the pendulum swings of Washington and regenerative agriculture's approach becomes just the way farmers and ranchers do business in the future,\" he says."]}, {"relevance_score": 64, "title": "Regenerative agriculture gives back to local soil environments - The Rocky Mountain Collegian", "published": "2025-04-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect a clarification on the number of students impacted...

But look closer, and signs emerge that Jorge is shedding tradition in the hope of future-proofing his farm.</p><p>Between the rows of chestnut and pistachio saplings, a mix of grasses covers the ground where a stretch of bare dirt would typically be \u2014 a deliberate attempt to prevent erosion. To retain water, Jorge has wrapped a blanket of wood chips around the base of each sapling. And among the young trees grow yellow lupin flowers, known as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tremocilha</emphasis> in Portuguese, that have a special power: they capture nitrogen and store it underground.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a natural fertilizer,\u201d Jorge says, looking out over the field of chest-high saplings under an intense springtime Sun. The flowers, mowing and mulch are part of Jorge\u2019s transition to regenerative agriculture, a method of farming that prioritizes soil health, boosts biodiversity, minimizes tilling and uses pesticides sparingly. \u201cAnything that we can do that adds resilience to the land, that preserves this land for the future, is always a better option,\u201d Jorge says, \u201cas long as it\u2019s economically viable, of course.\u201d</p><p>What humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet</p><p>The future is coming hard at Europe \u2014 the fastest-warming continent on the planet since the 1980s1. In just the past few years, farmers on the Iberian Peninsula have struggled with shrivelled crops, shrinking water supplies and more-frequent wildfires. Going forwards, the economic hit to the European Union and the United Kingdom from drought alone could reach more than \u20ac65 billion (US$76 billion) each year by 2100, in part because of crop damage and lost water supplies2.</p><p>With an estimated 4 \u00b0C of warming expected over the next 75 years if no action is taken to curb or adapt to climate change, southern and western Europe could lose 10% of its agricultural economic output2. Meanwhile, widespread erosion continues to sweep away soil, taking with it crucial nutrients and increasing the risk of flooding and landslides. Between 60% and 70% of soils in the EU are degraded, according to the European Commission.</p><p>These mounting risks are leading farmers such as Jorge to bet on regenerative agriculture. Together with climate advocates and scientists, they increasingly see these practices as key to withstanding changing climatic conditions \u2014 and to helping farmers stay in business. And Europe is showing how it can be done, they say.</p><p>\u201cWe believe right now we\u2019re at a point where the grassroots are spreading,\u201d says Simon Kr\u00e4mer, executive director at the European Alliance for Regenerative Agriculture (EARA), a farmer-led advocacy group in Berlin that was founded in 2023. According to Kr\u00e4mer, about 2% of farms in Europe are fully regenerative, and another 5\u201310% are on the regenerative path.</p><p>This budding regenerative revolution now faces some headwinds, however. After farmer protests across Europe in 2023 and 2024, the EU has backed away from some environmental requirements for the agricultural sector, and farmers say that incentives fall short of what\u2019s needed to help them make the transition.</p><p>But many advocates expect that the momentum behind regenerative agriculture will continue to build, particularly given Europe\u2019s need to meet its commitments to restore ecosystems and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. And farmers and researchers around the world are carefully watching Europe\u2019s attempts to pull off one of the biggest transitions in agriculture in generations. Regenerative agriculture, Kr\u00e4mer says, \u201cis the most important farmer and science movement in the world\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saving the soil</emphasis></p><p>In Portugal and many other parts of the globe, farmers are coming to realize that what worked for their parents and grandparents is no longer viable. To survive increasingly harsh conditions, they need to rethink how they farm \u2013 from the soil up.</p><p>About 180 kilometres south of Jorge\u2019s farm, just outside the tiny cobblestoned hamlet of Assumar, Herberto Brunk is undertaking his own regenerative experiment. As he manoeuvres his black Peugeot truck up his long dirt driveway, he stops between two of his fields. On the left, Brunk has planted mixed grasses as ground cover. On the right is a thriving field dominated by buckwheat (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fagopyrum esculentum</emphasis>) with some millet, pumpkin and sunflowers mixed in. A few months later, after a dry summer, he decided not to harvest the buckwheat and to leave it as a cover crop instead. Kept intact, it has helped to prevent nitrogen from leaching out of the soil.</p><p>Much of the work Brunk is doing is aimed at improving the soil \u2014 the foundation for a healthy bottom line. \u201cOur main goal is to actually recover the soil, get our organic matter up, get our nutrients recycled and reduce as much as possible the erosion,\u201d Brunk says.

In August, as fires burnt across Portugal, he helped his neighbour, a cattle grower, to put out a fire. If it had reached Brunk\u2019s property, he says, it probably wouldn\u2019t have done much damage because the fields are green and well hydrated.</p><p>This is year three of Brunk\u2019s five-year plan, and he doesn\u2019t expect to see a profit for a while. But both Jorge and Brunk are hopeful that the eventual pay-off will be worth the wait. For them, the regenerative approach is not only a way to restore the soil \u2014 it\u2019s also good for business in the long run.</p><p>Improving the soil will help to retain water, protecting it from drought, says Brunk. He has also seen the amount of carbon in his soils increase from 1.9% in 2019 to 3.5% in 2024 \u2014 more than halfway to his goal of 6%. Under a new partnership with Terra Madre, a company based in Porto, Portugal, that helps farmers transition to regenerative agriculture, he will receive payments for increasing the amount of carbon stored in plants and the soil; companies buy carbon credits based on this sequestered carbon to offset their pollution.</p><p>The practices that Brunk and Jorge are deploying \u2014 planting cover crops, rotating crops, reducing tilling, integrating trees \u2014 can help to protect their farms against the vagaries of a changing climate, says Thomas Elmqvist, a sustainability scientist at the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University.

And a 2021 meta-analysis4 spanning 85 countries showed that diversifying crops in this way increased the biodiversity of other plants and animals by 24%. Growing a variety of crops brings a host of other benefits: the study also found the practice led to a 51% increase in water quality, a 63% boost in pest and disease control and an 11% spike in soil quality.</p><p>How farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool</p><p>A 2022 study5 using soil samples from 1,267 farm sites across Germany found that tripling the area used to grow cover crops could boost the amount of organic carbon added to the soil by 12% within 50 years.</p><p>When it comes to crop yields, the results are less clear. A 2019 review6, for example, found that using cover crops decreased grain production by 4%, but including legumes such as clover in the cover crop could increase yields by 13%.</p><p>Other studies show positive trends in terms of profitability for farmers. In June, Kr\u00e4mer\u2019s group released a multi-year analysis7 that looked at 78 farms across 14 European countries. The results, which have not been published in a scientific journal but were reviewed by agricultural experts across Europe, found that farms that had adopted regenerative practices used 61% less synthetic nitrogen and 75% less pesticides than did their conventional counterparts. Per hectare, regenerative farms also achieved a 20% higher margin (the difference between income and costs).</p><p>And a 2023 analysis of regenerative farms in Germany by Kr\u00e4mer and his co-authors \u2014 written for the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy firm \u2014 reported that these operations should be at least 60% more profitable after six to ten years compared with conventional farms using other approaches.</p><p>But what works in one location might not work in another, Elmqvist says. \u201cMore long-term studies are needed to fully understand the sustainability and profitability of regenerative practices over multiple growing seasons, in different regions and under different climatic conditions,\u201d he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A push for reform</emphasis></p><p>On paper, at least, the EU has some of the world\u2019s most ambitious commitments to sustainable agriculture, several of which encourage a regenerative approach.

Launched on 2025-09-11, this initiative seeks to assist 24 farmers in implementing sustainable methods on a total of 5,454 hectares in Western Poland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this program, Mars Inc. will concentrate on regenerative wheat production across 3,359 hectares, primarily for its pet care brands, including WHISKAS and PEDIGREE. In parallel, PepsiCo will advocate for sustainable rapeseed cultivation over 2,160 hectares for its snack brands, such as Lay's and Doritos. The partnership underscores a comprehensive approach focused on improving soil health, managing water resources efficiently, and bolstering agricultural resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This collaborative initiative incorporates regenerative practices into rotational agriculture, which involves farmers alternating various crops, including cereals, legumes, and cover crop blends, throughout the seasons. ADM will act as the implementation partner, offering financial and technical resources to facilitate farmers' transition to these sustainable methods. Participants will gain access to training and expertise from technical specialists, including support from Biospheres.</p><p>To motivate farmers financially, Mars Inc. and its partners will base incentives on the sustainable practices they adopt, such as conservation tillage and cover cropping. Paul Gardner, lead global commercial VP at Mars Inc., remarked, 'Through this pre-competitive collaboration, Mars, PepsiCo, and ADM are working together to help tackle the climate impacts of the agricultural supply chain.' He highlighted that by collaborating on shared crop rotations, the partnership can empower farmers to implement climate-smart practices that improve soil health and enhance long-term farm resilience.</p><p>To evaluate the impact of these efforts, the companies will employ the Cool Farm Tool, a sustainability calculator designed to assist farmers in assessing and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The data gathered from this program will not only assess the effectiveness of current initiatives but may also inform potential expansions into other markets, reinforcing Mars Inc.'s dedication to sustainability in the food sector.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MARS, INCORPORATED PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 MARS, INCORPORATED TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 3 MARS, INCORPORATED RANKING</p><p>SECTION 4 MARS, INCORPORATED PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 1 MARS, INCORPORATED PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Mars, Incorporated, founded in 1911, is a family-owned global confectionery and pet care company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.

With the addition of Heartland Craft Grains, the program strengthens its presence in the direct-to-consumer and artisanal grain sectors, supporting not only sustainability in production, but also transparency and storytelling at the point of sale. Heartland Craft Grains represents exactly the kind of farmer-led innovation and integrity that Grown Climate Smart is designed to support,\" said Dylan Vaca, Brand and Marketing Manager of Grown Climate Smart. Their emphasis on soil health, crop diversity, and flavor-driven grain varieties makes them a powerful example of how regenerative agriculture can show up on shelves and in kitchens across the country. Owned and operated by fourth and fifth-generation farmers Rochelle and Evan Schnadt, Heartland Craft Grains has gained a strong following for its heirloom and ancient grain offerings, including blue corn, spelt, einkorn, and various hard and soft wheats, all grown using regenerative practices that prioritize soil vitality and biodiversity. From stone-milled flours to whole grain berries, the Schnadts' products highlight the importance of local food systems, nutrient density, and environmental stewardship. The Grown Climate Smart logo will appear on Heartland Craft Grains' products as a trusted signal to consumers seeking regenerative and sustainably grown ingredients. The addition of the logo will support brand storytelling, build consumer confidence, and connect farm-level conservation practices directly to purchasing decisions. This collaboration also reflects Grown Climate Smart's larger mission: to scale regenerative agriculture by aligning incentives, supply chains, and consumer demand.", "Their emphasis on soil health, crop diversity, and flavor-driven grain varieties makes them a powerful example of how regenerative agriculture can show up on shelves and in kitchens across the country.

And it's getting higher and higher for Brazil. Data presented by Instituto Escolhas in the panel \"Why is the transition of the soybean production model crucial for Brazil?\" served as a starting point for a debate on the current state of agribusiness' main export item.</p><p><br/>Jaqueline Ferreira, Research Director at Instituto Escolhas, showed that producers currently use three times more pesticides and twice as much fertilizer to produce the same amount of soybeans as 30 years ago.<br/>According to the study produced by Escolhas, soybean production jumped from 23 million to 152 million tons in three decades - an increase of approximately 560%. Consumption of pesticides, meanwhile, exploded by 2,019% in the same period. The use of fertilizers, on the other hand, grew by 734%. Productivity per hectare, on the other hand, rose by only 61%, according to the Instituto Escolhas survey.<br/>Jaqueline Ferreira said that, as well as causing environmental degradation, the current model is inefficient from an economic point of view. According to her, producers are \"feeling the difficulties of an outdated system in their pockets\". \"In 1993, with one kilogram of pesticides, it was possible to produce 23 bags of soybeans. In 2023, the same amount of pesticide would only produce seven bags, which clearly costs the producer more,\" she said.<br/>Data from the National Supply Company (Conab) shows that spending on seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizers consumed 30% of the gross value of production in 2013 and that, by 2023, this percentage had risen to 44%.<br/>There is also the problem of dependence on imported inputs. More than 80% of fertilizers are imported, as are 60% of pesticides. Exchange rate and geopolitical fluctuations have a direct impact on production costs.<br/>\"Producers no longer use pesticides because they want to. It's expensive. They use it because they have to,\" explained the Instituto Escolhas researcher. \"We're talking about a monoculture model that reduces local biodiversity, degrades the soil and requires more and more inputs to deal with pests, weeds and diseases,\" she warned.<br/>Luis Barbieri, director of the Folio Institute, pointed to regenerative agriculture as a way to maintain productivity in a sustainable way. \"Today we have producers who have managed to eliminate 100% of chemical fungicides from their soybeans while maintaining high productivity and scale,\" he said.<br/>\"Rural producers who don't start this process now (switching to regenerative agriculture) will have solvency problems over the next decade, because this is a technological paradigm shift,\" Barbieri warned.<br/>Regenerative agriculture, based on bio-inputs and soil recovery, is emerging as an alternative to the productivity problems pointed out by the Escolhas study. The transition, however, is slow. Only 13% of the products registered with the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) are bio-inputs, compared to 87% that are highly toxic. \"There is a change taking place, but it needs to accelerate, otherwise we'll miss the boat,\" said the director of the Folio Institute.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Legal framework</emphasis><br/>The expansion of bio-inputs in the soy industry depends on regulatory advances. The regulation of bio-inputs was approved in 2024, after years of legal uncertainty. \"Producers who used bio-inputs were illegal and even subject to imprisonment,\" criticized Maur\u00edcio Buffon, president of Aprosoja Brasil. Even with the new law, 80% of farms have already experimented with some form of bio-input, according to Buffon. For the Aprosoja representative, the interest is there, but structural support is lacking.<br/>Jaqueline Ferreira also highlighted problems. She recalled that the National Fertilizer Plan allocates less than 1% of its resources to biofertilizers, investing mainly in the traditional chemical industry. \"We need to change the logic of public investment for this regenerative tropical agriculture,\" she said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow Correio's WhatsApp channel and receive the main news of the day on your cell phone</emphasis><br/>\"This culture diminishes local biodiversity, impacts on soil quality, requires more fertilizer and more pesticides. And every time we use pesticides, these plants also become more resistant and need to use even more. In other words, we're talking about a vicious cycle,\" he said.<br/>The expert proposed a review of concepts. \"A first step to getting out of the vicious cycle is to admit that this production model, which was so important, with all the technology that we generated internally, Brazilian, tropical, was important. But it needs to be rethought,\" she concluded.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industry</emphasis><br/>The president of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), Andr\u00e9 Nassar, sees the industry as a natural partner for producers in transforming soybean planting. He proposed the creation of a tripartite negotiating table to define a viable regenerative agriculture model for large-scale soy planting.<br/>According to Nassar, the initiative should bring together producers, industry and consumers to discuss the best sustainable transition. \"The industry has the capacity to promote production. We have an interest in promoting - the industry is the producer's commercial partner,\" he said.<br/>\"I'm sure Embrapa has many technologies. I'm sure the agrochemical and seed industry does too. We have to put these technologies on the table and think about how to finance their scalability, their adoption,\" said the industry representative.<br/>Nassar made some observations about productivity, one of the weak points highlighted by Instituto Escolhas. He said that falling productivity is common in agribusiness and has reached soybeans. \"The productivity curve goes up, but falls over time,\" he explained. For this reason, according to Nassar, it would be necessary to progressively increase the use of external inputs, especially fertilizers, in order to \"generate the same productivity gain\". \"This is going to happen in all crops, we're getting to soybeans,\" he said.<br/>Nassar argued that, when analyzing productivity in soybean production, the corn crop should be taken into account, in a rotation system.<br/>\"This is the great thesis of Brazilian tropical agriculture. The great thesis is two crops or more than one crop,\" he explained. The crop rotation system, mentioned by Nassar, considers planting soybeans as the main crop and corn as the second crop, the \"safrinha\".<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             By Francisco Artur de Lima       </p>", "publisher": "CE Noticias Financieras English", "instances": ["Exchange rate and geopolitical fluctuations have a direct impact on production costs.

Aging coffee trees and increasingly erratic weather made it hard for them to earn a living income. So when a new program launched to provide agronomy training in their community, they were eager to learn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By rejuvenating the coffee trees, applying compost to their soil, and adopting other regenerative practices, the couple transformed their farm. Over eight years, their annual coffee harvests grew from 200 kilograms to 4,300 kilograms \u2013 a 23-fold increase.</p><p>For Fedila and Mustafa, the benefits of transitioning toward regenerative production were clear. But would this be the case for other smallholder coffee growers around the world? And would investing in this transition pay off for businesses, governments, and the planet?</p><p>New research offers a resounding answer to both questions: yes.</p><p>Quantifying the Benefits of Regenerative ProductionThe study by international nonprofit TechnoServe, with support from Nestl\u00e9, JDE Peet \u2019 s, and the Rudy &amp; Alice Ramsey Foundation, makes the investment case for regenerative coffee in nine leading producer countries.</p><p>It found that regenerative production can increase smallholder farmer incomes by an average of 62%, boost coffee exports by 30% across seven countries, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.5 million tons of CO e annually.</p><p>In each country, agronomists and practitioners identified a shortlist of practices with the greatest potential to benefit farmers and the environment. The report \u2019 s authors then used real-world data to model how these practices would affect emissions, farm productivity and earnings, and production costs over time and at different scales \u2014 starting at the farm level and scaling up to estimate the cumulative impact nationwide.</p><p>This approach yielded not only global insights, but a nuanced picture of the opportunities in each country and region. In leading producing countries Brazil and Vietnam, for example, regenerative production could contribute to a significant decrease in coffee \u2019 s carbon footprint, while it could drive a 52% increase in Uganda Robusta exports.

In fact, the USDA has reported 21% and 17% declines in farm working capital in 2023 and 2024 respectively . These economic trends can limit farmers' ability to invest in regenerative transitions, and challenge long-term sustainability and growth.<br/>To address this, we provided investment capital to the Fractal Farmer Agriculture Regenerative Management (FARM) Fund , which introduced a pioneering financial model that supports farmers while maintaining their land control. Offering 10-year contracts inclusive of incentives tied to regenerative practice adoption, Fractal provides an alternative to conventional debt or majority equity funding structures.<br/>The success of this model is reflected in Fractal's work with 14 farms, which the organization says have reported a 6.5% higher crop yield compared to local benchmarks and maintained stronger income rates relative to market averages.<br/>For Jesse Hough, the general manager and financial strategist of Hough Farms in East Central Nebraska, Fractal's long term minority investment approach has helped him consistently outperform county yields. He can continue making on-farm decisions and, unlike short-term programs, Fractal supports regenerative practices for the full ten years, aligning incentives so both farmer and investor share in the long-term gains.<br/>Fractal uses AI and machine learning to analyze underlying land productivity and create more accurate land valuations for its investments. Its models incorporate climate risk and soil health, a more sophisticated approach than traditional static measures that can under- or overvalue a farm's long-term potential. For Fractal to continue to implement its work best and support farmers like Jesse, it needs improved data infrastructure to support underwriting and incentive processes for the company.<br/>To accelerate the development of these vital datasets, the Cisco Foundation also provided an early-stage cash grant to Earth Genome . Their new, open-source Open Ground initiative, developed in collaboration with Fractal, will integrate historical climate data, localized extreme weather models, and advanced crop failure classifications to deliver precise field-level insights. Their open access helps stakeholders like researchers, startups, insurers, lenders, and public good entities unlock the potential for AI applications in agriculture. It also helps them to confidently invest in, integrate and reward regenerative agricultural practices in their operations.<br/>The AI edge in wildfire management: Mapping a resilient future<br/>Another example of our blended finance approach is our support of Vibrant Planet and Vibrant Planet Data Commons to address wildfire and land management.<br/>Cisco Foundation's investee, Vibrant Planet PBC , operates on the core thesis that\"you can't understand what you can't see\"- a concept increasingly crucial as more extreme weather, outdated fire suppression policies, and fragmented restoration efforts make U.S. forests more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.<br/>The lack of open-source, high-quality data has hindered restoration, management, and community engagement, and has especially excluded Indigenous stewardship and perspectives.<br/>Addressing these challenges requires advanced technology. Vibrant Planet leverages satellite imagery, remote sensing, AI-powered modeling, and cloud-based data integration to capture a comprehensive, real-time picture of forest health, fire risk, and ecosystem change with unmatched granularity.<br/>While these technologies enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of vast datasets -spanning millions of acres - they provide it at an incredibly localized level. This makes actionable insights and informed recommendations via their wildfire resilience platform available to land managers, scientists, and policymakers.<br/>Vibrant Planet Data Commons , the nonprofit arm of Vibrant Planet PBC, makes forest science and data meaningful and accessible to drive wildfire and ecosystem resilience. With Cisco Foundation grant support since 2022, they've built core infrastructure and released novel open-access data packages - including a wildfire ignition probability model -alongside story-driven tools for public engagement.<br/>Their work prioritizes Indigenous knowledge sharing, with protocols co-developed alongside Tribal partners. These packages are used by scientists and practitioners across the American West, with a growing focus on tracking how this knowledge informs management and infrastructure decisions.<br/>As Dr. Chelsey Walden-Schreiner, Director of Science Development at Vibrant Planet Data Commons shared,\"Together, Vibrant Planet PBC and VPDC form a hybrid engine for change - where science meets scalable systems, and where public good and market-driven innovation reinforce one another. Our success is not parallel, but interdependent - unlocking a model for how mission-aligned for-profits and nonprofits can co-create transformative climate resilience.\"<br/>Together, these examples illustrate how blended finance and open data can help inform AI-driven approaches to climate resilience, such as supporting more adaptive agricultural practices and informing forest management strategies.<br/>This blog was written with assistance from Ryan Jones, Cisco Chief Sustainability Office, TekSystems.<br/>View original content here .<br/>MENAFN12092025007202015466ID1110054498<br/></p>", "publisher": "MENAFN - Press Releases (English)", "instances": ["Link to ImageLink to StoryArtificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for climate innovation, but its effectiveness depends on access to diverse, high-quality data - something that can be difficult and costly to obtain in the climate sector.

Since the company settled in the country, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">we have maintained the cattle raising plans\", </emphasis>he indicated.<br/>Although the direct economic benefit provided by the program for participating in different practices is limited - around US$ 17 per hectare - the real value lies in the ecosystem services. \"The determining factor is the improvement in moisture management and logistics,\" he said.<br/>For <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alejandro Ramos Mej\u00eda,</emphasis> commercial manager of Garfin Agro, joining the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LDC program </emphasis>also has<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> a strategic value in the medium term.</emphasis> \"What adds up for us is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">basically</emphasis> to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">show it and have them help us measure it.</emphasis> Good practices are already part of the company's culture with our own measurement ratios, but doing it together with a multinational that needs these programs is a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">win-win</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. </emphasis>They help us to show it as the end consumers want to see it, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">upstream in the chain,\"</emphasis> he explained.<br/>Ramos Mej\u00eda said that the company has an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">advanced track record in sustainability,</emphasis> but that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">there is always room for learning</emphasis>. \"The company has been producing sustainably for many years.

Regenerative agricultureis no longer a trend, but a necessity. It is a model that seeks not only to produce food, but also to restore the resilience of the land, restore soils, conserve water and protect biodiversity. With this in mind, an Italian capital company with presence in Argentina decided to redouble its commitment to sustainability. Garfin Agro, founded in 2001 by businessman Stefano Garilli, has been dedicated to the production and commercialization of high quality commodities and specialties for more than twenty years. Since its inception, the company has adopted practices focused on the environment and technological innovation. Government modified vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease and producers will save US$25 millionIn the same year of its foundation, Garfin Agro acquired several ranches in three productive areas of the province of Buenos Aires (north, west and southeast): La Esperanza, in Arrecifes; La Chita, in Am\u00e9rica; and La Morocha and La Estrella, in Balcarce.", "As Juan Ignacio Mateu, the company's technical coordinator, explained to LA NACION, Garfin Agro's strategy is based on \"an agricultural model with an industrial process, a lot of field monitoring, commitment with the soil, the environment and diversity\". The company has been implementing precision agriculture and digital field monitoring systems for more than eleven years . Spring weather: the data that will be a \"blessing\" and the risk that will haunt a region of the country. We have everything surveyed with data. We put a lot of focus on information because we understand that it is key to make better productive decisions,\" he said. Last year, Garfin Agro decided to join the regenerative agriculture program ofLouis Dreyfus Company (LDC), an initiative that seeks to accompany producers in the implementation of sustainable practices that improve soil health and biodiversity. We thought it was an excellent proposal, because it was very much in line with what we had been doing. It fit perfectly with our work philosophy and gives us the possibility to improve and advance together with other actors, exchange experiences and grow,\" Mateu said. TheArrecifes operating unit covers 5,000 hectares, where Garfin Agro carries out an intensified approach in rotations and biodiversity, with more than 55% of double cropping . According to the agronomist, this season cover crops such as vetch with oats and camelina were planted , as well as wheat and barley in winter, while some fields were left fallow prior to soybeans. The production scheme also includes a herd of 400 mothers, with cattle breeding on natural pastures in cattle pastures and rebreeding on oats, taking advantage of the surplus water and nitrogen available to transform it into meat.", "For now the market does not pay for sustainability, but we believe that in the future that will change.

Wettstein started partnering with the company in 2019, when he decided to expand his family's operations by adding a 200-acre farm in Woodford County, Illinois, a press release from Iroquois Valley said.</p><p>\"We very much view the relationship with our farmers as one of a long-term partnership. Our leases are set up and structured\u2026 to be six years in duration initially, and they can be evergreen thereafter,\" Chris Zuehlsdorff, CEO of Iroquois Valley, told EcoWatch. \"The main product that we offer farmers is what we call a purchase lease. So a farmer like Rex, for example, will identify a 200-acre farm that is down the road or that he would like to add to his portfolio and his business plan. And we'll buy that farm and lease it back to the farmer over a six-year term. So that gets them through the organic certification. After year six, [the leases] auto-renew for every two years. We also offer the farmer an opportunity to purchase the farm from us at the end of year six, should they want to.\"</p><p>Last year, Iroquois Valley distributed $37 million from investors to 18 farmers.</p><p>\"Rex is a good example of a farmer in our portfolio. We first did a purchase of a farm for him and his family back in 2020, and he successfully transitioned that farm\u2026 to certified organic production,\" Zuehlsdorff told EcoWatch. \"He's looking to grow his operation \u2014 his acreage portfolio, if you will \u2014 and so he identified this opportunity late last year to purchase another farm, and he brought that opportunity to us.\"</p><p>Organic wheat, soy and corn will be grown on Wettstein's farm, but it will also become the first Iroquois Valley partner to invest in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/renewable-energy-carbon-capture-climate-solution.html\">renewable energy</url>.</p><p>\"For us, it is the first investment in our portfolio that has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/wind-turbine-repurposed-tiny-home.html\">wind turbines</url> on it.

Wettstein said organic farming not only makes for better <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/healthy-soil-sounds-science.html\">soil health</url>, but has economic advantages too.</p><p>\"I've done organic farming all my life. But then any new farms that we get, we do transition them to organic,\" Wettstein said in a recent interview. \"There's definitely more of a return on the organic side. And if you're talking to someone who maybe is a conventional farmer, and they ask you, 'What do you see as the benefits of organic over conventional?' we feel like it's healthier for the soil, for us and everything. We're obviously smaller farmers, and it gives more opportunity for us. I mean, if it wasn't for organic, I probably couldn't farm.\"</p><p>Wettstein said there are probably at least 25 to 30 organic farms in the area around his farm in Eureka, Illinois, and the number is growing.</p><p>\"Expanding Rex's operations is not just about growing more organic crops, but also about building a thriving organic hub here in Illinois,\" said Andy Ambriole, Iroquois Valley's managing director of farmland investments, in the press release. \"By building resilient, organic communities it creates a model for sustainable, profitable farming that benefits the community, the environment and future generations.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1n4Gj5awymC3nEYwNWwpQgQRGMhYA6kqQ&amp;ehbc=2E312F\">https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1n4Gj5awymC3nEYwNWwpQgQRGMhYA6kqQ&amp;ehbc=2E312F</url></p><p>Co-founded by Dr. Stephen Rivard, a former emergency medicine doctor, and Dave Miller, a former commercial real estate banker, the origin story of Iroquois Valley is an illustration of the importance of organic farming for human health and the well-being of the planet .</p><p>Rivard and Miller \"grew up in the same small town, Kankakee, Illinois, farm country in central Illinois.

But that was what inspired them to begin to explore solutions,\" Zuehlsdorff told EcoWatch. \"And the one solution that they came up with was to buy a farm in Iroquois County, Illinois \u2014 hence the name, Iroquois Valley \u2014 and convert that farm to organic, to get chemicals out of the food system, to just try to make a small impact on outcomes in the environment.\"</p><p>That was the first farm Iroquois Valley purchased, but now their model is one of partnership with farmers.</p><p>\"Harold Wilkins would have been the first farmer in our portfolio in Iroquois County, Illinois, that they worked with to transition\u2026 to certified organic production.

And by 2012, they [had] created a small LLC,\" Zuehlsdorff explained. \"[They] continued raising capital and buying and converting farmland to organic. And then in 2016, they converted the fund to the structure that it is today, which is a real estate investment trust and a public benefit corporation\u2026 And what I really like is we really democratize access for individuals and for people to own a diversified portfolio of organic farmland.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Firoquoisvalley%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0TSDbK1LNJbKmUFY9ZHEEuTCdtUswUZmxJixSf5EZniZut5VhvnKKq3eGgx1VDgJnl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500\">https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Firoquoisvalley%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0TSDbK1LNJbKmUFY9ZHEEuTCdtUswUZmxJixSf5EZniZut5VhvnKKq3eGgx1VDgJnl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500</url></p><p>In 2000, the amount of certified organic land being used for agriculture or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/carbon-sequestration-soil-livestock-emissions.html\">livestock</url> in the United States was 1.8 million acres, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2023/november/rising-consumer-demand-reshapes-landscape-for-u-s-organic-farmers#:~:text=In%20the%20two%20decades%20since,toward%20development%20of%20organic%20agriculture.\">U.S Department of Agriculture</url>. But by 2021, that number had increased to 4.9 million acres.</p><p>\"We continue to see a growing need for more organic, regenerative farming in America,\" Zuehlsdorff said in the press release. \"Iroquois Valley receives support from over 925 accredited and non-accredited individuals and institutional investors, and investments range from $5,000 to over $9 million. Patient investor capital is the cornerstone of our long-term support for organic, regenerative farmers, but we need more individuals and institutional investors who want to join our mission.\"</p><p>Zuehlsdorff shared some of his thoughts about the importance of organic farming for healthy food and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/drinking-water-contaminants-us-health.html\">drinking water</url>.</p><p>\"Something like 80% of all <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/produce-pesticide-levels-health-risks.html\">pesticides</url> are applied to five crops \u2014 corn, soybeans, wheat, potatoes and cotton, I think. And so much of that gets funneled right down the Mississippi River and right into the watersheds in a number of these farming communities and beyond,\" Zuehlsdorff told EcoWatch. \"Certified organic production removes the synthetic chemicals, pesticides, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/fertilizers-pollinators-impact.html\">fertilizers</url> from the soil and from the downstream negative impacts that comes with that.\"</p><p>Zuehlsdorff said individuals can support organic farming by buying produce and other products through community supported agriculture programs and local cooperatives. They can also cultivate awareness by growing their own food.</p><p>\"I think having a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/vegetable-garden-growing-tips-ecowatch.html\">backyard garden</url> or a small garden plot where you're getting your hands dirty and you understand how hard it is to grow and how hard farming can be and various challenges that come with it is very tangible and creates awareness. And then, ultimately, it's about creating demand for organic produce, organic grown crops,\" Zuehlsdorff said. \"So the more awareness we can create amongst the consumer in the buying community and the more demand that's out there, the supply side is going to respond. And so that's a very important piece to the puzzle, I think, is to feel more connected to the food [we] eat and where it's grown and how it's grown.\"</p><p>Zuehlsdorff said he sees organic farming continuing to expand for the health of water, soil, humans and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/wallis-annenberg-wildlife-crossing-soil.html\">wildlife</url>.</p><p>\"We started farming organically 60, 70 years ago, before we started putting chemicals on fields en masse.

Our latest blended finance engagements -with partners across regenerative agriculture and wildfire resilience - serve as case studies.</p><p>Aligningcapital and data to value regenerative agriculture practices</p><p>U.S. farmers seeking to adopt regenerative agriculture practices face many challenges, such as limited access to capital and inadequate data infrastructure. In fact, the USDA has reported 21% and 17% declines in farm working capital in 2023 and 2024 respectively. These economic trends can limit farmers' ability to invest in regenerative transitions, and challenge long-term sustainability and growth.</p><p>To address this, we provided investment capital to the Fractal Farmer Agriculture Regenerative Management (FARM) Fund, which introduced a pioneering financial model that supports farmers while maintaining their land control. Offering 10-year contracts inclusive of incentives tied to regenerative practice adoption, Fractal provides an alternative to conventional debt or majority equity funding structures.</p><p>The success of this model is reflected in Fractal's work with 14 farms, which the organization says have reported a 6.5% higher crop yield compared to local benchmarks and maintained stronger income rates relative to market averages.</p><p>For Jesse Hough, the general manager and financial strategist of Hough Farms in East Central Nebraska, Fractal's long term minority investment approach has helped him consistently outperform county yields. He can continue making on-farm decisions and, unlike short-term programs, Fractal supports regenerative practices for the full ten years, aligning incentives so both farmer and investor share in the long-term gains.</p><p>Fractal uses AI and machine learning to analyze underlying land productivity and create more accurate land valuations for its investments. Its models incorporate climate risk and soil health, a more sophisticated approach than traditional static measures that can under- or overvalue a farm's long-term potential. For Fractal to continue to implement its work best and support farmers like Jesse, it needs improved data infrastructure to support underwriting and incentive processes for the company.</p><p>\"When regenerative practices improve yield resilience, the cash flow impacts ripple from land value to crop insurance. Through Open Ground, we're partnering with Earth Genome to make the climate and agronomic data behind those benefits open source - ensuring it can drive meaningful impact across the entire sector.\" - Dr. Emma Fuller, Co-Founder, Fractal</p><p>To accelerate the development of these vital datasets, the Cisco Foundation also provided an early-stage cash grant to Earth Genome. Their new, open-source Open Ground initiative, developed in collaboration with Fractal, will integrate historical climate data, localized extreme weather models, and advanced crop failure classifications to deliver precise field-level insights. Their open access helps stakeholders like researchers, startups, insurers, lenders, and public good entities unlock the potential for AI applications in agriculture. It also helps them to confidently invest in, integrate and reward regenerative agricultural practices in their operations.</p><p>The AI edge in wildfire management: Mapping a resilient future</p><p>Another example of our blended finance approach is our support of Vibrant Planet and Vibrant Planet Data Commons to address wildfire and land management.</p><p>Cisco Foundation's investee, Vibrant Planet PBC, operates on the core thesis that \"you can't understand what you can't see\" - a concept increasingly crucial as more extreme weather, outdated fire suppression policies, and fragmented restoration efforts make U.S. forests more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>The lack of open-source, high-quality data has hindered restoration, management, and community engagement, and has especially excluded Indigenous stewardship and perspectives.</p><p>Addressing these challenges requires advanced technology. Vibrant Planet leverages satellite imagery, remote sensing, AI-powered modeling, and cloud-based data integration to capture a comprehensive, real-time picture of forest health, fire risk, and ecosystem change with unmatched granularity.</p><p>While these technologies enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of vast datasets -spanning millions of acres - they provide it at an incredibly localized level. This makes actionable insights and informed recommendations via their wildfire resilience platform available to land managers, scientists, and policymakers.</p><p>Vibrant Planet Data Commons, the nonprofit arm of Vibrant Planet PBC, makes forest science and data meaningful and accessible to drive wildfire and ecosystem resilience. With Cisco Foundation grant support since 2022, they've built core infrastructure and released novel open-access data packages - including a wildfire ignition probability model -alongside story-driven tools for public engagement.</p><p>Their work prioritizes Indigenous knowledge sharing, with protocols co-developed alongside Tribal partners. These packages are used by scientists and practitioners across the American West, with a growing focus on tracking how this knowledge informs management and infrastructure decisions.</p><p>As Dr. Chelsey Walden-Schreiner, Director of Science Development at Vibrant Planet Data Commons shared, \"Together, Vibrant Planet PBC and VPDC form a hybrid engine for change - where science meets scalable systems, and where public good and market-driven innovation reinforce one another. Our success is not parallel, but interdependent - unlocking a model for how mission-aligned for-profits and nonprofits can co-create transformative climate resilience.\"</p><p>Together, these examples illustrate how blended finance and open data can help inform AI-driven approaches to climate resilience, such as supporting more adaptive agricultural practices and informing forest management strategies.</p><p>This blog was written with assistance from Ryan Jones, Cisco Chief Sustainability Office, TekSystems.</p><p>View original content here.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/industrial-and-manufacturing/cisco-the-data-catalyst-blended-finance-paving-the-way-for-climate-ai-1072220\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / September 12, 2025 / By Jocelyn Matyas, Alex WilkinsCisco's Chief Sustainability Office hosted an AI + Climate Innovation Lab, bringing together 100+ industry experts, founders, and investors to discuss AI and data needs across nine climate sub sectors during San Francisco Climate Week 2025.

He can continue making on-farm decisions and, unlike short-term programs, Fractal supports regenerative practices for the full ten years, aligning incentives so both farmer and investor share in the long-term gains.</p><p>Fractal uses AI and machine learning to analyze underlying land productivity and create more accurate land valuations for its investments. Its models incorporate climate risk and soil health, a more sophisticated approach than traditional static measures that can under- or overvalue a farm's long-term potential. For Fractal to continue to implement its work best and support farmers like Jesse, it needs improved data infrastructure to support underwriting and incentive processes for the company.</p><p>\"When regenerative practices improve yield resilience, the cash flow impacts ripple from land value to crop insurance.

Their new, open-source Open Ground initiative, developed in collaboration with Fractal, will integrate historical climate data, localized extreme weather models, and advanced crop failure classifications to deliver precise field-level insights. Their open access helps stakeholders like researchers, startups, insurers, lenders, and public good entities unlock the potential for AI applications in agriculture. It also helps them to confidently invest in, integrate and reward regenerative agricultural practices in their operations.</p><p>The AI edge in wildfire management: Mapping a resilient future</p><p>Another example of our blended finance approach is our support of Vibrant Planet and Vibrant Planet Data Commons to address wildfire and land management.</p><p>Cisco Foundation's investee, Vibrant Planet PBC, operates on the core thesis that \"you can't understand what you can't see\" - a concept increasingly crucial as more extreme weather, outdated fire suppression policies, and fragmented restoration efforts make U.S. forests more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>The lack of open-source, high-quality data has hindered restoration, management, and community engagement, and has especially excluded Indigenous stewardship and perspectives.</p><p>Addressing these challenges requires advanced technology. Vibrant Planet leverages satellite imagery, remote sensing, AI-powered modeling, and cloud-based data integration to capture a comprehensive, real-time picture of forest health, fire risk, and ecosystem change with unmatched granularity.</p><p>While these technologies enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of vast datasets -spanning millions of acres - they provide it at an incredibly localized level. This makes actionable insights and informed recommendations via their wildfire resilience platform available to land managers, scientists, and policymakers.</p><p>Vibrant Planet Data Commons, the nonprofit arm of Vibrant Planet PBC, makes forest science and data meaningful and accessible to drive wildfire and ecosystem resilience. With Cisco Foundation grant support since 2022, they've built core infrastructure and released novel open-access data packages - including a wildfire ignition probability model -alongside story-driven tools for public engagement.</p><p>Their work prioritizes Indigenous knowledge sharing, with protocols co-developed alongside Tribal partners. These packages are used by scientists and practitioners across the American West, with a growing focus on tracking how this knowledge informs management and infrastructure decisions.</p><p>As Dr. Chelsey Walden-Schreiner, Director of Science Development at Vibrant Planet Data Commons shared, \"Together, Vibrant Planet PBC and VPDC form a hybrid engine for change - where science meets scalable systems, and where public good and market-driven innovation reinforce one another. Our success is not parallel, but interdependent - unlocking a model for how mission-aligned for-profits and nonprofits can co-create transformative climate resilience.\"</p><p>Together, these examples illustrate how blended finance and open data can help inform AI-driven approaches to climate resilience, such as supporting more adaptive agricultural practices and informing forest management strategies.</p><p>This blog was written with assistance from Ryan Jones, Cisco Chief Sustainability Office, TekSystems.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:</p><p>Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc</url></p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>__________________________________________________</p><p>_______________________________________________ Closing price for CSCO-Q Date : 2025/09/11 Price: 67.69</p><p>____________________________________________________________</p><p>(c)2025 Market News Publishing Inc.

A study published by the Instituto Escolha shows that the model is also inefficient, causing damage to both the environment and the economy.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Follow Correio's WhatsApp channel and receive the main news of the day on your cell phone</emphasis><br/>The study, \"Brazil as world leader in soybean production: until when and at what cost?\", compares figures for soybean production in 1993 and 2023, and proves the rise in costs for soybean producers, such as the increase in the use of chemical inputs to produce the same number of bags of soybeans and the disproportionate growth in the price of agrochemicals and fertilizers for soybeans.<br/>According to the survey, in 2023, farmers produced fewer bags of soybeans (60 kg) with the same amount of pesticides as in 1993. With 1 kilo of chemicals in 1993, the farmer produced 23 bags, while in 2023 productivity drops to just 7 bags. The same goes for the use of fertilizers: with 1 ton, in 1993, the worker produced 517 bags of soybeans, in 2023 the number was reduced to 333.<br/>For rural producer Marion Kompier, Brazil doesn't need to expand the area planted with soya any further, it just needs to use the degraded pasture areas, which have enough space to accommodate soya, and increase irrigation systems throughout Brazil. That would be enough to increase production to supply the planet.<br/>\"It's like comparing it to a sick person, who takes a chemical medicine from the pharmacy, that medicine can give a side effect, that we will need to take another medicine to solve that side effect. It's a snowball. We use more and more medicine,\" he says.<br/>\"The producer's profit margin is much smaller, because we need to use more and more chemicals and fertilizers to try to correct the imbalances that we ourselves have caused with this current model of agriculture,\" he adds.<br/>According to the survey, Brazil is the world leader in the use of pesticides and fertilizers (phosphorus and potassium), accounting for 22% of the global volume of pesticides in agriculture. However, even with a large volume of chemical inputs, the country also stands out for its inefficient use per hectare of cultivated land (all crops), among the five largest soy producers in the world (Argentina, Brazil, China, the United States and India), being the worst among the five in the use of pesticides per hectare and the second worst in the use of fertilizers per hectare.<br/>Transgenics<br/>According to Croplife - representing the world's leading soybean seed companies - the adoption of transgenic seeds in soybean production in Brazil is almost absolute, representing 93% of the total by 2023. The adoption of this technology promised to promote efficiency in pest control in transgenic crops and a reduction in the use of agrochemicals, but unfortunately the promise has not been fulfilled. The study shows that the volume of pesticides used is growing faster than the volume of seed production and soybean production. The 20-year analysis shows an increase of 660% in the use of agrochemicals, 348% in seed production and, for grain production, a smaller increase of 256%.<br/>According to Marion Kompier, genetically modified cultivars are chemically dependent. \"They were produced to respond with productivity when a lot of chemicals were applied. So today they are not tolerant to pests and diseases, to climatic difficulties. They're not suitable for reducing the amount of chemicals we'd like,\" she adds.<br/>The sum of the average spending on these three inputs per hectare/year in the rural enterprises evaluated by Conab went from 68% (R$1,630/ha/year) of total costing expenses (R$2,385/ha/year) in 2013 to 87% (R$3,487/ha/year) of total costing expenses (R$4,015/ha/year) in 2023.<br/>An economic factor highlighted by the research is the discrepancy between the price increase of the inputs used in planting and that of the soybean itself. As an example, the price evolution of the herbicide Glyphosate 480 grams, an agrochemical used in soybean cultivation, whose annual national average price per liter increased by 99% between 2013 and 2023, reaching a value (corrected) of R$52.62 in 2023.Meanwhile, during this same period, the price of a 60kg bag of soybeans increased by only 2%, reaching a value of R$153.40 in 2023.<br/>The study reveals a series of problems and difficulties that Brazilian producers face due to the excessive use of chemical inputs, the price of which is detrimental to the farmer's economy.<br/>For the farmer, it is necessary to honor and thank the production model that has brought Brazilian agriculture to the top of the world, but the time has come to look at a new way of production, regenerative agriculture. \"We need research to work to show how to validate, how to do it, which way to go, whether what producers are doing is right or wrong. We're learning this way, but we still know very little, but the little we do know is already making a big difference to our production,\" he says.<br/>Kompier also points out that many producers are already looking for solutions, such as the Associated Group for Sustainable Agriculture (Gaas). They already see that this current model is unsustainable for both nature and the economy and they need to find a new way of farming. For more farmers to adopt the regenerative agriculture model, more research is needed.<br/>\"Here's a call for research institutions to research this new model of regenerative agriculture and provide data that will teach and show farmers how to do it.

This initiative, launched on 2025-09-11, aims to support 24 farmers in adopting sustainable methods across their crop rotations, covering a total of 5,454 hectares in Western Poland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under this program, Mars Inc. will focus on regenerative wheat production across 3,359 hectares, primarily for its pet care brands such as WHISKAS and PEDIGREE. Meanwhile, PepsiCo will promote sustainable rapeseed cultivation across 2,160 hectares for its snack brands, including Lay's and Doritos. The partnership emphasizes a farm-wide approach that aims to improve soil health, manage water resources effectively, and enhance agricultural resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The collaborative effort involves integrating regenerative practices into rotational agriculture, where farmers alternate different crops, including cereals, legumes, and cover crop blends, each season. ADM serves as an implementation partner, providing financial and technical resources to support farmers transitioning to these sustainable practices. Participants in the program will benefit from training and guidance from technical specialists, including support from Biospheres.</p><p>Mars Inc. and its partners are incentivizing farmers financially based on the sustainable practices they implement, such as conservation tillage and cover cropping. Paul Gardner, lead global commercial VP at Mars Inc., stated, 'Through this pre-competitive collaboration, Mars, PepsiCo, and ADM are working together to help tackle the climate impacts of the agricultural supply chain.' He emphasized that by working across shared crop rotations, the partnership can empower farmers to adopt climate-smart practices that enhance soil health and build farm resilience over the long term.</p><p>To measure the impact of these initiatives, the companies plan to utilize the Cool Farm Tool, a sustainability calculator designed to help farmers assess and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The data collected through this program will not only inform the effectiveness of the current initiatives but may also guide potential expansion into other markets, reinforcing Mars Inc.'s commitment to sustainability in the food industry.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: POUL WEIHRAUCH CEO &amp; President</p><p>SECTION 2 MARS, INCORPORATED PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 3 MARS, INCORPORATED TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 4 MARS, INCORPORATED RANKING</p><p>SECTION 5 MARS, INCORPORATED PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 6 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 7 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: POUL WEIHRAUCH CEO &amp; President</p><p>In September 2022, Poul Weihrauch took over the position of CEO and Office of the President for Mars. \u200b</p><p>Poul has spent more than 20 years with Mars and is known for his commitment to Associates and merging purpose, sustainability and strategy to drive growth, performance and positive impact.   \u200b</p><p>He has been President of Mars Petcare since 2014, leading the evolution from its origins in pet food into a true pet care company, making Mars the world's largest provider of veterinary services and doubling the size of the business.

The finding, centered on the SLAMF1 gene, is the first of its kind and could lead to informed breeding decisions.</p><p>The SLAMF1 variant was found in 71% of French Bulldogs and 40% of Boxers - breeds known to present frequently with this condition - significantly increasing their risk of developing cAD. The discovery came from analyzing clinical data from Banfield(Registered) Pet Hospital paired with DNA data from Wisdom Panel.</p><p>Estimates suggest cAD affects up to 10-30% of dogs, and it is a condition with no known cure. These findings add vital knowledge to help improve understanding of disease processes and could potentially lead to more targeted solutions in the future. In addition, identification of the SLAMF1 variant presents the opportunity for breeders to breed toward dogs with a lower risk of atopic dermatitis.</p><p>Though the study specifically confirmed the link in French Bulldogs and Boxers, scientists believe the implications are much broader.</p><p>\"This finding could have a real impact on dog health,\" says Jimmy Barr, DVM, DACVECC, Chief Medical Officer for Mars Petcare's Science &amp; Diagnostics division.</p><p>June 24: Mars, Incorporated New DNA discovery could help itchy dogs find relief</p><p>If you've ever had a dog that can't stop scratching, biting their paws, or dealing with constant ear infections, you know how frustrating it can be - both for you and your pet.
