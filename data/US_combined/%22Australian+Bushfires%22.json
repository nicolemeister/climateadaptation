These data could offer clues</emphasis></p><p>In December, the Australian government will bring the Online Safety Amendment Act into force. The law will prevent people under 16 years of age from having accounts for a range of social-media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. The legislation, introduced in response to concerns over children\u2019s online safety and well-being1, provides a golden opportunity for researchers to investigate how social-media use might affect mental health among adolescents \u2014 a complex issue that has been the subject of heated debate.</p><p>Social-media bans won\u2019t work \u2014 there are better ways to keep kids safe</p><p>There\u2019s little time to plan and set up the ideal experiment. Assessing the mental-health status and Internet usage of tens of thousands of teenagers in Australia and comparator countries over time, before and after the legislation comes into force, is no mean feat. It would require substantial organization in schools, the recruitment of research staff, agreement about the research measures used and fast ethical review and parental consent, all of which takes many months. Nevertheless, there are more-feasible approaches that could provide valuable information if researchers act promptly.</p><p>An as-yet-unnamed advisory committee and research partner have been established by the government to review the effect of the act, but to our knowledge there have been no official announcements about the responsibilities, leadership or research strategies they will adopt. We urge the committee to consider implementing each of the following three approaches.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Track official records</emphasis></p><p>Hospital admissions records and coroners\u2019 reports can track the incidence of serious self-harm and suicides among adolescents before and after the introduction of legislation. The benefits of this approach are that it is possible to gather data for the whole country, rather than studying a subset of teens, and that many years of retrospective data are available. Data from other nations can also be used to help determine whether any changes to mental health in Australia can be ascribed to the bans or whether they simply reflect broader trends.</p><p>On the downside, it takes time for official data to become available. Figures on suicide are linked to time-consuming coroners\u2019 investigations, so data sets are often not finalized for years. Routinely collected data do not reveal anything about individual mental-health trajectories and social-media use, making it hard to determine whether social media contributed to peoples\u2019 actions. These records also do not allow investigation of the many instances of anxiety and depression that do not lead to self-harm or suicide. This is because these conditions often go untreated or are addressed through primary health-care services or private psychologists, from which data are not easily collated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Launch national surveys</emphasis></p><p>The government could commission surveys of the health and well-being of young people aged under 16 before and after the legislation is brought in. Two national surveys have been run in Australia in the past, the latest in 2013\u2013142. Starting one survey in the coming months and another in four years\u2019 time would enable comparisons with previous cohorts.</p><p>These surveys typically involve a representative sample of the population. To study the social-media ban, they might instead oversample at-risk subgroups \u2014 teens from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQIA+) or those with pre-existing mental health conditions, for instance. The surveys could be used to probe risk factors for anxiety and depression, including online bullying, and could ask detailed questions about mental ill-health and social-media use on various platforms, going beyond generic measures such as screen time. They could also include measurements of lifestyle and any activities or hobbies taken up to fill the time previously spent on social media. Analyses would help to answer questions about which individuals are protected by social-media bans, and what online activities are associated with improved well-being.</p><p>Young people might adopt different lifestyle interests when Australia\u2019s social-media ban begins \u2014 a trend that researchers could study.</p><p>A teenage girl with her family leaning on the railings of a ferry crossing Sydney Harbour, throws her head back as her hair blows in the wind</p><p>Credit: Vlad Sokhin/Panos Pictures</p><p>The drawback of these surveys is that the proposed first cohort (to be evaluated in the coming months) would have a different social-media environment and different stressors from the second group, which would be assessed in four years\u2019 time. This would make any comparisons complex and challenging. A gap of four years between surveys would make the data coarse with respect to any trajectories of change \u2014 but narrowing that gap to, say, two years is probably both financially and politically unfeasible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Piggyback existing studies</emphasis></p><p>Researchers could take advantage of ongoing longitudinal studies of young people to recruit new cohorts and follow them up over time. These studies have the advantage of individual retrospective data. Australia has several such studies that include mental-health measures. The Future Proofing Study, for instance, began in 2019 and is examining the onset and trajectory of mental-health conditions in 6,000 adolescents from age 13 onwards3. It is scheduled to finish this year, but could be funded to include a new cohort running from now until 2030.</p><p>How social media affects teen mental health: a missing link</p><p>Trials evaluating public-health interventions could also be used, if their timespan encompasses the social-media ban (the control groups in such trials are essentially longitudinal observational studies). One example is the Health4Life trial4, which is investigating the effect of six lifestyle interventions on the mental health of 11- to 13-year-olds in three Australian states. It could continue its follow-up assessments for longer than the current limit of 36 months.</p><p>An audit of existing trials and longitudinal studies, both in Australia and in potential comparator countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States, should be high on the priority list for the ban\u2019s advisory committee and researchers. But comparisons are likely to be complex, owing to probable differences in sample demographics, risk assessments, age in the cohorts and outcome measurements. It might also be tough to achieve safe and ethical access to these cohorts \u2014 teenagers and their parents might not have consented to have their data used beyond the original investigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proceed with caution</emphasis></p><p>Once any results are in hand, the question becomes how to interpret them.</p><p>The naive expectation is that any measure of mental health will show improvements after the ban is implemented. But even if the ban has this effect, it might not be clear in the data. Long-term trends such as geopolitical unrest or concern over climate change might mask any change, as could seasonal or one-off effects \u2014 for instance, floods, the emergence of new viruses, examinations at the time of measurement or changes in school admission procedures. And the ban itself could introduce a period of distress before longer-term effects are established.</p><p>What\u2019s more, it will be impossible to draw firm conclusions without establishing whether the legislation has actually reduced social-media use. The most direct way to do this is to get information from telecommunications companies and social-media platforms, but they are not obliged to provide data and might be unwilling if it causes legal or financial risks. If teens continue to access social media \u2014 through virtual private networks (VPNs) or the accounts of older siblings, friends or parents \u2014 any information from companies might be unreliable. And if new (unbanned) products for young people are developed by the platforms that are to be restricted, their use, and any effects on mental health, will further muddy the waters.</p><p>The fight to keep big tech in check: digital researchers are in \u2018David and Goliath\u2019 battle</p><p>Bringing together results from several approaches \u2014 such as those we have listed \u2014 can enable researchers to look for convergence and consistency, providing some assurance about conclusions. The clearest scenario would be if multiple data sources found evidence of improvements in mental health. In this case, each source would have internally consistent results (all hospitalization data on suicide and self-harm moving in the same direction, for instance) and data sets from several studies would show the expected direction in Australia but a different direction in other countries. This should be accompanied by independent data showing a decrease in technology use.</p><p>Researchers should be clear that, if there are no positive findings, we still cannot rule out any benefit of the ban. The lack of perfect data, and the fact that evidence from a natural experiment remains correlative, means that causation cannot be proven. Vested interests might well claim that the ban has not made a difference. Politicians and researchers should prepare the way in communications about the ban and about their proposed research by emphasizing that a null result does not mean the absence of an effect.</p><p>Despite all of the limitations, previous natural experiments have often yielded results that inform policy. For instance, data from 21 countries collected when COVID-19 restrictions were in place provided evidence that suicide rates were not increasing in those places. This helped to counter fears among some governments and health providers that the pandemic would be associated with a much higher risk of mental-health problems5. In another example, legalization of same-sex marriage has been associated with lower anxiety and depression in the Netherlands6 and across some US states7. This work was used to support the case for same-sex marriage in Australia. Furthermore, ongoing longitudinal studies have been used to examine the combined effects of Australian bushfires and COVID-19 on the mental health of young teens8, enabling policymakers to plan the size and distribution of services for suicide and depression risk. Similarly, the data from Australia\u2019s social-media ban might be used to inform evidence-based policy around social-media use in the country and elsewhere.</p><p>Although the Online Safety Amendment Act aims to reduce harms and improve mental health, it imposes substantial restrictions on the current freedoms and behaviour of young people and adds possible burdens on those who care for them. The worst possible outcome from policy and scientific perspectives would be a failure to collect and to use \u2014 as best we can \u2014 scientifically rigorous evidence of how this legislation affects Australia\u2019s youth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>Social-media bans won\u2019t work \u2014 there are better ways to keep kids safe</p><p>How social media affects teen mental health: a missing link</p><p>The fight to keep big tech in check: digital researchers are in \u2018David and Goliath\u2019 battle</p><p>Use fines from EU social-media act to fund research on adolescent mental health</p>", "publisher": "Nature", "instances": ["Despite all of the limitations, previous natural experiments have often yielded results that inform policy.

Daily data was obtained from an ACT air quality monitoring station from November 2019 to January 2020 (study period) and November 2018 to January 2019 (control period, no bushfire). The number and types of government-funded asthma medicine prescriptions were obtained from the Services Australia (government) website by searching under \u2018Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Item Reports' and using relevant item codes during the study and control periods. The medians for PM2.5 levels for the study period were significantly higher than those for the control period (p &lt; 0.001).

However, evidence indicates that mental health disabilities are not significant predictors of such violence; studies attribute only 4% of gun violence to individuals with mental health conditions. Focusing on mental health may inadvertently fuel stigma and deter individuals from seeking necessary care. It is crucial to separate mental health initiatives from gun violence legislation to avoid misrepresentation and ensure effective policy measures.

This continuous monitoring facilitates early intervention and personalized treatment plans. However, challenges persist, including the need for interdisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, engineers, and app developers to ensure that technological solutions align with clinical needs. Additionally, current app and wearable data often do not directly correspond to established psychiatric diagnoses, necessitating further research and development to bridge this gap effectively.

In the 1950s, significant pharmacological advancements introduced treatments for psychosis and depression, notably chlorpromazine for psychosis and monoamine oxidase inhibitors like isoniazid and iproniazid for depression. These discoveries led to the monoamine hypothesis, focusing on serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in depression treatment.

Parkinson's disease models have shown that semaglutide improves motor impairments induced by MPTP, rescues tyrosine hydroxylase levels, alleviates inflammation, reduces lipid peroxidation, and inhibits apoptosis pathways. Additionally, it increases autophagy-related protein expression, protecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum, and reduces the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein.

According to news reporting out of Creteil, France, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Record-breaking wildfires ravaged south-eastern Australia during the fire season 2019-2020. The intensity of the fires reached its paroxysmal phase at the turn of the year 2019-2020, when large pyro-cumulonimbi developed.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Agence Nationale De La Recherche; Centre National D'etudes Spatiales. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS): \"Pyro-convective activity injected biomass burning aerosols and gases in the upper-troposphere-lower-stratosphere (UTLS), producing a long-lasting perturbation to the atmospheric composition and the stratospheric aerosol layer. The large absorptivity of the biomass burning plume produced self-lofting of the plume and thus modified its vertical dynamics and horizontal dispersion. Another effect of the in-plume absorption was the generation of compact smoke-charged anticyclonic vortices which ascended up to 35 km altitude due to diabatic heating. We use observational and modelling description of this event to isolate the main vortex from the dominant Southern Hemispheric biomass burning aerosol plume. Entering this information into an offline radiative transfer model, and with hypotheses on the absorptivity and the angular scattering properties of the aerosol layer, we estimate the radiative heating rates (HRs) in the plume and the vortex. We found that the hemispheric-scale plume produced a HR of 0.08\u00b10.05 K d<sup>-1</sup> (from 0.01 to 0.15 K d<sup>-1</sup>, depending on the assumption on the aerosol optical properties), as a monthly average value for February 2020, which is strongly dependent on the assumptions on the aerosol optical properties and therefore on the plume ageing. We also found in-vortex HRs as large as 15-20 K d<sup>-1</sup> in the denser sections of the main vortex (8.4\u00b16.1 K d<sup>-1</sup> on average in the vortex). Our results suggest that radiatively heated ascending isolated vortices are likely dominated by small-sized strongly absorbing black carbon particles.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The hemispheric-scale and in-vortex HR estimates are consistent with the observed ensemble self-lofting (a few kilometres in 4 months) and the main isolated vortex rise ( 20 km in 2 months).

According to news reporting out of Federal University of Health Sciences by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Harmattan is a season characterized by dust, cold, and sub-humid trade winds in Sub-Saharan countries. It's similar to meteorological phenomena like Asian dust storms, Santa Ana winds, Australian bushfires, and Saharan dust in the Caribbean.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Federal University of Health Sciences: \"It causes profound changes in the cardiorespiratory system in apparently healthy individuals and increases the risk of hospitalization in susceptible individuals. Exposure to these extreme conditions has been associated with alterations in autonomic function and baroreceptor sensitivity thus resulting in dysregulation of blood pressure control mechanisms. Baroreceptors are critical regulators of hemodynamics and cardiovascular function. They play a vital role in the short-term responses to blood pressure perturbation and are essential for acute restoration of blood pressure following cold exposure. Harmattan wind contains a barrage of chemicals, dust, and particulate matters depending on industrialization, natural and human activities. Particulate matter from Harmattan dust can trigger systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, exacerbating endothelial dysfunction and impairing vascular reactivity thus contributing to the pathogenesis of alterations in baroreceptor insensitivity, and cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, fine particulate matter from dust may penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, activating pulmonary sensory receptors and eliciting reflex responses that influence autonomic tone.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The presence of rich acrolein smokes and non-essential heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, and mercury in Harmattan wind also reduces baroreflex sensitivity, culminating in a sustained increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure. This integrated review aims to provide valuable insights into how changes in each of these environmental constituents alter vital pathophysiologic and immunologic mechanisms of the body leading to baroreceptor instability and ultimately hemodynamic imbalance using available primary studies. Understanding this intricate interplay is crucial for implementing targeted interventions and informed public health strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of extreme environmental exposure and ultimately reduce poor health outcomes in the affected regions.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Unravelling the interplay between Harmattan wind and baroreflex functions: implications on environmental health and cardiovascular pathophysiology.

The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Federal University of Health Sciences: \"It causes profound changes in the cardiorespiratory system in apparently healthy individuals and increases the risk of hospitalization in susceptible individuals. Exposure to these extreme conditions has been associated with alterations in autonomic function and baroreceptor sensitivity thus resulting in dysregulation of blood pressure control mechanisms. Baroreceptors are critical regulators of hemodynamics and cardiovascular function. They play a vital role in the short-term responses to blood pressure perturbation and are essential for acute restoration of blood pressure following cold exposure.

Australia typically experiences every year what is known as \"bushfire season\" during the winter and spring for northern Australia and summer and fall for southern Australia. The hot, dry weather that is characteristic of Australia's climate creates the perfect environment for fires to break out and spread across the continent. The reason that these bushfires are receiving so much media attention is the sheer, almost unparalleled destruction these fires have caused. As of right now, at least 31 people have lost their lives, over 27 million acres of land have burned and around a half of a billion animals have been affected, according to the latest CNN report. There seems to be no end in sight.</p><p>The bushfires are a natural feature of Australia's climate. Most of the time these fires are due to natural causes, like a lightning strike. When lightning strikes the dry, water-deprived forests, a fire will break out, spreading rapidly given the abundance of kindling. Unfortunately, 24 people so far have been arrested for starting fires deliberately. This still does not account for the ferocity of this year's bushfires. What has changed this past year is the severity of the droughts. This past December, a heatwave rocked Australia, breaking the record for the highest nationwide average temperature. Coupled with the fact that this past spring has been the driest ever recorded, it makes sense that the Australian bushfires have been so deadly this year. There are many reasons why the fires are so bad this year, but all of them lead back to climate change. Ultimately, our earth is warming due in no small part to human pollution, which has affected our environment in catastrophic ways, including an extended and more severe Australian bushfire season. While climate change is scary enough, what is truly terrifying is the fact that people do not seem to care.</p><p>Now, before people get offended, I am measuring public concern about climate change by looking at the reaction to climate change induced disasters, like the extended Australian bushfires, by the United States government. While I understand that there has been increased awareness over the past few months by people protesting in favor of climate change reform, I would argue that it takes the power of a country's government to incite real change. If the public puts enough pressure on our government to take measures to fix climate change, eventually it will. The history of the United States has proven time and again that when the people put enough heat on the government, no matter how reluctant it is, it will bend to the will of the public, like during the Civil Rights Movement.</p><p>Why is the vast majority of the public not rising up and demanding change? There are four broad reasons why climate change does not invoke the same response as other threats. The first reason is that climate change is not a personal threat. Climate change does not have a face that we can plaster on every news outlet and demonize.</p><p>For example, look at the public outcry following 9/11. Not only did many Americans feel a loss of security within our country, we had someone that we could blame. The second reason is that climate change is slow. It is easier to identify and solve a problem when you can actually see it with your own two eyes. Although we are seeing some of the consequences of climate change now, none of them have appeared out of nowhere. For example, if you have lived in New England for an extended period of time, you may have noticed that the winters are becoming more erratic.</p><p>Many may remember that a few years back in Massachusetts it snowed on Halloween. This was major news at the time. Now, as the winters are slowly becoming more and more abnormal, when it is 50 degrees out in the dead of winter nobody bats an eye.</p><p>The third reason is that people tend to respond to immoral events. Remember the public outcry when the accusations started coming out against Harvey Weinstein? People pay attention when an event or a threat invokes an emotional response. Climate change just does not inspire those same feelings. People feel sorry for those affected by the Australian bushfires and act upon those feelings by sending aid. Climate change is too abstract to create a visceral reaction from the public. Furthermore, climate change is not an immediate threat. There are too many issues facing Americans in the presently in order for us to worry about the future.</p><p>So, back to the main question at hand: Why don't we care about the Australian bushfires? We don't care because we don't have to or want to. Climate change is a problem that we can put out of our minds because, quite frankly, many Americans will die before it has any major impact on our daily lives. Unfortunately for the younger generation, older individuals have decided to ignore this inconvenient truth. So, we have to do something before it is too late, whether that be voting out of office those who choose to ignore us or taking up the mantle ourselves.

The study, published in Science Advances, reveals how wildfires, such as the catastrophic 2019/20 Australian bushfires,affect the stratosphere in a previously unseen way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ozone layer, a critical shield that protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation,is on a path to recovery thanks to the Montreal Protocol. This landmark international treaty, adopted in 1987, successfully phased out the production of numerous substances responsible for ozone depletion. Over the past few decades, the ozone layer has shown significant signs of healing, a testament to global cooperation and environmental policy.</p><p>However, the stability of this vital atmospheric layer is now facing a new and unexpected challenge. During the 2019/20 Australian wildfires, researchers observed a dramatic increase in stratospheric aerosols tiny particles that canaffect climate, health, and atmospheric chemistry.</p><p>Using advanced satellite data and numerical models, the research team successfully demonstrated the impact of wildfires through a novel phenomenon: the smoke-charged vortex (SCV).</p><p>\"The SCV is a powerful, smoke-laden whirlpool that transports wildfire emissions into the stratosphere, reaching altitudes of up to 35 kilometers,\" said Prof. SU Hang from the Institute of Atmospheric Physicsof the Chinese Academy of Sciences, corresponding author of the study. 'This process led to at least a doubling of the aerosolload in the middle stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere. Once these aerosols reached such high altitudes, they initiated a series of heterogeneous reactions that affected ozone concentrations.\"</p><p>The international team discovered that these wildfire-induced aerosols facilitated heterogeneous chemical reactions, which paradoxically led to both ozone depletion and ozoneenhancement at different atmospheric layers.</p><p>While the lower stratosphere experienced significant ozone loss, they found that the enhanced chemical reactions on aerosols at higher altitudes, i.e., the middle stratosphere, led to an increasein ozone. In the southern mid-latitudes, this complex interplaywas ableto buffer approximately 40% (up to 70%) of the ozone depletion observed in the lower stratosphere in the months following the mega bushfire events.</p><p>So why does this matter?</p><p>\"Our study demonstrates an unexpected and crucial mechanism, by which the absorbing aerosols in wildfire smoke, such as black carbon, can induce and sustain HUGE smoke-charged vortices spanning thousands of kilometers. These vortices can persist for months, carrying aerosols deep into the stratosphere and affecting the ozone layer in different ways at different altitudes. This highlights the need for continued vigilance and research as climate change progresses,\" said Prof. CHENG Yafang, another corresponding author from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.</p><p>The ozone layer's role in filtering UV radiation is criticalto protecting all life forms on Earth. The success of the Montreal Protocol in reducing ozone-depleting substances was a monumental achievement, but the new findingsshow that natural events, exacerbated by climate change, pose additional risks to this fragile layer. As global warmingincreases thefrequency and intensity of wildfires, the formation of SCVs and their impact on the stratosphere could become more common, threatening the delicate balance of the ozone layer.</p><p>As we continue to grapple with climate change, understanding these newly discovered atmospheric processes is vital. This study opens new avenues for research into how wildfires and other climate-driven events mayaffect stratospheric chemistry and ozone dynamics in the future.</p>", "publisher": "States News Service", "instances": ["The following information was released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences:In a revelation that highlights the fragile balance of our planet's atmosphere, scientists from China, Germany, and the U. S. have uncovered an unexpected link between massive wildfire events and the chemistry of the ozone layer. The study, published in Science Advances, reveals how wildfires, such as the catastrophic 2019/20 Australian bushfires,affect the stratosphere in a previously unseen way. The ozone layer, a critical shield that protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation,is on a path to recovery thanks to the Montreal Protocol. This landmark international treaty, adopted in 1987, successfully phased out the production of numerous substances responsible for ozone depletion. Over the past few decades, the ozone layer has shown significant signs of healing, a testament to global cooperation and environmental policy. However, the stability of this vital atmospheric layer is now facing a new and unexpected challenge.

Mike Richard Holden, 27, was charged Wednesday in Darwin Local Court as fires rage across the country. An ankle bracelet he had to wear as part of his bail conditions for the sex charges linked him to several of the fires he is accused of starting.Holden was a volunteer with the Darwin River fire fighting unit in Australia's Northern Territory when, between January and September, he allegedly started the blazes.His lawyers argued the prosecution's case was circumstantial and that he had been at the scene of the fires as part of his volunteer duties. They said he did not fit the profile of a lone arsonist because he works as a mechanic and is in a relationship,NT News reported[1].However, the judge denied Holden bail after receiving 33 pages of what he called 'powerful' information collected by the ankle bracelet. He said there was great concern of Holden reoffending.

According to news reporting originating from Creteil, France, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As a consequence of extreme heat and drought, record-breaking wildfires developed and ravaged south-eastern Australia during the fire season 2019-2020. The fire strength reached its paroxysmal phase at the turn of the year 2019-2020.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Agence Nationale De La Recherche. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS): \"During this phase, pyrocumulonimbus clouds (pyroCb) developed and injected biomass burning aerosols and gases into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The UTLS aerosol layer was massively perturbed by these fires, with aerosol extinction increased by a factor of 3 in the visible spectral range in the Southern Hemisphere, with respect to a background atmosphere, and stratospheric aerosol optical depth reaching values as large as 0.015 in February 2020. Using the best available description of this event by observations, we estimate the radiative forcing (RF) of such perturbations of the Southern Hemispheric aerosol layer. We use offline radiative transfer modelling driven by observed information of the aerosol extinction perturbation and its spectral variability obtained from limb satellite measurements. Based on hypotheses on the absorptivity and the angular scattering properties of the aerosol layer, the regional (at three latitude bands in the Southern Hemisphere) clear-sky TOA (top-of-atmosphere) RF is found varying from small positive values to relatively large negative values (up to -2.0 W m<sup>-2</sup>), and the regional clear-sky surface RF is found to be consistently negative and reaching large values (up to -4.5 W m<sup>-2</sup>). We argue that clear-sky positive values are unlikely for this event, if the ageing/mixing of the biomass burning plume is mirrored by the evolution of its optical properties. Our best estimate for the area-weighted global-equivalent clear-sky RF is - 0.35 \u00b1 0.21 (TOA RF) and - 0.94 \u00b1 0.26 W m<sup>-2</sup> (surface RF), thus the strongest documented for a fire event and of comparable magnitude with the strongest volcanic eruptions of the post-Pinatubo era.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The surplus of RF at the surface, with respect to TOA, is due to absorption within the plume that has contributed to the generation of ascending smoke vortices in the stratosphere. Highly reflective underlying surfaces, like clouds, can nevertheless swap negative to positive TOA RF, with global average RF as high as +1.0 W m<sup>-2</sup> assuming highly absorbing particles.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Radiative impacts of the Australian bushfires 2019-2020 - Part 1: Large-scale radiative forcing.

According to news reporting originating from Creteil, France, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As a consequence of extreme heat and drought, record-breaking wildfires developed and ravaged south-eastern Australia during the fire season 2019-2020. The fire strength reached its paroxysmal phase at the turn of the year 2019-2020.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Agence Nationale De La Recherche. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS): \"During this phase, pyrocumulonimbus clouds (pyroCb) developed and injected biomass burning aerosols and gases into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The UTLS aerosol layer was massively perturbed by these fires, with aerosol extinction increased by a factor of 3 in the visible spectral range in the Southern Hemisphere, with respect to a background atmosphere, and stratospheric aerosol optical depth reaching values as large as 0.015 in February 2020. Using the best available description of this event by observations, we estimate the radiative forcing (RF) of such perturbations of the Southern Hemispheric aerosol layer. We use offline radiative transfer modelling driven by observed information of the aerosol extinction perturbation and its spectral variability obtained from limb satellite measurements. Based on hypotheses on the absorptivity and the angular scattering properties of the aerosol layer, the regional (at three latitude bands in the Southern Hemisphere) clear-sky TOA (top-of-atmosphere) RF is found varying from small positive values to relatively large negative values (up to -2.0 W m<sup>-2</sup>), and the regional clear-sky surface RF is found to be consistently negative and reaching large values (up to -4.5 W m<sup>-2</sup>). We argue that clear-sky positive values are unlikely for this event, if the ageing/mixing of the biomass burning plume is mirrored by the evolution of its optical properties. Our best estimate for the area-weighted global-equivalent clear-sky RF is - 0.35 \u00b1 0.21 (TOA RF) and - 0.94 \u00b1 0.26 W m<sup>-2</sup> (surface RF), thus the strongest documented for a fire event and of comparable magnitude with the strongest volcanic eruptions of the post-Pinatubo era.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The surplus of RF at the surface, with respect to TOA, is due to absorption within the plume that has contributed to the generation of ascending smoke vortices in the stratosphere. Highly reflective underlying surfaces, like clouds, can nevertheless swap negative to positive TOA RF, with global average RF as high as +1.0 W m<sup>-2</sup> assuming highly absorbing particles.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Radiative impacts of the Australian bushfires 2019-2020 - Part 1: Large-scale radiative forcing.

The continent was ablaze for almost a month and caused severe disruption to the climate. More than 18 million hectares of land was burnt, with the states of New South Wales and Victoria being affected the worst which destroyed over 5,900 houses, killing over 33 people and about 1.2 billion animals.</p><p>The fires erupted in the month of December which is usually the driest month as it is summer in the southern hemisphere. The real cause of the fires is the Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon that balances the climate between Australia and East Africa. When the regions of the ocean are warm around Australia, the regions of the ocean around Africa are cooler, and vice versa. When this occurs, the region with the warm current receives rainfall because wind travels from cooler region to warmer region. This year the difference was highest ever recorded in sixty years which resulted in really dry climate in Australia and flooding in East Africa. The resultant was a month long forest fire.</p><p>The wildlife in Australia is very indigenous to the country. Therefore, a lot of species are believed to be endangered or extinct such as the the koala bears. Although the koala bears aren't extinct, they are termed as \"functionally extinct\", which means that they do not play a role in the ecosystem and are on the verge of extinction. Consequently, the fires killed several koalas and destroyed their natural habitat.</p><p>The impact of the fires was also seen in the major cities as the cities were engulfed by the smoke that was generated through the fires resulting in worst air quality index. This created a severe health risk as the smoke can cause eye irritation and respiratory disorders. The loads of smoke that was created crossed the country and affected New Zealand and South American countries like Argentina and Chile. The smoke created through the bush fires created their own weather that created flash floods and heavy rain fall at many places.</p><p>The nation has been recording higher than average temperatures every year and scientists are predicting hotter and drier climate which would result in more intense and frequent fires. The climate change has severely affected our planet and the impacts are seen at different locations. We must therefore look deeply into the matter of climate change that affects the entire humanity.</p>", "publisher": "University Wire", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 19, "title": "CustomUSB Donates 10% of Sales to Fight Australian Bushfires", "published": "2020-02-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">PR Newswire</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0In an effort to help Australian firefighters combat the destructive bushfires across the country, CustomUSB donated 10% of the proceeds from popular products (January 8 to January 17) to the\u00a0New South Wales Rural Fire Service.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1089376/CustomUSB_Logo.jpg\"/></p><p>\"Not only are we passionate about ourcustom promotional productsand customers,\" says CustomUSB CEORussell Chatskis, \"but we're also committed to helping others, and we wanted to offer support in any way we could.\"</p><p>How to Help</p><p>Australia's long road to recovery has only just begun.

An estimated billion animals, and many more bats and insects, are likely to die in total over the coming weeks and months as a result of lost habitat and food sources. This loss is part of a much bigger picture of a world where biodiversity is in steep decline. We are losing wildlife at an ever-increasing scale across the planet, with impacts to ecosystems vital for our own global food production. The world's terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in forests: they are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. So, when forests burn, the biodiversity on which humans depend for their long-term survival also disappears in the inferno. With over 1 million species currently facing extinction if we continue with business as usual, extreme weather events such \"megafires\" become an increasing matter of concern for species survival.</p><p>A dead Australian native bird is seen on ashes on the ground near Eden, Australia January 7, 2020.</p><p>Photo by: REUTERS/Tracey Nearmy</p><p>3. Public health</p><p>As a result of intense smoke and air pollution stemming from the fires, in January 2020 reports indicated that Canberra measured the worst air quality index of any major city in the world. Wildfires produce harmful smoke which can cause fatalities. Wildfires produce fine particle air pollution, which is directly threatens human health even during relatively short exposures. Close to the fires, smoke is a health risk because it contains a mixture of hazardous gases and particles that can irritate the eyes and the respiratory system. The effects of smoke exposure and inhalation range from eye and respiratory tract irritation to more serious disorders, including reduced lung function, bronchitis, exacerbated asthma and premature death. Exposure to particulate matter is the main public health threat from short-term exposure to wildfire smoke. According to the World Health Organization, older people, people with cardiorespiratory diseases or chronic illnesses, children, and people who work outdoors are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>People wear breathing masks to protect themselves from a thick smoke haze from the bushfires, in Melbourne, Australia January 14, 2020.

Picture by Mark J Toomey, Pixabay.</p><p>7. Climate feedback loops</p><p>The bushfires have not only been made more likely and intense by climate change, they also add to it. Until the 20192020 Australian bushfire season, the forests in Australia were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in bushfires across the country. This would mean the forests achieved net zero emissions. However, global warming is making bushfires burn more intensely and frequently and the 20192020 bushfires have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the Copernicus monitoring programme. This is as much as Australia's average annual carbon dioxide emissions in just the past three months. These will increase Australia's annual greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, and heighten the likelihood of recurring megafires that will release yet more emissions. This is a deeply concerning climate feedback loop.</p><p>Thick plumes of smoke rise from bushfires at the coast of East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia January 4, 2020 in this aerial picture taken from AMSA Challenger jet. Photo by Australian Maritime Safety Authority/Handout via REUTERS</p><p>8. Environmental costs: pollution</p><p>Ash from the fires has landed in school playgrounds, backyards, and is being washed up on Australia's beaches and into freshwater stores and water catchments. Drinking water catchments are typically forested areas, and so are vulnerable to bushfire pollution. Bushfire ash contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria produce chemicals which may cause a range of water quality problems, including poor taste and odour, and sometimes toxic chemicals. During a blaze, plumes of smoke, ash and other debris catch on the wind and scatter across the landscape. Sometimes they blow over the ocean, where they add nutrients. When burned soils flow into streams and rivers, they fertilize water plants and algae. The extra nutrients can have benefits in moderation but too much can over-fertilize and cause excess algal growth. Algae absorb oxygen in the water in order to grow, and deplete dissolved oxygen when they die and decompose, which can asphyxiate fish and other marine life, with localized impacts to biodiversity. The same can be true in ocean environments, where smoke has shown to have a negative impact on marine ecosystems in several past incidents: haze from record wildfires in Indonesia killed coral reefs in the late 1990s, according to a study in Science, as iron-rich smoke billowed out over the coast and fertilized the water, causing a huge plankton bloom. The resulting so-called red tide asphyxiated coral reefs around the Mentawai Islands, off southwest Sumatra.</p><p>Ash and fire debris are washed up on Boydtown Beach near the Nullica River in Eden, Australia January 7, 2020.</p><p>Photo by: REUTERS/Tracey Nearmy</p><p>9. Agricultural impacts</p><p>The bushfires have scorched pasture, destroyed livestock and razed vineyards, with regrowth and recovery likely to stretch water resources already challenged by drought. Reports indicate that the country's dairy supply will likely be hit hardest, with Victoria and New South WalesAustralia's key milk-producing statessuffering the greatest loss of farmland and infrastructure damage. Meat, wool, and honey output may also be impacted. About 13 per cent of the national sheep flock is in regions that have been significantly impacted and a further 17 per cent in regions partially impacted, according to Meat and Livestock Australia. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2019 report on Climate Change and Land found that climate change has already affected food security and the agriculture industry due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events (high confidence). In some dryland areas, increased land surface air temperature and evapotranspiration and decreased precipitation amount, in interaction with climate variability and human activities, have contributed to desertification. These areas include Australia.</p><p>Sheep make their way in the fire grounds near Bega, News South Wales, Australia January 8, 2020.</p><p>Photo by: REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis</p><p>10. Public attitudes are changing</p><p>While Australians are reported to have been subject to misinformation campaigns and targeted attempts to undermine the link between climate change and more intense bushfires, this bushfire season has given Australians, and the watching world, an insight into the humanitarian, ecological and economic catastrophes of a changing and warming climate.

From devastating hurricanes and typhoons to prolonged droughts and wildfires, the frequency and intensity of these events have increased markedly in recent decades. This article explores the intersection of extreme weather events with capital flows, sustainable investment, and the broader finance sector, providing insights into how businesses and investors are navigating these turbulent times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rising Tide of Extreme Weather Events</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact of climate change on weather patterns has been well-documented. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the number of extreme weather events has increased significantly, with 2020 seeing a record number of climate-related disasters. These events not only cause immediate physical damage but also lead to long-term economic disruptions.</p><p>Economic Consequences</p><p>Extreme weather events can disrupt supply chains, damage infrastructure, and displace communities. For instance, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 caused an estimated $125 billion in damage in the United States, impacting industries ranging from oil production to real estate. Similarly, the Australian bushfires of 2019-2020 resulted in losses exceeding $100 billion, affecting tourism, agriculture, and insurance sectors.</p><p>Insurance and Reinsurance Markets</p><p>The insurance industry has been particularly affected by the rising number of natural disasters. Insurers are facing higher claims payouts, leading to increased premiums and more stringent underwriting standards. Reinsurance markets are also feeling the pressure, with firms needing to reassess their risk models and capital reserves to account for the heightened likelihood of extreme weather events.</p><p>Capital Flows in the Face of Climate Risk</p><p>Capital flows are increasingly influenced by the need to manage climate risk. Investors are becoming more discerning, seeking to allocate funds in ways that mitigate potential losses from climate-related disruptions.</p><p>Divestment from High-Risk Sectors</p><p>A growing trend is the divestment from sectors that are highly vulnerable to extreme weather events or contribute significantly to climate change. Fossil fuel companies, for example, have seen significant divestment as investors seek to reduce their exposure to stranded assets. The Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitments Database reports that over 1,200 institutions, managing assets worth $14.6 trillion, have committed to divest from fossil fuels as of 2023.</p><p>Investment in Resilient Infrastructure</p><p>Conversely, there is a surge in investment in resilient infrastructure. Projects that enhance the durability of buildings, roads, and other critical infrastructure against extreme weather are attracting significant capital. For instance, green bonds issued to fund climate-resilient infrastructure projects reached $269.5 billion in 2020, a substantial increase from previous years.</p><p>Climate Adaptation Funds</p><p>Climate adaptation funds are becoming a vital component of capital flows. These funds aim to finance projects that help communities adapt to the changing climate, such as flood defences, drought-resistant crops, and improved water management systems. The Green Climate Fund, established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has mobilised over $10 billion for climate adaptation and mitigation projects in developing countries.</p><p>The Role of Sustainable Investment</p><p>Sustainable investment, which integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions, is gaining momentum as a response to the challenges posed by extreme weather events.</p><p>ESG Integration</p><p>Investors are increasingly recognising that ESG factors, particularly those related to environmental sustainability, are critical in assessing the long-term viability of investments. Companies with strong environmental practices are seen as better positioned to withstand and adapt to climate-related disruptions. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA), global sustainable investment reached $35.3 trillion in 2020, representing 36% of all professionally managed assets.</p><p>Green Finance</p><p>Green finance, which includes a range of financial products designed to support environmentally sustainable projects, is on the rise. Green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and climate-focused equity funds are attracting significant interest from investors. The green bond market, in particular, has grown exponentially, with cumulative issuance surpassing $1 trillion by 2020.</p><p>Impact Investing</p><p>Impact investing, which aims to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impacts alongside financial returns, is another critical trend. Investors are increasingly looking to support projects that directly address climate change and its effects. For example, investments in renewable energy projects not only provide financial returns but also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Financial Sector's Response to Extreme Weather</p><p>The financial sector is adopting various strategies to manage the risks and opportunities associated with extreme weather events.</p><p>Risk Assessment and Management</p><p>Financial institutions are enhancing their risk assessment frameworks to better account for climate-related risks. Stress testing and scenario analysis are becoming standard practices to evaluate the potential impact of extreme weather events on portfolios. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides guidelines that help companies and investors integrate climate-related risks into their financial reporting.</p><p>Sustainable Finance Regulations</p><p>Regulators are also stepping in to promote sustainable finance. The European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requires financial market participants to disclose how they integrate sustainability risks into their investment decisions. This regulation aims to increase transparency and steer capital towards sustainable investments.</p><p>Collaboration and Innovation</p><p>Collaboration between public and private sectors is crucial in addressing the challenges posed by extreme weather. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are emerging as effective models for financing large-scale, climate-resilient infrastructure projects. Moreover, technological innovation is playing a significant role. Advances in climate modelling, data analytics, and satellite technology are providing valuable insights into weather patterns and helping to develop more accurate risk assessments.</p><p>Future Outlook: Navigating the Challenges Ahead</p><p>As extreme weather events continue to pose significant challenges, the financial sector must evolve to manage these risks and seize new opportunities. Several key trends are likely to shape the future landscape of capital flows and sustainable investment.</p><p>Increased Focus on Climate Resilience</p><p>Building climate resilience will become a central theme in investment strategies. Investors will prioritise assets and projects that demonstrate robust resilience to climate risks. This focus on resilience will drive demand for innovative solutions and technologies that enhance the ability of communities and businesses to withstand extreme weather events.</p><p>Enhanced Regulatory Frameworks</p><p>Regulatory frameworks are expected to evolve further to support sustainable finance. Governments and regulatory bodies will likely introduce more stringent requirements for climate risk disclosure and sustainable investment practices. These regulations will enhance transparency and accountability, fostering a more sustainable financial ecosystem.</p><p>Growth of Sustainable Finance Instruments</p><p>The market for sustainable finance instruments is set to expand. Green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and other innovative financial products will continue to attract capital. Additionally, new instruments tailored to address specific climate risks, such as catastrophe bonds, will gain prominence.</p><p>Integration of ESG into Mainstream Investing</p><p>The integration of ESG factors into mainstream investing will accelerate. Asset managers and institutional investors will increasingly incorporate ESG criteria into their investment processes, recognising the material impact of environmental risks on financial performance. This shift will drive greater alignment between financial returns and sustainability outcomes.</p><p>Collaboration for Climate Action</p><p>Collaboration between stakeholders will be essential in addressing the complex challenges posed by extreme weather events. Governments, businesses, financial institutions, and civil society must work together to develop comprehensive strategies for climate adaptation and mitigation. Public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives will play a crucial role in mobilising resources and driving meaningful action.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Extreme weather events are reshaping the financial landscape, influencing capital flows, and driving the adoption of sustainable investment practices. As the frequency and intensity of these events continue to rise, investors and financial institutions must adapt to manage the associated risks and opportunities. By integrating climate resilience into investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment frameworks, and fostering collaboration, the financial sector can play a pivotal role in building a more sustainable and resilient future. Through these efforts, capital flows can be directed towards projects and initiatives that not only deliver financial returns but also contribute to a more sustainable and climate-resilient world.</p><p> COPYRIGHT 2022 NEW STATESMAN MEDIA GROUP LTD.  </p>", "publisher": "Capital Monitor", "instances": ["The Rising Tide of Extreme Weather EventsThe impact of climate change on weather patterns has been well-documented.

The situation garners more and more media attention by the day as we enter the third month of fires. \"These are the worst bushfires in Australian history,\" said 5th Year ME Major and Australian student Hayden Bartsch, \"Fortunately, the lives lost in the fires have not matched those of the 2009 bushfires, but the long term environmental, economic and social outcomes will</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">be devastating.\"</p><p>Australia's wildfire crisis is an ongoing battle that will continue for months to come. \"A billion animals have died, and that number is rising every day,\" said 3rd-Year EAS Major Hannah Verboncoeur, \"Over 60 thousand square kilometers of land has been incinerated by the fires, destroying the habitats of many animals that may have tried to repopulate the area in the future. People's homes are being destroyed, and people relocated. The ecosystems and people of Australia will forever face the impacts of the fires.\"</p><p>The historical event is highlighting global issues that have been brought on by climate change. \"The data are in, and 2019 was the warmest and driest year in Australia ever recorded, setting up the conditions for extreme flammability,\" Dr. Cobb Director of the Global Change Program at Tech said. \"Unfortunately, this is part of a long-term trend strongly linked to climate change, with heat extremes and drought conditions expected to worsen in coming decades. These deadly bushfires are yet another horrific taste of our climate future should we fail to curb the rise of greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade or two.\"</p><p>Many around the world and included at Tech have highlighted the systemic issues that allowed the situation to take place. \"As an Earth and Atmospheric Science major,\" said Verboncoeur, \"I feel a responsibility to educate both myself and the public about environmentally devastating events like the fires in Australia. These horrifying series of fires will change Australia's ecosystems and impact the people there forever. The climate of Australia has been the warmest it's been in over 100 years, and the warming trend continues to rise. This is the new normal for regions all over the world as more communities and Earth systems face the catastrophic impacts of climate change.\"</p><p>Verboncoeur continued, \"These fires aren't just ravishing the ecosystems and air quality of Australia either. Entire infrastructures, cities, and surrounding countries are being impacted as well. In New Zealand, for example, ash from the fires is covering glaciers, making their surface darker and, in turn, absorb more incoming light as heat.\"</p><p>Many people are dedicating their time and effort to ensure that the fires are put out. \"The heroes who are fighting the fires,\" said Hayden Bartsch, \"Tens of thousands of the men and women fighting the fires are volunteers working [15 plus] hour shifts with minimal breaks. Additionally, 3,000 army reservists were deployed to help fight the fires for the first time in history.\"</p><p>What comes next is a question on many minds as the blaze continues. \"Preventative measures must be taken globally,\" said Verboncoeur, \"Whether that's in the political realm with Environmental policy decisions, educationally with more extensive Earth Science curricula in schools or even within the fields of engineering as we prepare our world and communities with infrastructure to adapt to this new normal. Our jobs as people who can protect the environment and prevent much of our influence on climate change should be to employ what skills we have to help work towards a global effort against climate change.</p><p>While progress is needed, there are some obstacles impeding progress. \"It is important to note that there has been a pushback by the Greens Party,\" said Bartsch, \"In the past for years against controlled back burning. Back burning is a practice that dates all the way back to the native inhabitants. It's a proven tactic that wasn't exercised enough before these bushfires.\"</p><p>This historical crisis will carry on for months to come, but many people believe in perseverance. \"Australians are damn tough,\" said Bartsch, \"Bushfires are a common occurrence throughout Australian history, and we always bounce back. Our wildlife have adapted to survive these circumstances. In fact, some plant species rely on fires for germination. It's a shocking situation, but the Australian people have hearts forged in fire - we will come together and persevere through these tough times, with or without our government behind us.\"</p>", "publisher": "University Wire", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 30, "title": "Save the Children: Australian Bushfires - Children's Mental Health Needs to Be a Key Part of Response and Recovery", "published": "2020-01-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Save the Children issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Save the Children is warning of the importance of addressing the long-term mental health needs of children impacted by the devastating Australian bushfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thousands of children have been affected by the fires, which have burned through more than 38,610 square miles--larger than Maine--since September.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experiencing a disaster of this nature can have a harrowing long-term impact on a person's emotional wellbeing, especially for children if they are not provided with the right support.</p><p>\"Bushfires are incredibly frightening events and the psychological toll can last a very long time if not properly addressed,\" said Paul Ronalds, head of Save the Children in Australia.</p><p>\"For children, there is so much uncertainty around what's happening.

In an effort to understand the effects of these devastating events on the Christchurch Muslim community, the University of Otago, Christchurch's Department of Psychological Medicine initiated The March 15 Project - to study the psychological aftermath of the terrorist attacks, and to understand them within the context of similar incidents internationally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Preliminary findings from The March 15 Project were presented in a recent day-long symposium held at the campus' Rolleston Lecture Theatre on 21 March, showcasing work from the Project's research team alongside guest lectures from international speakers in the field of incident trauma.</p><p>The symposium opened with a karakia from kaumatua Rangihau Te Moana, followed by a dua from Imam Ibrahim Abdelhalim. Dean and Head of Campus Professor Suzanne Pitama welcomed attendees - including many from the city's Muslim community.</p><p>March 15 Project researchers Associate Professor Caroline Bell and Dr Ruqayya Sulaiman-Hill gave the first presentation, discussing findings from the first phase of their long-term study into the impacts on members of the community directly affected by the attacks. They spoke of the challenges associated with conducting research in such a highly-exposed population, and the requirements they needed to meet to establish a culturally-responsive, participatory and trauma-informed design process.</p><p>They noted the impacts and challenges the tragedy inflicted upon the well-being and mental health of closely-affected community members. However, they also spoke of self-reported positive outcomes from many participants - including high levels of measures rating religious coping and post traumatic growth. A qualitative study, presented by Project co-researcher Dr Shaystah Dean, provided a deeper understanding of some of the unique challenges participants faced and how they coped. The Project team concluded that taken together, these findings will be helpful for the Muslim community in planning the ongoing support services they require.</p><p>The March 15 Project is collaborative, involving the University of Otago, Christchurch, University of Canterbury and Te Whatu Ora Canterbury, and is funded the Health Research Council of New Zealand and the Canterbury Medical Research Foundation.</p><p>This was followed by a presentation from Professor Martin Dorahy from the University of Canterbury, discussing the impacts of the mosque attacks on the New Zealand population as a whole. Using data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Surveys recorded both before and after the attacks, his findings show both an increase in terrorism anxiety and an increase in the sense of \"community\" following the incidents, yet no reported changes in either psychological distress or wellbeing. He discussed how this delivers insight into the psychological implications of politically-motivated violence on the wider population when terrorism is directed toward a specific minority group.</p><p>In the aftermath of the attacks, members of the March 15 Project research team, including Associate Professor Bell and Head of the Department of Psychological Medicine, Professor Richard Porter, consulted widely with international researchers - who they say were generous in giving of their time and expertise.</p><p>One such researcher was Professor Lori Zoellner from the University of Washington's Department of Psychology, and Director of the University of Washington Centre for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress in Seattle. Professor Zoellner, the first of two international guest speakers to present at the symposium, reported findings from her ground-breaking Islamic faith-based, community-led program, developed to support Somali refugees in the United States and a similar programme in Somalia.</p><p>Following lunch and prayers, Linwood mosque survivor and researcher Dr Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, discussed findings from his work, outlining the positive impacts of publicly written messages and acts of aroha on those most closely affected by the mosque attacks. Mazhar provided a personal and moving description of this, explaining how widely and swiftly this community support spread. His research examines how aroha can combat negative and racist messages promulgated through social media.</p><p>Professor David Forbes, Director of the Phoenix Australia Centre for Post Traumatic Mental Health from within the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, was the symposium's second international guest speaker. He provided an overview of his extensive experience managing community responses following trauma, with a focus on the Australian bushfires. He also discussed the impacts of multiple trauma on populations as a whole, and various interventions for recovery.</p><p>Concluding the symposium on a positive note, Professor Porter discussed findings from his body of research into the effects of trauma on the brain.

The dramatic discovery in the mid-1980s of the seasonal \u2018hole\u2019 in the ozone layer over the Southern Hemisphere polar region led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the phasing out of CFCs worldwide and the expected gradual recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer \u2014 which is still not complete, owing to the long residence time of CFCs in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. When the ozone hole was first observed, the challenge for atmospheric chemists was to explain its unique seasonal and spatial characteristics. At the time, observations clearly linked the hole\u2019s appearance to anthropogenic chlorine, but there was no chemical explanation for its intensity and timing.</p><p>A major breakthrough came from theoretical and laboratory studies that pinpointed reactions occurring on the surfaces of stratospheric ice particles6,7, which make up the iridescent \u2018mother-of-pearl\u2019 clouds seen in polar regions. Throughout the dark polar winter, those surfaces efficiently catalyse reactions of hydrogen chloride (HCl, mostly derived from the breakdown of CFCs) with other relatively inert chlorine-containing gases, including chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), to release \u2018photoactive\u2019 forms of chlorine that become reactive when irradiated by light. The return of sunlight in the polar spring transforms those forms of chlorine into a burst of highly reactive chlorine radicals, which catalyse processes that cause ozone loss. The ice particles further contribute to ozone depletion by removing certain nitrogen oxides (N2O5 and HNO3) from the atmosphere; these compounds act as reservoirs for nitrogen oxide radicals, which, if present, limit the efficiency of chlorine-catalysed ozone destruction6,7.</p><p>Ozone mystery laid to rest</p><p>The properties of ice make it particularly well suited to catalysing chlorine activation and to removing nitrogen oxides at the low temperatures of the stratosphere, but there are clues that other particle types might also have a role. The powerful eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 injected large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere. After being transported long distances and oxidized, this gas became a layer of reflective sulfuric acid particles over much of the globe. In addition to reducing global average surface temperatures by 0.5 \u00b0C for more than a year, these particles also catalysed ozone loss in the stratosphere \u2014 not just over polar regions, but throughout the mid-latitudes8. </p><p>Fast-forward 30 years to the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfires, which were another source of stratospheric particles, but with a very different chemical profile.

Solomon <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al</emphasis>. now report that particulate matter from wildfire smoke contributes to the destruction of stratospheric ozone by efficiently absorbing HCl gas, thereby enhancing chemical activation of ozone-destroying chlorine radicals (Fig. 1). The authors also provide a glimpse of the properties of wildfire smoke particles in the stratosphere, which are challenging to observe directly or to recreate in the laboratory owing to their compositional complexity and the extreme conditions of the stratosphere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Figure 1 | A mechanism for wildfire-driven ozone depletion.</emphasis> Smoke particles from intense wildfires can enter the stratosphere. Solomon <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis>4 report that smoke particles in the stratosphere can absorb hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas, derived mostly from the breakdown of anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbon compounds (not shown). This allows the particles to catalyse the conversion of other chlorine-containing gases, such as chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), to \u2018photoreactive\u2019 chlorine compounds. When irradiated by ultraviolet light from the Sun, the photoreactive compounds produce chlorine radicals that catalytically destroy ozone, depleting its concentration in the stratosphere.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Particles in wildfire smoke consist mostly of soot and organic carbon material, and are not immediately obvious candidates for enhancing chlorine activation and nitrogen oxide sequestration. Under dry conditions, such particles are generally less reactive than in ice or aqueous solutions9. Moreover, particles that are made up mostly of oxygenated organic compounds (such as those in smoke), and that might otherwise take up liquid water to better facilitate chlorine activation, can be glass-like at the cold temperatures and dry conditions of the lower stratosphere10. Reactant gases would not dissolve and diffuse into glassy particles as well as they would into liquid droplets. However, efficient HCl ionization and chlorine-activation reactions can occur on frozen polar stratospheric ice-particle surfaces as a result of the formation of disordered surface regions under stratospheric conditions11, and this could also be true for glassy particles. </p><p>The first clue that smoke particles in the stratosphere might not be in a dry, glassy state came from an analysis of data acquired by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer, a project in which the atmosphere is monitored by a spectrometer on a space satellite. This suggested that the Australian wildfire particles in the stratosphere contain both oxygenated organic material and adsorbed water2.</p><p>Cloud droplets aid the production of formic acid in the atmosphere</p><p>Solomon<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> et al.</emphasis> now build on this observation, using thermodynamic arguments to assert that complex mixtures of oxygenated organic material are likely to be liquid-like, even at low stratospheric temperatures. They also draw on an intriguing, albeit limited, set of laboratory studies of HCl solubility in mixtures of organic acids and water. These show that the potential for such mixtures to absorb HCl is even higher than that for sulfuric acid (the more common component of stratospheric particles). In other words, smoke particles have a higher potential to promote ozone depletion than was previously thought. On this basis, Solomon and colleagues are able to reproduce the ozone depletion observed during the Australian wildfires, using numerical modelling that combines their proposed process with the known chemistry of chlorine activation and chlorine-catalysed ozone destruction.</p><p>The study makes it clear that chlorine activation by smoke particles is the missing piece of the wildfire ozone-depletion puzzle. However, the findings raise questions about the physical state and chemistry of smoke particles in the stratosphere, questions that should now be further explored with field observations and laboratory studies under realistic conditions. Are these particles liquid-like, glassy or in some other state? And is a liquid-like state necessary to catalyse chlorine activation efficiently?</p><p>The findings also raise further questions about proposals to intentionally inject particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and cool the planet \u2014 a climate-engineering approach called solar-radiation management. It has been proposed that, by using particles other than sulfuric acid, negative side effects such as ozone depletion and stratospheric warming could be bypassed or reduced12. Solomon and colleagues\u2019 study underscores the possibility that various particle types, fresh or after chemical transformation in the stratosphere, might still promote ozone depletion for a few decades as stratospheric chlorine levels slowly decline. Any candidate material for stratospheric injection must, at a minimum, be studied carefully in the laboratory, under simulated conditions of the stratosphere.</p><p>The Australian bushfire season of 2019\u201320 was extreme, but large wildfires and the resulting pyrocumulonimbus clouds are likely to become increasingly frequent and intense as the climate changes. The resulting injections of smoke into the upper atmosphere might therefore slow or temporarily disrupt the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer. In this context, Solomon and colleagues\u2019 findings emphasize the need for atmospheric chemists to better understand the properties and reactivity of common, but complex, atmospheric particle types, such as those produced from biomass burning, in the cold and dry upper atmosphere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>Read the paper: Chlorine activation and enhanced ozone depletion induced by wildfire aerosol</p><p>Ozone mystery laid to rest</p><p>Evidence of illegal emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals</p><p>Cloud droplets aid the production of formic acid in the atmosphere</p><p>See all News &amp; Views</p>", "publisher": "Nature", "instances": ["Unexpected smoke-particle chemistry is shown to be the link between intense wildfires and stratospheric ozone loss.

During a trip to California to visit family, associate professor of physics Imre Bartos, Ph.D., had an up-close look at the devastation caused by uncontrolled wildfires.</p><p>\"As a scientist, I wondered why it took days to spot a fire once it was sparked, giving it time to become catastrophic,\" said Bartos, FNN's chief technology officer whose day job is finding distant black hole collisions in the universe.</p><p>Bartos took his question to Kereszy, a PhD student in the department at the time who was studying lightning properties with UF's lightning lab.</p><p>\"Imre's question struck a chord with me,\" Kereszy said. \"He and his astrophysics colleagues could look back millions of years and map out distant galaxies, but we cannot find a fire that's 20 miles away.\"</p><p>FNN has created what could be called a 21st century watch tower, locating dangerous lightning-sparked fires in seconds, so fire managers can decide whether to put them out or let them burn.</p><p>Some fires are good -- nature's way of clearing out the dead litter on the forest floor that fuels the bad fires.

According to news originating from Heidelberg, Germany, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"We report on airborne limb and nadir measurements of vertical profiles and total vertical column densities (VCDs) of glyoxal (C [ [2] ] H [ [2] ] O [ [2] ] ) in the troposphere, which were performed aboard the German research aircraft HALO (High Altitude and LOng Range) in different regions and seasons around the globe between 2014 and 2019. The airborne nadir and integrated limb profiles agree excellently among each other.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; European Space Agency. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Heidelberg University: \"Our airborne observations are further compared to collocated glyoxal measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with good agreement between both data sets for glyoxal observations in (1) pristine terrestrial, (2) pristine marine, (3) mixed polluted, and (4) biomass-burning-affected air masses with high glyoxal concentrations. Exceptions to the overall good agreement are observations of (1) faint and aged biomass burning plumes over the oceans and (2) of low-lying biomass burning or anthropogenic plumes in the terrestrial or marine boundary layer, both of which contain elevated glyoxal that is mostly not captured by TROPOMI. These differences in airborne and satellite-detected glyoxal are most likely caused by the overall small contribution of plumes of a limited extent to the total glyoxal absorption in the atmosphere and the difficulty in remotely detecting weak absorbers located close to low reflective surfaces (e.g. the ocean in the visible wavelength range) or within dense aerosol layers. Observations of glyoxal in aged biomass burning plumes (e.g. observed over the tropical Atlantic off the coast of West Africa in summer 2018, off the coast of Brazil by the end of the dry season 2019, and the East China Sea in spring 2018) could be traced back to related wildfires, such as a plume crossing over the Drake Passage that originated from the Australian bushfires in late 2019. Our observations of glyoxal in such aged biomass burning plumes confirm recent findings of enhanced glyoxal and presumably secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in aged wildfire plumes from yet-to-be-identified, longer-lived organic precursor molecules (e.g. aromatics, acetylene, or aliphatic compounds) co-emitted in the fires. Furthermore, elevated glyoxal (median 44 ppt - parts per trillion), as compared to other marine regions (median 10-19 ppt), is observed in the boundary layer over the tropical oceans, which is well in agreement with previous reports. The airborne data sets are further compared to glyoxal simulations performed with the global atmosphere chemistry model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). When using an EMAC set up that resembles recent EMAC studies focusing on complex chemistry, reasonable agreement is found for pristine air masses (e.g. the unperturbed free and upper troposphere), but a notable glyoxal overestimation of the model exists for regions with high emissions of glyoxal and glyoxal-producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the biosphere (e.g. the Amazon). In all other investigated regions, the model underpredicts glyoxal to varying degrees, in particular when probing mixed emissions from anthropogenic activities (e.g. over continental Europe, the Mediterranean, and East China Sea) and potentially from the sea (e.g. the tropical oceans).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Also, the model tends to largely underpredict glyoxal in city plumes and aged biomass burning plumes. The potential causes for these differences are likely to be multifaceted, but they all point to missing glyoxal sources from the degradation of the mixture of potentially longer-chained organic compounds emitted from anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, and from the organic microlayer of the sea surface.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Airborne glyoxal measurements in the marine and continental atmosphere: comparison with TROPOMI observations and EMAC simulations.

Coastal communities are already struggling to keep up with sea-level rise; yet future rates of sea-level rise will outpace those of the present, which have already accelerated at least 3-fold in comparison to 20th century rates.9 Coastal flooding frequency along U.S. coastlines has already increased by a factor of 2-3 along most of the Atlantic and Gulf coast between 1990 and 2020 and the occurrence of high tide flooding events is accelerating (Fig. 1).10</p><p>Sea level is rising due to the combined impacts of the expansion of seawater as the ocean continues to warm and the melting of land-based ice such as glaciers and ice sheets.2 The polar ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are melting at accelerating rates and will become the increasingly dominant factor contributing to sea-level rise this century.2</p><p>* * *</p><p>Rapid Jumps and Tipping Points</p><p>My research focuses on reconstructing sea-level change during past warm periods to constrain how quickly and how much sea-level rises as temperatures warm.

For reference, in 2023, warming reached 1.4 C above the preindustrial baseline.</p><p>When will we cross ice sheet tipping points? Even with the best models and the best data imaginable, we won't truly be certain where these tipping points are until we are past them.</p><p>A key takeaway is that because there are known tipping points in ice sheets, there is an urgency to reducing carbon emissions sooner rather than later. While we can negotiate with each other until we are blue in the face, we cannot negotiate with the ice sheets. The physics is simple: sustained global warming melts more ice. And there is much at risk on our coastlines.</p><p>* * *</p><p>What the 'long tail' means for economic risk</p><p>Sea-level rise projections have been developed according to different carbon emission scenarios to help us understand the probable response of sea level (one example is shown in Fig. 2A).</p><p>These are useful for planning, but reliance on the most probable or central estimate outcome masks the true risk in what is referred to as the long tail (Fig. 2B).</p><p>Long-tailed (skewed) distributions have uncertainties that are unequally distributed around the central estimate. In the case of sea-level rise (and many other climate impacts) this means that the central estimate more likely greatly underestimates the true risk rather than overestimates it.</p><p>I have just provided several examples (sea-level pulses, tipping points in ice sheets, and rapid and bi-polar climate forcing) of reasons why sea level may rise both higher and faster than the 'central estimate' or range of 'consensus values' that are often the focus in research studies and reports. This helps to understand why the uncertainty for future sea-level has a very long tail on the high end.</p><p>Most economic models are unable to fully account for this long tail. To address this, in one study, a spatial analysis of eight climate tipping points showed that passing these tipping points would increase economic losses almost everywhere and increase the overall level of risk in the global economy.16 Even in that case, the authors warn that their results are \"probable underestimates\" of the actual risk.</p><p>* * *</p><p>15 Greenhouse gas emissions heats both poles simultaneously in contrast to some past examples of warming and ice sheet retreat that were caused by small changes in Earth's orbit, where increasing solar insolation in one hemisphere corresponds to less in the other hemisphere.</p><p>16 Dietz et al., 2021, Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118 (34) e2103081118.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Another factor that leads to underestimated risk is how sea-level projections are interpreted and implemented in coastal planning. Relative sea level projections for a particular location are typically taken to represent how long a community might have until sea level reaches a particular elevation. Unfortunately, this is incorrect and leads to a gross underestimation of risk.</p><p>In brief, for any magnitude of sea-level rise shown on a projection curve, sea level will reach that level before the time indicated on the graph.17 At first it may only be once or a few times a year, but the frequency of sea level reaching that elevation will increase until this becomes the average position of sea level.</p><p>Figure 2. (A) The top of panel A displays global surface temperature (in degrees Celsius) for four future pathways that are distinguished by different emissions scenarios. The lower portion of the panel displays the corresponding projected pathway of global mean sea-level rise for each scenario. Only the \"very low\" fossil fuel emissions pathway (blue line) that peaks before 2030 (peak temperature 1.6 C, SSP1-1.9) would slow and stabilize sea-level rise, preserving many coastal communities and giving others time to adapt.18 (B) Representation of the \"long-tail\" of uncertainty on the high side of sea-level rise projections that translates to lower probability but extremely high potential risks. The dark purple shading represents the likely (67% probability) amount of sea-level rise projected by the now-outdated IPCC AR5 report and the light purple area represents the other 33% probability that is unevenly distributed around that.19</p><p>* * *</p><p>17 For example, see the global sea level projections in Figure 2A.</p><p>18 Park et al., 2023, Future sea-level projections with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice-sheet model.

If a house is flooded more than once a year, it may no longer be habitable much sooner than 2060. Hence, the tolerance of residents and infrastructure for flood frequency at 2 feet therefore will likely be reached long before 2060.</p><p>Some adaptations may create even more risk rather than lowering it. For example, there are already social inequities arising between communities that can afford to build sea walls and those that cannot. Building sea walls is inherently risky, because the water will come, and eventually those walls will be breached. Building walls is another form of delay, and it builds in a level of complacency for communities behind the wall that think they are safe and increases risk in the long term. It also builds in fierce social inequities, because all that water has to go somewhere and seawalls will push the water into the areas where there is no protection, making adjacent communities without seawalls even more vulnerable.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Summary for sea-level rise</p><p>When the coastal real estate market collapses--not if, but when--the impacts will cascade through our national economy.</p><p>While the recent pandemic taught us something about supply chain vulnerabilities, accelerating rates of sea-level rise will create more persistent challenges for our supply chains as ports struggle to maintain their infrastructure in the face of retreating coastlines. Many major transportation corridors are coastal, compounding these challenges.</p><p>The accelerating trend and potential for larger jumps in sea level as ice sheets and glaciers decay is cause for concern for industries operating in the coastal zone and for the 40% of Americans who live in coastal communities20. Without policies and resources in place to remove or adapt infrastructure from retreating coastlines, we will continue to lose houses, condos, and other buildings into the ocean. Is our plan really to stand by and continue to allow buildings to collapse into the ocean, adding debris and toxic chemicals into the water, disrupting tourism, recreation, marine ecosystems, and maritime operations?</p><p>Policy decisions that are made today on future greenhouse gas emissions will in turn determine the rate of future sea-level rise along with associated risks to development and security for millennia to come. To maintain the possibility of not passing critical tipping points in ice sheets we need to fully commit to the Paris Agreement goals. To do otherwise, leaders would be effectively making a decision to erase many coastlines, displacing hundreds of millions of people, sooner than many think.</p><p>* * *</p><p>20 <url normalizedValue=\"https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/acs.html\">https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/acs.html</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Marine Heatwaves</p><p>You may have heard in the news recently that 2023 was the warmest year on record21. However, the warming we measure in the atmosphere only represents 1% of the total heating in our climate system. It turns out that the oceans absorb approximately 91% of that heat, with the remaining 8% being absorbed by land and ice.</p><p>This in itself is a remarkable statistic. The oceans have also absorbed 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. By absorbing both heat and carbon dioxide the oceans have been buffering the amount of warming that has occurred in our atmosphere. This may seem like a good thing, but each additional increment of ocean warming is having an increasingly devastating impact.</p><p>Ocean heat content has been steadily increasing, with five of the warmest years on record occurring in the past 5 years.22 Last year a record high was reported for upper ocean heat content, which is a key metric for tracking the warming of our planet given that the oceans absorb most of the excess heat in the Earth system23.</p><p>In 2023, temperatures in Florida Bay reached 100 F,24 possibly the highest seawater temperatures ever recorded.25 A record-breaking marine heatwave also took hold in the northeast Atlantic Ocean in 2023, with temperatures that were off the charts.26</p><p>Heatwaves in the ocean are different than those in on land because seawater absorbs and releases heat more slowly than air. Hence marine heatwaves can last for much longer and cover vast expanses of the ocean. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s and they have become more intense and longer.27</p><p>Marine heatwaves can result in impacts on marine ecosystems that are both severe and persistent, including mass mortality of benthic organisms, toxic algal blooms, and decline in fisheries catch and mariculture.28 In 2015, one of the largest and longest duration marine heatwaves occurred in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. This resulted in shifts in marine species distribution and abundance and a bloom of toxic algae off the West Coast of the United States.</p><p>Impacts cascaded through the food web, including decline of the California kelp forests and the collapse of the abalone industry.29</p><p>* * *</p><p>21 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202312\">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202312</url></p><p>22 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202312\">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/global-climate-202312</url></p><p>23Cheng et al., New Record Ocean Temperatures and Related Climate Indicators in 2023, Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 2024.</p><p>24 For reference, average hot tub temperatures are 100-102 F.</p><p>25 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/extreme-ocean-temperatures-are-affecting-floridas-coral-reef\">https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/extreme-ocean-temperatures-are-affecting-floridas-coral-reef</url></p><p>26 <url normalizedValue=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151743/the-ocean-has-a-fever\">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151743/the-ocean-has-a-fever</url></p><p>27 Fox-Kemper, B. et al., 2021, IPCC.</p><p>28 Smale, D.A. et al., 2019, Marine heatwaves threaten global biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.

Taika Waititi \u2014 who took home the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for 'Jojo Rabbit' \u2014 will return to write and direct. The filmmaker directed the third film in the installment, 'Thor: Ragnarok,' which was written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost. </p><p>Waititi also portrayed Korg in 'Ragnarok' and 'Avengers: Endgame.' The plot remains under wraps, but at the end of 'Avengers: Endgame,' Thor leaves New Asgard on Earth and hitches a ride to parts unknown with the Guardians of the Galaxy. As they get ready to depart, Thor jokingly refers to the group as the 'Asgardians of the Galaxy,' leading to a funny exchange with Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) aka Star Lord about who really leads the team. So we know at least where Thor might be when he returns. Also Read: Chris Pratt Accidentally Deletes Over 50,000 Emails: 'I'm Trying Not to Panic'[1] The future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe after 'Avengers: Endgame' is a great big mystery \u2014 and exciting mystery which we have to try to piece together. Until we get any kind of detailed plan from the future from Marvel Studios, we'll have to have to have our fun making guesses about what the 'Black Widow' movie might be about[2]or extrapolate based on details from 'Endgame.' Such as that scene late in the movie with Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. While the name 'Asgardians of the Galaxy' in 'Avengers: Endgame' mainly served as a fun pun \u2014 and probably also to set up Thor as a full on Guardian in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' \u2014 in the comics it's actually an existing superhero team, and the reference could be hinting at a fun new expansion of the Guardians.

I am a geologist and paleoceanographer who conducts research on past climate and sea-level change using marine sediments. My research focuses on the behavior of sea level and polar ice sheets during past warm periods to better inform us about future sea-level rise. I am an international expert in this area and my accomplishments have been widely recognized: as a MacArthur Fellow, a Fulbright Scholar, and a Fellow of the Geological Society of America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Human-caused climate change that is driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels poses formidable challenges to maintain the health of our oceans and coastlines. This impacts a wide range of economic, cultural, environmental, and social interests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate impacts on the oceans that have major repercussions for marine life include:</p><p>* marine heatwaves that are increasing in frequency and intensity n1, n2,</p><p>* more acidic seawater as the carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere gets absorbed by the oceans, n3, n4 and</p><p>* lower levels of oxygen in seawater. n5</p><p>Some additional impacts on the oceans include:</p><p>* changes in ocean currents that impact weather patterns extending far inland, n6</p><p>* warmer oceans that fuel more intense hurricanes and can lead to rapid intensification of hurricanes before they make landfall, n7 and</p><p>* accelerating rates of sea-level rise and coastal inundation. n4</p><p>These are just a few examples, but they give a flavor of the profound and far-reaching impacts of climate change on the oceans, marine life, and human life that will produce knock-on effects for our coastal and national budgets and economies. To better grasp the scope of these impacts, the remainder of my testimony provides more depth on two of these climate impacts: sea-level rise and marine heatwaves.</p><p>Sea-level rise</p><p>Sea-level rise threatens the safety and security of the United States. n8</p><p>Sea-level rise impacts coastal ecosystems and infrastructure that underpin the blue economy and also poses economic risks related to many topics that this committee has held hearings on, including supply chains, real estate, infrastructure, agriculture, insurance markets, health costs and more.</p><p>Sea level is not just rising, it is accelerating. Coastal communities are already struggling to keep up with sea-level rise; yet future rates of sea-level rise will outpace those of the present, which have already accelerated at least 3-fold in comparison to 20th century rates. n9 Coastal flooding frequency along U.S. coastlines has already increased by a factor of 2-3 along most of the Atlantic and Gulf coast between 1990 and 2020 and the occurrence of high tide flooding events is accelerating (Fig. 1). n10</p><p>Sea level is rising due to the combined impacts of the expansion of seawater as the ocean continues to warm and the melting of land-based ice such as glaciers and ice sheets.2 The polar ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are melting at accelerating rates and will become the increasingly dominant factor contributing to sea-level rise this century. n2</p><p>* Rapid Jumps and Tipping Points</p><p>My research focuses on reconstructing sea-level change during past warm periods to constrain how quickly and how much sea-level rises as temperatures warm. The record of past sea-level change has taught us some important lessons about what to expect for the future.</p><p>We have learned that as ice sheets melt, sea level can experience sudden jumps as sectors of the ice sheet collapse. n5 This potential for sudden pulses in sea level as ice sheets deteriorate means that if we are relying on average projections of future sea-level rise to estimate risk, then we will be unprepared for the much greater damages when such events unfold.</p><p>If we delay action to slash carbon emissions, we risk triggering physical instabilities known to exist in ice sheets; crossing these tipping points will commit us to accelerating rates of sea-level rise and continued ice loss that cannot be reversed on human timescales.n2, n11 Once that threshold is crossed, mass loss of ice will further accelerate and could commit us to rates of sea-level rise 10 times faster than today by the end of this century. n11</p><p>Figure 1. The average number of days per year when coastal waters rose above a local threshold for flooding.</p><p>The small bar graphs for each of the 33 sites compares the number of flood days per year for 1950-1959 in orange compared to the 2013-2022 time window in purple.n12, n13</p><p>There is considerable evidence that portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be near such a tipping point, whereby the grounded ice margin could retreat past the ledge of the deep basin in which it sits, causing the ice sheet to become unstable and retreat rapidly down this slope.</p><p>Both data and modeling suggest that some of these thresholds for rapid melting and retreat in Greenland and Antarctica are somewhere between 1 and 2 [degrees]C of warming n14 and could commit us to tens of feet of sea level rise. For reference, last year warming reached 1.4 [degrees]C above the preindustrial baseline.</p><p>In comparison to past warming events, we are warming the ice sheets faster now than at any point in geologic history and we are heating both poles simultaneously n15. Both of these factors may push the ice sheets and sea-level rise to respond even more quickly than in the past.</p><p>Both data and modeling suggest that some of these thresholds for rapid melting and retreat in Greenland and Antarctica are somewhere between 1 and 2 [degrees]C of warming and could commit us to tens of feet of sea-level rise. For reference, in 2023, warming reached 1.4 [degrees]C above the preindustrial baseline.</p><p>When will we cross ice sheet tipping points? Even with the best models and the best data imaginable, we won't truly be certain where these tipping points are until we are past them.</p><p>A key takeaway is that because there are known tipping points in ice sheets, there is an urgency to reducing carbon emissions sooner rather than later. While we can negotiate with each other until we are blue in the face, we cannot negotiate with the ice sheets. The physics is simple: sustained global warming melts more ice. And there is much at risk on our coastlines.</p><p>* What the 'long tail' means for economic risk</p><p>Sea-level rise projections have been developed according to different carbon emission scenarios to help us understand the probable response of sea level (one example is shown in Fig. 2A). These are useful for planning, but reliance on the most probable or central estimate outcome masks the true risk in what is referred to as the long tail (Fig. 2B).</p><p>Long-tailed (skewed) distributions have uncertainties that are unequally distributed around the central estimate. In the case of sea-level rise (and many other climate impacts) this means that the central estimate more likely greatly underestimates the true risk rather than overestimates it.</p><p>I have just provided several examples (sea-level pulses, tipping points in ice sheets, and rapid and bi-polar climate forcing) of reasons why sea level may rise both higher and faster than the 'central estimate' or range of 'consensus values' that are often the focus in research studies and reports. This helps to understand why the uncertainty for future sea-level has a very long tail on the high end.</p><p>Most economic models are unable to fully account for this long tail. To address this, in one study, a spatial analysis of eight climate tipping points showed that passing these tipping points would increase economic losses almost everywhere and increase the overall level of risk in the global economy. n16 Even in that case, the authors warn that their results are \"probable underestimates\" of the actual risk.</p><p>Another factor that leads to underestimated risk is how sea-level projections are interpreted and implemented in coastal planning. Relative sea level projections for a particular location are typically taken to represent how long a community might have until sea level reaches a particular elevation. Unfortunately, this is incorrect and leads to a gross underestimation of risk.</p><p>In brief, for any magnitude of sea-level rise shown on a projection curve, sea level will reach that level before the time indicated on the graph. n17 At first it may only be once or a few times a year, but the frequency of sea level reaching that elevation will increase until this becomes the average position of sea level.</p><p>Figure 2. (A) The top of panel A displays global surface temperature (in degrees Celsius) for four future pathways that are distinguished by different emissions scenarios. The lower portion of the panel displays the corresponding projected pathway of global mean sea-level rise for each scenario. Only the \"very low\" fossil fuel emissions pathway (blue line) that peaks before 2030 (peak temperature 1.6[degrees]C, SSP1-1.9) would slow and stabilize sea-level rise, preserving many coastal communities and giving others time to adapt. n18 (B) Representation of the \"long-tail\" of uncertainty on the high side of sea-level rise projections that translates to lower probability but extremely high potential risks. The dark purple shading represents the likely (67% probability) amount of sea-level rise projected by the now-outdated IPCC AR5 report and the light purple area represents the other 33% probability that is unevenly distributed around that. n19</p><p>As an example, if a community is planning for sea-level to rise 2 feet by the year 2060, sea-level will reach 2 ft. long before 2060 and will do so with increasing frequency until that is the average position. If a house is flooded more than once a year, it may no longer be habitable much sooner than 2060. Hence, the tolerance of residents and infrastructure for flood frequency at 2 feet therefore will likely be reached long before 2060.</p><p>Some adaptations may create even more risk rather than lowering it. For example, there are already social inequities arising between communities that can afford to build sea walls and those that cannot. Building sea walls is inherently risky, because the water will come, and eventually those walls will be breached. Building walls is another form of delay, and it builds in a level of complacency for communities behind the wall that think they are safe and increases risk in the long term. It also builds in fierce social inequities, because all that water has to go somewhere and seawalls will push the water into the areas where there is no protection, making adjacent communities without seawalls even more vulnerable.</p><p>* Summary for sea-level rise</p><p>When the coastal real estate market collapses--not if, but when--the impacts will cascade through our national economy.</p><p>While the recent pandemic taught us something about supply chain vulnerabilities, accelerating rates of sea-level rise will create more persistent challenges for our supply chains as ports struggle to maintain their infrastructure in the face of retreating coastlines. Many major transportation corridors are coastal, compounding these challenges.</p><p>The accelerating trend and potential for larger jumps in sea level as ice sheets and glaciers decay is cause for concern for industries operating in the coastal zone and for the 40% of Americans who live in coastal communities n20. Without policies and resources in place to remove or adapt infrastructure from retreating coastlines, we will continue to lose houses, condos, and other buildings into the ocean. Is our plan really to stand by and continue to allow buildings to collapse into the ocean, adding debris and toxic chemicals into the water, disrupting tourism, recreation, marine ecosystems, and maritime operations?</p><p>Policy decisions that are made today on future greenhouse gas emissions will in turn determine the rate of future sea-level rise along with associated risks to development and security for millennia to come. To maintain the possibility of not passing critical tipping points in ice sheets we need to fully commit to the Paris Agreement goals. To do otherwise, leaders would be effectively making a decision to erase many coastlines, displacing hundreds of millions of people, sooner than many think.</p><p>Marine Heatwaves</p><p>You may have heard in the news recently that 2023 was the warmest year on record n21. However, the warming we measure in the atmosphere only represents 1% of the total heating in our climate system. It turns out that the oceans absorb approximately 91% of that heat, with the remaining 8% being absorbed by land and ice.</p><p>This in itself is a remarkable statistic. The oceans have also absorbed 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. By absorbing both heat and carbon dioxide the oceans have been buffering the amount of warming that has occurred in our atmosphere. This may seem like a good thing, but each additional increment of ocean warming is having an increasingly devastating impact.</p><p>Ocean heat content has been steadily increasing, with five of the warmest years on record occurring in the past 5 years. n22 Last year a record high was reported for upper ocean heat content, which is a key metric for tracking the warming of our planet given that the oceans absorb most of the excess heat in the Earth system n23.</p><p>In 2023, temperatures in Florida Bay reached [greater than]100 [degrees]F, n24 possibly the highest seawater temperatures ever recorded. n25 A record-breaking marine heatwave also took hold in the northeast Atlantic Ocean in 2023, with temperatures that were off the charts. n26</p><p>Heatwaves in the ocean are different than those in on land because seawater absorbs and releases heat more slowly than air. Hence marine heatwaves can last for much longer and cover vast expanses of the ocean. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s and they have become more intense and longer. n27</p><p>Marine heatwaves can result in impacts on marine ecosystems that are both severe and persistent, including mass mortality of benthic organisms, toxic algal blooms, and decline in fisheries catch and mariculture. n28 In 2015, one of the largest and longest duration marine heatwaves occurred in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. This resulted in shifts in marine species distribution and abundance and a bloom of toxic algae off the West Coast of the United States. Impacts cascaded through the food web, including decline of the California kelp forests and the collapse of the abalone industry. n29</p><p>One particular concern is that marine heatwaves threaten the continued existence of corals reefs on our planet. Coral reefs are a cradle of marine biodiversity. Though they occupy less than 1% of the sea floor, coral reefs are home to 25% of marine life. Extreme heat is toxic to corals because it causes them to lose their colorful microscopic algae - an event referred to as coral bleaching. Severe bleaching events result in coral death with major repercussions on marine ecosystems.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2020, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia experienced three major bleaching episodes within a five-year span due to extremely high seawater temperatures. n30 You may remember the Australian bushfires during the austral summer 2019-2020 n31. After the Australian bush burned, what you did not see under the water was another mass mortality event that played out as corals bleached and died.</p><p>I recently wrote a paper about the Great Barrier Reef, which is the largest coral reef system on our planet. It has existed for hundreds of thousands of years, spanning warm periods and intervening ice ages. n32 Despite this long-lived history, the burning of fossil fuels is increasing the frequency of marine heatwaves and leaving mass mortality of corals in its wake. Our pathway to saving the Great Barrier Reef and reef systems around the globe is unquestionably to slash fossil fuel emissions as quickly as possible.</p><p>Scientists have warned of a developing mass extinction unfolding beneath the waves, but the good news is that they also project that we could cut these losses by 70% if we reverse greenhouse gas emissions trends. n33</p><p>This is just one example of how extreme heat in our oceans is impacting marine life, with immediate knock-on effects for fisheries, tourism, food availability, shoreline protection, and coastal economies.</p><p>The way forward</p><p>An important point in this conversation is that we cannot just adapt to climate change. My testimony has highlighted ways in which marine life is already reaching thresholds of survival. Human bodies similarly have physical limits in terms of the temperature extremes that can be tolerated. Such limitations mean that while climate change may seem like a gradual, slow-moving problem, once we cross critical thresholds the impacts can be sudden, widespread, and devastating.</p><p>Keeping our oceans healthy and protecting our economy means not investing in more fossil fuel infrastructure and transitioning to renewable energy sources as rapidly as possible. These energy sources are less expensive and create less pollution, translating to immediate financial and health benefits for Americans.</p><p>This transition, while already underway, is not happening quickly enough. While I applaud the current administration for the steps they have taken to curb emissions, our actions have yet to scale with the urgency of the problem.</p><p>Because risks increase with every increment of warming, the costs of inaction are far greater than the costs of action. If we choose to delay mitigation and adaptation, we will increase losses and damages, lock in high-emissions infrastructure, and increase the risks of stranded assets.</p><p>However, we are not powerless to change our climate change trajectory.</p><p>The most important part of my message today is that because humans are driving the rapid warming of our planet, that means that we are also the solution to this problem. Our climate future is not just a place that we get to go to, it is a place that we get to create together.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>n1 Marine heatwaves have increased by 54% over the last century.</p><p>n2 Fox-Kemper, B. et al., 2021, Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change.

Though they occupy less than 1% of the sea floor, coral reefs are home to 25% of marine life. Extreme heat is toxic to corals because it causes them to lose their colorful microscopic algae - an event referred to as coral bleaching. Severe bleaching events result in coral death with major repercussions on marine ecosystems. Between 2016 and 2020, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia experienced three major bleaching episodes within a five-year span due to extremely high seawater temperatures. n30 You may remember the Australian bushfires during the austral summer 2019-2020 n31. After the Australian bush burned, what you did not see under the water was another mass mortality event that played out as corals bleached and died. I recently wrote a paper about the Great Barrier Reef, which is the largest coral reef system on our planet. It has existed for hundreds of thousands of years, spanning warm periods and intervening ice ages. n32 Despite this long-lived history, the burning of fossil fuels is increasing the frequency of marine heatwaves and leaving mass mortality of corals in its wake. Our pathway to saving the Great Barrier Reef and reef systems around the globe is unquestionably to slash fossil fuel emissions as quickly as possible."]}, {"relevance_score": 11, "title": "University of Greenwich: Two Landscape Architecture and Urbanism Lecturers Featured in the Architecture Foundation's New Architects", "published": "2021-05-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">(TNSBook) -- The University of Greenwich issued the following news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Architects 4 is the latest edition of a \"guide for the open-minded client\" that the Architecture Foundation periodically produces.

The latest data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre shows that, as of Wednesday, a total of 4,774 fires have occurred nationwide in Canada, with cumulative burned areas of more than 121,000 square kilometers. This data has far exceeded the country's historical record of 76,000 square kilometers burned in 1989, surpassing the land area of South Korea, and is 7.5 times the cumulative disaster areas of wildfires in China from 2000 to 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to endangering the lives and property of local residents, the ecological damage and the emission of greenhouse gases caused by the wildfires have had an immeasurable impact on the human living environment. Recently, Chinese scientists used scientific methods to assess it and concluded that, as of Wednesday, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires have reached approximately 1 billion tons. Chinese scientists involved in this research told the Global Times that this astonishing data indicates that the carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides emitted by Canadian wildfires have had an undeniable impact on global climate warming. This has already developed into a global environmental event, rather than just wildfires happening in Canada, the scientists warned.</p><p>\"Remote sensing technology is an effective method currently used to estimate carbon emissions from large-scale wildfires. It can conduct rapid and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from wildfires,\" Liu Zhihua, a researcher at the Shenyang-based Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who participated in this study, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p><p>The scientists estimated that, as of Wednesday, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires had reached approximately 1 billion tons.</p><p>In addition, Chinese scientists have estimated through the emission factor method that the greenhouse effect of methane and nitrous oxide emitted from this wildfires is approximately equivalent to 110 million tons of carbon dioxide. Combined with the direct emission of 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires is equivalent to about 1.11 billion tons. Liu believes that this figure is quite astonishing, as the carbon dioxide emissions related to fossil energy in Canada in 2021 were about 546 million tons, and the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from this year's wildfires are nearly twice that amount. 1.11 billion tons of carbon dioxide have already exceeded Japan's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the year 2021, according to Liu.</p><p>According to data from the Global Carbon Project, Japan's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2021 were 1.067 billion tons, ranking fifth globally.</p><p>However, the wildfire in Canada this time has surpassed that record. \"Furthermore, there is a concerning situation where about one eighth of the wildfires in Canada occur in permafrost areas, which could potentially promote the release of methane stored in the permafrost,\" Liu said.</p><p>In addition to causing serious harm to the climate through greenhouse gas emissions, this year's wildfires in Canada has also released air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, organic aerosols, and black carbon. This will inevitably have an impact on the environment and harm human health.</p><p>\"Up to now, this wildfire has had significant cross-border impacts on air quality four times, namely from May 17 to 26, June 6 to 19, June 23 to 30, and July 15 to 20.</p><p>During these four instances of cross-border transmission, the air quality in the US was significantly reduced, with particulate matter exceeding 50 micrograms per cubic meter, leading to flight cancellations, school closures, and severe disruptions to production and daily life.</p><p>Among them, the second transmission process resulted in the most severe pollution weather in New York City since 1960. The third transmission process caused Chicago's air quality index to exceed the standard by 5.6 times on June 27, which will inevitably pose significant risks to the respiratory systems of local residents,\" Liu explained.</p><p>What is more serious is that due to the westerly circulation and weather dynamics, the PM2.5 released from the Canadian wildfire has also been transported across long distances.</p><p>Wang Zhe, an associate researcher at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the CAS, who participated in this study, told Global Times on Wednesday that research shows that PM2.5 released from the wildfires reached the Scandinavian Peninsula in Europe on May 25, spread to Iceland and Greenland on June 8, and affected mainland Europe on June 26. The atmospheric transport process from June 27 to 30 contributed more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5 in Europe. This transport process even affected North Africa and Asia, impacting a large area in the western part of China, contributing approximately 1-2 micrograms per cubic meter to PM2.5 concentrations in the western region of China, according to Wang.</p><p>\"Wildfires in Canada are indeed a global environmental event, and their ultimate impact will certainly be much more severe than the current data suggests,\" Wang said.</p><p>He further stated that this research outcome is only a preliminary assessment, and a comprehensive evaluation of the wildfires will be conducted once they are over. This evaluation will include the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate, the impact of particle emissions on the environment, and the effects on human health.</p><p>\"We are currently combining air pollution epidemiology to assess the impact of this wildfire on human health, because the particulate matter generated by the wildfire may be more harmful to the human body than traditional PM2.5. The impact could be 2 to 10 times greater, mainly because the small particles produced by the forest wildfires are more likely to enter our lungs and then enter our bloodstream. This not only affects the respiratory system but also the cardiovascular system. Therefore, we will also conduct a comprehensive assessment of the harm caused by this wildfire to the human body in the later stage,\" Wang noted.</p><p>Rapidly burning wildfires can cause extensive damage and death to vegetation, resulting in not only a loss of biodiversity but also the loss of habitat and food sources for animals. Additionally, wildfires can destroy the vegetation cover, leading to exposed soil surfaces and exacerbating the frequency of secondary disasters such as soil erosion, sediment runoff, and landslides.</p><p>Wang further pointed out that the recent Canadian wildfires may also have an impact on the frozen layers in the polar regions. For example, the emissions of organic aerosols and black carbon, if deposited on the surface of the Arctic sea ice, can cause rapid melting of the ice. Therefore, the impacts of this wildfire are very complex and a comprehensive assessment will be needed using more comprehensive Earth system models in the future.</p><p>In recent years, with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities, extreme forest fires have been occurring frequently all around the world.</p><p>For example, in 2019, the Amazon forest fires caused a burnt area of over 90,000 square kilometers in 10 months. In 2019-2020, the Australian bushfires led to a burnt area of 243,000 square kilometers in one year. In 2021, the wildfires in Russia resulted in a burnt area of 181,600 square kilometers.</p><p>The wildfire season in Canada usually lasts until October, and there is a possibility that the current wildfire will continue to spread. The academic community also believes that the scale of the disaster will further expand, surpassing the country's historical records.</p><p>For a long time, the Western academic community has considered fire disturbance a natural process that regulates forest ecosystems, benefiting the stability of ecosystem structure and function. However, Liu believes that in recent years, the frequent occurrence of large-scale wildfires has exceeded the range of natural variation and has evolved into a destructive disaster.</p><p>Frequent and severe wildfires not only rapidly deplete carbon reserves in vegetation and soil, but also alter the natural succession of forests, leading to ecosystem degradation into shrublands or grasslands, significantly reducing the carbon sequestration function of the ecosystem. Therefore, large-scale wildfires disrupt the balance of ecosystems, rather than being considered as traditional ecological disturbance processes, Liu explained.</p><p>\"The forest protection concept in European and American countries first focuses on the protection of people's lives and property, and secondly on important natural resource areas. As to the fires in remote areas, they preferring monitoring rather than interfering in as they believe that everything will eventually return to its original state after one or two hundred years, considering it as a natural evolutionary process,\" Liu said.</p><p>However, Liu noted that extreme environmental events are occurring frequently nowadays, which has exceeded the scope of natural changes and has evolved into a destructive ecological disaster. At this time, proper human intervention is needed.</p><p>If the fires go straight up to the tree crowns and become strong, the effectiveness of human intervention may be limited. Currently, wildfires in Canada spread very quickly and release a lot of energy, so the effectiveness of human intervention is limited.\" Liu explained to the Global Times.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the forest area in China is approximately 2.31 million square kilometers, which is roughly two-thirds of the forest area in Canada. The forest coverage rate is about 24.02 percent. Such extensive distribution of forests has brought significant challenges to our country's forest fire prevention work. However, over the years, China has accumulated rich experience in forest fire prevention and control, successfully reducing the occurrence rate and disaster losses of forest fires, and significantly improving the comprehensive capacity for fire prevention and control, Liu said.</p><p>According to estimation, the average annual emission of carbon dioxide caused by forest fires in China from 2000-2021 was approximately 15 million tons, only account for 0.2 percent of the global forest fire emissions, demonstrating China's responsible role as a major country, Liu said.

The experimentalist band combines death metal's relentless rhythms, black metal's melancholic soundscapes and progressive metal's abstract song structures with classical violin accompaniments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Courtesy of Seasons of Mist</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Melbourne, Australia quintet's debut album, \"Portal of I\" (2012), redefined what metal could be, not just by introducing a new musical approach, but by perfecting it. Catapulting the band from obscurity to cult fame, \"Portal of I\" gradually made waves across the world, becoming an enduring favorite of the metal underground. Its 11-minute magnum opus, \"And Plague Flowers the Kaleidoscope,\" racked up millions of views across its different postings on YouTube, in addition to being taught alongside Ludwig van Beethoven at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.</p><p>Ne Obliviscaris released their fourth full-length album, \"Exul,\" on March 24. Like its predecessors, the album bears the unenviable task of living up to their discography's impossibly-high bar. \"Citadel\" (2014) and \"Urn\" (2017) were fantastic entries in the band's catalog, though neither release had the boundary and genre-breaking success of the lightning-in-a-bottle \"Portal of I.\" As the band entered the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic still without a new record, anticipation mounted; fans wondered if the six-year wait for \"Exul\" would signal a new magnum opus or the band's first misstep.</p><p>While every fan will have a different opinion on which album is Ne Obliviscaris' best, it is safe to say that \"Exul\" more than makes up for its six-year wait, featuring some of the band's most compelling songwriting and experimentation to date. \"Equus,\" the album's opening track, bursts with every Ne Obliviscaris trademark a fan could ask for, perfectly balancing vocalist and violinist Tim Charles' classically-trained vocals with Marc \"Xenoyr\" Campbell's abrasive growls. Charles and Xenoyr lament the tragedy of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires as the track moves from local outrage to philosophical wonder, imagining the bushfires as a symptom of the destruction humanity has inflicted upon the Earth; the scorched desert that awaits if our systems do not change.</p><p>\"Equus\" also clocks in at over 12 minutes, and Ne Obliviscaris makes the most of that time, embodying natural disasters through musical contrasts. It is as much a song of mourning as a call to arms - one whose emotion becomes tangible on the track's concluding guitar solo. Heartbroken, desperate and outraged, guitarist Benjamin Baret's playing succeeds where words fail, embodying grief for the millions of animals killed in the bushfires. Musically and lyrically, \"Equus\" introduces the main threads interwoven throughout the album's six tracks, including the concept of \"exul\" as the feeling of alienation from a world seemingly unresponsive to logic or compassion. As Xenoyr told Season of Mist, the band's record label, \"'Exul' felt right to use [for the album title] in a broader sense and as a lone word, for we each have our own history and a story of exile.\"</p><p>That exile continues in an even darker sense on the album's two-part epic, \"Misericorde,\" a 16-minute composition confronting terminal illness. These two tracks deliver the feeling of alienation from one's own body with palpable urgency and grief. The first part, \"Misericorde I - As the Flesh Falls,\" showcases Ne Obliviscaris at their loudest, railing against the truth that life leads to death, whereas \"Misericorde II - Anatomy of Quiescence\" fades into a dream-like ambiance. Here, Charles' violin takes center stage like never before, strings singing to guide the primarily instrumental track into atmospheres reminiscent of funeral flowers: both solemn and beautiful.</p><p>As the \"Misericorde\" suite concludes the first half of \"Exul,\" the album's remaining three tracks commence with \"Suspyre,\" a song smartly tucked away until release day. Instead of releasing the album's strongest track as a single, Ne Obliviscaris unleashes \"Suspyre\" after the listener has already been primed by \"Equus\" and \"Misericorde,\" and the results are game-changing. \"Suspyre\" leans more into the technical death metal genre, a sound characterized by densely layered and technically demanding riffs played at nearly inhuman speeds. Even as every band member pushes themselves to the limit, melody is still a primary feature on this track. Charles' violin and Baret and Matt Klavins' flamenco skills are perfectly incorporated, and Martino Garattoni's mind-blowing basslines tie every part of \"Suspyre\" together.</p><p>After the revelation of \"Suspyre,\" the album concludes with \"Graal\" and \"Anhedonia,\" a fitting crescendo and decrescendo that take the listener for one more epic ride. The lyrics of \"Graal\" are veiled in mystery, but if the forceful instrumentation is any indication, an apocalypse looms over every rhythmic shift. The absence of pleasure defines \"Anhedonia,\" and as \"Graal\" concludes with the ominous portent, \"There is only dust / Humanity is gone,\" it seems that the song anticipates a post-human future ushered in by humanity itself. \"Exul\" ends on an impactful, haunting note, Charles' mournful vocals trailing off in the sway of gentle violin and piano passages.</p><p>Altogether, \"Exul\" is everything fans could have expected from Ne Obliviscaris. The album's organization allows every song to build off the previous, resulting in a full listen sure to stay with listeners long after the final note. It is an incredibly difficult album to critique, in large part because nobody else in the world is making music like Ne Obliviscaris and because they execute every song's balancing act flawlessly. \"Exul\" could have used one more epic song to reach an even greater theatrical level, and an overarching narrative could have made each theme even more compelling. However, the fact remains that Ne Obliviscaris delivered what fans were promised: another high-caliber metal record strong enough to rival any of their previous releases.</p><p>In just over 10 years since the release of \"Portal of I,\" Ne Obliviscaris has jumped from avant-garde metal curiosities to classical experimentalists marrying the elegant and the brutal, doing so with lyrical sincerity and a relentless drive for self-improvement. \"Exul\" is the next step in the band's quest to achieve the impossible: to make sense of life and all of its often dispiriting mysteries.</p><p>Easton Lane</p><p>+ posts</p><p>Easton Lane (he/him) (25C) is from Littleton, Colorado and is double majoring in Creative Writing and Environmental Sciences.

'This is an international that we can't avoid,' Kelley said at the Television Critics Association press tour. 'We have to start speaking up about the real causes behind these devastating fires, which is the undeniable fact that the planet is warming combined with a whole host of other things that I won't get into on this panel. </p><p>But this should be a really big wake-up call for the world. Things are shifting, the tide is turning and we need to stop and take action now.' Fueled by extreme heat and dehydration, the wildfires in Australia have burned more than 30,000 square miles since September. Thousands of homes have been destroyed in the fire and 24 people have been killed. Experts have estimated[1] that as many as one billion animals will be dead by the time the fires are put out.

Kelley, whose credits include 'Dynasty,' 'The Vampire Diaries' and 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,' was born in Peru but relocated with her family to Australia when she was two. Kelley said Wednesday that her family still resides in the country and she spent the holidays witnessing the effects of the fire first-hand. 'I couldn't see the sun or the Harbour Bridge through the smoke. And they said those were good days,' Kelley told reporters. 'I don't know if you've heard, but the glaciers in New Zealand have turned yellow and brown from the smoke. A billion animals dead from these fires. But if that's what it takes for us to wake up and see that this is not a joke, then so be it. But let's wake up, please.' Kelley is far from the only Hollywood star who has called for action in response to the wildfires. 'Thor' headliner Chris Hemsworth, who is also an Australian native, pledged $1 million on Tuesday to organizations battling the fires.Related stories from TheWrap: 'The Baker and the Beauty' Gets First Trailer at ABC (Video)[3]Will Jed Wyatt Be on 'The Bachelor' Music-Based Spinoff?

From there, the smoke can be seen traveling across the ocean and interacting with global weather.#8216;As smoke from the massive fires has interacted with global weather, the transport of smoke plumes around the globe has accelerated into the upper troposphere and even the lowermost stratosphere, leading to long-range transport around the globe,#8217; NASA explained[1]. As such, the smoke from the bushfires will complete a circle around the Earth and back to Australia again.Also seen in the video are the dust[2] from desert regions, the sea saltemitted over the oceans, and several forms of pollution emitted from industrial activities.WildfiresWildfires are, actually, quite normal and may even be beneficial to an ecosystem because the fires can kill diseases and pests, and even allow for new grasslands to be created. However, human activities have since resulted in bigger and more destructive ones. Such fires can emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide in a very short time. In fact, scientists estimated that wildfires have emitted billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year for the last 20 years.Unfortunately, wildfires have also been worsening in some parts of the world, particularly in the regions that are drying out because of global warming. Even after big fires, the decomposing wood also emits carbon dioxide, sometimes even surpassing the emissions from the actual fire.Numerous wildfiresare actually started due to human carelessness, from leaving unextinguished campfires to throwing cigarette butts. By taking simple preventative measures such as being more aware of how we discard flammable items, we can lower the threats associated with the devastating events.

However, unlike traditional thunderstorm clouds, these clouds do not bring precipitation. Instead, these \"firestorms\" tend to worsen fires by generating strong winds, transporting the embers and striking lightings.Because of pyroCbs, the smoke can reach the stratosphere 10 miles in altitude, allowing it to travel thousands of miles away from the source, thereby affecting global conditions.

Values over 10 are often associated with such events. The aerosol index values produced by some of the Australian pyroCb events have rivaled that largest values ever recorded,' research scientist at Goddard Colin Seftor said[2].Based on the animations provided by NASA, one can see that by Jan. 8, the smoke from the bushfires had already traveled halfway around the world. According to NASA, the smoke is expected to make at least one full circle around the globe and return to Australia.

Many people were wise to point out that just because of the new year, the problems of 2020 are not going to disappear. But that should not mean that we cannot be optimistic about 2021.

We can take the fierce Australian bushfires to raise awareness of global warming. We can take the California gender reveal fire to get rid of the horrible trend of gender reveal parties.

If 2020 threw you in for a loop, it's okay to work your way back into finding good reasons to enjoy your life even during lockdowns and political turmoil. It can be something as simple as setting up your room in a different way, taking the time to go on walks or trying a new recipe. Despite 2020's struggles that are bleeding into 2021, we can still find things to look forward to. You could plan a vacation for when the pandemic is over; even if you don't ever go on that vacation, studies have found that just planning a trip can be good for your mental health. You can meet up with friends for Zoom games and chats or plan something you can all do together when the pandemic has ended. Though it seems odd to place so much focus on the end when there doesn't seem to be one in sight, it can be nice to take stress off of the brain by focusing on the light at the end of the tunnel rather than inundate ourselves daily with constant tragedy.\u00a0</p><p>And of course, there is nothing wrong with self-care. Social media detoxing and taking time to do things that bring you peace can help foster hope and joy. Returning to a daily routine can also help mental health and may instill your life with more optimism. Even within the safety guidelines and problems going on in the world, it is okay to take a few days to yourself to recharge your batteries. Living in times as mercurial as these can take a serious toll on mental health, especially for people of color, and it would bode well for hope for a better year if positive mental health was a main focus.</p><p>When you're not concentrating on taking care of yourself, learn. 2020 put to the forefront the many things that are wrong in our societies, and now with these issues in everyone's minds, we can educate ourselves better. Read books written by POC and continue to support small businesses. Educate yourself on the atrocities mainstream media is choosing to ignore, and help do something about them, even if it's spreading awareness through social media. Learning helps the brain stay healthy and active, so even if you're diving into some subjects that are heavy, your brain will appreciate learning something new about communities that are in need of support.</p><p>It is okay to not be optimistic about 2021. It is also okay to try to find some hope in 2021 by bettering yourself, your home or the world around you.

CuriosityStream's summer slate of original films and series is full of incredible people who are driven by their passions, and we're thrilled to kick off the season with this series, where Doug's commitment to wildlife rescue and his love for animals comes across in every engaging scene.\"</p><p>Nothing is easy in the aftermath of a natural disaster. There's often no power, no cell service and few public resources. People are displaced, often separated from their loved ones with no easy way to make contact. When services are scarce and too many people are in need, what happens to the animals that are caught in the aftermath? That's where drone pilot Doug Thron comes in.</p><p>\"There always seems to be a natural disaster ravaging some part of the world, and the potential for drones to help rescue animals in those situations, whether wild or domestic, and help in their recovery is unlimited,\" said Doug Thron, drone pilot featured in CuriosityStream's Doug To The Rescue. \"The emotion when victims of a tragedy get their animals back is incredibly moving. It gives people a sense of hope to carry on after something so devastating. I'm enormously grateful to be a part of that.\"</p><p>In Thron's animal search and rescue efforts, he relies on 4 drones, made by DJI, outfitted for use in disaster areas. He uses a Phantom 4 Pro and Mavic Pro for scouting out specific zones. He then switches to a Matrice 210 RTK and a Matrice 210 V2, both of which are equipped with a spotlight, a 180x zoom lens, and an infrared camera. The forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera is used by the U.S. Coast Guard and search and rescue units around the globe to detect heat signatures, allowing warm-blooded animals to jump out from their surroundings. The FLIR camera helps Doug quickly find animals among the rubble, at which point he switches the drone to a high-end optical camera to make a positive ID and get a clearer look at the scene. The drone's GPS coordinates are recorded, so when animals are pinpointed by air, the rescue team knows exactly where to go.</p><p>CuriosityStream, a leading factual entertainment streaming service, recently premiered season 2 of the original series Engineering the Future, narrated by the Golden Globe-nominated David Oyelowo, as well as Nature Through Her Eyes, a 4-part original series exploring a dazzling vision of the natural world through the work of some of the best female cinematographers and filmmakers.

The detailed animal and its lifelike gaze struck the jury, which chose it as this year's winner, among a high volume of quality entries to this year's contest. Tiarn was welcomed as a guest of honour at the high-level event at the UN Headquarters where she received the award.</p><p>This year's Youth Art Contest followed the theme of the 2020 World Wildlife Day celebrations: \"Sustaining all life on Earth.\" This encompassed all forms of wild fauna and flora, celebrating their roles as essential components of the world's biodiversity, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 14 (Life Below Water), 15 (Life On Land), 1 (No Poverty) and 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns).</p><p>This was the second time an International Youth Art Contest was held to mark World Wildlife Day. Nearly 200 entries from over 20 countries were received. The jurors picked the winner from an exceptional roster of 13 finalists.</p><p>The panel of jurors included:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Azzedine Downes, President and CEO of IFAW Midori Paxton, Head of Biodiversity and Ecosystems at UNDP Ivonne Higuero, Secretary-General of CITES Monica Medina, Founder and CEO of Our Daily Planet Maddy Paice, IFAW Youth Ambassador Kathleen Rodgers, President of Earth Day Network Jim Toomey, Syndicate Cartoonist of Sherman's Lagoon</emphasis></p><p>\"In November 2019, dozens of bushfires erupted across Australia and burned uncontrollably for months destroying millions of acres of valuable wildlife habitat. Billions of animals perished in the devastating blazes. This heart-breaking loss included some of our most iconic wildlife species - in particular tens of thousands of precious koalas. I was inspired to draw this scene as it represents the sustainability struggle happening in my own backyard. I wanted to draw attention to the vulnerability of our native wildlife and how their lives hang in the balance. I wanted to convey how this fragile balance can be quickly destroyed - sometimes, in as such short a time as days or even hours - and to evoke action to tackle the immediate and longer-term impacts that threaten wildlife. Sustaining life on earth means making sure all of us have the same chance to survive,\" said Tiarn Garland, the 2020 International Youth Art Contest Winner.</p><p>\"Through a means that offers both creativity and expression, we continue to be in awe of the breadth and remarkable beauty of the artwork received from all ages from all parts of the world,\" said Kelly Johnston, Program Officer of IFAW. \"We are inspired by the global response to this contest which so vividly reflects the natural affinity that children have for both animals as well as art. We will continue to welcome the opportunity to celebrate the rich biodiversity that surrounds us, and which so needs the critical role of youth to serve as stewards of the natural world.\"</p><p>CITES Secretary-General, Ivonne Higuero said, \"We congratulate Tiarn for her powerful drawing and for the talent she showed in illustrating the threats that weigh on the world's biodiversity. We are proud to collaborate with IFAW and UNDP on this Art Contest. We do so in the hope of galvanizing young people and children's interest in the conservation of wild fauna and flora and their habitats in all their diversity. We thank Tiarn and all participants in this year's contest for their work and commitment. We believe they will inspire others and that their art will help strengthen the bonds between youth, wildlife and the world's biodiversity.\"</p><p>\"Tiarn's artwork is extremely powerful. It captures the theme of this year's World Wildlife Day and shows how the climate crisis and nature crisis are directly interlinked,\" said Midori Paxton, head of Biodiversity and Ecosystems at UNDP. \"Frequent heatwaves and wildfires represent some of the most pressing threats to biodiversity. The plight of the koala as depicted by Tiarn symbolizes these growing threats. Many small endemic species such as mouse-size marsupial dunnarts are also on the brink of extinction because of the Australian fires. We are facing a planetary crisis whose solution requires integrated approaches that tackle both climate change and biodiversity loss together.\"</p><p>Celebrated annually, World Wildlife Day was established by a 2013 resolution by the United Nations General Assembly, marking the day of signature of the CITES Convention. The CITES Secretariat is its principal facilitator. Since its proclamation, the day has become one of the most important global annual events specifically dedicated to wildlife, with annual high-level events at the UN Headquarters in New York and Geneva.</p><p>The winning artwork as well as all entries are viewable on theFlickr page\u00a0of World Wildlife Day and on the IFAW website.</p><p>For more information and to arrange interviews, please contact:</p><p>IFAW: Rodger Correa at +1 202 834 6637 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:orrcorrea@ifaw.org\">orrcorrea@ifaw.org</email></p><p>CITES: Francisco P\u00e9rez at +41 22 917 1447 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:orfrancisco.perezgonzalez@un.org\">orfrancisco.perezgonzalez@un.org</email></p><p>UNDP: Sangita Khadka at +1 212 906 5043 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:orsangita.khadka@undp.org\">orsangita.khadka@undp.org</email></p><p>About CITES</p><p>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was signed in on 3 March 1973 and entered into force on 1 July 1975. With 183 Parties (182 countries + the European Union) it remains one of the world's most powerful tools for wildlife conservation through the regulation of international trade in over 36,000 species of wild animals and plants. CITES-listed species are used by people around the world in their daily lives for food health care, furniture, housing, tourist souvenirs, cosmetics or fashion. CITES seeks to ensure that international trade in such species is sustainable, legal and traceable and contributes to both the livelihoods of the communities that live closest to them and to national economies for a healthy planet and the prosperity of the people, in support to UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>About UNDP</p><p>UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in nearly 170 countries and territories, we offer global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations.</p><p>About IFAW</p><p>The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is a global non-profit helping animals and people thrive together. We are experts and everyday people, working across seas, oceans, and in more than 40 countries around the world.
