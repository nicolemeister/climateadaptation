This initiative provides up to $3,000 in grant funding to local organizations working on innovative solutions that support food justice, climate equity, and community resilience.</p><p>This years projects reflect a wide range of ways Austinites are strengthening their communities from expanding fresh produce distribution in schools and building community gardens, to creating safer, more sustainable ways for families to travel by bike, and even powering meal deliveries with electric cargo bikes.</p><p>These efforts highlight the creativity and determination of local leaders working to reduce food insecurity, take action on climate change, and build resilience in our city, said Zach Baumer, Director of Austins Office of Climate Action and Resilience. Each FACE grant is an investment in a community-driven solution that will have a positive impact in Austin.</p><p>The FACE Grants program was designed to support projects that address systemic and structural inequities, with a focus on empowering communities that have been historically marginalized. By funding these innovative projects, the City of Austin aims to create a more just, equitable, and resilient future for all Austinites.</p><p>With this support, we are sowing seeds of hope, dignity, and resilience in Austins most vulnerable communities. This grant will help us expand our Nourish and Uplift initiative, providing hot meals, wellness support, and climate resilience resources that nourish both body and spirit, said Rachid Sow, Founder and Executive Director of the Sow Family Foundation. Together, we can meet urgent needs today while growing a stronger, healthier, and more equitable city where no one is left behind.</p><p>\"The FACE grant will allow us to build on the momentum of our inaugural Kidical Mass ATX event to catalyze more sustained behavior shifts in how families access the City by bike. Alongside our partner, National Youth Bike, we are excited to help seed and nurture a robust bike families community in Austin, said Eileen McGinnis, Founder of The Parents Climate Community.</p><p>List of Funded Organizations</p><p>Organizations will begin work on their projects and have until June 1, 2026, to complete them.

Among the summit's key focus areas are climate equity and the implementation of proactive measures for a rapid and just transition to an integrated global green economy.</p><p>Held under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, WGES is organised by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO). This year's summit will take place on 1-2 October 2025 at the Dubai World Trade Centre, under the theme 'Innovating for Impact: Accelerating the Future of the Green Economy'.</p><p>\"The World Green Economy Summit continues to build on the momentum of the historic UAE Consensus resulting from COP28 to support an orderly, responsible, fair and logical transition in the energy sector. The summit contributes to translating the agreement into sustainable international action and finding common ground to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and honour previous commitments. It underscores the importance of investing in innovation, technology, finance and data-driven research to provide climate funding to the countries and communities that need it most, ensuring benefits for all humanity. The concept of a just transition has gained prominence since 2013, advocating inclusive economies that are environmentally sustainable and leave no one behind,\" said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD &amp; CEO of DEWA and Chairman of WGEO.</p><p>While nearly 92% of the global population now has basic access to electricity, more than 666 million people still live without it, according to a report by the World Health Organization and its partners.</p><p>HE Flavien Joubert, Minister of Agriculture, Climate Change and Energy in the Seychelles, said: \"We inhabit one interconnected world. Its resources are not without end and its ability to withstand humanity's assault is not unlimited. Each individual from each country must bear this in mind as [their nation] seeks to develop.\"</p><p>HE Max Andonirina Fontaine, Madagascar's Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, said: \"In Madagascar, climate justice is part of our everyday struggle. It means standing with those who lose their harvests to drought, their homes to floods and, too often, their future to indifference. The green transition must be just - or it will fail. It must restore fairness, protect the vulnerable and create opportunities where they are needed most. At this year's WGES, I will carry the voice of those the world forgets - and show how Madagascar is turning adversity into leadership, and resilience into lasting change.\"</p><p>Muaviyath Mohamed, Minister of State for Tourism and Environment in the Maldives, said: \"As a Small Island Developing State, Maldives is dedicated to collaborating with global partners to strengthen climate action and ensure a sustainable future for all.\"</p><p>Dr Tarifa Alzaabi, Director General of ICBA, said: \"Achieving a truly green economy requires solutions that are grounded in science, innovation and global collaboration. At ICBA, we transform advanced scientific research into practical strategies that strengthen climate-resilient agriculture, safeguard water and food security, and empower communities in the world's most arid and saline regions. WGES provides an invaluable platform to advance these conversations and accelerate collective climate action.\"</p><p>Prof Nazia M Habib from the University of Cambridge said: \"A just green transition demands shared decisions - clarifying who gains, who bears the cost and how we fund institutions to sustain change.\"</p><p>Olaf van der Veen, CEO and co-founder of Orbisk, said: \"Food both fuels climate change and is one of its greatest victims, a dangerous feedback loop. As climate change worsens, food availability shrinks and food quality deteriorates in a vicious circle, risking human health as a consequence. Reducing food waste is the most immediate and impactful way to disrupt this cycle, thereby cutting emissions, land and water use and relieving pressure on our food system. It's where climate action must begin while, in parallel, we keep designing a more resilient, healthy and responsible global diet.\"</p><p>Angela Homsi, Founder of Ignite Energy Access and Ignite Partners, said: \"At Ignite, we're proving that delivering clean energy to the Global South is not just a moral imperative - it's one of the most compelling business opportunities of our time. In regions where the grid can't keep up with needs, accelerating human and national potential and returns are unlocked through bold execution and relentless focus. Distributed renewable energy isn't waiting for the future - it's enabling it and already outperforming in the world's toughest markets.\"</p><p>Michael Pollan, best-selling author and journalist, said: \"As we stand at the crossroads of climate urgency and opportunity, gatherings like WGES and DEWA's forums in Dubai offer not just policy or innovation but a chance to reshape our collective narrative around energy, food and the planet. I look forward to engaging with the global community in 2025 - to share, to listen and to help seed a greener, wiser culture.\"</p><p>Hani Tohme, Head of Sustainability for the Middle East and Africa at Kearney, said: \"As we accelerate global climate action, we must remember what's at the core of this fight - people. Climate action must serve people, especially those most exposed to environmental and structural vulnerabilities. This is what climate justice truly means. Not just protection, but empowerment. When we design policies that are inclusive and forward-looking, we turn climate mitigation and adaptation into engines of growth, resilience and opportunity. It's not just about reducing emissions. It's about building a future that works for everyone.\"</p><p>Adri Pols, CEO of Desolenator, said: \"Climate change is intensifying the global challenge of food and water scarcity, and we cannot afford to treat these issues in isolation. Agriculture already consumes 70% of the world's freshwater, and extreme weather will only deepen the crisis. But solutions exist. From renewable-powered desalination to circular resource systems and innovations in controlled-environment agriculture, we have the tools to build resilience. What we need now is collaboration across borders and sectors to secure sustainable food and water systems for future generations.\"</p><p>During WGES 2025, prominent decision-makers, officials, experts, innovators and representatives from government entities, the private sector and the academic community worldwide will explore the disproportionate effects of climate change on vulnerable communities, particularly in relation to health, food security and access to water. Sessions will address rising risks such as extreme heat, air pollution and resource scarcity, while showcasing innovative solutions including AI-driven smart farming, agrivoltaics and advanced water management technologies. With a focus on sustainability, resilience and cross-border collaboration, the summit will examine strategies to ensure equitable access to essential resources in a changing climate.</p><p>Water</p><p>WGES will address ways to achieve long-term progress in confronting the global challenge of water scarcity. It will focus on strengthening sustainable water security systems at a global scale, accelerating the development of innovative technological solutions and evaluating their effectiveness in mitigating this growing crisis. According to the United Nations, one in three people worldwide lacks access to safe drinking water, and over two billion people live in water-stressed regions. Participants will share the latest practices and insights to mobilise all sectors and communities in climate action, with a strong emphasis on achieving the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030, particularly the sixth goal that focuses on clean water and sanitation.</p><p>Health</p><p>The summit will highlight the critical role of innovation and technology in developing more efficient, inclusive health systems that mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate-related risks threaten to reverse decades of progress in global health, jeopardising lives and undermining ongoing efforts to combat disease and save lives.</p><p>Food</p><p>The summit enhances collaboration and drives investment in smart, sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural and food systems. It aims to confront the severe pressures and risks posed by climate change, strengthen adaptative capacity, reduce carbon emissions, promote sustainable food production and, ultimately, eliminate hunger around the world. Studies reveal that food systems contribute more than 30% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the urgent need for transformative change to reshape global food systems and accelerate the transition towards sustainability.</p><p>[Category: Renewable Energy, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: Dubai Electricity &amp; Water Authority, Government of Dubai,

San Francisco's decarbonization efforts have gained significant momentum this past year as the City's Climate Equity Hub continues to ramp up its no-cost HPWH installation to qualified residents.</p><p>\"The Climate Equity Hub has been successful from the start, because it grew out of government and community collaboration,\" said Tyrone Jue, Director of SF Environment. \"Communities knew jobs were key to the program's success, and the turnout at this training is a reminder of the role the City can play to prepare the workforce for climate action. Green jobs are here to stay, and as demand for them grows, San Franciscans will benefit.\"</p><p>SF Environment partnered withCity College of San Francisco (CCSF) and appliance manufacturers to train local contractors on the installation of HPWH. 75 participating plumbers and HVAC installers received a manufacturer's certification to install electric water heaters in homes and businesses. This event was at capacity and had a significant waitlist.</p><p>\"I encourage contractors, as well as City College of San Francisco students, to attend future trainings so they are prepared for the work of the future,\"said Nick Rothman, Chair of the Automotive, Construction, Custodial, and Motorcycle departments at the City College of San Francisco.</p><p>CCSF servesmore than 40,000 students annually at several centers throughout San Francisco, offering an affordable opportunity to earn certificates and degrees while learning hands-on skills like carpentry, plumbing, and automotive repair.Partnering with SF Environment on this program provides a timely resource andopportunitytoeducate contractors.</p><p>\"Over 70 contractors showed up, a turnout we've never seen at past warehouse trainings,\" said Chad Asay, Principal of Smart Building Solutions. \"The presentations from Rheem, A.O. Smith, and Bradford White made it simple to see how to install the tank. Contractors left with a clear understanding of how to make heat pump installs affordable through local incentives, and how to access support services so they can focus on what they do best, the installs.\"</p><p>After an incredibly successful first year completing electrification projects for 24 residential units across the city, SF Environmentplans to reach an additional 50-80 households this year. The Climate Equity Hub aims to support the transition in as many homes as possible before a series of new Bay Area Air District zero emission appliance regulations start taking effect in 2027. This can only happen with a workforce ready to take on these jobs.</p><p>In addition to these existing resources, the Climate Equity Hub is now partnering with the newly launchedBayREN EASE Home program to provide low-cost weatherization and energy efficiency upgrades to residents .</p><p>SF Environment's newly launchedbetterelectric.org is a resource for both residents and contractors looking to connect with the Climate Equity Hub's programs. Residents can explore how replacing gas appliances with all-electric units can improve their health, comfort, and home resilience. Contractors can participate in education programs that will prepare them for the transition to electric appliances.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127303053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJK-YTR3-RVD0-W2WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 19, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As part of its ongoing work on water and climate equity, the Pacific Institute produced the report in collaboration with the Livelihoods Knowledge Exchange Network (LiKEN) and rural technical assistance providers.</p><p><br/>Pacific Institute research has found that many rural communities across the United States face persistent challenges in accessing safe, affordable, and reliable water and sanitation. In some rural areas, households lack running water or basic plumbing, while others rely on systems that do not consistently meet health and safety standards. Climate change is worsening these already serious challenges.<br/>\"There is no other resource like this specifically tailored for rural communities,\" said Dr. Shannon McNeeley , lead author and Associate Director of Water and Climate Equity at the Pacific Institute.\"Rural communities face distinct challenges in ensuring reliable access to water and sanitation. This report fills a recognized knowledge gap about rural water systems. It highlights the unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities of rural communities while providing actionable strategies for rural leaders and water managers.\"<br/>This report builds on a report published by Pacific Institute, DigDeep, and Center for Water Security and Cooperation in March 2025 that compiled strategies for equitable, climate-resilient water and sanitation in frontline communities. This new report focuses specifically on rural contexts and communities. The report framework outlines key attributes of equitable, climate-resilient rural water and sanitation into eight categories: Built Infrastructure, Technology and Innovation, Natural Infrastructure, Management and Planning, Funding and Financing, Knowledge and Information, Capacity Building, and Law and Policy. Each category includes associated strategies designed to advance equitable, climate-resilient rural water and sanitation. It includes real-world examples of successful implementation and online tools to support and inspire action.<br/>This compilation of equitable and climate-resilient strategies comes at a critical time as climate change increasingly exacerbates the impacts of climate disasters and rural water and sanitation access and affordability challenges. Climate disruptions like catastrophic flooding, water and power outages from extreme storms, and diminished water supply and water quality from drought increase the risk of communities losing access to water and sanitation. These growing climate risks can be intensified for rural communities due to unique factors like dispersed or remote populations, limited workforce and financial capacity, chronic underinvestment, and aging infrastructure.<br/>\"Rural communities are often overlooked and underrepresented in the development of tools, resources, and programs for responding to climate disruptions, even though they are uniquely affected,\" said Betsy Taylor , Executive Director of LiKEN.\"Despite facing unique challenges, one of the key takeaways from the report is that rural communities are implementing and creating strategies to strengthen their resilience.\"<br/>This report captures the locally driven strategies rural communities are implementing to prepare their water and sanitation systems for the impacts of climate change. Some of those strategies include:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Developing emergency response plans and implementing emergency response systems to help rural water operators perform necessary actions during climate emergencies. Centering rural communities in all stages of water, sanitation, and climate planning and management, including beginning with visioning exercises to incorporate local knowledge and values from the outset. Offering income-qualified assistance programs for climate-resilient decentralized water infrastructure upgrades and water efficient technologies to lessen the financial burden on rural households.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Through the 130+ strategies, the report highlights the strengths, interconnectedness, creativity, and resources of rural communities rather than focusing solely on the barriers they face. This asset-based and community-centered approach supports local empowerment and collective action.<br/>The full report is available at:<br/>-XXX-<br/>Founded in 1987, the Pacific Institute is a global water think tank that combines science-based thought leadership with active outreach to influence local, national, and international efforts in developing sustainable water policies.

As part of its ongoing work on water and climate equity, the Pacific Institute produced the report in collaboration with the\u00a0Livelihoods Knowledge Exchange Network (LiKEN)\u00a0and rural technical assistance providers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pacific Institute research has found that many rural communities across the United States face persistent challenges in accessing safe, affordable, and reliable water and sanitation. In some rural areas, households lack running water or basic plumbing, while others rely on systems that do not consistently meet health and safety standards. Climate change is worsening these already serious challenges.</p><p>\u201cThere is no other resource like this specifically tailored for rural communities,\u201d said\u00a0Dr. Shannon McNeeley, lead author and Associate Director of Water and Climate Equity at the Pacific Institute. \u201cRural communities face distinct challenges in ensuring reliable access to water and sanitation. This report fills a recognized knowledge gap about rural water systems. It highlights the unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities of rural communities while providing actionable strategies for rural leaders and water managers.\u201d</p><p>This report builds on a\u00a0report\u00a0published by Pacific Institute, DigDeep, and Center for Water Security and Cooperation in March 2025 that compiled strategies for equitable, climate-resilient water and sanitation in frontline communities. This new report focuses specifically on rural contexts and communities. The report framework outlines key attributes of equitable, climate-resilient rural water and sanitation into eight categories: Built Infrastructure, Technology and Innovation, Natural Infrastructure, Management and Planning, Funding and Financing, Knowledge and Information, Capacity Building, and Law and Policy. Each category includes associated strategies designed to advance equitable, climate-resilient rural water and sanitation. It includes real-world examples of successful implementation and online tools to support and inspire action.</p><p>This compilation of equitable and climate-resilient strategies comes at a critical time as climate change increasingly exacerbates the impacts of climate disasters and rural water and sanitation access and affordability challenges. Climate disruptions like catastrophic flooding, water and power outages from extreme storms, and diminished water supply and water quality from drought increase the risk of communities losing access to water and sanitation. These growing climate risks can be intensified for rural communities due to unique factors like dispersed or remote populations, limited workforce and financial capacity, chronic underinvestment, and aging infrastructure.</p><p>\u201cRural communities are often overlooked and underrepresented in the development of tools, resources, and programs for responding to climate disruptions, even though they are uniquely affected,\u201d said\u00a0Betsy Taylor, Executive Director of LiKEN. \u201cDespite facing unique challenges, one of the key takeaways from the report is that rural communities are implementing and creating strategies to strengthen their resilience.\u201d</p><p>This report captures the locally driven strategies rural communities are implementing to prepare their water and sanitation systems for the impacts of climate change. Some of those strategies include:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Developing emergency response plans and implementing emergency response systems to help rural water operators perform necessary actions during climate emergencies.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Centering rural communities in all stages of water, sanitation, and climate planning and management, including beginning with visioning exercises to incorporate local knowledge and values from the outset.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Offering income-qualified assistance programs for climate-resilient decentralized water infrastructure upgrades and water efficient technologies to lessen the financial burden on rural households.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Through the 130+ strategies, the report highlights the strengths, interconnectedness, creativity, and resources of rural communities rather than focusing solely on the barriers they face. This asset-based and community-centered approach supports local empowerment and collective action.</p><p>The full report is available at:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://pacinst.org/publication/strategies-for-resilient-rural-water-and-sanitation-in-the-united-states/\">https://pacinst.org/publication/strategies-for-resilient-rural-water-and-sanitation-in-the-united-states/</url></p><p>\u2014XXX\u2014</p><p>Founded in 1987, the\u00a0Pacific Institute\u00a0is a global water think tank that combines science-based thought leadership with active outreach to influence local, national, and international efforts in developing sustainable water policies.

Our shared commitment today empowers this institution and gives life to our words,\" he said.</p><p>He stressed that the PRF represents a shift in climate finance.</p><p>\"We are manifesting our shared vision to establish the PRF as a new innovative way of doing business in climate financing, signalling that climate equity and justice is a right, and that the time for tired narratives is gone and the time for action is now,\" he said.</p><p>The Tongan leader said the region could not wait.</p><p>\"Based on all our lived experiences with our extreme vulnerabilities to natural hazards like cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods, the Pacific does not have the luxury of time as climate change threatens the livelihoods and very existence of our people and communities,\" he said.</p><p>Dr Eke said the next challenge is to meet the facility's capitalisation target.</p><p>\"We must also recognise the significant responsibility ahead to meet the capitalisation target of US$500 million by the end of 2026. This Agreement and the Capitalisation Memorandum will be key instruments in driving our advocacy efforts toward that goal,\" he said.</p><p>Looking ahead, he said the PRF's next milestone will be in Palau.</p><p>\"We look ahead to the 55th Forum Leaders Meeting in Palau in 2026 as the platform to launch the inaugural call for pilot project proposals,\" he said.</p><p>Dr Eke reaffirmed Tonga's role as host of PRF.</p><p>\"On behalf of the Government and people of Tonga, I extend our sincere appreciation to the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders for entrusting Tonga with the honour of hosting the PRF.

The report includes information, documents, and communications obtained by the Committee showing how the Biden Administration weaponized the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to ensure awards went to Democratic allies, leaving taxpayer funds vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>Todays report from the House Oversight Committee exposes the Biden Administrations sweeping green energy scheme, designed to funnel tens of billions in taxpayer dollars to enrich Democratic allies and fund partisan, politically motivated projects. Its clear the Biden Administration turned the Environmental Protection Agency into a vehicle for rewarding political allies, all while risking the stability of our energy infrastructure and burdening American families with higher utility costs. Americans deserve better than this green energy scam disguised as environmental justice, and Oversight Republicans will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable to ensure the EPA operates as intended and that taxpayer dollars are spent transparently, responsibly, and in the best interest of the American people. We applaud EPA Administrator Zeldins action to shut down this Green New Deal scam and protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse, said House Committee on Oversight and Government Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.).</p><p>President Trumps EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin led an internal review and unearthed significant deficiencies in the GGRF award process. On March 11, 2025, Administrator Zeldin terminated these grant agreements due to concerns over widespread waste, fraud, and abuse. The EPAs acting Inspector General is investigating potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the GGRF. The EPA has formally referred the GGRF to the U.S. Department of Justice for potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and fraud.</p><p>Below are key findings from the Committee report:</p><p>In 2023, the Biden Administration earmarked $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to advance Democrats radical environmental justice agenda. The EPA awarded $20 billion from the GGRF to just eight nonprofits closely tied to Democratic allies.</p><p>These awards created a Green New Deal grift by increasing the nonprofits assets by as much as 2,000,000,000%.</p><p>The Biden Administration designed the process to ensure GGRF funds went to Democratic allies by prioritizing climate equity metrics over merit. The Biden EPA weighted equity and environmental justice as much as financial statements, and more than governance, compliance risk management, or consumer protection policies. One nonprofit receiving funds lacked even the basic capacity to comply with EPAs reporting requirements.</p><p>Documents reveal outright waste, fraud, and abuse within the GGRF, including taxpayer-funded, exorbitant salaries with lavish travel benefits for C-suite executives. Funds were also slated for questionable projects such as housing for artists, a bar and communal kitchen, and emissions-free equipment for a brewery.</p><p>The Democrats scheme to redirect taxpayer dollars to their policy elites has created an artificial economy built around environmental justiceand its become big business for well-connected insiders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNCMW-508260994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNCMW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR7-VCW3-RSF8-J402-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420008</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school across the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!<br/>You have robbed me of my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I am one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!<br/>For over 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to turn a blind eye and come here saying you are doing enough, when the policies and solutions needed are still not in sight?<br/>You say you hear us and understand the urgency. But as sad and angry as I am, I don't want to believe it. Because if you really understood the situation and yet still failed to act, you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.<br/>\"The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 percent chance of staying below 1.5 degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.<br/>Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those figures do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution, or aspects of climate equity and justice. They also depend on my generation absorbing hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 from the air with technologies that barely exist.<br/>So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us who have to live with the consequences.<br/>To have a 67% chance of staying below a global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's best estimate - the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 to emit on January 1, 2018. Today, that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.<br/>How dare they pretend that this can be solved simply with \"business as usual\" and some technical solutions? At current emission levels, that remaining CO2 budget will disappear completely in less than eight and a half years.<br/>No solutions or plans in line with these figures will be presented today, because they are too cumbersome. And they are not yet mature enough to tell it like it is.<br/>They are failing us. But young people are beginning to understand their betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are on you. And if you decide to fail us, I tell you: we will never forgive you.<br/>We will not let you get away with it. Here and now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.<br/>\"Thank you.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73014043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR1-WSJ3-RRSM-61H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 11, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Ambiente</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000056</classCode><className>AIR POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

The report includes information, documents, and communications obtained by the Committee showing how the Biden Administration weaponized the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to ensure awards went to Democratic allies, leaving taxpayer funds vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>\"Today's report from the House Oversight Committee exposes the Biden Administration's sweeping green energy scheme, designed to funnel tens of billions in taxpayer dollars to enrich Democratic allies and fund partisan, politically motivated projects. It's clear the Biden Administration turned the Environmental Protection Agency into a vehicle for rewarding political allies, all while risking the stability of our energy infrastructure and burdening American families with higher utility costs. Americans deserve better than this green energy scam disguised as environmental justice, and Oversight Republicans will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable to ensure the EPA operates as intended and that taxpayer dollars are spent transparently, responsibly, and in the best interest of the American people. We applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin's action to shut down this Green New Deal scam and protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse,\" said House Committee on Oversight and Government Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.).</p><p>President Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin led an internal review and unearthed significant deficiencies in the GGRF award process. On March 11, 2025, Administrator Zeldin terminated these grant agreements due to concerns over widespread waste, fraud, and abuse. The EPA's acting Inspector General is investigating potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the GGRF. The EPA has formally referred the GGRF to the U.S. Department of Justice for potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and fraud.</p><p>Below are key findings from the Committee report:</p><p>In 2023, the Biden Administration earmarked $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to advance Democrats' radical \"environmental justice\" agenda. The EPA awarded $20 billion from the GGRF to just eight nonprofits closely tied to Democratic allies.</p><p>These awards created a Green New Deal grift by increasing the nonprofits' assets by as much as 2,000,000,000%.</p><p>The Biden Administration designed the process to ensure GGRF funds went to Democratic allies by prioritizing climate equity metrics over merit. The Biden EPA weighted \"equity and environmental justice\" as much as financial statements, and more than governance, compliance risk management, or consumer protection policies. One nonprofit receiving funds lacked even the basic capacity to comply with EPA's reporting requirements.</p><p>Documents reveal outright waste, fraud, and abuse within the GGRF, including taxpayer-funded, exorbitant salaries with lavish travel benefits for C-suite executives. Funds were also slated for questionable projects such as housing for artists, a bar and communal kitchen, and emissions-free equipment for a brewery.</p><p>The Democrats' scheme to redirect taxpayer dollars to their policy elites has created an artificial economy built around environmental justiceand it's become big business for well-connected insiders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127338449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR3-BPT3-RTGN-107C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 11, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The report includes information, documents, and communications obtained by the Committee showing how the Biden Administration weaponized the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to ensure awards went to Democratic allies, leaving taxpayer funds vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>\"Today's report from the House Oversight Committee exposes the Biden Administration's sweeping green energy scheme, designed to funnel tens of billions in taxpayer dollars to enrich Democratic allies and fund partisan, politically motivated projects. It's clear the Biden Administration turned the Environmental Protection Agency into a vehicle for rewarding political allies, all while risking the stability of our energy infrastructure and burdening American families with higher utility costs. Americans deserve better than this green energy scam disguised as environmental justice, and Oversight Republicans will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable to ensure the EPA operates as intended and that taxpayer dollars are spent transparently, responsibly, and in the best interest of the American people. We applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin's action to shut down this Green New Deal scam and protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse,\" said House Committee on Oversight and Government Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.).</p><p>President Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin led an internal review and unearthed significant deficiencies in the GGRF award process. On March 11, 2025, Administrator Zeldin terminated these grant agreements due to concerns over widespread waste, fraud, and abuse. The EPA's acting Inspector General is investigating potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the GGRF. The EPA has formally referred the GGRF to the U.S. Department of Justice for potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and fraud.</p><p>Below are key findings from the Committee report:</p><p>* In 2023, the Biden Administration earmarked $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to advance Democrats' radical \"environmental justice\" agenda. The EPA awarded $20 billion from the GGRF to just eight nonprofits closely tied to Democratic allies.</p><p>* These awards created a Green New Deal grift by increasing the nonprofits' assets by as much as 2,000,000,000%.</p><p>* The Biden Administration designed the process to ensure GGRF funds went to Democratic allies by prioritizing climate equity metrics over merit. The Biden EPA weighted \"equity and environmental justice\" as much as financial statements, and more than governance, compliance risk management, or consumer protection policies. One nonprofit receiving funds lacked even the basic capacity to comply with EPA's reporting requirements.</p><p>* Documents reveal outright waste, fraud, and abuse within the GGRF, including taxpayer-funded, exorbitant salaries with lavish travel benefits for C-suite executives. Funds were also slated for questionable projects such as housing for artists, a bar and communal kitchen, and emissions-free equipment for a brewery.</p><p>* The Democrats' scheme to redirect taxpayer dollars to their policy elites has created an artificial economy built around environmental justice--and it's become big business for well-connected insiders.</p><p>Read the report here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-10_Report_Green-New-Deal-Scam.pdf\">https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-10_Report_Green-New-Deal-Scam.pdf</url>).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-exposing-bidens-green-new-deal-scam-benefitting-democratic-allies/\">https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-exposing-bidens-green-new-deal-scam-benefitting-democratic-allies/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9381435 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9381435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR2-HK03-RRKV-T2VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 12, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The report includes information, documents, and communications obtained by the Committee showing how the Biden Administration weaponized the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to ensure awards went to Democratic allies, leaving taxpayer funds vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>\"Today's report from the House Oversight Committee exposes the Biden Administration's sweeping green energy scheme, designed to funnel tens of billions in taxpayer dollars to enrich Democratic allies and fund partisan, politically motivated projects. It's clear the Biden Administration turned the Environmental Protection Agency into a vehicle for rewarding political allies, all while risking the stability of our energy infrastructure and burdening American families with higher utility costs. Americans deserve better than this green energy scam disguised as environmental justice, and Oversight Republicans will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable to ensure the EPA operates as intended and that taxpayer dollars are spent transparently, responsibly, and in the best interest of the American people. We applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin's action to shut down this Green New Deal scam and protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse,\" said House Committee on Oversight and Government Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.).</p><p>President Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin led an internal review and unearthed significant deficiencies in the GGRF award process. On March 11, 2025, Administrator Zeldin terminated these grant agreements due to concerns over widespread waste, fraud, and abuse. The EPA's acting Inspector General is investigating potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the GGRF. The EPA has formally referred the GGRF to the U.S. Department of Justice for potential financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and fraud.</p><p>Below are key findings from the Committee report:</p><p>* In 2023, the Biden Administration earmarked $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to advance Democrats' radical \"environmental justice\" agenda. The EPA awarded $20 billion from the GGRF to just eight nonprofits closely tied to Democratic allies.</p><p>* These awards created a Green New Deal grift by increasing the nonprofits' assets by as much as 2,000,000,000%.</p><p>* The Biden Administration designed the process to ensure GGRF funds went to Democratic allies by prioritizing climate equity metrics over merit. The Biden EPA weighted \"equity and environmental justice\" as much as financial statements, and more than governance, compliance risk management, or consumer protection policies. One nonprofit receiving funds lacked even the basic capacity to comply with EPA's reporting requirements.</p><p>* Documents reveal outright waste, fraud, and abuse within the GGRF, including taxpayer-funded, exorbitant salaries with lavish travel benefits for C-suite executives. Funds were also slated for questionable projects such as housing for artists, a bar and communal kitchen, and emissions-free equipment for a brewery.</p><p>* The Democrats' scheme to redirect taxpayer dollars to their policy elites has created an artificial economy built around environmental justice--and it's become big business for well-connected insiders.</p><p>Read the report here <url normalizedValue=\"https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-10_Report_Green-New-Deal-Scam.pdf\">https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-10_Report_Green-New-Deal-Scam.pdf</url>.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-exposing-bidens-green-new-deal-scam-benefitting-democratic-allies/\">https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-exposing-bidens-green-new-deal-scam-benefitting-democratic-allies/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHP911515Q2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR2-H8G3-S0WJ-02XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 11, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Under the theme 'Innovating for Impact: Accelerating the Future of the Green Economy', the summit will convene policymakers, investors, business leaders, academics and innovators to mobilise capital toward equitable, sustainable growth. Organised under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin\u202fRashid\u202fAl\u202fMaktoum and spearheaded by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority and the World Green Economy Organization, WGES aims to translate COP28's UAE Consensus into operational climate strategies.</p><p>Leaders will underscore the necessity of green capital to ensure a fair transition for vulnerable communities. HE\u202fSaeed\u202fMohammed\u202fAl\u202fTayer, Vice\u2011Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and MD &amp; CEO of DEWA, will highlight how the summit furthers global commitments under the Paris Agreement through investments in innovation, finance and data-driven research that benefit all humanity.</p><p>Addressing climate equity, participants from small island and developing states will bring critical perspectives. The Minister of Agriculture, Climate Change and Energy of the Seychelles will speak to the interwoven nature of development and environmental limits, while Madagascar's Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development will emphasise that \"the green transition must be just \u2013 or it will fail,\" highlighting those who lose livelihoods to drought, flood and neglect.</p><p>Technological innovation and science will receive equal attention. Dr\u202fTarifa\u202fAlzaabi, Director General of the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture, will point to science-based strategies that build resilient agriculture and water systems. Professor Nazia\u202fM\u202fHabib from the University of Cambridge will stress that a just green transition involves clarifying who gains, who bears the costs and how institutions are funded.</p><p>Industry thought\u2011leaders will offer solutions that span key sectors. Olaf\u202fvan\u202fder\u202fVeen, CEO and co\u2011founder of Orbisk, will make the case that reducing food waste offers immediate, high\u2011impact mitigation through its effect on emissions and resource use. Angela\u202fHomsi, founder of Ignite Energy Access and Ignite Partners, will demonstrate that providing clean energy in underserved markets is not just ethical\u2014it is economically compelling, with distributed renewable energy already outperforming in some of the toughest markets globally.</p><p>Focus will also turn to water and food security. Adri\u202fPols, CEO of Desolenator, will frame climate-induced scarcity as a crisis demanding integrated responses\u2014advocating renewable-powered desalination and circular systems to tackle pressures on agriculture and freshwater supplies.</p><p>Sessions will explore the disproportionate burden climate change places on the vulnerable, especially concerning health, food security and water access. Delegates will evaluate rapid, equitable solutions\u2014ranging from AI-driven smart farming and agrivoltaics to advanced water management tools\u2014all aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Water scarcity and health impacts of climate change will feature prominently. With one in three people lacking safe drinking water and over 2 billion facing water stress worldwide, WGES will examine scalable technologies to strengthen sustainable water systems and reach SDG\u202f6. Equally, climate-related health threats that could reverse decades of progress will drive calls for inclusive and resilient health infrastructure.</p><p>____________________________________</p><p>This article first appeared on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenlogue.com/2025/09/green-finance-anchors-dubais-green.html?ref=LU-Tap-ContentBottom\">Greenlogue.com</url> and is brought to you by  Hyphen Digital Network</p><p>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://\"/>).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARABPO-506528908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARABPO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GN0-4B33-RRVW-B1YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435508</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  The Arabian Post Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The legislation builds upon Supervisor Mandelman's All-Electric New Construction Ordinance and continues the Board President's commitment to a safer, healthier, and more sustainable San Francisco. Under this ordinance, major renovation building projects must go all-electric, improving public health and safety and reducing emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We can't build the San Francisco of the future with a fuel from the past,\" said Board of Supervisors President, Rafael Mandelman. \"This legislation picks up where we left off with the All-Electric New Construction ordinance and affords us the opportunity to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in our existing buildings, improve indoor and outdoor air quality, and make San Francisco a safer, healthier, and more resilient place to live and work. Choosing clean energy is how we build the clean, all-electric City of the future.\"</p><p>Building operations are responsible for nearly half of San Francisco's emissions. Most of these emissions stem from the combustion of methane, more commonly referred to as natural gas, in existing buildings. The combustion of this super pollutantfor heating, cooling, and other building functionsposes significant threats to humans and the planet. In addition to impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health, natural gas-powered fixtures further exacerbate the climate crisis, increase the risk of fire during earthquakes, and take significantly longer to get back up and running after seismic events.</p><p>\"This ordinance protects the health and safety of San Franciscans by phasing out outdated gas systems in major renovations,\" said Tyrone Jue, Director of the San Francisco Environment Department. \"It reduces indoor air pollution, strengthens building safety, and ensures our infrastructure is ready for a cleaner, more resilient future. And as we make our homes safer, we're also cutting the pollution that fuels the climate crisis because in San Francisco protecting people and protecting the planet go hand in hand.\"</p><p>\"San Francisco is leading the charge towards building a green future for our city,\" said Supervisor Bilal Mahmood. \"Large-scale renovations offer an opportunity to reduce our City's reliance on fossil fuels, shrink our carbon footprint, and ensure a more sustainable future for all.\"</p><p>Mechanical systems in existing buildings are customarily upgraded or replaced for many reasons, including deterioration, building expansion, energy efficiency improvements, or building conversions. Targeting gas-powered systems at this point, when the project scope also includes major construction, is the most efficient and inexpensive way to electrify. By requiring buildings undergoing major renovations, a very high bar in the building code, to be rebuilt all-electric, the new ordinance helps San Francisco decarbonize its existing building stock in the most cost-effective way.</p><p>\"Building decarbonization is essential if we are going to have a fighting chance against climate change,\" said Supervisor Jackie Fielder. \"I am proud that San Francisco is showing leadership on this important environmental issue by expanding our building decarbonization requirements to include major renovations.\"</p><p>San Francisco is already going all-electric. The City's successful Climate Equity Hub has completed 26 projects/installs and has 45 in progress, targeting lower-income families with cost-free electric appliance installations. Affordable housing projects like Casa Adelante, Maceo May, 400 China Basin, and Transbay 2 West senior housing have been built all-electric, providing the community with healthier, safer, all-electric buildings. And the renovation of a small residential project in the Mission District by the Mission Economic Development Association (MEDA) has replaced gas appliances with all-electric ones in both the existing building and in its new additions. In fact, throughout the State, the vast majority of new construction projects are all-electric.</p><p>The ordinance is the result of over two years of planning and outreach. Engaged stakeholders include the Building Operations Task Force, developers, nonprofits, tenants' rights organizations, contractors, unions, and professional/housing associations. The passage of this legislation moves the City one step closer to electrifying all of San Francisco's buildings, which is key to San Francisco meeting its ambitious goal of net zero emissions by 2040. The ordinance will take effect in July 2026.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127323644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GN5-M4F3-RV6J-X4Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 2, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Complying with Public Act No. 23-156, the roadmap seeks to discuss Connecticut's vision for incorporating clean hydrogen into its broader energy landscape; guide clean hydrogen production and infrastructure development and target strategic end uses; encourage the use of hydrogen produced from renewable energy; assess the benefits and risks of clean hydrogen; and recommend policies, programs, and pilot projects to enable clean hydrogen market development in line with state decarbonization and economic development goals. The roadmap builds on a series of previous stakeholder sessions led by DEEP, as well as findings from the state's Hydrogen Power Task Force, and includes a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the potential impacts of clean hydrogen development across five energy strategy lenses: affordability, climate, equity, reliability and resilience, and economic development. To help guide the types of clean hydrogen projects that may be eligible for future state policy and program incentives, DEEP proposes a definition for clean hydrogen and outlines short, medium, and long-term clean hydrogen targets and corresponding economic and climate impacts through 2040.</p><p>To learn more about Connecticut's Clean Hydrogen Roadmap process and other DEEP-led clean hydrogen initiatives, click here.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.naseo.org/news-article?NewsID=4161\">https://www.naseo.org/news-article?NewsID=4161</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9350318 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9350318</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD2-4173-RWP3-62TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"310\"/><timeReceived>10:18 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 31, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030 and reflects the UAE's commitment to adopt innovative solutions that support resource sustainability and economic growth.</p><p>Organised annually by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), this year's summit will take place under the theme 'Innovating for Impact: Accelerating the Future of the Green Economy' on 1-2 October 2025 at the Dubai World Trade Centre.</p><p>\"International data indicates accelerating growth in clean energy production capacity globally. This reflects a shift in priorities toward sustainable, low-emission energy sources, especially in light of increasing energy demand from data centres and artificial intelligence (AI), and the global pursuit of carbon neutrality. Through the World Green Economy Summit, which brings together decision-makers, thought leaders and global experts, we help to accelerate the adoption of clean and renewable energy by facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors, financial institutions and international organisations in key areas such as clean energy, sustainable finance and green technology. This platform supports effective partnerships, stimulates innovation and shares best practices to achieve a sustainable future for us and generations to come,\" said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD and CEO of DEWA and Chairman of WGEO.</p><p>Role of AI in energy transition</p><p>Commenting on the key role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the energy sector, Dr Amalia Pantazidis, President of Lummus Consultants International and one of the speakers at WGES 2025, said AI has the potential to transform every aspect of the energy transition.</p><p>\"With AI, we can optimise the performance of key sectors of the energy value chain - including renewable power, refining and petrochemical production - to make complex, carbon-intensive industrial operations more sustainable. Predictive maintenance, real-time optimisation, smart forecasting and other digital tools are not just improving efficiency - they are making clean energy more reliable, economic and accessible. At Lummus, we are integrating AI and digital solutions to help our customers unlock new levels of energy efficiency, waste reduction, resilience and lower emissions,\" said Dr Pantazidis.</p><p>Jessica Scopacasa, co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer of Olive Gaea and one of the speakers at WGES 2025, said: \"Climate urgency is rising, and action must follow. AI offers a powerful path to accelerate decarbonisation and make sustainability a true source of value - not just a reporting exercise. But we must build and use it ethically, transparently and with long-term impact in mind.\"</p><p>Stwart Pea Feliz, co-founder and CEO of MacroCycle Technologies, said: \"Circularity can only be achieved by bringing together all the stakeholders across the value chain. This event is a monumental opportunity to engage in fruitful conversations to achieve an economical pathway towards true circularity.\"</p><p>Green hydrogen</p><p>Green hydrogen also supports energy storage and cross-border transport, enhancing energy security and diversification. Seen as a new economic engine, green hydrogen has the potential to transform supply chains, industry and energy systems, offering strong export opportunities for producing countries. The UAE's National Hydrogen Strategy 2050, launched in 2023, aims to establish the country as a regional production and export hub by 2031, targeting 1.4 million tonnes of annual production, including one million tonnes of green hydrogen. This will be achieved through investment promotion, infrastructure development, R&amp;D and international partnerships.</p><p>Elie Adaimy Group Director Business Development, Technology &amp; Innovation at Gulf Cryo Group and one of the speakers at WGES 2025, said: \"Green hydrogen has captured global imagination - but imagination alone won't decarbonise heavy industry or fuel our future. To move from MoUs to megawatts, and to start building a new energy economy, we must move from pilot projects to scalable deployment, with bold policy, bankable offtake agreements and regional co-operation, turning ambition into reality.\"</p><p>The role of critical minerals in energy transition</p><p>Minerals are vital to the manufacture of energy transition technologies such as batteries, wind turbines and solar panels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that by 2040, lithium demand could increase over 40 times, while graphite, cobalt and nickel may grow 20-25 times, compared to 2020, and copper demand is expected to more than double. This shift highlights the need for sustainable supply chains that ensure responsible resource extraction. Green hydrogen also plays a key role in decarbonising emission-intensive sectors such as heavy industry and transport. As a zero-emission fuel produced via electrolysis from renewable sources, it is gaining traction among governments and global companies.</p><p>Energy storage</p><p>Another crucial aspect is energy storage, which ensures grid stability amid a growing reliance on intermittent sources such as solar and wind. The IEA's net-zero emissions scenario shows global grid-scale storage capacity grew from 10 GW in 2020 to 28 GW in 2022, and is expected to reach 967 GW by 2030, driven by advances in battery technology, falling costs and smart grid development. Storage technologies enable renewable integration and improve energy access in remote areas, with lithium-ion and grid-scale batteries central to achieving net-zero goals.</p><p>WGES role</p><p>WGES facilitates strategic discussions among decision-makers, investors, academic institutions and international organisations. It highlights key pillars shaping the future energy landscape and drives the transition towards a more resilient, efficient and inclusive energy system. Guided by innovation and the principles of climate equity, resource sustainability and cross-sectoral integration, the summit serves as a global platform to promote climate action and unify efforts for a more sustainable future. It not only focuses on reducing emissions, but also supports comprehensive and inclusive development for current and future generations.</p><p>[Category: Renewable Energy, Energy Equipment and Services, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: Dubai Electricity &amp;

Specifically, the Hub's inauguralHeat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) Direct Install Program has completed ten installations, has 22 units prepared for new HPWH installations and is on track to transition 50 more households in 2025.</p><p>The Climate Equity Hub was created through a partnership of community-based organizations and the San Francisco Environment Department. The Hub helps qualified residents in San Francisco navigate electrification incentive programs, connect with trusted contractors, and install appliances that eliminate greenhouse gas emissions- a one-stop-shop for home electrification.</p><p>\"San Francisco is leading the way in climate action by ensuring that no community is left behind in our transition to clean energy,\" said Mayor London Breed. \"The Climate Equity Hub is a powerful example of how we can create meaningful change through partnership and innovation, providing immediate relief to residents while strengthening our workforce for a greener future.\"</p><p>The Climate Equity Hub is a key part of San Francisco's bold Climate Action Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2040. This transition to clean electricity is essential for improving the City's climate, health, and resiliency, while ensuring that low-and-middle-income renters and owners are protected. The plan also supports affordable housing, creates job opportunities, and provides training for local workers- all developed through extensive public engagement.Click here to read the Plan.</p><p>\"I am excited to see our shared vision for greenhouse gas reductions and equitable climate action realized through the successful launch of our community-driven Climate Equity Hub,\" said District 8 Supervisor Rafael Mandelman. \"The Hub is a great example of how government can facilitate successful climate action by listening to community and committing funds to get projects off the ground. The challenge ahead is to find the ongoing resources needed to make sure every San Franciscan who qualifies can access The Hub's offerings.\"</p><p>Preparing for the Future</p><p>The Hub's inaugural program focuses on Heat Pump Water Heaters because they are 3-5 times more efficient than traditional gas water heaters, have a lower risk of fire and/or explosion, and reduce air pollution. Direct installation has proven to be a speedy, hassle free process for qualified residents. Assisting both renters and homeowners, the hub has already made meaningful impact in the lives of residents in just a few short months of operation.</p><p>\"Switching from a gas water heater to a new electric heat pump water heater has been a significant step toward a healthier home environment, especially as we learned about the hidden health impacts of gas emissions,\" said Teresa Dulalas, a recent program participant. \"It's reassuring to know that tenants are supported and that our journey toward a cleaner, safer home has been community driven. We're thankful for the education, resources, and the sense of security this collaboration has provided, and we're excited to explore more programs that benefit our health and environment in the future.\"</p><p>\"After months without hot water and struggling to cover the costs of a broken gas water heater that flooded my home, I found the Climate Equity Hub's program online,\" saidJolie Goorjian, a recent program participant. \"Within days of filling out the forms, they had a new, efficient electric water heater installed for me at no cost. The whole process was seamless, and the team was incredible, they made everything easy to understand and took care of everything. I couldn't believe how quickly I was able to move back into my home.\"</p><p>San Francisco's Climate Equity Hub will also provide essential support for the transition required by regional regulations and proposed state laws. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District recently approved new regulations to phase out and ultimately ban the sale and installation of gas-powered water heaters and furnaces.</p><p>\"I am thrilled to see this project come to life,\" said Tyrone Jue, Director of the San Francisco Environment Department. \"The only way we can be successful in achieving citywide net zero emissions by 2040 is with the full participation of all our residents. The Hub makes that participation possible particularly for those in our City who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The Hub is more than a program, it's an important tool that empowers communities to take meaningful action towards a greener and healthier future.\"</p><p>The advisors and contractors participating in the inaugural program are part of The Hub's broader effort to strengthen and expand the local decarbonization workforce to ensure it can meet the needs of the City's transition. Hub advisor, Emerald Cities Collaborative's E-Contractor Academy trains electrification specialists from equity communities, and at least half of the HPWH installation projects are given to contractors from these communities.</p><p>\"I am proud to participate in a program that supports residents and local businesses,\" said David Guan of DMG Construction. \"I appreciate the spirit of collaboration and support from the San Francisco Environment Department.\"</p><p>Driving San Francisco's Path to Net Zero Carbon Emissions</p><p>The Climate Equity Hub is one among several solutions including the all-electric new construction ordinance, and the development of Building Performance Standards, for which the Cityrecently received a $14 million award from the Department of Energy. These efforts are carving out pathways for buildings both large and small, commercial and residential to transition to electric, ensuring no communities are left behind.</p><p>San Francisco continues to make strides towards Mayor Breed's bold emissions reduction goals.

In a news release, the Agriculture Department said farmers and small businesses awarded grants through the Rural Energy for America Program will be called on to revise their projects to meet the new administration's policy priorities. In doing so, the USDA said, grant recipients will be asked several questions and to provide a description of the revisions to their projects. \"President Trump made tackling America's energy emergency a top priority from day one, and this review allows rural energy providers and small businesses to realign their projects with that mission,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in the news release. </p><p>\"We're ensuring these investments support U.S. energy production while putting America's farmers, ranchers, and rural businesses first.\" The department didn't immediately return a message Wednesday seeking details on how projects will be evaluated, but the USDA cited President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order called \"Unleashing American Energy\" and emphasizing \"oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources.\" Potentially at stake is hundreds of millions of dollars in grants already obligated in contracts funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, and which the Trump administration froze upon taking office. As many as 3,500 rural small businesses saw funding frozen, according to congressional Democrats who reviewed program data. The Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, started in 2002 and has been authorized in five-year farm bills ever since. It provides loan guarantees and grants to help farmers and rural small businesses cover the cost of energy efficiency projects including solar, wind and biogas-to-electricity systems. It's funded more than 22,000 projects in all 50 states, according to the Environmental Law and Policy Center. It's had bipartisan support in Congress, and funding has gone heavily toward Republican-leaning districts, given their dominance in rural areas. In recent years, small solar energy projects that reduce operating costs for farms and businesses have received the bulk of funding. But some funding has gone to manure digesters that create electricity, to grain-drying systems and to small wind energy systems. Trump has made his distaste for solar and large-scale wind energy obvious and earlier this year called wind turbines \"garbage in a field.\" The trouble for REAP now is in the $2 billion plus-up Congress gave the program in the Inflation Reduction Act to be spent over a decade, and potentially in the program's embrace of energy sources that aren't necessarily in line with the Trump administration's emphasis on fossil fuels. For last year's round of funding, the USDA encouraged applicants to advance priorities including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building resiliency against the changing climate, as well as \"advancing racial justice, place-based equity and opportunity,\" according to the Federal Register notice from Oct. 16. The notice added that projects with climate benefits such as zero-emissions goals could receive a 50 percent federal cost share, while biogas-to-energy projects would be eligible for a smaller cost share of 25 percent. The USDA news release said refocusing the program would steer money away from \"harmful DEIA and far-left climate features\" in project proposals. The environmental group Earthjustice accused the administration of changing the program's rules on farmers and businesses that already made investments based on the awards. \"The only 'opportunity' for farmers in USDA's disingenuous stunt is to formally deny already awarded grant funds instead of withholding them indefinitely,\" said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice. \"Farmers have taken on loans and spent thousands of dollars to install solar panels and pursue energy efficiency upgrades because they believed they would be paid back in line with their REAP agreement.\" Vizcarra added, \"President Trump and Secretary Rollins can't change the rules of the game well into the second half. This is the definition of an arbitrary and capricious catch-22.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000195d334d96da79ff33fa0880000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FMV-4SV3-S54S-24DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 26, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The move marks a noteworthy shift from past administrations, where civil servants have played major roles in dishing out the federal government's vast grant spending. That was done in part to avoid the appearance of political appointees playing favorites, according to former government officials. But after months of the Trump 2.0 team slashing spending across the federal government, the administration said concentrating grantmaking authority with political appointees will stop \"unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats from wasting taxpayer dollars.\" </p><p>The Trump executive order issued Thursday directs each agency head to designate a senior appointee to create a new process to review funding announcements and to renew discretionary grants to ensure that they're \"consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.\" The order aims to give political appointees more direct control over a sizable chunk of federal spending. In fiscal 2024, the federal government spent $1.1 trillion just on state and local government grants to fund programs including environmental protection and education. The Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency boasts on its website that it has terminated more than 15,000 government grants worth about $44 billion since January. The administration \"has already terminated many wasteful grants,\" the White House said in a fact sheet. The executive order, it says, \"helps ensure that bureaucrats can't make the same mistakes in the future.\" A 'significant departure' Trump assailed a series of grant recipients in his executive order as evidence that the process was broken, including programs that funded \"drag shows in Ecuador, trained doctoral candidates in critical race theory, and developed transgender-sexual-education programs.\" Federal grants have also gone to \"non-governmental organizations that provided free services to illegal immigrants, worsening the border crisis and compromising our safety, and to organizations that actively worked against American interests abroad,\" the executive order says. Agency bosses across the Trump administration have spent months touting cuts to federal grants and contracts inked by the Biden administration. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin declared earlier this year that the \"days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\" Zeldin on Thursday announced that his agency would terminate $7 billion in grants to help states, nonprofits and territories bring solar power to low-income communities. The National Science Foundation has announced the cancellations by 57 percent. The Trump administration's crackdown on grant approvals marks a \"significant departure\" from how the process has worked previously, said Matthew Tejada, a former senior career EPA staffer who led the agency's environmental justice office. \"I can't name a grant program that did not have political appointee involvement, but there were varying levels of that involvement, depending on the size and scope and gravity of the program,\" said Tejada, who's now a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Political appointees in the past have sought to avoid the appearance that they were meddling in the grantmaking process, Tejada said. He called Trump's approach an \"ineffective, unrealistic way of governing\" that will ultimately slow down the grantmaking process. \"The bureaucracy exists to help facilitate government working effectively and efficiently, and this is going in the opposite direction,\" Tejada said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001988a56d016a9fbdade91900000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNM-6MH3-S19M-63DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 8, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Austin Youth Climate Equity Council was created to connect youth leaders with knowledge, resources, and local leaders to help turn their ideas into impactful actions. Entering its fourth year, the Council is excited to welcome 35 local youth representing each City Council district and 21 different public, private, and charter schools. Facilitated by local nonprofit EcoRise, the mission of the Council is to activate the next generation of climate champions to engage in community issues around climate change, environmental policy, and environmental justice.</p><p>My generation needs leaders to tackle climate change. I want to be a part of this program so I can train to be a well-informed and effective leader, said newly appointed Youth Council Member Clara, a junior at McCallum High School. I love Austin, and Im very concerned about how climate change will affect our day-to-day lives. I want to meet people who share this interest with me and collaborate on real solutions to help preserve our city and the world.</p><p>This school year, Council members will learn about sustainability, civic procedures, and environmental justice and how these relate to improving their community's health and well-being. They will use the goals and strategies in Austin's Climate Equity Plan as a guide to support the work of local frontline community organizations, continue the work of past Council cohorts, and engage their communities in resilience initiatives.</p><p>Todays youth are powerful advocates for a sustainable future, said Zach Baumer, the City of Austins Chief Sustainability Officer. Through the Youth Climate Equity Council, were not only equipping them to understand and address climate issues but also to champion equity and resilience within their communities. Their work is vital to Austins path forward.</p><p>With their passion, creativity, and stake in solving the problems created by climate change, youth play an essential role in shaping the solutions that will impact them for decades to come, said Brittany Jayroe, EcoRise Senior Director of Youth Programs. These 35 youth will become effective leaders and contribute to the important climate equity work happening in Austin communities.</p><p>The Council is led and facilitated by the national sustainability education nonprofit EcoRise in partnership with the City of Austin's Office of Sustainability. Learn more about the work of last year's Youth Council members. Austin-area community organizations and sustainability professionals can contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:YouthPrograms@EcoRise.org\">YouthPrograms@EcoRise.org</email> to get involved in mentoring this years Council members.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126826978</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDK-VPT1-JCBF-S1BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Retreat of the United States (US) from the Paris Climate Accord and the upsurge in global environmental trade measures like EU carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM) have worsened the already paralysed global climate governance. CBAM, a controversial trade protection measure, can significantly distort the global trade order and alter the industrial practices of developing countries in their effort towards industrial decarbonisation and global trade competitiveness. Premised as a mechanism to plug the carbon leakage that may spill from the EU to other countries, as the latter have lax domestic emission standards, the mechanism projects to accelerate the decarbonisation efforts across countries through the imposition of carbon prices on exports to the EU.</p><p>For instance, while the EU's carbon price hovered around &amp;#8364;80-100 per ton of CO2, in most of the other parts of the world, it remains below &amp;#8364;10 per ton, which could be a major factor driving the relocation of the emission-intensive industries away from the EU. To start with, the mechanism aims to cover six high-emission intense sectors: cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen, aiming at minimising the significant risk of carbon leakage from the EU region.</p><p>Going against the current of multilateralism</p><p>CBAM is espoused by many countries like Brazil, China, and India as a trade barrier and is touted as a unilateral measure by EU. It is argued as a strategically designed protectionist measure by the EU, defying the principles of multilateralism and violating the norms of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade experts argue that CBAM is in contradiction with the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clause under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Article I, which calls for equal treatment for \"like\" products from all WTO members. CBAM, by levying differential tariffs on different products based on the embedded carbon content of the product, breaches the WTO clause of MFN. In addition, the design principle of CBAM is also in conflict with the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities - Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) principle of UNFCCC, which is considered central to international climate negotiations and driving global climate governance architecture. At the heart of the CBDR-RC principle lies the differential responsibility of nation states to address climate issues based on the differences in their historical emissions, current capabilities, and developmental priorities of countries. However, CBAM, which levies uniform carbon costs irrespective of developing countries' emission positions and economic capabilities, undermines the very core of the CBDR principle. By doing so, it adversely impacts the climate governance order, which has already been fractured due to several other reasons.</p><p>Breaking the core norms of international climate finance funds flow</p><p>Apart from the above, the CBAM, by its design, has provisions to mobilise financial resources for the EU and its member countries. The architecture of such a regulatory measure has made explicit provision for generating revenue through CBAM for the EU and its member countries. Revenue potential estimates indicate that CBAM could mobilise more than $80 billion per year till 2040.</p><p>The quantum of the revenue would be dependent on the purchase of CBAM certificates by the EU importers based on the magnitude of embedded emissions of carbon-intensive goods. The price of these certificates would be indexed to the weekly average auction price of EU-ETS allowances to ensure that the importers pay a carbon tariff equivalent to the tariff paid by the EU domestic producers. Starting from the definitive phase of 2026, the revenue collection would be part of the EU's general budget scheme and would be considered as its 'own resource', of which 3/4th will be part of the EU budget, and the remaining will be allocated to EU member states. The funds collected through selling CBAM certificates are intended to further the EU climate goals reinforced through various policy initiatives such as 'fit for 55'.</p><p>Though the specific allocation plan for the revenue to be mobilised through CBAM is yet to get a definitive direction, however, it is caught in controversy due to various reasons. Some stakeholders favour directing these resources to meet the domestic industrial decarbonisation efforts, while others demand diverting a portion of the funds to support developing countries' climate efforts. Nothing concrete so far has emerged as a formal agreement in deciding the allocation of such resources to developing countries' climate actions, though pressure to allocate such funds to developing countries is escalating over time from a climate equity point of view. CBAM in its current form not only curtails the trade competitiveness of developing countries' exports but also poses an additional financial burden for the developing countries through the imposition of such a tax on their exported products. Unless a proper redistribution mechanism is explicitly integrated with the revenue framework of CBAM, it would lead to so-called \"double whammy\" effects for developing countries like India.</p><p>India's CBAM exposure and the need for a managed transition</p><p>CBAM will reshape India and EU trade dynamics. The exposure is concentrated, with iron and steel forming 76.83 per cent of India's CBAM-affected exports. Compliance costs and margin pressure will hit these sectors first. Without a managed glide path that provides time, tools, and finance, firms risk losing price competitiveness and market share even as they invest to cut emissions.</p><p>Fairness and effectiveness must align. Developing countries need a phased adaptation window. The European Union should recycle CBAM revenues to fund capacity building and technology transfer. An equity-based adjustment should reflect historical responsibility, trade benefits, and development needs.</p><p>Gopal K.

On the stage, a lively guest preacher, Ronzel Pretlow, roused the congregation in the Hayward, California, church, his raspy voice rising and falling as he sang and shouted, prompting his audience to stand. When the excitement waned, he shifted their attention to Glad Tidings' founder, Bishop Jerry Macklin, seated in the pulpit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think we owe our Bishop another round of applause for leading us into innovation and creativity,\" the preacher said, eliciting a jingle from the organist. \"I'm going back home to see if I've got room for some electric vehicle chargers,\" he joked, knowing the profit that the chargers the church would soon have up and running could bring.</p><p>In September, Glad Tidings will complete its new Community Decarbonization Hub-a multipurpose campus featuring a 13,000-square-foot solar-powered building with battery storage and ten EV charging stations. The project, which started four years ago and has a $4.3 million price tag, won't only cut the church's energy usage and costs-it's expected to generate around $500,000 annually. And in five to seven years, as more people charge their vehicles at the church, that amount is projected to double.\u00a0</p><p>Glad Tidings isn't the only Black church in the Bay Area undergoing this kind of transformation. It's one of four, thanks to a partnership with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenthechurch.org/\">Green the Church</url>, an Oakland-based environmental justice nonprofit founded by Reverend Ambrose Carroll, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.geminiesolutions.com/\">Gemini Energy Solutions</url>, a cleantech company founded by Stanford University graduate Anthony Kinslow. The hubs Carroll and Kinslow are helping to build won't only bring clean energy infrastructure to these churches, but also turn them into year-round resilience hubs, ready to support residents when a disaster hits-be it a power outage, wildfire or heatwave.</p><p>As climate change progresses and brings more frequent extreme weather events, resilience hubs are becoming increasingly necessary-especially in Black and low-income communities, where legacies of redlining and other forms of racial discrimination have left residents particularly vulnerable. These communities are often the last to receive access to affordable, energy-efficient technology. Still, they persevere through brutal temperatures, hurricanes and other weather disasters, frequently earning praise from political leaders and news media for their resilience.</p><p>\"Resiliency isn't enough,\" Kinslow said. \"Resiliency implies maintaining where you're at, but I would think most of us would agree that the current baseline isn't where we want it to be. Communities need to be generating their own money to implement their own decarbonization projects.\"</p><p>Black churches don't just need money for decarbonization, but for their basic survival. Across the country, their congregations are shrinking due to aging populations and a larger generational shift away from religion, according to a Gallup <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx\">study</url>. Unable to rely on tithes and offerings, church leaders are under pressure to find new ways to maintain their buildings-their largest economic assets-and cut costs. Clean energy offers them a way to keep thriving.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923IbDakNaE&amp;t=21s\">Bishop Macklin</url> began building his ministry in the late 1970s, when South Hayward was troubled by \"drugs, crime, and rampant poverty,\" according to the church's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gladtidingscogic.org/about-us\">website</url>. Called a \"visionary\" by many in his circle, about 30 years ago, Bishop Macklin established the Glad Tidings Community Development Corporation (CDC), a separate entity from the church, to help area residents access essential resources, such as food, healthcare and affordable housing. Between the church and the CDC, they've acquired enough buildings to cover half a city block.</p><p>At the church's north campus, directly across from the main sanctuary, the new resilience hub features a 5,000-square-foot gymnasium, an exercise room, a STEM lab, a youth lounge, a kitchen and classrooms. Powered by solar energy, the building can accommodate over 500 people in an emergency, providing them with electricity, as well as air conditioning and filtered air. The church will add six EV charging stations to a sliver of parking lot between the resilience hub and the main sanctuary, which will also be equipped with solar panels this fall.</p><p>According to Benita McLarin, who leads the Glad TidingsCDC, her team has spent the past six months training a 15-person Community Response Team on fire safety, CPR and mental health first aid. \"Bishop Macklin is well respected and people look to him always for answers,\" said McLarin, a former military commander and public health official. \"He shouldn't be the only person in our organization who is ready to provide them.\"</p><p>At the south campus, where the church operates its Spanish-language ministry, four of the fastest EV chargers on the market are already installed under eight solar-paneled carports. McLarin, who drives an EV herself, expects this location to be their greatest revenue generator, as it's located closest to Highway 880, a major thoroughfare that runs from Oakland to San Jose. Currently, there are few charging options in this part of Hayward, a common issue in many <url normalizedValue=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4hj979ws\">lower-income and Black and brown neighborhoods</url>. These are the same neighborhoods where gig drivers, who often struggle with low wages, <url normalizedValue=\"https://forthmobility.org/storage/app/media/Reports/2024-Best-Practice-Papers/Best-Practices-For-Gig-Drivers-Transition-to-EVs.pdf\">tend to live</url>. Access to EVs and charging stations could help them save money in the long term and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process.</p><p>According to Kinslow, Glad Tidings will reinvest 80 percent of its profits back into the church and the larger South Hayward community. \"We're actually building more solar than the demand of the buildings, so we make a profit from that [by selling the excess electricity they generate through the public EV charging stations], and then we use that profit for programming,\" Kinslow said.</p><p>For example, they may use the funding to provide free solar panels and batteries to income-qualifying households or help to finance electric vehicles for people in the neighborhood. \"We see this clean energy hub as the starting point to decarbonizing the rest of the community,\" he said. Kinslow's company is also creating a \"Neighborhood Decarbonization Index\" that utilizes survey data and machine learning to assess greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate neighborhood decarbonization progress over time.</p><p>Kinslow completed his Ph.D. at Stanford and spent most of his student years thinking about how to bring renewable energy to communities of color. Inspired by Al Gore's documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" in high school, he wanted to make a difference. He launched Gemini Energy Solutions while he was still in graduate school, with the goal of democratizing clean energy. In 2020, he met Bishop Macklin at an event organized by Carroll's nonprofit, Green the Church (GTC), and was later introduced to McLarin. A year later, they began crafting a plan to bring the community decarbonization hub to fruition.\u00a0</p><p>Gemini Energy Solutions handles project management and community engagement, while Green the Church\u00a0 rallies clergy and collaborates with their internal \"green team.\" Rev. Carroll founded GTC fifteen years ago and has built relationships with faith leaders across the country. The organization currently has contracts with more than 15 churches, representing various denominations, to develop Community Decarbonization Hubs. In addition to Glad Tidings, GTC and Gemini are working to build these hubs at three other Bay Area churches: Twenty-Third Avenue Church in Oakland, The Way Christian Center in Berkeley and University AME Zion in Palo Alto. Glad Tidings is the furthest along, and the lessons learned there are shaping the work Kinslow and Carroll are doing at the other churches.</p><p>According to Kinslow, <url normalizedValue=\"https://richmondside.org/2025/03/21/pge-blamed-for-solar-delays-richmond-nonprofit/\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company's (PG&amp;E) delays</url> in connecting the solar panels, battery, master meter and EV chargers to the power grid set the project back by about six months. Now, their construction partner, Imperial Electric Service in Fresno, has a designated interconnection representative at PG&amp;E to accelerate future projects.</p><p>Gemini's project team also realized they needed a contractor to explain the impacts of construction, like loss of parking, \"which is a big thing for churches,\" Kinslow said.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest challenge was the two years it took to find financing.</p><p>\"We started this project based on faith,\" said Carroll, noting this was before the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions in clean energy. But banks struggled to grasp the concept of a Black community generating income rather than an outside company profiting from it, Carroll said. Eventually, he and Kinslow formed a joint entity, Green the Church Renewable Energy Development (GTC R.E.D.), which secured a $3 million revolving loan from the Kresge Foundation to bring clean energy to churches across the country.</p><p>More support came from Green Power Ventures, a Black-led investment management firm focused on climate resilience in low- to moderate-income areas, and Freedmen Green Bank &amp; Trust, a Black-led nonprofit and charitable trust devoted to climate resilience and clean energy. And while the churches aren't putting money into the community decarbonization hubs, Kinslow said, they are investing a lot of \"sweat equity.\"</p><p>The Bay Area's Black churches have long been a force for social change. In East Palo Alto, congregants organized community watch programs during times of racial unrest. St. Augustine's Episcopal Church in Oakland is the birthplace of the Black Panthers' first free breakfast program, which served undernourished children before school. At the 107-year-old <url normalizedValue=\"https://uamez.com/\">University AME Zion</url> (UAMEZ) church in Palo Alto, they see their forthcoming community decarbonization hub as a continuation of this legacy-and their own commitment to justice.\u00a0</p><p>\"When we started talking [about the hub] as a community, it wasn't like, 'Why should we do this?'\" said UAMEZ Pastor Kaloma Smith. \"It was like, 'This makes sense for the betterment of our world.'\"\u00a0</p><p>Born in Jamaica and raised in New York, Smith arrived at UAMEZ in 2013 to find common challenges facing Black churches, including declining membership. That drop-off is partly from residents leaving Palo Alto-and the state of California-due to rising costs of living, Smith said. The community decarbonization hub is part of his long-term effort to \"revitalize\" the church and \"be more effective, particularly for Gen Z and young families,\" for whom he says environmental issues are a top concern.</p><p>Working with Kinslow on the hub marks a full-circle moment: he joined the UAMEZ congregation while still a student at Stanford, and approached Pastor Smith with a proposal to replace the sanctuary's fluorescent lights. \"We didn't really have the money at the time,\" said Smith. \"But we saw there was phenomenal intersectionality between creating a benefit for the church, the environment and the community.\"</p><p>Besides installing solar panels and making energy-efficient upgrades, UAMEZ will add 12 to 16 EV charging stations, including eight fast chargers, to its parking lot. Construction of the UAMEZ hub is expected to take only six months, including its connection to the power grid. In the event of an earthquake, Smith envisions UAMEZ as the go-to place for \"all the things\" residents of midtown Palo Alto might require.</p><p>\"Black churches have always been resilience hubs,\" said Carroll, who added that they have often provided tangible support during times of crisis. But they have the potential to do more, he said, by turning their parking lots into \"revenue-generating microgrids\" that meet their neighborhoods' rapidly changing energy and climate needs.</p><p>Back in the pulpit at Glad Tidings, pink and purple lights illuminate the stage, casting a glow on Pretlow, the guest preacher, and an attentive congregation. \"Prosperity is coming to your house,\" he proclaimed, as the bassist plucked his strings. \"Favor is getting ready to find your address!\" His words seemed fitting for the era Glad Tidings is entering-as if that blessing had already come to pass.</p><p>This story was supported by the Climate Equity Reporting Project at Berkeley Journalism.

Kathy Hochul, D-New York, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Hochul Announces Nearly $28 Million Awarded to Advance Energy Efficiency and Electrification Projects as Part of Empire Building Challenge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">*</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Kathy Hochul announced today that nearly $28 million has been awarded to advance 10 energy efficiency and electrification projects as part of the State's Empire Building Challenge. The awarded partners collectively represent more than 123 million square feet of real estate and more than 123,000 multifamily residential units, including more than 13,000 affordable housing units across the state. These multifamily projects will help to unlock more than $150 million in private investment while attracting solution providers from around the world to bring innovation and business investment to New York State. Today's announcement features a diverse range of enhanced low-carbon building solutions that can help reduce fossil fuel use in a building up to 100 percent, improve comfort and living conditions for residents, and achieve operating cost savings for building owners.</p><p>\"New York State is once again leading by example and tackling one of the largest energy consumers -- large buildings,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Thanks to the support and partnership of the real estate industry, the Empire Building Challenge has spurred innovative demonstration projects that are driving building modernization across the state, and these multifamily projects are just another step forward toward a cleaner, healthier future for all New Yorkers.\"</p><p>Through the Empire Building Challenge (EBC), administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), each project was awarded up to $3 million to demonstrate and address opportunities for energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in multifamily buildings. The projects include 22 showcase buildings of which 17 are located in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the New York State Climate Justice Working Group, to ensure these communities benefit from improved energy efficiency, enhanced indoor air quality, and lower operating costs. These projects will not only accelerate New York's clean energy transition but also provide a blueprint for the broader market by demonstrating how multifamily buildings of all sizes can be retrofitted to improve the well-being and safety of residents.</p><p>New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, \"The Empire Building Challenge has been a tremendous public-private partnership, unlocking private investment to help modernize and improve New York State's large buildings. The projects announced today expand our impact by providing a model for multifamily buildings around the state to transition to clean, healthy living spaces through the adoption of low-carbon building solutions.\"</p><p>The awarded projects include:</p><p>* Ascendant Neighborhood Development: Will demonstrate the innovative use of thermal storage and geothermal in a dense urban setting alongside enhanced building envelope performance.</p><p>-Team: MaGrann Associates and Paul A.

In total, these real estate partners control more than 200,000 units of housing throughout the state, representing a clear signal from the New York real estate industry for high quality, low-carbon solutions for multifamily buildings, with significant potential for replication of successful solutions across large portfolios.</p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker said, \"As Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to establish the policy framework and funding pathways that make initiatives like the Empire Building Challenge possible. Today's announcement is a clear example of how NYSERDA continues to deliver on our clean energy vision by driving innovation that benefits everyday New Yorkers. These projects will help reduce fossil fuel use, improve the quality of our housing, and most importantly, lower energy costs for families who are too often burdened by high utility bills. By ensuring disadvantaged communities are prioritized, we are creating a pathway where the clean energy transition not only protects our environment but also puts money back into the pockets of those who need it most.\"</p><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh said, \"These funds are an important part of our ongoing commitment to make the critical transition to a clean, efficient, reliable, affordable energy system, while promoting innovation and ensuring that property owners are not unduly burdened with the cost of the transition. I thank Governor Kathy Hochul, Doreen Harris and her colleagues at NYSERDA, and all the property owners, contractors, architects, and engineers for stepping up to the challenge!\"</p><p>Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal said, \"Housing and energy efficiency go hand-in-hand. Creating a more affordable New York includes investing in green initiatives that put money back in the hands of New Yorkers, while fostering a more sustainable state. The Empire Building Challenge does exactly that. As the federal government works overtime to reverse decades of environmental progress, New York will continue to lead the way in fighting for a greener, more resilient future for the next generation.\"</p><p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"As our City and State continue to adapt to climate change, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and climate equity must be a top priority. With multiple buildings in Manhattan selected, including buildings with affordable housing, we are taking steps forward toward a more energy-efficient future. Thank you to Governor Hochul, the NYS Energy Research and Development Authority, and the NYS Climate Justice Working Group for making this possible.\"</p><p>New York City Council Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala said, \"This investment is a major win for our community and for the future of sustainable, affordable housing in New York City. I'm proud to see East Harlem at the forefront of climate innovation, where projects like Ascendant Neighborhood Development's are proving that we can deliver cutting-edge, low-carbon solutions without compromising affordability. These upgrades will not only reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency but also enhance comfort and quality of life for our residents. I thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their continued commitment to environmental justice and inclusive development.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Gale Brewer said \"I am proud that 111 West 67th Street, here on the Upper West Side, has been selected as part of the Empire Building Challenge. This investment in energy efficiency and electrification demonstrates how New York can lead by example--showing that even large, mixed-use buildings can make the transition to cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable living. I commend Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their leadership in building a greener future for our city and state.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"I want to thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their commitment to advancing clean energy, and I especially want to recognize the inclusion of Harlem in this important initiative. Here in Harlem, Ascendant Neighborhood Development's projects on East 132nd, 131st, and 116th Streets will ensure that our residents--many of whom live in affordable housing--benefit directly from healthier, more energy-efficient, and more sustainable homes. These investments are not just about reducing emissions; they are about equity, lowering costs for families, and improving quality of life in our community.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Shaun Abreu said, \"Governor Hochul's Empire Building Challenge investment on 125th Street will help us work towards our climate goals while keeping energy costs low for families. To transition to an affordable and clean energy economy that protects our health and our wallets, the public and private sector will need to work together. This effort serves as an example of what smart, forward-looking governance can achieve.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Chi Osse said, \"I'm proud to see New York leading the way in making our homes more sustainable for generations to come. As we face immense setbacks in charting a clean energy future because of the Trump administration's rollbacks, these projects show what real progress looks like. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we protect both our environment and the New Yorkers who call these buildings home. Our state must keep acting to prove we can build a future defined by clean air, affordable housing, and lasting sustainability.\"</p><p>Additionally, the Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings (Playbook) - a free online resource to support building owners advancing energy retrofits in large commercial and multifamily buildings, was also updated to include a new toolkit feature with a spotlight on heat recovery and design charrettes as two important practice areas for strategic decarbonization planning, as well as new multifamily case studies for the 10 newly selected demonstration projects.</p><p>Launched in 2024, the Playbook was created through a partnership between NYSERDA, Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (ESRT) and other Empire Building Challenge real estate partners, with RMI, Building Energy Exchange, and Urban Land Institute. It features case studies and an expansive resource library of best practices and technical information to support building owners and the engineering community in planning and implementing low carbon retrofit projects.</p><p>Rocky Mountain Institute Principal Phil Keuhn said, \"RMI is proud to partner with NYSERDA and industry leaders through the Empire Building Challenge to accelerate large-scale building decarbonization. These projects and the enhanced Retrofit Playbook provide decision makers with proven, replicable solutions that can cut carbon pollution and unlock private investment. Together, we are demonstrating a clear path to transform the building sector, while meeting climate goals and delivering greater comfort and affordability.\"</p><p>Building Energy Exchange CEO and Fellow of the American Institute of Architects Richard Yancey said, \"Building Energy Exchange is honored to have been collaborating with the Empire Building Challenge (EBC) for over three years, providing educational programs and resources, sharing the amazing stories from the EBC partners and their ground-breaking projects. We're thrilled to share more viable demonstrations of successful low carbon retrofit projects on the Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings platform, supporting the entire building industry in advancing this ground-breaking approach to building decarbonization.\"</p><p>ULI Randall Lewis Center for Sustainability in Real Estate Senior Director of Decarbonization Kara Kokerna said, \"This third round of funding toward energy efficiency and electrification projects underscores the Empire Building Challenge's commitment to decarbonizing the built environment. ULI supports this important initiative and the updated Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings, which provides our members with case studies and a robust library of best practices to inform their everyday decision-making.\"</p><p>Buildings are one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in New York State. Through NYSERDA and utility programs, more than $5.6 billion has been invested to decarbonize buildings and support high-efficiency all-electric heating and cooling technologies. Building owners, solution providers, manufacturers, and other interested stakeholders are encouraged to visit NYSERDA's website for additional details on the Empire Building Challenge and to learn how to partner with NYSERDA.</p><p>This program is funded through NYSERDA's 10-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund.</p><p>New York State's Climate Agenda</p><p>New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-nearly-28-million-awarded-advance-energy-efficiency-and\">https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-nearly-28-million-awarded-advance-energy-efficiency-and</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>-9375809 T83-SS-FR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9375809</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNP-RFV3-RRNR-H2S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2759\"/><timeReceived>8:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 5, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The awarded partners collectively represent more than 123 million square feet of real estate and more than 123,000 multifamily residential units, including more than 13,000 affordable housing units across the state. These multifamily projects will help to unlock more than $150 million in private investment while attracting solution providers from around the world to bring innovation and business investment to New York State. Today's announcement features a diverse range of enhanced low-carbon building solutions that can help reduce fossil fuel use in a building up to 100 percent, improve comfort and living conditions for residents, and achieve operating cost savings for building owners.</p><p>\"New York State is once again leading by example and tackling one of the largest energy consumers large buildings,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Thanks to the support and partnership of the real estate industry, the Empire Building Challenge has spurred innovative demonstration projects that are driving building modernization across the state, and these multifamily projects are just another step forward toward a cleaner, healthier future for all New Yorkers.\"</p><p>Through the Empire Building Challenge (EBC), administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), each project was awarded up to $3 million to demonstrate and address opportunities for energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in multifamily buildings. The projects include 22 showcase buildings of which 17 are located in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the New York State Climate Justice Working Group, to ensure these communities benefit from improved energy efficiency, enhanced indoor air quality, and lower operating costs. These projects will not only accelerate New York's clean energy transition but also provide a blueprint for the broader market by demonstrating how multifamily buildings of all sizes can be retrofitted to improve the well-being and safety of residents.</p><p>New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, \"The Empire Building Challenge has been a tremendous public-private partnership, unlocking private investment to help modernize and improve New York State's large buildings.

In total, these real estate partners control more than 200,000 units of housing throughout the state, representing a clear signal from the New York real estate industry for high quality, low-carbon solutions for multifamily buildings, with significant potential for replication of successful solutions across large portfolios.</p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker said, \"As Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to establish the policy framework and funding pathways that make initiatives like the Empire Building Challenge possible. Today's announcement is a clear example of how NYSERDA continues to deliver on our clean energy vision by driving innovation that benefits everyday New Yorkers. These projects will help reduce fossil fuel use, improve the quality of our housing, and most importantly, lower energy costs for families who are too often burdened by high utility bills. By ensuring disadvantaged communities are prioritized, we are creating a pathway where the clean energy transition not only protects our environment but also puts money back into the pockets of those who need it most.\"</p><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh said, \"These funds are an important part of our ongoing commitment to make the critical transition to a clean, efficient, reliable, affordable energy system, while promoting innovation and ensuring that property owners are not unduly burdened with the cost of the transition. I thank Governor Kathy Hochul, Doreen Harris and her colleagues at NYSERDA, and all the property owners, contractors, architects, and engineers for stepping up to the challenge!\"</p><p>Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal said, \"Housing and energy efficiency go hand-in-hand. Creating a more affordable New York includes investing in green initiatives that put money back in the hands of New Yorkers, while fostering a more sustainable state. The Empire Building Challenge does exactly that. As the federal government works overtime to reverse decades of environmental progress, New York will continue to lead the way in fighting for a greener, more resilient future for the next generation.\"</p><p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"As our City and State continue to adapt to climate change, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and climate equity must be a top priority. With multiple buildings in Manhattan selected, including buildings with affordable housing, we are taking steps forward toward a more energy-efficient future. Thank you to Governor Hochul, the NYS Energy Research and Development Authority, and the NYS Climate Justice Working Group for making this possible.\"</p><p>New York City Council Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala said, \"This investment is a major win for our community and for the future of sustainable, affordable housing in New York City. I'm proud to see East Harlem at the forefront of climate innovation, where projects like Ascendant Neighborhood Development's are proving that we can deliver cutting-edge, low-carbon solutions without compromising affordability. These upgrades will not only reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency but also enhance comfort and quality of life for our residents. I thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their continued commitment to environmental justice and inclusive development.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Gale Brewer said \"I am proud that 111 West 67th Street, here on the Upper West Side, has been selected as part of the Empire Building Challenge. This investment in energy efficiency and electrification demonstrates how New York can lead by exampleshowing that even large, mixed-use buildings can make the transition to cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable living. I commend Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their leadership in building a greener future for our city and state.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"I want to thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their commitment to advancing clean energy, and I especially want to recognize the inclusion of Harlem in this important initiative. Here in Harlem, Ascendant Neighborhood Development's projects on East 132nd, 131st, and 116th Streets will ensure that our residentsmany of whom live in affordable housingbenefit directly from healthier, more energy-efficient, and more sustainable homes. These investments are not just about reducing emissions; they are about equity, lowering costs for families, and improving quality of life in our community.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Shaun Abreu said, \"Governor Hochul's Empire Building Challenge investment on 125th Street will help us work towards our climate goals while keeping energy costs low for families. To transition to an affordable and clean energy economy that protects our health and our wallets, the public and private sector will need to work together. This effort serves as an example of what smart, forward-looking governance can achieve.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Chi Osse said, \"I'm proud to see New York leading the way in making our homes more sustainable for generations to come. As we face immense setbacks in charting a clean energy future because of the Trump administration's rollbacks, these projects show what real progress looks like. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we protect both our environment and the New Yorkers who call these buildings home. Our state must keep acting to prove we can build a future defined by clean air, affordable housing, and lasting sustainability.\"</p><p>Additionally, the Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings (Playbook) a free online resource to support building owners advancing energy retrofits in large commercial and multifamily buildings, was also updated to include a new toolkit feature with a spotlight on heat recovery and design charrettes as two important practice areas for strategic decarbonization planning, as well as new multifamily case studies for the 10 newly selected demonstration projects.</p><p>Launched in 2024, the Playbook was created through a partnership between NYSERDA, Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (ESRT) and other Empire Building Challenge real estate partners, with RMI, Building Energy Exchange, and Urban Land Institute. It features case studies and an expansive resource library of best practices and technical information to support building owners and the engineering community in planning and implementing low carbon retrofit projects.</p><p>Rocky Mountain Institute Principal Phil Keuhn said, \"RMI is proud to partner with NYSERDA and industry leaders through the Empire Building Challenge to accelerate large-scale building decarbonization. These projects and the enhanced Retrofit Playbook provide decision makers with proven, replicable solutions that can cut carbon pollution and unlock private investment. Together, we are demonstrating a clear path to transform the building sector, while meeting climate goals and delivering greater comfort and affordability.\"</p><p>Building Energy Exchange CEO and Fellow of the American Institute of Architects Richard Yancey said, \"Building Energy Exchange is honored to have been collaborating with the Empire Building Challenge (EBC) for over three years, providing educational programs and resources, sharing the amazing stories from the EBC partners and their ground-breaking projects. We're thrilled to share more viable demonstrations of successful low carbon retrofit projects on the Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings platform, supporting the entire building industry in advancing this ground-breaking approach to building decarbonization.\"</p><p>ULI Randall Lewis Center for Sustainability in Real Estate Senior Director of Decarbonization Kara Kokerna said, \"This third round of funding toward energy efficiency and electrification projects underscores the Empire Building Challenge's commitment to decarbonizing the built environment. ULI supports this important initiative and the updated Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings, which provides our members with case studies and a robust library of best practices to inform their everyday decision-making.\"</p><p>Buildings are one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in New York State. Through NYSERDA and utility programs, more than $5.6 billion has been invested to decarbonize buildings and support high-efficiency all-electric heating and cooling technologies. Building owners, solution providers, manufacturers, and other interested stakeholders are encouraged to visit NYSERDA's website for additional details on the Empire Building Challenge and to learn how to partner with NYSERDA.</p><p>This program is funded through NYSERDA's 10-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund.</p><p>New York State's Climate Agenda</p><p>New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127329831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNT-HB53-RSNK-T41M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 5, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The awarded partners collectively represent more than 123 million square feet of real estate and more than 123,000 multifamily residential units, including more than 13,000 affordable housing units across the state. These multifamily projects will help to unlock more than $150 million in private investment while attracting solution providers from around the world to bring innovation and business investment to New York State. Today's announcement features a diverse range of enhanced low-carbon building solutions that can help reduce fossil fuel use in a building up to 100 percent, improve comfort and living conditions for residents, and achieve operating cost savings for building owners.</p><p>\"New York State is once again leading by example and tackling one of the largest energy consumers - large buildings,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Thanks to the support and partnership of the real estate industry, the Empire Building Challenge has spurred innovative demonstration projects that are driving building modernization across the state, and these multifamily projects are just another step forward toward a cleaner, healthier future for all New Yorkers.\"</p><p>Through the Empire Building Challenge (EBC), administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), each project was awarded up to $3 million to demonstrate and address opportunities for energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in multifamily buildings. The projects include 22 showcase buildings of which 17 are located in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the New York State Climate Justice Working Group, to ensure these communities benefit from improved energy efficiency, enhanced indoor air quality, and lower operating costs. These projects will not only accelerate New York's clean energy transition but also provide a blueprint for the broader market by demonstrating how multifamily buildings of all sizes can be retrofitted to improve the well-being and safety of residents.</p><p>New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, \"The Empire Building Challenge has been a tremendous public-private partnership, unlocking private investment to help modernize and improve New York State's large buildings. The projects announced today expand our impact by providing a model for multifamily buildings around the state to transition to clean, healthy living spaces through the adoption of low-carbon building solutions.\"</p><p>The awarded projects include:</p><p>* Ascendant Neighborhood Development: Will demonstrate the innovative use of thermal storage and geothermal in a dense urban setting alongside enhanced building envelope performance.</p><p>-Team: MaGrann Associates and Paul A.

In total, these real estate partners control more than 200,000 units of housing throughout the state, representing a clear signal from the New York real estate industry for high quality, low-carbon solutions for multifamily buildings, with significant potential for replication of successful solutions across large portfolios.</p><p>State Senator Kevin Parker said, \"As Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to establish the policy framework and funding pathways that make initiatives like the Empire Building Challenge possible. Today's announcement is a clear example of how NYSERDA continues to deliver on our clean energy vision by driving innovation that benefits everyday New Yorkers. These projects will help reduce fossil fuel use, improve the quality of our housing, and most importantly, lower energy costs for families who are too often burdened by high utility bills. By ensuring disadvantaged communities are prioritized, we are creating a pathway where the clean energy transition not only protects our environment but also puts money back into the pockets of those who need it most.\"</p><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh said, \"These funds are an important part of our ongoing commitment to make the critical transition to a clean, efficient, reliable, affordable energy system, while promoting innovation and ensuring that property owners are not unduly burdened with the cost of the transition. I thank Governor Kathy Hochul, Doreen Harris and her colleagues at NYSERDA, and all the property owners, contractors, architects, and engineers for stepping up to the challenge!\"</p><p>Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal said, \"Housing and energy efficiency go hand-in-hand. Creating a more affordable New York includes investing in green initiatives that put money back in the hands of New Yorkers, while fostering a more sustainable state. The Empire Building Challenge does exactly that. As the federal government works overtime to reverse decades of environmental progress, New York will continue to lead the way in fighting for a greener, more resilient future for the next generation.\"</p><p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"As our City and State continue to adapt to climate change, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and climate equity must be a top priority. With multiple buildings in Manhattan selected, including buildings with affordable housing, we are taking steps forward toward a more energy-efficient future. Thank you to Governor Hochul, the NYS Energy Research and Development Authority, and the NYS Climate Justice Working Group for making this possible.\"</p><p>New York City Council Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala said, \"This investment is a major win for our community and for the future of sustainable, affordable housing in New York City. I'm proud to see East Harlem at the forefront of climate innovation, where projects like Ascendant Neighborhood Development's are proving that we can deliver cutting-edge, low-carbon solutions without compromising affordability. These upgrades will not only reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency but also enhance comfort and quality of life for our residents. I thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their continued commitment to environmental justice and inclusive development.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Gale Brewer said \"I am proud that 111 West 67th Street, here on the Upper West Side, has been selected as part of the Empire Building Challenge. This investment in energy efficiency and electrification demonstrates how New York can lead by example-showing that even large, mixed-use buildings can make the transition to cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable living. I commend Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their leadership in building a greener future for our city and state.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"I want to thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their commitment to advancing clean energy, and I especially want to recognize the inclusion of Harlem in this important initiative. Here in Harlem, Ascendant Neighborhood Development's projects on East 132nd, 131st, and 116th Streets will ensure that our residents-many of whom live in affordable housing-benefit directly from healthier, more energy-efficient, and more sustainable homes. These investments are not just about reducing emissions; they are about equity, lowering costs for families, and improving quality of life in our community.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Shaun Abreu said, \"Governor Hochul's Empire Building Challenge investment on 125th Street will help us work towards our climate goals while keeping energy costs low for families. To transition to an affordable and clean energy economy that protects our health and our wallets, the public and private sector will need to work together. This effort serves as an example of what smart, forward-looking governance can achieve.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Chi Oss said, \"I'm proud to see New York leading the way in making our homes more sustainable for generations to come. As we face immense setbacks in charting a clean energy future because of the Trump administration's rollbacks, these projects show what real progress looks like. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we protect both our environment and the New Yorkers who call these buildings home. Our state must keep acting to prove we can build a future defined by clean air, affordable housing, and lasting sustainability.\"</p><p>Additionally, the Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings (Playbook) - a free online resource to support building owners advancing energy retrofits in large commercial and multifamily buildings, was also updated to include a new toolkit feature with a spotlight on heat recovery and design charrettes as two important practice areas for strategic decarbonization planning, as well as new multifamily case studies for the 10 newly selected demonstration projects.</p><p>Launched in 2024, the Playbook was created through a partnership between NYSERDA, Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (ESRT) and other Empire Building Challenge real estate partners, with RMI, Building Energy Exchange, and Urban Land Institute. It features case studies and an expansive resource library of best practices and technical information to support building owners and the engineering community in planning and implementing low carbon retrofit projects.</p><p>Rocky Mountain Institute Principal Phil Keuhn said, \"RMI is proud to partner with NYSERDA and industry leaders through the Empire Building Challenge to accelerate large-scale building decarbonization. These projects and the enhanced Retrofit Playbook provide decision makers with proven, replicable solutions that can cut carbon pollution and unlock private investment. Together, we are demonstrating a clear path to transform the building sector, while meeting climate goals and delivering greater comfort and affordability.\"</p><p>Building Energy Exchange CEO and Fellow of the American Institute of Architects Richard Yancey said, \"Building Energy Exchange is honored to have been collaborating with the Empire Building Challenge (EBC) for over three years, providing educational programs and resources, sharing the amazing stories from the EBC partners and their ground-breaking projects. We're thrilled to share more viable demonstrations of successful low carbon retrofit projects on the Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings platform, supporting the entire building industry in advancing this ground-breaking approach to building decarbonization.\"</p><p>ULI Randall Lewis Center for Sustainability in Real Estate Senior Director of Decarbonization Kara Kokerna said, \"This third round of funding toward energy efficiency and electrification projects underscores the Empire Building Challenge's commitment to decarbonizing the built environment. ULI supports this important initiative and the updated Retrofit Playbook for Large Buildings, which provides our members with case studies and a robust library of best practices to inform their everyday decision-making.\"</p><p>Buildings are one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in New York State. Through NYSERDA and utility programs, more than $5.6 billion has been invested to decarbonize buildings and support high-efficiency all-electric heating and cooling technologies. Building owners, solution providers, manufacturers, and other interested stakeholders are encouraged to visit NYSERDA's website for additional details on the Empire Building Challenge and to learn how to partner with NYSERDA.</p><p>This program is funded through NYSERDA's 10-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund.</p><p>New York State's Climate Agenda</p><p>New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.</p><p>[Category: Renewable Energy, Real Estate, Procurement and Sales]</p><p>Source: Governor Kathy Hochul</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDENW-0067015607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDENW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNT-1C13-RTSR-G2R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373672</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2891\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Energy News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"3934\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 5, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00054FU</classCode><className>NEW YORK STATE ENERGY RESEARCH &amp;

The legislation updates Supervisor Mandelman's All-Electric New Construction Ordinance and continues his commitment to a safer, healthier, and more sustainable City by ensuring major renovation building projects go all-electric and reduce emissions. The measure will be heard tomorrow (7/29) as a Committee Report at the Board of Supervisors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We can't build the San Francisco of the future with fuel from the past,\" said Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman. \"This legislation picks up where we left off with the All-Electric New Construction ordinance and affords us the opportunity to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in our existing buildings, improve indoor and outdoor air quality, and make San Francisco a safer, healthier, and more resilient place to live and work. Choosing clean energy is how we build the clean, all-electric City of the future,\"</p><p>Building operations are responsible for nearly half of San Francisco's emissions. Most of these emissions stem from the combustion of methane, more commonly referred to as natural gas, in existing buildings. Natural gas is a fossil fuel just like oil. It is a super pollutant that is 83 times more effective at trapping heat in our atmosphere than C02. The combustion of this super pollutant for heating, cooling, and other building functionsposes significant threats to humans and the planet. In addition to impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health, natural gas-powered fixtures further exacerbate the climate crisis, increase the risk of fire during earthquakes, and take significantly longer to get back up and running after seismic events.</p><p>\"This ordinance protects the health and safety of San Franciscans by phasing out outdated gas systems in major renovations,\" said Tyrone Jue, Director of the San Francisco Environment Department. \"It reduces indoor air pollution, strengthens building safety, and ensures our infrastructure is ready for a cleaner, more resilient future. And as we make our homes safer, we're also cutting the pollution that fuels the climate crisis because in San Francisco protecting people and protecting the planet go hand in hand.\"</p><p>Mechanical systems in existing buildings are customarily upgraded or replaced for many reasons, including deterioration, building expansion, energy efficiency improvements, or building conversions. Replacing gas-powered mechanical systems with all-electric when those systems are outdated or failing, and as part of a major renovation, is the most efficient and inexpensive way to transition existing buildings to electric. By requiring buildings undergoing major renovations, a very high bar in the building code, to be rebuilt all-electric, the new ordinance helps San Francisco electrify in the most cost-effective way.</p><p>\"This ordinance makes good on the city's commitment to the climate and public health by tackling a major source of pollution and emissions,\" said Sam Fishman, SPUR's sustainability and resilience policy manager. \"The ordinance will ensure that buildings are electrified in a smart and planned fashion, and is a major step in increasing the pace of decarbonization in San Francisco in a cost-effective way.\"</p><p>San Francisco is already going all-electric. The City's successful Climate Equity Hub has completed 26 projects/installs and has 45 in progress , targeting lower-income families with cost-free electric appliance installations. Affordable housing projects like Casa Adelante, Maceo May, 400 China Basin, and Transbay 2 West senior housing have been built all-electric, providing community with healthier, safer, all-electric buildings. And the renovation of a small residential project in the Mission District by the Mission Economic Development Association (MEDA) has replaced gas appliances with all-electric ones in both the existing building and in the new additions. In fact, throughout the State, the vast majority of new construction projects are all-electric.</p><p>\"The Sierra Club supports Board President Mandelman's All-Electric Major Renovations Ordinance. Nearly half of the City's greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings and so this ordinance contains a significant opportunity to address a major source of emissions in San Francisco, said Charles Whitfield, Chair of the San Francisco Group, San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club. \"Building electrification can help solve some of the nation's top challengeslowering air pollution, improving resilience during extreme weather and earthquakes and dramatically reducing greenhouse gas pollution. We urge the passage of this important ordinance for both for the health of San Francisco residents and for the sake of the climate.\"</p><p>The ordinance is the result of over two years of planning and outreach. Engaged stakeholders include the Building Operations Task Force, developers, nonprofits, tenants' right organizations, contractors, unions, and professional/housing associations. The Committee's vote moves the City one step closer to electrifying all of San Francisco's buildings, which is key to San Francisco meeting its ambitious goal of net zero emissions by 2040. The ordinance would take effect starting in July 2026.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127262715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCM-5C13-RTMH-W145-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This contrast has helped shape Sims's curiosity about the environment around him. His background in environmental geosciences has allowed him to explore a range of fieldsfrom soil testing to corporate sustainabilitybefore finding his calling. Now, after working as a sustainability analyst at the NYC Mayor's Office and enrolling as a graduate student at Columbia Climate School, Sims is honing his skills to tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: ensuring an equitable energy transition through data-informed climate policy. \"I've always loved taking things apart to understand how they work,\" Sims says. \"Policy is like thatit's not about dismantling systems, but making small tweaks that ripple out and create widespread impact.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We spoke with Sims about his path into climate work, his experience in the M.A. in Climate and Society program at the Columbia Climate School and his vision for the future. Learn more about Sims's journey in the QandA below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tell us how you found your way into the climate space.</p><p>I have always been drawn to science, particularly ecology and environmental systems. During my time in undergrad, I explored many different subjects to try and find a major that was a fit for me. I tried accounting at one point, and psychology at another, before landing in a senior capstone course on climate mitigation with Elizabeth Thomas. It was the first time the University at Buffalo offered a course on climate change, specifically climate change mitigation. We partnered with the Western New York Sustainable Business Roundtablea coalition of companies who are interested in taking on sustainability initiatives. Students met with staff and operations people and developed plans for these companies to reduce emissions in ways that made sense for them. This was my first exposure to mitigation and crafting a policy-type framework to reduce corporate emissions and save operational costs as well.</p><p>After graduating, I bounced between rolesdoing soil testing in a lab, remediation work and environmental consultingbefore landing at the NYC Mayor's Office of Management and Budget. I joined just as they were launching the Environmental Sustainability and Resiliency Task Force, where I analyzed greenhouse gas emissions across New York City policies. That role solidified my passion for climate policy and made me realize I wanted to focus on systemic change.</p><p>I'm really interested in problem-solving, especially when it comes to tackling challenges in cities. I like analyzing existing systems to identify changes that can move us toward more sustainable and healthier communities. For example, transitioning from diesel buses to electric ones could help reduce asthma hospitalizations in a neighborhood. Small changes like that can have a real impact on people's lives.</p><p>Why did you decide to apply to the Climate and Society program?</p><p>I always knew I wanted to come back to school for my master's degree, but I wasn't sure what field to pursue. As I explored different programs, what stood out about this onetrue to its namewas its focus on both climate and society. It really emphasizes the human aspect, with courses centered on climate justice and how to evaluate and implement policies that genuinely improve people's lives. That was a major draw for me to apply to the Climate School.</p><p>Another factor was the importance of the cohort, which someone mentioned to me while I was researching schools. My cohort includes people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, which has been eye-opening in terms of understanding the many different ways climate issues intersect with various fields. This program has also been marketed as intensive and interdisciplinary, and so far, it has lived up to that. I wanted an intensive experience that would allow me to cross-register for courses and explore different aspects of climate policy. The one-year timeline also made sense for me.</p><p>Which classes have been the most memorable and why?</p><p>There are two classes that impacted me the most during my first semester at the Climate School. The first is the Energy Regulation course I attended at the Law School with Michael Gerrard. I had never taken a law class before. Understanding the legal landscape is crucialwhether it's climate litigation, environmental justice laws or the regulatory hurdles that shape policy. This class gave me the tools to analyze what's feasible, what barriers exist and how legal frameworks can drive change.</p><p>Climate Justice Theory and Policy with Sheila Foster was another impactful course last semester. At the NYC Mayor's Office, I worked on the city's climate budget, and a major question was how to operationalize environmental justice. This course provided a framework for understanding the intersection of policy, justice and climate. How do we ensure that the energy transition doesn't worsen inequalities? How do we make sure policies don't leave communities behind? This class, alongside the law perspective, gave me new perspectives to think about these challenges and what should be considered when drafting policy or evaluating it.</p><p>This spring semester, I am looking forward to taking Regional Climate Science and Forecasting for Climate Services. This is a course on risk analysis and using climate data to look at regional and local climate variations. The climate resiliency aspect of this course is something I find very interesting. It is a best practice, and necessary, to have climate-informed policies with high-level data analysis.</p><p>What do you envision as your future role in solving the climate crisis?</p><p>I see myself in a research analyst role, focusing on the energy transition. We've gone through the industrial revolutions beforeand many other societal transitionsbut how do we transition this time without repeating the mistakes of the past? How do we ensure that low-income communities aren't left behind again as we shift to renewables? How do we decarbonize the grid without leaving communities worse off? This is definitely a hard topic, but these are the questions I hope to answer. Being in a space where I can craft policy and also do some research about how we can improve people's quality of lives with an equity lens is ideal for me.</p><p>At first, I planned to go straight back into the workforce, but this program has fueled more questions than answers. Now, I'm considering a predoctoral program or a Ph.D. to dive deeper into these issues. My goal is to conduct research that isn't just theoreticalit needs to be actionable, informing policy and directly benefiting communities. I don't want my work to sit on a shelf; I want it to lead to tangible, measurable change. I'm particularly interested in urban energy systems and the impact of electrification in highly dense cities like New York. I find myself asking questions like: If we switch entirely to electric, how does that affect low-income families? What are the unintended consequences?</p><p>Is there anything else you'd like to add?</p><p>At the end of the day, I'm just a data nerd who wants to apply my skills to climate justice. I love taking things apartwhether it's a social system, an energy grid or a policy frameworkand figuring out how to make them better. Life is a big puzzle, and I want to help solve it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126990227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6W-99F3-RTFH-414W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 25, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fair-share literature assesses whether these targets are fair and ambitious in comparison to emissions trajectories based on equity principles. Such emissions trajectories commonly start at present-day emissions levels. Here we show that these continuous trajectories inherently reward past inaction and increasingly do so with their iterative updates. We provide an approach to allocating emissions trajectories based on equity principles applied with immediate effect. The resulting discontinuous national trajectories not starting at current emissions levels imply significant immediate international support to fund rapid mitigation globally. Modelling allocations with or without continuity has remarkable consequences for the relative implied contributions to international support among high-income countries. We find that emissions targets of G7 countries, Russia and China are responsible for most of the global 2030 ambition gap, while only some countries align with their 1.5 \u00b0C allocation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Existing ambition assessments of national climate pledges are biased, incompatible with international law and reward high emitters. Immediately accounting for the equity obligations of the Paris Agreement implies important financial support now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The Global Stocktake under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) found in 2023 that the aggregated impact of the 2030 countries\u2019 pledges is insufficient to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement1. To inform negotiations on the periodic improvement of national emissions pledges, studies assess their ambition against quantifications of each country\u2019s fair share of the remaining global emissions space to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C and well below 2 \u00b0C in line with the Paris Agreement2, 3, 4, 5\u20136. The literature on fair emissions levels can contribute to explaining, or even enhancing, the ambition of national pledges7, 8, 9\u201310 that insufficiently describe how they are \u2018fair and ambitious\u201911 as required under the Paris Agreement. Governments can legislate to adopt emissions targets recommended by independent bodies based on equity-based literature8, 9\u201310,12. Additionally, this fair-share literature designed to inform international negotiations on fair contributions to achieve the Paris Agreement is also used by courts of law to determine the adequacy of countries\u2019 emissions objectives under national laws6,13, 14, 15, 16\u201317. Recent literature has compared the ambition of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to possible emissions allocations based on fairness principles2, 3, 4, 5\u20136,18,19. However, most approaches allocate continuous emissions trajectories to countries, starting at their current emissions levels6,20. Such a modeling choice of continuous allocations favors, in the near term, countries with high current emissions resulting from relatively minor past efforts to reduce emissions6. This influence of present-day emissions on near-term emissions allocations also affects the ambition assessment of NDCs. The choice to model continuous emissions trajectories leads to a more lenient ambition assessment of NDCs for countries with higher than equitable emissions, to the disadvantage of others. Successive future literature updates of continuous emissions trajectories would increase this legacy effect as we approach the target dates, currently 2030.</p><p>Here we show how allocating discontinuous emissions trajectories solves the near-term legacy influence present in the fair share literature, regardless of the equity principle modeled. We quantify two methods to allocate discontinuous emissions trajectories, starting at emissions levels only based on fairness criteria, rather than present-day observed emissions levels. Here, \u2018fair\u2019 or \u2018equitable\u2019 allocations do not seek to reflect the personal view of any authors, but emissions allocations resulting from effort-sharing approaches based on principles of distributive justice and the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) of the Framework Convention and Paris Agreement1. We apply these methods to allocate to countries the emissions of a range of global scenarios with warming ranging from 1.5 \u00b0C to over 4 \u00b0C and compare the resulting allocations to the countries\u2019 NDCs. We discuss the emissions gaps between these allocations and their pledges. Finally, we discuss the results of these discontinuous trajectories with results from the recent literature.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Avoiding a grandfathering influence from continuous fair share trajectories</emphasis></p><p>The literature quantifying emissions allocations based on diverse principles of distributive justice, including the Paris Agreement\u2019s CBDR-RC, agrees on the insufficiency of the NDCs of most of the largest emitting countries2,3,5,6,18, 19, 20\u201321. Although there are divergences on the modeling choices of equity concepts21,22, this literature focused on a \u2018continuous\u2019 allocation of emissions trajectories starting at current emissions levels. In this context, \u2018continuous\u2019 refers to trajectories starting at current emissions levels, rather than immediately at equitable levels. Effort-sharing formulas can achieve such continuity by design2,3,23 or through a transition period added to ensure continuity3,18,20 towards allocations only based on fairness considerations. This continuity is also commonly assumed when allocating national carbon budgets over time into emissions trajectories18,24,25.</p><p>The legacy influence of current emissions levels on near-term emissions allocations is described here as a \u2018grandfathering\u2019 effect6. This grandfathering influence on equity-based emissions allocation is strongest in the near term and increasingly affects the ambition assessment of NDCs in 2030. As we near 2030, a given NDC\u2019s emissions target will be closer and closer to a continuous emissions allocation that is iteratively updated (Fig. 1). The grandfathering allocation is criticized for its lack of ethical basis26, 27\u201328 and has been shown to penalize the poorest countries20 as it preserves a status-quo, including current inequalities. Prior to the Paris Agreement, a study highlighted the value of a moderate grandfathering29, from a political theory perspective, with a realist justification for negotiations and a utilitarian justification. Indeed, the pledges of many high-emitters only align with a grandfathering allocation3. However, the IPCC has highlighted the need for a fair distribution of mitigation efforts, excluding grandfathering, in order to achieve an effective global agreement on emissions reductions21,27. Likewise, recent reports of scientific advisory bodies have disapplied grandfathering when presenting fair-share emissions allocation12,30. The Paris Agreement now requires NDCs of the highest possible ambition that reflect equity. A recent study6 described grandfathering allocations as not in line with international law. It identified that all continuous allocations entail elements of grandfathering but did not offer a solution.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of emissions allocations when modeling continuous and discontinuous allocations taking the USA.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> and Uganda (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) as examples. The successive update of continuous allocations emissions allocations, here illustrated with the addition of a transition period starting 2015 (dashed red) and 2020 (red), rewards countries with insufficient Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by decreasing the 2030 gap (gray dashed line) with the emissions allocation. Cumulatively over the transition period, the allocation difference with a discontinuous allocation (green area), here based on Approach 2, affects the additional effort, and possible climate finance, needed to align NDC with fair allocations.</p><p>The key motivation for allocating continuous emissions scenarios is to address the need for emissions trajectories that countries can implement domestically27,29. However, different from emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAM), equity allocations do not engage with feasibility concerns but solely focus on effort allocation irrespective of where emissions reductions take place. Past delays of emissions reduction progressively leads to steeper fair share trajectories that are unlikely to be considered politically, technically or economically realistic for any country27. Recent studies on budget allocations have shown already depleted budgets for high-emitting countries24,31. Modeling trajectories from current levels in such instances leads to countries accumulating further excess depletion to be compensated by substantial negative emissions in the future. However, equity-based allocations serve as a proxy to distribute mitigation efforts and do not need to be met through domestic mitigation exclusively. Instead, countries can achieve their equity-based emissions allocations through a combination of domestic effort and international cooperation27,32. As such, emissions allocations do not require to be continuous, and countries can immediately provide an equitable share of the global mitigation effort, beyond the limitations of what is feasible to implement within their borders. Immediately contributing to mitigation efforts outside of their own territories would be better able to remedy current inequities caused by past emissions as well as address the current emissions gap between current NDCs and the Paris Agreement targets.</p><p>To inform this extraterritorial contribution, the IPCC sixth assessment report calls for research extending equity frameworks to quantify equitable international support as the difference between equity-based national emissions scenarios and national domestic emissions scenarios22. Such frameworks would enable assessing the ambition of countries\u2019 total contribution to global mitigation through domestic and international cooperation jointly. International cooperation to mitigate global emissions through bilateral agreements (as in the Swiss NDC), financial support or trading of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), is now facilitated with the agreement of trading rules under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement at UNFCCC COP29. Such mechanisms offer a solution to progress towards an equitable distribution of the mitigation effort while contributing to the funding of mitigation measures, in line with cost-optimal implementation of mitigation measures across countries. The utilitarian justification29 for a moderate grandfathering relies domestic mitigation costs and is no longer relevant when allocations can be traded to achieve a globally cost-effective pathway27.</p><p>Emissions scenarios from IAM assume the implementation of the cheapest mitigation option in each region without specifying which country should fund these measures. Implementing these scenarios without international cooperation \u2013 assuming that each country should fund the measures modeled for their territory \u2013 would represent a much greater fraction of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in regions with lower GDP per capita33. While much of the mitigation potential is in countries with low GDP per capita, countries with the greatest financial capacity fail to provide sufficient unconditional finance34,35 or meet their own pledges36. Additionally, accounting for the higher cost of access to capital in poorer countries would impact mitigation costs and imply greater domestic mitigation in richer countries than currently found in IAMs37, 38\u201339. The implementation of the Paris goals, or of IAM scenarios, thus requires significant and immediate international support35,40,41. Equitably implementing a global IAM trajectory can imply that countries\u2019 domestic emissions trajectories follow cost-optimal scenarios \u2013 that can be downscaled at the national level42 \u2013 and provide (or receive) the climate finance needed to mitigate overseas the difference with their equitable allocation. Compared to the domestic measures aligned with IAM trajectories, countries could pursue greater domestic mitigation to reap important co-benefits not accounted for, which can cover a substantial share of the mitigation costs43. In practice, countries with high responsibility and capability can align with the Paris Agreement with an NDC within their fair shares, met through a combination of domestic mitigation of the highest possible ambition44, and funding to mitigate global emissions overseas12. As a novel mechanism, the international trading of mitigation outcomes raises implementation issues regarding the additionality of the finance and of the funded mitigation measures. Scrutiny will be needed to ensure the integrity of mitigation measures under Article 6 whose implementation rules were just adopted at COP29, with safeguards on human rights and the additionality of emissions reductions41,45,46.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quantification discontinuous emissions trajectories</emphasis></p><p>Here we quantify two sets of emissions trajectories immediately based on equity principles and that do not start at current emissions levels (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The two methods combine the equity principles of capability and responsibility21 to reflect the principles of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, notably CBDR-RC. The literature suggests several approaches, conceptual or statistical, for combining different equity principles into a single allocation method (see Discussion). Here we apply each of the two equity principles to allocate global positive or negative emissions separately. This differentiated treatment of negative emissions extends a study from Fyson et al.47 that allocated negative emissions only, based on responsibility or capability. Fyson et al. 47 explain that obligations to deliver negative emissions require uncertain technologies made necessary because of insufficient global emissions reductions to date. That study alone could not be used to inform economy-wide emissions targets, and thus not assess the ambition of NDCs, as it only allocated negative emissions and assumed that positive emissions follow least-cost pathways (that is, no equity principle is applied to gross emissions)47. Here, Approach 1 first allocates global negative emissions across countries based on their capability, assessed through GDP per capita, and then allocates global positive emissions to equalize historical responsibilities over the total net emissions (positive + negative, see \u201cMethods\u201d). Under this approach, rich countries are required to fund most of the negative emissions that require important research and development costs without local co-benefits47. Approach 1 also ensures equal cumulative per capita emissions over the 1990-2100 period. The present results are therefore favorable for high historical emitters compared to accounting historical emissions since 1950 (Supplementary Data). Under Approach 2, all countries contribute to positive emissions reductions based on their wealth. Negative emissions, needed because of the world\u2019s important historical emissions, are then allocated proportionally to countries\u2019 individual historical responsibilities. There, countries\u2019 cumulative emissions allocations are not only based on their historical responsibility. Looking at the global emissions scenarios, the positive emissions refer here to the projected physical emissions (e.g., fossil fuels, agriculture). The negative emissions here refer to emissions captured through Carbon Dioxide Removal, excluding those from Direct Air Capture and Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) unlike Fyson et al.47.</p><p>In addition to representing CBDR-RC, the modeling of responsibility and capability also reflects considerations present in national policies. The European Union (EU) used a capability approach, based on GDP per capita, to allocate across its member states the mitigation effort of its first NDC target48,49 and to negotiate effort-sharing under the new Fit for 55 package50. However, this capability criterion is not used to determine the emissions objectives of the EU NDC itself, which are not based or justified by equity considerations applicable to all32. The capability principle reflects notions of progressive income taxation that many countries have implemented51. Responsibility can be related to the \u2018polluter-pays\u2019 principle that many countries recognized in the Rio 1992 declaration and use in national law.</p><p>Here, countries\u2019 responsibility is studied solely based on territorial emissions accounted under UN frameworks. Other emissions frameworks account for emissions linked to consumption, fossil fuel extraction, or carbon intensity of countries\u2019 income52. Such accounting could lead to more stringent allocations for countries with higher responsibilities, compared to territorial emissions, regarding their consumption footprint (the EU, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore), income footprint (Norway, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Australia) and extraction-based emissions (Canada, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Australia)52. Importantly, top-down effort-sharing formulas, such as those used here, may lose relevance for countries with very small and isolated populations (e.g., small island states). Such countries may have limited technical options to mitigate emissions and limited access to some options given the small size of their economies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fair-share allocations</emphasis></p><p>Under both approaches, emissions allocations start at levels that only depend on the global emissions scenario and countries\u2019 historical responsibilities and capabilities (Fig. 1, see country-level results in SI). Over time, emissions allocations for all countries follow the trends of the underlying global scenario (methods), a rapid decrease and plateau in the second half of the century. The USA, Canada and Australia have immediate negative allocations before 2035 under both approaches. Approach 2 is less stringent than Approach 1 for low-income countries53 (sub-Saharan African countries) and for countries with high historical responsibility (USA, Russia, Qatar and other fossil fuel extracting countries, see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data). These different stringencies of emissions allocations do not always change the warming assessment of countries\u2019 NDCs (Fig. 3). Emissions objectives, such as NDCs or net-zero targets, should only be considered aligned with the present allocations if earlier emissions match the discontinuous allocation as well, which implies immediate contribution to global mitigation. The near-term allocation of some countries, mostly sub-Saharan countries, may exceed their current emissions and business-as-usual trajectory beyond 2030, implying mitigation efforts only later18. However, staying within such decreasing allocations beyond 2030 implies immediate investments, possibly with international support. International support can enable recipient countries to implement mitigation measures in line with the underlying global socio-economic scenario in the near term. Approach 2 uses allocations inversely proportional to GDP per capita3,54 (see \u201cmethods\u201d), resulting in high emissions allocations compared to current emissions and allocations based on business-as-usual trajectories2,18 for low-income countries (e.g., Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo). These allocations theoretically imply financial transfers that may go beyond needs-based considerations and contribute to poverty reduction through climate action55. The absence of continuity criteria highlights important sensitivities in emissions allocation across equity-based formulas that are otherwise dampened by the need for continuity in the near term and the declining global emissions space in the longer term.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dates when emissions allocations first reach 50% below 2020 under Approach 1.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> and Approach 2 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), based on 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios with no or limited overshoot (C1 category).</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Warming assessment of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) based on Approach 1.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> and 2 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) allocations of global emissions scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1 category), 1.5\u00b0C with high overshoot (OS, C2), likely below 2 \u00b0C, below 3 \u00b0C or below 4 \u00b0C warmings. Colors at the edges of the legend range can reflect values outside the range, either more ambitious than a 1.5 \u00b0C allocation or less ambitious than a 4 \u00b0C allocation. NDCs should only be considered aligned with the present allocations if earlier emissions also match the discontinuous allocation, which implies immediate support and cooperative approaches.</p><p>The effect on the countries\u2019 near-term tradeable emissions of adding a transition phase to ensure the continuity of an emissions allocation schematized in Fig. 1. As highlighted in previous studies14, adding a transition period greatly influences near-term allocation through a grandfathering influence. Here we show an additional effect of continuous allocation where their updates reward inaction by closing the ambition gap between the updated equity-based allocations and an insufficient NDC (exemplified in Fig. 1).</p><p>Looking at the geography of reduction rates, Fig. 2 shows the date when allocations are half of 2020 levels based on a 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory with no or limited overshoot (C1 scenarios, excluding bunkers and LULUCF emissions; see \u201cMethods\u201d). Under both approaches 1 and 2, the allocations of most countries reach half of 2020-levels by 2030. The allocations of some sub-Saharan and South Asian countries remain positive over the century.</p><p>The \u2018warming maps\u2019 (Fig. 3) show the warming alignment of countries\u2019 NDCs, that is, the warming associated with the most ambitious global scenario underlying the allocation that is above their NDC in 2030. This \u2018warming alignment\u2019 of a country also reflects the expected global warming level when all other countries follow a similar level of ambition. The differences in terms of emissions allocations across the two approaches do not translate into important differences for countries\u2019 ambition assessments. Most countries have an ambition assessment either 1.5 \u00b0C-aligned or not even 4 \u00b0C-aligned. The main reason is that the effect of the current inequities across countries\u2019 2030 allocations overwhelms the relative spread in numerical targets across countries. This polarization of results reflects the extreme disparities of the current situation, considering countries\u2019 responsibilities and capabilities. This effect increases as we delay climate action and as we near 2030. Many countries have committed to NDCs much more ambitious than their 1.5 \u00b0C-allocations, mostly sub-Saharan countries. Countries with NDCs within their fair-shares could sell emissions space (possibly through conditional NDCs), possibly under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which could fund the implementation of the mitigation measures implied by the cost-optimal scenarios42. Most high-income countries have largely insufficient NDCs, even when historical emissions accounted only since 1990. Approach 2 also yields a more stringent assessment for the NDCs of the UK, Switzerland and multiple countries, mostly in Latin America and South Asia.</p><p>The absence of continuity also changes the ranking of countries in terms of additional mitigation effort needed to align with their allocation, which potentially affects their share of the climate finance to be provided globally. Figure 4 provides an illustrative case of the influence of adding a 20-year transition period on the gap between the emissions allocations of G20 countries and their respective NDCs. In theory, each country\u2019s relative contribution to total international climate finance can be proportional to how much each country\u2019s NDC deviates from its fair-share trajectories. Compared to a traditional continuous approach, applying a discontinuous approach implies here a much higher obligation to contribute to global mitigation and possibly international finance for all G20 countries except India. In terms of the ranking of the emissions gap between NDC and allocation, assuming a transition period benefits Canada and Australia (moving down 9 positions), the USA and South Korea (each 8 positions). This shows that continuous pathways reward such countries for their history of comparably low mitigation efforts, lowering their implied contribution to international climate finance. Other countries, including China, T\u00fcrkiye, South Africa and even the EU move down in the ranking of the ambition gaps when removing the transition period.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effect on the 2030 emissions gap between countries Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and their 1.5 \u00b0C allocations of adding a 20-year transition period from current emissions levels (right side), compared to allocations calculated in Approach 2 (left side).</emphasis></p><p>The ranking of additional mitigation effort and potential international support needed for countries to align their NDC with their allocation changes when using a transition period. Results are shown for G20 countries with NDCs above their allocation. The color legend is based on the discontinuous allocation.</p><p>Discussions about climate finance in the context of the UNFCCC have often referred to the perceived obligations of, for example, high versus low-income countries. The comparison between continuous and discontinuous fairness allocations highlights the difference amongst high-income countries when considering the amount of finance needed to meet their fair shares.</p><p>In addition to capability and responsibility, equality is the third equity principle described in the IPCC AR521,27. IPCC reports do not present equity-based emissions allocations since AR5, despite available studies and its importance for courts of law13. The egalitarian approach modeled as equal per capita emissions is not explicitly mentioned in the Paris Agreement or international environmental law6 but it can reveal the inequalities of emissions spaces claimed through NDCs. Figure 5 shows the equal per capita allocation where each country\u2019s share of global emissions is proportional to its population projection at every point in time18. Even discarding countries\u2019 CBDR-RC, as modeled in approaches 1 and 2, this equality-based assessment yields similar warming assessments for most large emitters. In other words, the NDCs of many sub-Saharan countries are below the equal per capita levels of a 1.5 \u00b0C scenario. However, the NDCs of many countries with high responsibility and capability, which are meant to reflect their \u2018highest possible ambition\u20191,44 and account for CBDR-RC do not even reflect an equal per capita share of a business-as-usual trajectory, itself yielding warming impacts that hit some countries much harder than others. Establishing a country\u2019s alignment with the CBDR-RC principle depends on the methods used to quantify the responsibility and capability principles18,24. However, the misalignment of an emissions target with a simple equal per capita allocation can be used to characterize a misalignment with the CBDR-RC principle, for countries with higher-than-average capability and responsibility. In a recent ruling15, the European Court of Human Rights used a simple equal per capita allocation to comment on Switzerland\u2019s inadequate emissions levels while recognizing the need to account for its CBDR-RC.Fig. 5</p><p>Warming assessment of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) based on an equal per capita allocation of global emissions scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1 category), 1.5 \u00b0C with high overshoot (OS, C2), likely below 2 \u00b0C, below 3 \u00b0C or below 4 \u00b0C warmings. Colors at the edges of the legend range can reflect values outside the range, either more ambitious than a 1.5 \u00b0C allocation or less ambitious than a 4 \u00b0C allocation. NDCs should only be considered aligned with the present allocations if earlier emissions also match the discontinuous allocation, which implies immediate support and cooperative approaches.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Here we discuss how this study\u2019s modeling choices compare to the literature regarding the continuity assumption and the combination of equity principles. Then, we compare results.</p><p>A study28 called for transparency regarding ethical choices behind quantifications of fair contributions under the Paris Agreement. It categorized existing literature based on whether a grandfathering perspective or approach had been used explicitly or through the addition of a transition period. Our analysis reveals a broader form of grandfathering influence not previously identified, resulting from the choice of modeling continuous emissions allocation. This modeling choice is not necessary to allocate global mitigation efforts and is at odds with legal and ethical principles. Greater transparency is needed in future studies regarding the motivations and implications of modeling continuous allocations. A transparent disclosure on the inclusion or not of a continuity criterion in models can also inform courts on how the modeling assumptions affect the assessment of whether or not a country\u2019s target is legally sufficient6,28.</p><p>Even models that do not have a transition period but rely on continuous allocations have that grandfathering influence. In the model behind the Climate Equity Reference Calculator2,23 (CERC), the continuity of the emissions trajectory results from the choice of allocating the mitigation burden to depart from a reference trajectory rather than allocating the remaining emissions space2. Such an approach based on reference trajectories can be adequate to assess the ambition of an emissions target when provided with a corresponding reference scenario, e.g. pledges adopted in 2015 can be compared to allocations starting in 2015. The grandfathering effect could occur when the ambition of an older target is assessed against a newer allocation based on a newer reference scenario that no longer reflects the effort that the target represented when adopted. With successive updates, the allocated emissions trajectory at a given year would come closer to even a business-as-usual target. An allocation starting the year prior to the target will find it to be close to equitable levels. Therefore, such an approach may not be suited as a single metric to assess the ambition of targets adopted at different times by different countries2,56. To avoid the grandfathering influence of allocation updates, it is possible not to update allocations (e.g. after the Paris Agreement), but it misses the effect of later emissions trends of countries on allocations57. The CERC approach can be used to determine the financial support that countries should receive to depart from a reference scenario. Because of the reliance on a reference scenario, the tradeable mitigation outcome starts at zero. This could disserve recipient countries in the near term, compared to using the allocations derived in the present study, unless finance is mobilized immediately to fund future mitigation gap.</p><p>The near-term grandfathering influence may increase the overshoot of a country\u2019s emissions budget to be compensated through lower or negative allocations later in the century2,3,5,12,18,24. Relying on the assumptions of future compensations reduces near term efforts and complicates accountability. Some studies allocate emissions budgets, which are not defined over time and do not have a grandfathering influence. The flexibility provided by carbon budgets over emissions pathways18 theoretically allows countries to use their budget mostly in the near-term and justify insufficient emissions objectives, which raises issues of intergenerational justice12. However, budgets are not adequate to assess the ambition of emissions reduction targets without additional assumptions regarding their use over time24. The grandfathering influence is introduced when hypothesizing the use of the emissions budget through a continuous emissions pathway25,58,59. A recent study31 suggests that countries should compensate through negative emissions for their \u2018carbon debt\u201960,61 calculated as the observed or pledged overshoot of fair shares of the nearly exhausted 1.5 \u00b0C global carbon budget. This budget-based approach has been used to establish a breach of a legal obligation of states by courts15,17. However, emissions budgets are less suitable to determine minimum near term targets, which may be enforced by courts62, and can be complemented by discontinuous pathways such as modeled in this study.</p><p>A key challenge in the fair-share literature is the combination of different equity dimensions into a single emissions allocation method63. Here, the responsibility and capability principles are combined to drive the allocation of positive and negative global emissions distinctly, but other approaches to combining different equity principles exist in the literature. Simply presenting emissions allocation side by side3,5,18,64 may lead to the erroneous interpretation that the underlying principles are equivalently equitable, especially if compared to a grandfathering allocation20. Averaging2,65 or applying weighting factors2 to allocations based on different equity formulas reflects a numerical compromise rather than a multidimensional vision of equity66. Likewise, the online tool Climate Action Tracker (CAT) assesses and suggests targets based on an aggregation of fair-share studies19. These underlying studies may have mutually inconsistent hypotheses, including different starting dates that strongly influence near-term emissions allocations, different pursued warming outcomes based on different global scenarios, and budgets used differently over time. The emissions allocations from various studies are then harmonized before being aggregated. The iterative aggregations of continuous emissions allocation can increasingly impact the ambition assessment of countries\u2019 NDCs, in favor of parties with emissions above their allocations6,28. Alternatively, other studies apply distinct equity principles to each country4,67,68, possibly reflecting a self-differentiated approach of equity reflective of the Paris Agreement bottom-up architecture4 rather than applying a single principle to all countries. Under this differentiated combination, each country\u2019s fair-share formula does not affect how the share of another country is calculated. Instead, it affects the global goal applied to all countries\u2019 formulas. While these combinations of equity principles often rely on underlying continuous allocations, these are not a methodological requirement. The combination modeled in the present paper is also conceptual rather than numerical and avoids giving relative arbitrary weights to equity principles. The two modeled approaches illustrate the sensitivity of allocations to alternative combinations of capability and responsibility in the absence of continuity criteria.</p><p>The comparison of these results with the literature shows broad agreement on the insufficiency of some NDCs under the 1.5 \u00b0C goal but divergences on the ambition gaps across countries. Here, only substantial improvement, including through international cooperation, can improve the warming assessment of many NDCs. Compared to a previous warming assessment4 (visible on Paris-Equity-Check.org) where each country follows the least stringent of three equity principles (capability, responsibility, and equality), the present approaches find NDCs to be more ambitious (1.5 \u00b0C aligned) for a few countries (including India, Indonesia, and North Africa depending on the approach) and less ambitious for countries in most Latin American and Annex I countries. Both Approach 1 and 2 also have more polarized results with fewer NDCs between 1.5 \u00b0C and 3 \u00b0C, partly because the previous warming assessment4 relies on continuous approaches3,69. Compared to the CAT\u2019s \u2018fair shares\u2014the part of the CAT19 assessments that serves to assess the ambition of the overall mitigation effort in countries\u2019 NDCs\u2014results of the present study are more stringent for G7 countries, China and South Africa, and less for India. The CERC23 was used to published an NDC assessment2 in 2017 that found China\u2019s NDC to be nearly 1.5 \u00b0C aligned, unlike most other assessments3,4,18,19, including from Chinese institutions5. In terms of emissions allocations, the CERC finds much higher emissions allocations for Middle Eastern fossil-fuel-exporting countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar) implying a right to international climate support\u2014despite their high GDP per capita. Under its default setup (responsibility since 1950, but more settings are available), the CERC is more stringent for the EU with net-zero dates before 2030 (before 2035 in our study with responsibility since 1950), India, and the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) collectively, since their allocations are capped by their reference scenario.</p><p>In conclusion, this study highlights how iterative updates of ambition assessments that are based on continuous emissions allocations reward a lack of action and reduce the implied provision of international support. As a result, the ratcheting-up mechanism of the Paris Agreement is currently informed by ambition assessments that iteratively ratchet down the importance of equity considerations in the near term. We offer a solution to this near-term grandfathering influence, applicable to any equity-based emissions allocation, by modeling discontinuous emissions trajectories starting immediately at equity-based levels. Applying this method, we model two approaches that reflect countries\u2019 responsibilities and capabilities to derive emissions trajectories immediately consistent with the Paris Agreement\u2019s equity principle. With this removal of an important near-term grandfathering effect, we quantify ambition gaps between countries\u2019 allocated trajectories and current or pledged emissions. As NDCs for 2035 are expected in 2025, this study shows that meeting allocations immediately based on equity requires a faster scale-up of mitigation measures along with immediate international support. Future studies can quantify the equitable international support needed for countries to align with discontinuous emissions allocations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allocations methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Approach 1</emphasis> combines a capability-driven allocation of global negative emissions with a historical responsibility-driven allocation of global positive emissions to correct for historical responsibility and equalize per capita emissions rights over the considered period. The \u2018historical\u2019 period to account for responsibility here starts in 1950 to reflect recent historical emissions (Supplementary Data) or in 1990 to account for observed emissions since the first IPCC report (main text). Here, the capability allocation affects the distribution of emissions over time, but not the total budget. Richer countries then have more important negative allocations in the future and less stringent allocations in the near term. The capability-driven allocation of growing global negative emissions (under the most ambitious global pathways) requires greater negative emissions from richer countries, mostly occurring after 2030. Achieving future negative emissions requires technologies (here excluding LULUCF) yet to be developed and that do not provide the important co-benefits of positive emissions reductions (e.g., energy security, health co-benefits). Since the responsibility-driven allocation of positive emissions ensures a given total emissions budget for each country, the capability-driven allocation of negative emissions results in an increase of near-term net emissions allocations for richer countries, as it otherwise reduces their longer-term net allocations. Many of these richer countries would have negative emissions budgets in 2021 already under a pure equal cumulative per capita allocation of global net emissions. An alternative parameterization of this Approach 1 could be to use HDI instead of GDP to better reflect the development of countries and their potential needs for development, supported by a view of development that is not purely economic70. Then, a country with a higher HDI can be allocated a greater effort as a share of negative emissions. However, using HDI as a capacity indicator may then penalize good governance compared to using GDP. Comparing two countries with equal populations and equal GDPs, the country with the higher HDI will have greater effort to provide when using HDI as the capacity indicator rather than GDP.</p><p>Practically, the first step of this approach is to annually allocate to countries negative emissions (excluding LULUCF) of the global scenario proportionally to their respective GDP projection (and thus indirectly based on their populations). Unlike Fyson et al.47, the current approach does not filter out countries below the global mean of GDP per capita. As a second step, the positive emissions of the global scenario are then allocated to equalize per capita emissions over the considered period and reflect historical responsibility (in terms of emissions since 1950 or 1990). The budget is equal to the cumulation of equal per capita emissions over that period. This modeling accounts for historical responsibility dynamically as the sum over time of equal per capita shares of the global emissions. The resulting budget matches that of a theoretical situation where countries had equal per capita emissions. This dynamic modeling of historical responsibility differs from a more integrated modeling where total emissions over the period considered are proportional to the total cumulated population over the same period. This budget can be negative for countries that had high emissions levels. Note that past emissions are first discounted by 1.5% each year in the past to account for technological improvement71. Each country is then allocated at every point in time (2021 to 2100) a fraction of the positive part of the global scenario proportional to its remaining budget. As a result, the first year\u2019s allocation differs from current emissions, and it may require IMTOs and very rapid scaling up of mitigation efforts to reconcile actual emissions with allocations over the period to 2030.</p><p>For both approaches, we define the budget  as:12where  is the emissions of a country over time, , <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis>. Note that  can be negative for high historical per capita emitting countries.</p><p>For approach 1, the first step is to allocate the negative emissions of the global emissions pathway  to countries:3</p><p>The next step is to allocate the positive emissions of the global emissions pathway  to countries45</p><p>Finally:6</p><p>Note that7and that  is equal for all countries.</p><p>We could not model the addition of a transition period to Approach 1 where long-term and near-term allocations are calculated jointly. Results of Approach 1 can be compared to the continuous modeling of the Equal Cumulative Per Capita allocation of ref. 3 to review the effect of a continuity criterion since both methods pursue equal historical responsibility by 2100.</p><p>The burden-sharing Approach 1 of the present study was used in the Traffic Light Reports70 published by the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) with specific parameterizations based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI) (Supplementary Discussion).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Approach 2</emphasis> models a capability-driven allocation of the global positive emissions and a responsibility-driven allocation of negative emissions. This modeling can reflect a funding of the near-term transition mostly by countries with the most financial capacities. Following these results, allocations can help mobilize the high investments needed to implement the mitigation measures across countries. Practically, the allocation of the positive part of the global scenario follows the approach of prior studies3,54, where each country gets a share of global emissions proportional to its population divided by its GDP per capita dynamically (that is, at every point in time). This approach yields significant variations in emissions allocations across countries, which reflects the large differences across countries\u2019 GDPs (often proportionally greater than the differences in their historical contributions). This results in the allocation of important mitigation efforts for richer countries as a share of a global mitigation effort, which remains minor compared to global GDP72.</p><p>As a second step, the allocation of the global negative emissions is proportional to countries\u2019 respective contributions to cumulative emissions dynamically (since 1950 or 1990 consistently with Approach 1 parameterization). Countries are allocated a share of the effort to contribute to removing emissions proportionally to their contribution to global warming at every point in time. This contribution to negative emissions is thus linked with their past population through their emissions but not linked to their future population. The influence of the responsibility component is entirely bounded by the levels of global negative emissions that grow over time. The starting point of the emissions allocation is thus hardly influenced by the responsibility component. The capability allocation contributes to reducing the difference in historical emissions across countries given the frequent correlation between countries\u2019 responsibility and capability.</p><p>The emissions allocations in the near term are driven by the GDP per capita of each country, which yields very large allocations for poor countries. For such countries, climate finance informed by Approach 2 allocations in this paper could increase their GDP indicators and thus reduce their allocation in turn. In practice, many of the poorest countries have committed to unconditional targets much lower than the equity-based allocations.8910</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition alignment of global emissions scenarios</emphasis></p><p>Here, the warming alignment of a country\u2019s pledge reflects the global warming resulting from the emissions of the global scenarios whose allocation to that country is matched by its pledge. We use the representative scenarios from the IPCC-AR6 called C-scenarios, with warming outcomes ranging from 1.5 \u00b0C to above 4 \u00b0C. The respective emissions levels, including their negative emissions components, are not necessarily ordered according to their warming outcomes given their underlying socio-economic assumptions. As a result, their respective emissions trajectories cross over time, which brings limitations in assessing the ambition of the NDCs of a small number of countries (see Supplementary Discussion).</p><p>The reference to a 1.5 \u00b0C alignment corresponds here to an alignment with the distribution of emissions of the average of scenarios of the IPCC Categories C1 (below 1.5 \u00b0C with no or limited overshoot). The distribution of C2 conveys a warming below 1.5 \u00b0C with high overshoot. The upper threshold of 2 \u00b0C alignment here follows the definition based on emissions scenarios C3 (likely below 2 \u00b0C) category. The consistency of such low emissions scenarios with the Paris Agreement temperature goal is discussed based on warming responses and levels of negative emissions73,74. Additionally, the effort-sharing formulas are applied to the scenario categories C6 (below 3 \u00b0C), C7 (below 4 \u00b0C) that reflect current policies, and C8 aligned with a warming above 4 \u00b0C. The allocation approaches can be applied to any global emissions scenarios, coherently with its socio-economic modeling assumptions. When averaging over multiple scenarios for each C-category, this study only considers the emissions of global scenarios but does not represent underlying socio-economic assumptions75. Avoiding any 1.5 \u00b0C overshoot and ensuring a higher likelihood of achieving that warming threshold thereby implies smaller emissions allocations still than the ones presented in this article.</p><p>The alignment of an NDC with a given emissions scenario is based on the unconditional part of the NDC, as it represents the mitigation effort provided by the country. When the emissions quantification of the NDC was provided with an uncertainty range, the alignment with a pathway is based on the average of the high and low values.</p><p>The absence of monotony between the warming response of the C-scenarios and their negative emissions can also result in non-monotonous 2030 allocations for some countries under Approach 1. In other words, some countries may have less stringent allocations under a 3 \u00b0C scenario than under 2 \u00b0C in 2030. While this paradox is compensated over time, such warming assessments are not relevant for these countries (list of countries in Supplementary Discussion).</p><p>Some of the selected global 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios with strong near-term mitigation also have positive emissions throughout the century when LULUCF emissions are excluded. As a result, some countries with relatively low responsibility and capability have emissions allocations that are positive throughout the century under a 1.5 \u00b0C objective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data sources</emphasis></p><p>The global emissions scenarios whose emissions are allocated to countries are the average of ensembles of scenarios in the categories C1 to C8 from the IPCC AR6 database54 (accessible here). The GDP data (in purchasing power parity, ppp) is taken from the Social Socioeconomic Pathways55 associated with the global emissions scenarios (available here), specifically assuming the SSP2 scenario, describing a middle of the road between adaptation and mitigation challenges. Taking GDP without purchasing power parity correction could widen the difference in allocations between rich and poor countries. Historical emissions data is from a recent study76 based on the Potsdam Real-time Integrated Model for the probabilistic Assessment of emission Paths (PRIMAP)77,78 and the Global Carbon Project76,79. The population data is from the UN population prospects 2022 (available here). Bunkers scenario projections used in this article extrapolated from the ELEVATE project based on the IMAGE 3.4 model (available here, and visible in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). The quantification of NDCs is taken from a recent publication80,81 (updated in March 2023). The country-level results are contingent on the limitations of the methods discussed above and on the limitation of the data projections used here. Population and especially GDP projections have intrinsic uncertainty that varies from country to country. In particular, GDP projections for small countries should be seen as best guesses, and the resulting emissions allocations are indicative. Considering groups of small countries, possibly as their negotiating groups, can reduce the sensitivity of their emissions allocation to underlying data uncertainty. Additionally, the accounting of LULUCF emissions, here excluded, in reported data and emissions projections towards NDC targets can bring high uncertainty for countries with important forest coverage. Here, the data is coming from single sources for all countries, while the accounting of LULUCF in NDCs may differ from country to country and is often vaguely defined58. The allocation methods described here could be applied using other data projections, including governmental ones.</p><p>The countries considered are the 198 Paris to the UNFCCC. Parties for which data is missing are summarized in the Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and discussed in the Supplementary Methods. Emissions allocations are run amongst countries with available data, and the emissions allocation of the EU is the sum of the allocations of its member states. Its allocation as a single entity would yield different results given the non-linearity of the effort-sharing formulae derived here. The same considerations apply to country groups.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This study was co-funded by Aroha and\u00a0the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF).

Image  Madina Nurmanova via Shutterstock. </p><p>At the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.za/news/speeches/minister-naledi-pandor-brics-dialogue-developing-countries-11-jun-2024\">BRICS Dialogue with Developing Countries in Nizhny Novgorod in June 2024, South Africa's then Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, when asked about BRICS's tangible support for African countries, emphasized the need to #8216;expand dialogue capacities#8217; and #8216;create space for the voices of the Global South to be heard.#8217; While diplomatically worded, her response clearly illustrated that even at the highest levels, BRICS remains distant from offering concrete support mechanisms for the continent. This symbolic exchange sets the tone for a deeper reflection on how far BRICS has moved from the founding spirit of Global South solidarity first articulated at the 1955 Bandung Conference.</url></p><p>In 1955, leaders of 29 Asian and African countries gathered in Bandung, Indonesia, in a landmark conference that <url normalizedValue=\"https://africasacountry.com/2021/05/accra-to-bandung-addis-to-beijing\">challenged colonial domination and Western imperialism. The Bandung Conference sought to assert a new vision of sovereignty, solidarity, and self-determination among the recently decolonized nations. It laid the foundation for the Non-Aligned Movement, inspired Pan-Africanism and Asian-African cooperation, and gave voice to a moral and political alternative to Cold War bipolarity.</url></p><p>Seventy years later, as the BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) expands its membership and seeks to offer a counterweight to Western hegemony, many are asking whether BRICS represents a continuation\u2014or a betrayal\u2014of Bandung's spirit. Is BRICS the heir to the anticolonial, egalitarian project of the Global South? Or has it become a pragmatic alliance of economic interests, untethered from the radical imagination of its predecessors?</p><p>BRICS, for all its symbolic importance and economic weight, has so far failed to articulate a coherent strategic alternative to Western-led globalization. It lacks not only institutional depth but also the ideological clarity and political will that Bandung embodied. Unlike Bandung, which was rooted in shared anti-imperial struggles and a commitment to moral leadership, BRICS has been hampered by internal contradictions, geopolitical caution, and elite-driven agendas.</p><p>The promise of Bandung was not simply unity among postcolonial states\u2014it was a vision of global justice grounded in resistance to empire. Leaders like Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, and Nkrumah saw themselves as part of a world-historical movement. They were not merely defending sovereignty; they were articulating a new internationalism from below. In contrast, BRICS has often failed to speak with one voice on matters of war, peace, or development. During critical moments\u2014such as NATO's intervention in Libya, the Gaza wars, or coups in Africa\u2014its silence has been deafening.</p><p>China and Russia, to be sure, have increasingly challenged US unipolarity, especially in the wake of the Ukraine war and rising tensions in the South China Sea. But their confrontations with the West are largely framed in realist terms: a clash of great powers, not a struggle for the oppressed. Brazil and India, meanwhile, oscillate between Global South rhetoric and integration into Western-dominated financial and security institutions. South Africa, despite its post-apartheid legacy, has not consistently mobilized the language of liberation in its foreign policy.</p><p>The expansion of BRICS in 2024 to include countries like Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Argentina was seen by some as a revival of its southern identity. But enlargement alone cannot resolve the bloc's identity crisis. Without a shared political vision, BRICS risks becoming a loose consortium of discontent rather than a transformative force. The challenge is not simply to oppose the West\u2014it is to construct an alternative rooted in the struggles and aspirations of the majority world.</p><p>There are signs of hope. <url normalizedValue=\"https://africasacountry.com/2025/06/de-dollarization-from-bellow\">The push for de-dollarization, efforts to build new development banks, and calls for UN reform reflect a growing impatience with Western dominance. Civil society actors, social movements, and intellectuals across the South continue to invoke Bandung as a source of inspiration. But the gap between elite summitry and grassroots solidarity remains wide.</url></p><p>To recover the spirit of Bandung, BRICS must do more than convene. It must commit to principles: anti-imperialism, economic justice, climate equity, and popular sovereignty. It must listen to the voices from below\u2014from African farmers to Asian workers to Latin American feminists. Only then can it move beyond symbolism and offer a credible path toward a more just and multipolar world. Otherwise, BRICS risks becoming what Bandung opposed: <url normalizedValue=\"https://africasacountry.com/2023/05/anti-imperialism-for-the-ruling-class\">a club of powerful states reproducing global inequality in a new key.</url></p><p>Africa's role in BRICS remains complex and under-explored. While South Africa is a founding member, its ability to shape the bloc's agenda has been limited. Countries like Zambia, burdened by debt and austerity, have looked to BRICS as a possible alternative to Western financial institutions\u2014but with few concrete results. The New Development Bank's track record in Africa remains modest, and many governments remain cautious about aligning too closely with Beijing or Moscow. Similarly, in West Asia, BRICS has offered no unified stance on the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza or the continued marginalization of Palestine. The bloc's silence on these issues further distances it from the legacy of Bandung, which was <url normalizedValue=\"https://africasacountry.com/2023/09/reimagining-non-alignment\">rooted in anti-imperial solidarity and moral clarity.</url></p><p>Perhaps it is time to ask a more provocative question: Should we wait for states to revive the Bandung legacy, or has the mantle already shifted to grassroots movements, academic networks, and local struggles? From climate justice campaigns in Nairobi to feminist mobilizations in Buenos Aires, the postcolonial internationalism of the 21st century may no longer rely on elite summits. If BRICS is serious about honoring its southern identity, it must choose: replicate the hierarchies it once sought to dismantle\u2014or rediscover the radical hope of Bandung through action, not symbolism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ATOM12254601K0F1P4RBMA4W3MNAFKQ587FS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G95-5F83-RSCP-71W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

As the largest customers on the grid, tell utilities you need an affordable and reliable decarbonized grid that benefits all customers.</p><p>Power-hungry data centers used for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are rapidly increasing the projected demand for electricity throughout the country. In response, electric utilities are doubling down on dirty fuels, delaying retirements of coal plants and rushing to build new gas plants to meet the anticipated demand.</p><p>The Sierra Club released its Demanding Better framework in September 2024, detailing how tech companies and other electric sector stakeholders can decarbonize the grid while powering data centers. In the interim six months, the pace of data center proposals has increased dramatically.</p><p>Organizations signing the letter include Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen, and the Sierra Club.</p><p>Statement from Jeremy Fisher, Principal Advisor on Climate and Energy for the Sierra Club and Demanding Better co-author:</p><p>\"Tech companies shortchanging their climate commitments for the sake of data center market dominance is a betrayal of the ingenuity and vision that's driven American innovation. We need bold, clear-throated leadership from these influential tech CEOs who know that our economy and wellbeing are inextricably linked to a livable climate. All tech companies must be held accountable for where their data centers go, and those data centers must be powered by local, new clean energy.\"</p><p>Statement from Eliza Pan, spokesperson for Amazon Employees for Climate Justice:</p><p>\"We've heard from so many Amazon tech workers that they're tired and fed up with their leadership lying to them and to the public. To simultaneously have new fracked gas plants built to power their AI data centers while claiming they're a corporate leader in renewable energy-the hypocrisy is astounding. Amazon's been using creative accounting to mislead the public about its emissions for years, and now, with how much leadership is pouring into developing AI and building out AI data centers, the problem is only going to get much worse.\"</p><p>Statement from Lashelle Johnson, LCV's Senior Director, State Climate &amp; Equity Policy:</p><p>\"Everyday people are going to pay for Big Tech's unchecked expansion - both on higher utility bills and more pollution. If these tech CEOs don't keep their commitments, step up, and lead on climate like they said they would, they risk responsibility for irreparable harm to people and the planet. Wind, solar, and batteries are the cleanest, cheapest and fastest sources of power and our grids need more, not less, to keep prices and pollution down.\"</p><p>Statement from Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director for Public Citizen:</p><p>\"Big Tech and data center developers are among the most profitable corporations in the world, with the largest seven tech companies holding about $13 trillion in market capitalization. These companies have the financial resources to ensure that investments in communities prioritize zero-emission, sustainable energy solutions that will not only protect public health and water resources, but ensure affordable energy for consumers.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2025/06/full-page-open-letter-calls-amazon-google-meta-and-microsoft-stop-fueling\">https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2025/06/full-page-open-letter-calls-amazon-google-meta-and-microsoft-stop-fueling</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T83-SS-FR-9323344 T83-SS-FR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9323344</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G5F-1903-S04R-D1DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><timeReceived>10:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 30, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The project, formally known as Manhattan Greenway Harlem River, includes a reconstructed seawall, new pathways for pedestrians and bikes, as well as a brand-new seven-block waterfront park funded in part by $43 million from the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"New York State is investing in Harlem and other neighborhoods across the city with support from the $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act, connecting communities to the waterfront while also making these areas more resilient and sustainable,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Last week's severe flooding and resulting State of Emergency declaration are reminders that extreme weather is no longer a rare occurrence it's our new reality. This project comes at a critical time as we double down on building climate resilience, protecting vulnerable areas, and expanding access to safe and healthy outdoor spaces.\"</p><p>Part of the broader Manhattan Waterfront Greenway initiative to create a 32.5-mile ring of green space around the island of Manhattan, the $309 million Harlem River project is a New York City-led effort to reshape Harlem's shoreline. The Greenway will provide essential climate-friendly transportation, filling critical gaps that connect to the Empire State Trail through a landscaped corridor designed to absorb and retain rainfall, sensitively manage stormwater, and mitigate future flood events.</p><p>New York State is contributing $43 million in funding from the Environmental Bond Act, administered by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), to address climate vulnerability in a disadvantaged community by elevating the shoreline to reduce risks from sea level rise and intense storms, while also expanding waterfront access for East Harlem. The site will be elevated approximately two feet to an elevation of 11 feet, helping provide protection from sea level rise to 2080 projections. The new park will add hundreds of trees and shrubs, and two acres of lawns, helping to reduce urban heat island impacts in East Harlem and absorbing and retaining stormwater.</p><p>Additional project features include passive lawns, seating, fitness areas, a playground, public art, and community spaces for a neighborhood with some of the highest population vulnerabilities and environmental burdens in the state.</p><p>The project is a collaboration between New York City Economic Development Corporation, New York City Parks, and many other agencies, including New York City Department of Environmental Protection's integration of necessary storm sewer upgrades within the project area to help manage stormwater and reduce flood risk for the neighborhood.</p><p>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, \"New York State's Environmental Bond Act investment in the Manhattan Greenway is a textbook example of how Governor Hochul is centering equity and advancing climate resilience in careful consideration of specific community needs and vulnerabilities, here in the city and across the state. DEC's $43 million commitment to the Harlem River Greenway will help address climate vulnerabilities and disparities in one of the nation's most disadvantaged communities by elevating the shoreline to reduce risks from climate change-driven sea level rise and intense storms, while connecting East Harlem residents with expanded waterfront access. I am thrilled to see progress underway to connect local residents with the waterfront and new opportunities to get outside and enjoy Manhattan.\"</p><p>New York City Parks Commissioner Iris-Rodriguez Rosa said, \"We're so grateful for the State for their support in championing this investment in new open space and resiliency improvements along the East River. Construction is already underway on Manhattan Greenway Harlem River and we look forward to providing more updates to the community as the project progresses.\"</p><p>New York City Economic Development Corporation President and CEO Andrew Kimball said, \"This is a major step forward to completing the Manhattan Greenway Harlem River project from 125th-132nd Street that will connect the East Harlem community back to the waterfront and build a more equitable and greener New York City. NYCEDC, alongside our State and local partners, is committed to expanding New York City's already robust greenways system, working to close critical gaps in the system in order to build a more sustainable, resilient, and interconnected future for New York City.\"</p><p>State Senator Robert Jackson said, \"The Harlem River has long been a dividing linebetween access and exclusion, between concrete and canopy. But this $43 million investment begins to rewrite that legacy. Through the Environmental Bond Act, we are not just building a greenwaywe are repairing environmental harm and reclaiming what our communities were denied for generations. We are transforming a scarred shoreline into a living corridor of resilience and equity, reconnecting East Harlem to its rightful riverfront. I commend Governor Hochul for her partnership in helping to advance this vision and for recognizing that environmental justice demands bold, targeted investments. This is what justice looks like in actionpublic space, clean air, and climate infrastructure rooted in dignity and democracy. Because everyone has a right to clean air and clean water.\"</p><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare said, \"This project represents the best of both worldsstrengthening the connection between our community and the Harlem River Waterfront while simultaneously building in resilience and environmental protections. This type of endeavor should be replicated all throughout Northern Manhattan, both East and West. I commend Governor Hochul for smartly prioritizing this initiative.\"</p><p>Assemblymember Jordan J.G. Wright of Harlem said, \"From Hurricane Sandy to the recent heat waves that New Yorkers have endured so far this summer, we know that extreme weather is the new normal. Protecting Harlem and its residents from potential flooding and other types of erratic weather, while also bringing new access to our local waterfront, is smart use of the Environmental Bond Act funding. The Harlem River Greenway Project creates jobs, brings more open space and riverfront activities to the community, and is a powerful step towards achieving environmental justice. Neighborhoods like Harlem deserve the protection of a newly designed seawall as well as greater access to the waterfront and all that it has to offer residents and businesses alike. I commend Governor Hochul for spearheading this important effort which will improve the quality of life for the people of Harlem and beyond.\"</p><p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"I am thrilled that New York State is investing in the Harlem River Greenway. This funding is an investment in climate equity that will provide the East Harlem community with much-needed new park space, bike and pedestrian paths, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Completing the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway has long been one of my top priorities and I am glad to see the State partner with the City to move toward that goal. Thank you to Governor Hochul for this important State investment in our borough.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"This investment in the Harlem River Greenway marks a turning point. For too long, our community has been cut off from its own waterfront, a barrier not only to recreation and green space, but to resilience in the face of climate change. With this $43 million commitment from the Environmental Bond Act, Governor Kathy Hochul is helping to reconnect Harlem residents to the river, while building a stronger, safer, and more sustainable shoreline. This project is about equity, climate justice, and investing in the health and well-being of Harlem families. I'm proud to stand with our partners in government as we finally bring this long-overdue transformation to life.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Carmen De La Rosa said, \"For environmental justice communities like Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, investments in climate resiliency are not only necessary, they are urgent. As weeks of heavy rainfall flood our subways, our apartments, and our parks, it is communities like mine that feel the impacts the most. We look forward to the investments in Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill from the $43M Environmental Bond Act, and thank Governor Hochul for addressing the dire need for infrastructural improvements and climate change preparedness.\"</p><p>The project builds on Governor Hochul's efforts to encourage affordable outdoor recreation. The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget includes $200 million for State Parks to invest in and aid the ongoing transformation of New York's flagship parks and support critical infrastructure projects throughout the park system. The Governor's new Unplug and Play initiative also earmarks $100 million for construction and renovation of community centers through the Build Recreational Infrastructure for Communities, Kids and Seniors (NY BRICKS), $67.5 million for the Places for Learning, Activity and Youth Socialization (NY PLAYS) initiative helping New York communities construct new playgrounds and renovate existing playgrounds; and an additional $90 million for the continuation of the NY SWIMS initiative.</p><p>New York's Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act</p><p>On Nov. 8, 2022, New York voters overwhelmingly approved the $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act. State agencies, local governments, and partners will be able to access funding to protect water quality, help communities adapt to climate change, improve resiliency, and create green jobs. Bond Act funding will support new and expanded projects across the state to safeguard drinking water sources, reduce pollution, and protect communities and natural resources from climate change.

Kathy Hochul, D-New York, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Hochul Announces $43 Million in Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act Funding for Harlem River Greenway and Climate Resiliency</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">*</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Kathy Hochul today announced funding to advance construction of major elements of the Manhattan Greenway's Harlem River section to help connect neighborhood residents to the waterfront and bolster protections from extreme weather and sea level rise. The project, formally known as Manhattan Greenway Harlem River, includes a reconstructed seawall, new pathways for pedestrians and bikes, as well as a brand-new seven-block waterfront park funded in part by $43 million from the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"New York State is investing in Harlem and other neighborhoods across the city with support from the $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act, connecting communities to the waterfront while also making these areas more resilient and sustainable,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Last week's severe flooding and resulting State of Emergency declaration are reminders that extreme weather is no longer a rare occurrence -- it's our new reality. This project comes at a critical time as we double down on building climate resilience, protecting vulnerable areas, and expanding access to safe and healthy outdoor spaces.\"</p><p>Part of the broader Manhattan Waterfront Greenway initiative to create a 32.5-mile ring of green space around the island of Manhattan, the $309 million Harlem River project is a New York City-led effort to reshape Harlem's shoreline. The Greenway will provide essential climate-friendly transportation, filling critical gaps that connect to the Empire State Trail through a landscaped corridor designed to absorb and retain rainfall, sensitively manage stormwater, and mitigate future flood events.</p><p>New York State is contributing $43 million in funding from the Environmental Bond Act, administered by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), to address climate vulnerability in a disadvantaged community by elevating the shoreline to reduce risks from sea level rise and intense storms, while also expanding waterfront access for East Harlem. The site will be elevated approximately two feet to an elevation of 11 feet, helping provide protection from sea level rise to 2080 projections. The new park will add hundreds of trees and shrubs, and two acres of lawns, helping to reduce urban heat island impacts in East Harlem and absorbing and retaining stormwater.</p><p>Additional project features include passive lawns, seating, fitness areas, a playground, public art, and community spaces for a neighborhood with some of the highest population vulnerabilities and environmental burdens in the state.</p><p>The project is a collaboration between New York City Economic Development Corporation, New York City Parks, and many other agencies, including New York City Department of Environmental Protection's integration of necessary storm sewer upgrades within the project area to help manage stormwater and reduce flood risk for the neighborhood.</p><p>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, \"New York State's Environmental Bond Act investment in the Manhattan Greenway is a textbook example of how Governor Hochul is centering equity and advancing climate resilience in careful consideration of specific community needs and vulnerabilities, here in the city and across the state. DEC's $43 million commitment to the Harlem River Greenway will help address climate vulnerabilities and disparities in one of the nation's most disadvantaged communities by elevating the shoreline to reduce risks from climate change-driven sea level rise and intense storms, while connecting East Harlem residents with expanded waterfront access. I am thrilled to see progress underway to connect local residents with the waterfront and new opportunities to get outside and enjoy Manhattan.\"</p><p>New York City Parks Commissioner Iris-Rodriguez Rosa said, \"We're so grateful for the State for their support in championing this investment in new open space and resiliency improvements along the East River. Construction is already underway on Manhattan Greenway Harlem River and we look forward to providing more updates to the community as the project progresses.\"</p><p>New York City Economic Development Corporation President &amp; CEO Andrew Kimball said, \"This is a major step forward to completing the Manhattan Greenway Harlem River project from 125th-132nd Street that will connect the East Harlem community back to the waterfront and build a more equitable and greener New York City. NYCEDC, alongside our State and local partners, is committed to expanding New York City's already robust greenways system, working to close critical gaps in the system in order to build a more sustainable, resilient, and interconnected future for New York City.\"</p><p>State Senator Robert Jackson said, \"The Harlem River has long been a dividing line--between access and exclusion, between concrete and canopy. But this $43 million investment begins to rewrite that legacy. Through the Environmental Bond Act, we are not just building a greenway--we are repairing environmental harm and reclaiming what our communities were denied for generations. We are transforming a scarred shoreline into a living corridor of resilience and equity, reconnecting East Harlem to its rightful riverfront. I commend Governor Hochul for her partnership in helping to advance this vision and for recognizing that environmental justice demands bold, targeted investments. This is what justice looks like in action--public space, clean air, and climate infrastructure rooted in dignity and democracy. Because everyone has a right to clean air and clean water.\"</p><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare said, \"This project represents the best of both worlds--strengthening the connection between our community and the Harlem River Waterfront while simultaneously building in resilience and environmental protections. This type of endeavor should be replicated all throughout Northern Manhattan, both East and West. I commend Governor Hochul for smartly prioritizing this initiative.\"</p><p>Assemblymember Jordan J.G. Wright of Harlem said, \"From Hurricane Sandy to the recent heat waves that New Yorkers have endured so far this summer, we know that extreme weather is the new normal. Protecting Harlem and its residents from potential flooding and other types of erratic weather, while also bringing new access to our local waterfront, is smart use of the Environmental Bond Act funding. The Harlem River Greenway Project creates jobs, brings more open space and riverfront activities to the community, and is a powerful step towards achieving environmental justice. Neighborhoods like Harlem deserve the protection of a newly designed seawall as well as greater access to the waterfront and all that it has to offer residents and businesses alike. I commend Governor Hochul for spearheading this important effort which will improve the quality of life for the people of Harlem and beyond.\"</p><p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"I am thrilled that New York State is investing in the Harlem River Greenway. This funding is an investment in climate equity that will provide the East Harlem community with much-needed new park space, bike and pedestrian paths, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Completing the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway has long been one of my top priorities and I am glad to see the State partner with the City to move toward that goal. Thank you to Governor Hochul for this important State investment in our borough.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"This investment in the Harlem River Greenway marks a turning point. For too long, our community has been cut off from its own waterfront, a barrier not only to recreation and green space, but to resilience in the face of climate change. With this $43 million commitment from the Environmental Bond Act, Governor Kathy Hochul is helping to reconnect Harlem residents to the river, while building a stronger, safer, and more sustainable shoreline. This project is about equity, climate justice, and investing in the health and well-being of Harlem families. I'm proud to stand with our partners in government as we finally bring this long-overdue transformation to life.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Carmen De La Rosa said, \"For environmental justice communities like Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, investments in climate resiliency are not only necessary, they are urgent. As weeks of heavy rainfall flood our subways, our apartments, and our parks, it is communities like mine that feel the impacts the most. We look forward to the investments in Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill from the $43M Environmental Bond Act, and thank Governor Hochul for addressing the dire need for infrastructural improvements and climate change preparedness.\"</p><p>The project builds on Governor Hochul's efforts to encourage affordable outdoor recreation. The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget includes $200 million for State Parks to invest in and aid the ongoing transformation of New York's flagship parks and support critical infrastructure projects throughout the park system. The Governor's new Unplug and Play initiative also earmarks $100 million for construction and renovation of community centers through the Build Recreational Infrastructure for Communities, Kids and Seniors (NY BRICKS), $67.5 million for the Places for Learning, Activity and Youth Socialization (NY PLAYS) initiative helping New York communities construct new playgrounds and renovate existing playgrounds; and an additional $90 million for the continuation of the NY SWIMS initiative.</p><p>New York's Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act</p><p>On Nov. 8, 2022, New York voters overwhelmingly approved the $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act. State agencies, local governments, and partners will be able to access funding to protect water quality, help communities adapt to climate change, improve resiliency, and create green jobs. Bond Act funding will support new and expanded projects across the state to safeguard drinking water sources, reduce pollution, and protect communities and natural resources from climate change. Progress on implementing funding continues, with New York State awarding approximately $1.8 billion, or 25 percent, of Bond Act funds to date.</p><p>This Harlem River project is the latest step in Bond Act investments to enhance shoreline resiliency, encourage economic development, revitalize neighborhoods, and bolster recreational opportunities. In April, the Governor announced $60 million in Environmental Bond Act funding is available now for Green Resiliency Grants to support vital stormwater management and resilient infrastructure projects in flood-prone communities across New York State. Applications for this program are due by Aug. 15, 2025.

This initiative provides up to $3,000 in grant funding to local organizations working on innovative solutions to food justice, climate equity, and community resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FACE Grants program builds on previous grant opportunities held separately by the Offices of Sustainability and Resilience, awarding a total of $150,000 to 51 projects in 2023. Recognizing the interconnected nature of food justice, climate equity, and resilience, the offices collaborated in 2024 to combine grant programs, simplifying the application process for community leaders seeking support for their initiatives.</p><p>We are thrilled to see such a strong response from the community and to support these impactful projects, said Zach Baumer, the City of Austins Chief Sustainability Officer. The FACE Grants program showcases our commitment to fostering grassroots solutions that address climate change and increase equity in our community.</p><p>The 50 projects span a diverse range of initiatives, from urban farming and sustainable food systems to climate resilience planning and educational programs. These projects are a testament to the creativity and dedication of Austins community leaders in addressing the citys most pressing challenges.</p><p>The FACE Grants program was designed to support projects that address systemic and structural inequities, with a focus on empowering communities that have been historically marginalized. By funding these innovative projects, the City of Austin aims to create a more just, equitable, and resilient future for all Austinites.</p><p>\"In past years, we've hosted our annual event to feed 300-500 families in need. Thanks to the FACE grant, we are now able to feed 1,000 families for our annual event, said Ebonie D. Trice, CEO and Founder of Mission Accomplished.</p><p>This grant will allow us to add additional air purifiers to the library and increase our ability to respond to demand for larger community events, expand organizational capacity, meet community requests for face masks, and assist with transporting air purifiers to events, said KD Drackert, Founder of Clear the Air ATX. Beyond the material elements, this will allow us to continue working to build community connectedness and address gaps in our public health infrastructure.</p><p>List of Funded Organizations</p><p>A GOLDEN DEED</p><p>Alliance for African American Health in Central Texas</p><p>ATX Villages Helping One Another</p><p>Austin Vietnamese American Medical Professional Society (AVAMPS)</p><p>Austin Youth River Watch</p><p>Be The Neighbor</p><p>Building Promise USA</p><p>Central Texas Bioregional Learning Center</p><p>Central Texas Mycological Society</p><p>Clear the Air ATX</p><p>Color of Coffee Collective</p><p>Dove Springs Proud</p><p>Eco-Conscious Music Alliance</p><p>Festival Beach Food Forest</p><p>Forklift Danceworks</p><p>Friends of Grand Meadow Community Garden and Food Forest</p><p>Good Work Austin</p><p>Great Promise for American Indians</p><p>Green Corn Project</p><p>Heartening</p><p>Hearts2Heal</p><p>Imagine Art</p><p>Interfaith Action of Central Texas</p><p>Kalpulli Texas Quetzalcoatl</p><p>Keep Austin Neighborly</p><p>L'Oca d'Oro</p><p>Latinas Empoderadas en el Hogar</p><p>Life Changers</p><p>Luz de Atabey Midwifery Project</p><p>Mission Accomplished</p><p>More than Welcome</p><p>The Refugee Collective</p><p>Overton Elementary</p><p>People Organized in Defense of Earth and her Resources (PODER)</p><p>Rosewood Housing Cooperative</p><p>SAIVA</p><p>Sana Yoga</p><p>Sunday Lunchbox</p><p>Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center</p><p>Teen Mom Tender Start</p><p>The Charlie Center</p><p>The Children's Haven Association</p><p>The Healing Project</p><p>The Museum of Human Achievement</p><p>Tree Amigos</p><p>TreeFolks</p><p>Trinity Center</p><p>We Can Now</p><p>Whitehall Cooperative</p><p>WorkingGroup512 [WG512]</p><p>Organizations will begin work on their projects and have until June 1, 2025, to complete them.

Browner will remain on the board of LCV Education Fund.</p><p>\"It's been a profound privilege to serve as Board Chair for LCV and LCVEF,\" said Browner. \"As an organization and as a movement we have made significant strides in working to end environmental injustice, clean up our air and water, and tackle the climate crisis. The LCV team is among the best in the business in advancing strong and durable environmental policy and electing the leaders we need to meet the moment. I look forward to continuing my service on the board of LCVEF and working alongside Roger to drive to take back our democracy and keep making progress against the climate crisis.\"</p><p>\"Carol guided LCV and LCVEF through an incredible decade of growth and impact and we are grateful for her continued leadership,\" said Kim. \"I'm honored to take on this role. In the face of the Trump administration's dangerous assaults on clean energy, basic environmental protections, and our democracy, LCV's work has never been more important. We will build grassroots power and fight back against anyone who is worsening the climate crisis, endangering our health and environment, and threatening our democracy. The urgency of this moment calls for strong leadership and I am proud to take on the challenge as Board Chair.\"</p><p>\"We are so incredibly grateful for Carol's leadership and wisdom,\" said Pete Maysmith, President of LCV and LCV Education Fund. \"Her time as chair has been a period of massive growth for our organizations and the broader state affiliate network, the Conservation Voter Movement, and saw some of our biggest accomplishments, including passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.\"</p><p>\"We are thrilled to welcome Roger as our new Board Chair,\" continued Maysmith. \"His deep understanding of policy and movement politics, along with his lifelong commitment to tackling the climate crisis make him an ideal fit to guide our boards forward. I look forward to collaborating with Roger for years to come.\"</p><p>Kim was formerly the Founder and CEO of the Climate and Clean Energy Equity Fund and the Climate Equity Action Fund. He has also served as Senior Advisor to the Mayor of San Francisco and as Executive Director of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127181680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G18-2GG3-RT92-S3R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 10, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Berkeley, California, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Low-cost sensors (LCSs) emerge as a popular tool for urban micro-climate studies by offering dense observational coverage.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Science Foundation; The Katherine And James Lau Foundation For Climate Equity And Environmental Justice in The Built Environment. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of California: \"This study evaluates the performance of PurpleAir (PA) sensors for ambient temperature monitoring-a key but underexplored aspect of their use. While widely used for particulate matter, PA sensors' temperature data remain underutilized and lack thorough validation. For the first time, this research evaluates their accuracy by comparing PA temperature measurements with collocated high-precision temperature data loggers across a dense urban network in a humid subtropical U.S. county. Results show a moderate correlation with reference data ( r = 0.86) but an average overestimation of 3.77 \u00b0C, indicating PA sensors are better suited for identifying temperature trends but not for precise applications like extreme heat events. We also developed and compared eight calibration methods to create a replicable model using readily available crowdsourced data. The best-performing model reduced RMSE and MAE by 51% and 47%, respectively, and achieved an R <sup>2</sup> of 0.89 compared to the uncalibrated scenario.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Finally, the practical application of PA temperature data for identifying heat wave events was investigated, including an assessment of associated uncertainties. In sum, this work provides a crucial evaluation of PA's temperature monitoring capabilities, offering a pathway for improved heat mapping, multi-hazard vulnerability assessments, and public health interventions in the development of climate-resilient cities.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluating PurpleAir Sensors: Do They Accurately Reflect Ambient Air Temperature?.

Citing concerns about conflicts of interest and lack of oversight, EPA terminated the grants in March 2025. The grantees sued, and the district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering EPA and Citibank to continue funding the grants.We conclude the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, and therefore jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we vacate the injunction. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 3 of 924I.This case involves EPA grants awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, for which Congress appropriated $27 billion. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-169, \u00a7 60103, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065 \u2013 67 (formerly codified at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (2024)). In August 2024, EPA awarded $20 billion to eight nonprofits pursuant to two of the grant programs it created: the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. Five of those grantees are plaintiffs in this case: Climate United Fund ($6.97 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Power Forward Communities, Inc. ($2 billion), Inclusiv, Inc. ($1.87 billion), and Justice Climate Fund, Inc. ($940 million).Each grant was memorialized in an agreement between the nonprofit and EPA. The grant agreements have an unusual structure. Typically, grant funds are held by the U.S Treasury and disbursed incrementally as grantees use the funds for program purposes. EPA structured these grants with a middleman that would hold the funds as a \u201cfinancial agent\u201d of the United States. According to EPA, this was the first time the federal government used a financial agent, as opposed to Treasury, to carry out this kind of grant program. Treasury entered a Financial Agency Agreement (\u201cFAA\u201d) with Citibank. As set forth in the grant agreements, the funds were to be transferred from Treasury to Citibank in a \u201ctwo-step transaction\u201d involving a \u201cdrawdown\u201d by the grantee and a subsequent \u201cdisbursement\u201d to the appropriate Citibank account. J.A 566. The disbursement by the grantee is deemed \u201can allowable cost\u201d under \u201cthe EPA award. \u201d Id.Although the funds are held at Citibank, the grantees \u2019 use of the funds remains highly restricted. The money may be used only \u201cfor the purposes and under the conditions of the [grant USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 4 of 925agreement],\u201d and \u201cmust be maintained\u201d at Citibank until the end of the grant \u2019 s period of performance. J.A 568. The grantees \u2019 use of the funds is further restricted by Account Control Agreements (\u201cACAs\u201d) between EPA, Citibank, and each of the grantees. The ACAs give the government a \u201cright to exclusive control\u201d over the Citibank accounts. J.A 72. If the government exercises that right, Citibank must follow the government \u2019 s transfer instructions \u201cwithout further consent by the [grantee]. \u201d Id. The ACAs expressly acknowledge that Citibank \u201cact[s] as a financial agent of the United States pursuant to the authority of the U.S Department of the Treasury. \u201d J.A 71.The sheer scale of the grant program and the method of allocating billions of dollars drew public attention and criticism. The record includes a widely publicized video in which an EPA employee was recorded describing how \u201cuntil recently\u201d his role was to make sure proper \u201cprocesses are in place to \u2026 prevent fraud and to prevent abuse,\u201d but after the election of President Donald Trump, EPA was \u201cjust trying to get the money out as fast as possible before they come in and \u2026 stop it all. \u201d J.A 705 n.1 The employee compared the situation to \u201cthrowing gold bars off the Titanic. \u201dThe month before President Trump \u2019 s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements\u2014with no apparent consideration from the grantees\u2014to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.1 The week before the1 In December 2024, the government unilaterally modified the grant agreements, including by (1) eliminating any reference to termination for agency priorities; (2) requiring \u201ccredible evidence \u2026 of a violation of Federal criminal law\u201d before the government could exercise its contractual right to terminate for waste, fraud, or abuse; and (3) giving the grantees an expanded right USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 5 of 926inauguration, EPA amended the ACAs to require Citibank to \u201ccontinue to disburse funds\u201d to the grantees, even if the government exercised its right of exclusive control, if the funds are \u201cassociated with financial obligations \u2018properly incurred \u2019 \u201d before the government exercised its right. J.A 658.After the change in administration, EPA reviewed the grants and raised concerns about conflicts of interest during the award process, the political connections of the chosen grantees, lack of government oversight and control over tens of billions of dollars, and last-minute amendments to the grant agreements and ACAs.2 In February 2025, the FBI recommended to Citibank that it \u201cplace an administrative freeze on the account(s) associated with\u201d the grantees \u2019 ACAs. As the government \u2019 s financial agent, Citibank complied and stopped disbursing funds to the grantees. EPA also referred the matter to the Office of Inspector General for investigation. Shortly thereafter, EPA terminated the grant agreements.The grantees sued, seeking to enjoin the terminations as unconstitutional, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious. They sought a preliminary injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank toto cure any nonperformance. There is no serious dispute that these modifications increased the likelihood that a termination by the incoming administration would constitute a breach of contract.2 For example, the Acting Deputy Administrator averred in a letter to the EPA Inspector General that \u201cthe former director of the [Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund], personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital \u2013 without recusing himself. \u201d J.A 670. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 6 of 927resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d J.A 171 \u2013 72.The district court entered the injunction. It first held that it had jurisdiction because the grantees \u2019 claims were not essentially contractual and therefore did not need to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A , 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107 \u2013 11 (D.D.C 2025). On the merits, the court concluded the grantees were likely to succeed on their constitutional, regulatory, and arbitrary and capricious claims. The district court found the balance of harms supported an injunction because the nonprofits exist \u201cto fulfill the objectives of a grant\u201d and \u201csufficient protections [are] in place\u201d to prevent \u201creckless spending. \u201d Id. at 117, 120. The district court further concluded that an injunction \u201chalt[ing] any unlawful action\u201d serves the public interest. Id. at 121. The court enjoined Citibank as well, requiring it to disburse funds according to the relevant agreements.We administratively stayed the injunction and ordered the parties to take no action \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d with respect to the disputed funds, thereby prohibiting the grantees from making further commitments in reliance on the disputed funds. We then accelerated consideration of the merits of the appeal.II.While this litigation was pending, Congress enacted legislation repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. See Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 154 (2025) (repealing 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 and rescinding \u201cunobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section\u201d). Our partial administrative stay did not lift the portion of the district court \u2019 s order enjoining the grant terminations, so the funds at issue in this case remain at Citibank and remainUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 7 of 928obligated. Congress \u2019 s repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund therefore did not render this appeal moot.We review the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, its underlying legal conclusions de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 726 (D.C Cir. 2022). We consider the same Winter factors the district court applied, which require a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction to establish that it \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. \u201d Id. at 727 (quoting Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S 7, 20 (2008)).III.The district court erred in concluding the grantees are likely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, and constitutional claims. See Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C Cir. 2014) (describing likelihood of success on the merits as the \u201cmost important factor\u201d when considering a preliminary injunction). The grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims, and their constitutional claim is meritless.A.The grantees first allege the termination of their grants violated Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) regulations and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). As a remedy, they sought and received an injunction barring the termination of their grants and restoring access to the funds held by Citibank. We conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over these USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 8 of 929claims, which are essentially contractual and therefore must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.31.The federal government enjoys sovereign immunity and may be subject to suit only when it has explicitly waived that immunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S 392, 399 (1976). Waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed to protect the prerogatives of the government and to ensure the courts stay within the jurisdiction provided by Congress. See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S 187, 192 (1996); Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S 682, 703 \u2013 05 (1949). The grantees brought their claims in district court, invoking the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity, which applies to claims \u201cseeking relief other than money damages. \u201d 5 U.S.C \u00a7 702. But this waiver applies only if no \u201cother statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought. \u201d Id. For contract claims against the government, the Tucker Act establishes review in the Court of Federal Claims, which may award only damages and cannot provide3 Although the dissent considers this threshold jurisdictional question a \u201cdiver[sion],\u201d Dissenting Op. 47, our authority to assess the lawfulness of EPA \u2019 s actions of course depends on having jurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 94 (1998). Concluding that jurisdiction over most of these claims lies with the Court of Federal Claims, we do not reach their merits. The dissent inverts this fundamental limitation on Article III courts by recounting at great length the integrity and virtue of the previous administration \u2019 s efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and the alleged misdeeds of the current administration in terminating the grants. Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity of the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Politico.

Sec \u2019 y of Defense, 725 F.2d 107, 112 n.10 (D.C Cir. 1983).When it applies, Tucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and precludes jurisdiction in district court under the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.4 See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C Cir. 1992). The Court of Federal Claims is the \u201csingle, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). Because Congress has limited the forum and the remedies for contract claims against the government, a litigant whose claim is essentially contractual cannot \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act\u201d by simply asking for injunctive relief in district court. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967; Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613 (\u201c[T]he APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d).This jurisdictional inquiry cannot turn on a plaintiff \u2019 s preferred characterization of its claim, lest we \u201cupset the carefully modulated waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of remedies for breach of contract embodied in the Tucker Act. \u201d Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v.

USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 10 of 9211516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[I]n the contract context, a distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign \u2019 s immunity from being compelled to perform obligations it prefers to breach and compensate financially, holding that what are \u2018in essence \u2019 claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the Tucker Act and its prohibition on equitable relief by being artfully pled as something else. \u201d).To determine whether jurisdiction was proper in the district court, we must therefore assess whether the grantees \u2019 claims are essentially contractual. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 \u2013 68. The fact that the grantees \u2019 \u201ccomplaint nowhere mentions breach of contract \u2026 cannot alone suffice to establish jurisdiction in the District Court. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77. Instead, for each claim we consider (1) whether \u201cthe source of the rights\u201d asserted is contractual or is \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds\u201d and (2) whether \u201cthe type of relief sought\u201d is a typical contract remedy. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 \u2013 71; see Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.2.The grantees first allege EPA \u2019 s termination of their agreements violated OMB regulations. By terminating for \u201cagency priorities,\u201d EPA allegedly relied on a basis for termination not set forth in the grant agreements, in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4). Furthermore, EPA allegedly failed to provide written notice of termination as required by 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a). Despite the grantees \u2019 characterization, their claims are essentially contractual and therefore the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear them.First, the source of the grantees \u2019 right to the relief they seek is their agreements, which are contracts for Tucker Act purposes. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) (per curiam); Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp. v. United States,USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 11 of 9212990 F.3d 1330, 1338 \u2013 41 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2231 (2025) (explaining that courts have historically described federal grants as contracts). Each grantee \u2019 s right to the funds arises \u201conly upon creation and satisfaction of its contract with the government; in no sense d[oes] it exist independently of that contract. \u201d Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C Cir. 1985). While the grantees attempt to ground their claims in OMB guidance, the substance of these claims may be understood \u201cas entirely contained within the terms of the contract\u201d or in principles of contract law. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.The claim that EPA violated 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4) expressly refers to and incorporates the grant agreements. The grantees interpret this OMB guidance as prohibiting the government from terminating based on agency priorities unless the grant agreements reserve the right to terminate on those grounds. Even assuming this is what the guidance requires, the grantees \u2019 claim turns on the government \u2019 s rights under the agreements\u2014a question of contract interpretation that the parties fiercely dispute. Because this claim perforce incorporates the grant agreements, it is not based \u201csolely\u201d on the regulation or on \u201ctruly independent legal grounds. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78; Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70.The claim that EPA failed to give proper notice of termination in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a) is not an independent legal ground for a slightly different reason. This allegation \u201ccould be phrased\u201d as a claim that the government stopped performing on the contract without sufficient warning. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. Federal contract law addresses USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 12 of 9213when defective notice by the government is actionable,5 and therefore the substance of the grantees \u2019 claim can be analyzed \u201csolely on contract principles. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. As we have explained, the fact that the government \u2019 s termination of a contract \u201calso arguably violates certain other regulations does not transform the action into one based solely on those regulations. \u201d Id. Indeed, \u201c[i]f the mere allegation\u201d of violations of the regulations governing federal contracting and grantmaking \u201cwere to bring claims of this type within the jurisdiction of the district court, Congress \u2019 intent to limit contract remedies against the government to damages in the [Court of Federal Claims] would be effectively circumvented. \u201d Id. (cleaned up). Because the substance of the grantees \u2019 notice claim sounds in federal contract law, the claim is essentially contractual and can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims. The grantees cannot avoid the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional channeling by disguising a breach of contract claim as a claim that the government violated the regulations governing grantmaking.Furthermore, the guidance documents on which the grantees rely likely do not create enforceable private rights because they merely set out principles for agencies to follow when making grants. See Guidance for Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 \u2013 90 (Apr. 22, 2024). These guidance provisions fall within subtitle A of Title 2, which sets forth OMB \u2019 s \u201cguidance to Federal agencies on5 See, e.g , Decker &amp; Co. v. West, 76 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201c[H]arm should accompany a defect in an otherwise proper termination notice in order for the contractor to seek relief based on that defect. \u201d); Philadelphia Regent Builders v. United States, 634 F.2d 569, 572 \u2013 73 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (declining to treat government \u2019 s termination as defective because government \u2019 s regulatory violations were \u201charmless technical defects\u201d). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 13 of 9214government-wide policies for the award and administration of Federal financial assistance. \u201d 2 C.F.R \u00a7 1.100(a). \u201cPublication of the OMB guidance in the [Code of Federal Regulations] does not change its nature\u2014it is guidance, not regulation. \u201d Id. \u00a7 1.105(b). But in any event, as the dissent concedes, Dissenting Op. 58, these regulatory claims are essentially contractual, and we have no jurisdiction to consider them.Second, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction because the remedy the grantees seek is contractual in nature. The grantees requested an injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants, \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank to resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d The grantees maintain they own the funds and seek an injunction barring unlawful interference, rather than an order for specific performance. But the grantees \u2019 \u201cownership\u201d of the funds goes only as far as the grant agreements and the ACAs permit. And the funds are held by Citibank, which acts as a fiduciary of the government. Despite their characterization, in substance, the grantees are seeking specific performance of their agreements with the government.6 As then-Judge Scalia6 The dissent \u2019 s only legal argument that we have jurisdiction turns on the claim that the grantees have \u201ctitle\u201d to the billions of dollars in government funding. To demonstrate the grantees \u2019 ownership, however, the dissent relies on the grant agreements and the ACAs\u2014that is, on the disputed and ongoing contracts that govern the parties \u2019 relationship. Dissenting Op. 48. The dissent \u2019 s argument merely reinforces that this dispute is contractual and belongs in the Court of Federal Claims. And even assuming the grantees had somehow secured title, that would simply mean the grantees might have a Takings Clause claim for damages, a claim they have not made and which in any event would also have to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. See Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 14 of 9215explained, \u201c[t]he waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] does not run to actions seeking declaratory relief or specific performance in contract cases. \u201d7 Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C Cir. 1986). \u201c[A] complaint involving a request for specific performance must be resolved by the [Court of Federal] Claims. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 80.In sum, the grantees cannot manufacture district court jurisdiction through artful pleading. Because the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims are essentially contractual, they must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.3.Nor can the grantees repackage their contract claims by invoking the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. The grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims are also essentially2170, 2173 (2019) (explaining the Tucker Act \u201cprovides the standard procedure for bringing [takings] claims\u201d against the federal government and that \u201c[e]quitable relief [is] not available\u201d if \u201cmonetary relief \u2026 under the Tucker Act\u201d is).7 The dissent \u2019 s reliance on Sharp is entirely misplaced. In Sharp, there was no dispute that the plaintiff was a military officer, that he had an interest in his employment, and that the deprivation of that interest without due process could be litigated in district court under Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S 61, 71 (1974). See Sharp, 798 F.2d at 1523. Here, by contrast, the rights and interests of the grantees are disputed. The grantees assert they \u201cperformed\u201d on their contracts when Treasury deposited federal funds at Citibank, the government \u2019 s financial agent. Even overlooking the oddity of this argument, whether the grantees have performed depends entirely on the terms of the disputed contracts\u2014a question that must be adjudicated in the Court of Federal Claims. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 15 of 9216contractual, considering both the source of the legal right asserted and the remedy sought.The grantees assert the government acted arbitrarily because it \u201coffered no facts or individualized reasoning to justify\u201d the grant terminations. And the grantees insist they can challenge the sufficiency of the government \u2019 s reasons for terminating the grants separately from the issue of whether the terminations were allowed under the agreements. But this court has expressly and repeatedly rejected attempts to manufacture district court jurisdiction by framing contract claims as violations of the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580. Despite the grantees \u2019 characterizations, the remedy they seek is specific performance of their contracts, and they have identified no right to that relief that is \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the grant agreements. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970.As already discussed in reference to the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims, the grantees seek to set aside their grant terminations, which means they seek specific performance. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 79 \u2013 80. This is a \u201ctypical contract remedy\u201d that indicates a claim is \u201cfounded upon a contract for purposes of the Tucker Act. \u201d Spectrum Leasing, 764 F.2d at 894 \u2013 95; see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613.The APA \u2019 s substantive bar on arbitrary and capricious action does not give the grantees an independent right to specific performance of their grant agreements. To the extent the grantees argue the government acted arbitrarily by failing to follow the terms of the grant agreements, that argument can be evaluated only by \u201creference to and incorporation of\u201d the agreements. Richardson, 512 F.2d at 578. The source of the right asserted is therefore not \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the contracts. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 16 of 9217To the extent the grantees argue the terminations were arbitrary regardless of whether they were permitted under the agreements, that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law. That law prohibits the government from \u201cdishonor[ing], with impunity, its contractual obligations\u201d even when a contract allows the government to terminate for convenience. Maxima Corp. v. United States, 847 F.2d 1549, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (cleaned up). The grantees \u2019 argument that the termination was arbitrary and capricious is simply a claim that EPA breached the grant agreements by terminating with \u201cimpunity. \u201d That claim must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.The grantees insist the APA gives them an independent right to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract terminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA \u2019 s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court.8 See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (\u201c[D]ecisions made by contracting officers pursuant to contract clauses fall outside the contemplation of the [APA]. \u201d). The APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action did not \u201cdestroy the Court of [Federal] Claims by implication. \u201d Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (cleaned up).8 The dissent \u2019 s analysis focuses on the grantees \u2019 \u201ctheory of relief\u201d and concludes that because the grantees have \u201clegitimate\u201d APA claims and request injunctive relief, the district court has jurisdiction. Dissenting Op. 56 \u2013 57. But Supreme Court and circuit precedent require that we look beyond plaintiffs \u2019 characterization of their claims and determine whether the claims are \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d not simply whether plaintiffs have made good faith legal arguments. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70. On this central question, the dissent has nothing to offer. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 17 of 9218In sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual and fall outside the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.This conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court \u2019 s recent decision in a stay posture that a very similar arbitrary and capricious challenge to federal grant terminations likely could not be brought in district court. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968. In that case, state plaintiffs sued in district court and claimed the Department of Education \u2019 s decision to terminate several grants was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The district court enjoined the terminations. The Court stayed the injunction on the ground that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because \u201cthe Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on \u2018any express or implied contract with the United States. \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491(a)(1)). The Supreme Court has doubled down on this conclusion in another case staying an injunction against discretionary grant terminations: \u201cThe [APA] \u2019 s \u2018limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity \u2019 does not provide the District Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims \u2018based on \u2019 \u201d the plaintiffs \u2019 grants \u201cor to order relief designed to enforce any \u2018obligation to pay money \u2019 pursuant to those grants. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Aug. 21, 2025) (quoting Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968).The Court \u2019 s reasoning requires respect and strongly supports our conclusion that the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious challenge to the grant terminations is a disguised contract claim that cannot be heard in district court. See Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025) (\u201cAlthough our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 18 of 9219court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. \u201d); Priests for Life v. HHS, 808 F.3d 1, 25 (D.C Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that Supreme Court stay orders are \u201cextremely strong signals\u201d); see generally Trevor N.

Pol \u2019 y 827, 831 (2021) (arguing some emergency orders are \u201cauthoritative with respect to future cases considering the same legal questions\u201d).In the face of this overwhelming authority, the grantees nonetheless maintain that jurisdiction over their arbitrary and capricious claims is proper. But the two cases on which they rely cannot support that conclusion.The grantees point out that this court reviewed an agency \u2019 s grant termination under the APA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious standard in Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 923 F.2d 188, 193 (D.C Cir. 1991). But the court in that case made no mention of the Tucker Act, nor did it engage with our decisions in Richardson and Ingersoll-Rand. This drive-by jurisdictional holding does not bind us. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 91 (1998). Just one year later, we extensively considered the jurisdictional framework and \u201cdecline[d] to overrule this Court \u2019 s very specific holdings that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613. As the Supreme Court \u2019 s stay order in Department of Education confirms, Kansas City is an outlier and does not support district court jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims.Second, the grantees point to Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, which held that a state agency could maintain an USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 19 of 9220arbitrary and capricious claim in district court to challenge the federal government \u2019 s withholding of grant funds. 763 F.2d 1441, 1451, 1453 (D.C Cir. 1985). In that case, the federal government was required by law to pay block grant funds to Maryland according to a statutory formula. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1397a(a) \u2013 (b), 1397b(b) (1982). We explained that Maryland \u2019 s claim was not contractual for purposes of the Tucker Act because it \u201cturn[ed] on the interpretation of statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the parties. \u201d Maryland, 763 F.2d at 1449. There was no \u201ccontract within the meaning of the Tucker Act\u201d\u2014only statutes and regulations that dictated how much Maryland was entitled to receive, how the funds could be spent, and under what circumstances the federal government could withhold payment. Id.By contrast, these grant agreements are \u201ccontracts\u201d within the meaning of the Tucker Act because they include the traditional contract elements of offer, acceptance, and consideration. See, e.g , Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp., 990 F.3d at 1338 \u2013 41. The grantees do not suggest that any of these elements is lacking. Moreover, the Inflation Reduction Act did not specify who was to receive money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or in what amount. Those determinations were to be made \u201con a competitive basis\u201d at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees obtained federal funds only because they were awarded discretionary EPA grants, the terms of which are governed by the grant agreements. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *4 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that Department of Education \u201ccontrols\u201d when a district court seeks to remedy \u201cthe government \u2019 s denial of previously awarded discretionary grants\u201d). The dispute over the termination of these agreements does not turn solely, or USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 20 of 9221really at all, on the statute, and the relief sought is continued performance of the agreements.In short, the grantees cannot circumvent the Court of Federal Claims by arguing that EPA \u2019 s termination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.4.Finally, the grantees cannot bring their regulatory or arbitrary and capricious claims in district court by arguing that the EPA Administrator acted ultra vires. The grantees invoke the Larson-Dugan doctrine, which, like the Ex parte Young exception to state sovereign immunity, holds that sovereign immunity does not bar suits against federal officers whose \u201cpowers are limited by statute\u201d and whose actions go \u201cbeyond those limitations\u201d or are \u201cconstitutionally void. \u201d Larson, 337 U.S at 689, 701 \u2013 02; see also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S 609, 621 \u2013 23 (1963). The grantees insist Administrator Zeldin exceeded his lawful authority by terminating the agreements in violation of the OMB guidance provisions and the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. We disagree.The Supreme Court in Larson recognized that the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity does not apply to contract claims: \u201cThe Government, as representative of the community as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any plaintiff who presents a disputed question of property or contract right. \u201d 337 U.S at 704. As already explained, the grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims essentially allege the government (1) violated the terms of the grant agreements and (2) acted with impunity. If proven, these claims establish breach of contract. They do not establish that the government (or any official) acted in excess of statutory limits or in contravention of the Constitution, as is required toUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 21 of 9222invoke the Larson-Dugan exception.9 See Larson, 337 U.S at 695 (squarely rejecting the contention that \u201can officer given the power to make decisions\u201d only has sovereign immunity when he \u201cmake[s] correct decisions\u201d).The grantees cannot bootstrap district court jurisdiction through the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity because their regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims are essentially contractual.B.The grantees also maintain that EPA violated the \u201cSeparation of Powers\u201d by not enforcing the Inflation Reduction Act, citing In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C Cir. 2013). The grantees contend that Congress directed how and when the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund appropriations were to be spent and that EPA violated those directives by canceling the grant agreements. Although the district court had jurisdiction over this claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the merits.As an initial matter, this is not a constitutional claim at all, but rather a claim that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction Act. Claims that agency officials acted in excess of their statutory authority do not ipso facto allege violations of the \u201cSeparation of Powers. \u201d See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S 462,9 This is consistent with the general principle that \u201c[i]t is not illegal for a party to breach a contract. \u201d United States v. Blankenship, 382 F.3d 1110, 1133 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it[]\u2014and nothing else. \u201d United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S 839, 919 \u2013 20 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Holmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in 3 The Collected Works of Justice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick ed. 1995)). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 22 of 9223474 (1994) (distinguishing between \u201cclaims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other\u201d); cf. 5 U.S.C \u00a7 706(2) (distinguishing judicial review of agency action \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity\u201d and action \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations\u201d). As we recently explained, when a \u201csupposed separation-of-powers violation turns entirely on whether [executive] officials violated the governing statutes, \u2026 Dalton requires us to analyze the claim as an ultra vires one. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *19 \u2013 20 (D.C Cir. Aug. 15, 2025); see also Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2326021, at *6 \u2013 9 (D.C Cir. Aug. 13, 2025). The grantees here allege violations of the statute, not the Constitution, and we decline to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim.We conclude EPA did not violate the Inflation Reduction Act when it terminated these grants. The grantees have identified no statutory provision that barred the cancellation of the grants. In relevant part, the Inflation Reduction Act \u201cappropriated to the Administrator\u201d $20 billion \u201cto make grants[] on a competitive basis\u201d and provided that the funds are \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees interpret these provisions as a mandate that EPA spend the full $20 billion, a mandate that EPA allegedly violated when it cancelled grants after the September 2024 appropriation deadline. But even assuming the statute required EPA to obligate all $20 billion by the appropriation deadline, EPA did so. EPA later cancelled the grants, but the Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants. And EPA repeatedly represented that it planned to recommit the funds. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 23 of 9224The grantees and the dissent insist EPA \u2019 s promise to recommit the funds was hollow because the Inflation Reduction Act appropriation had lapsed by the time EPA terminated the grants, and therefore EPA had no ability to recommit the funds. But the grantees cite no authority for the proposition that when an agency cancels a grant after an appropriation has lapsed, any recommitment of those funds requires deobligation and a new appropriation by Congress. Indeed, such a categorical rule would be inconsistent with the longstanding position of the Government Accountability Office\u2014a legislative agency\u2014that the Executive Branch may issue replacement contracts even after an appropriation has lapsed. See Funding of Replacement Contracts, 68 Comp. Gen. 158, 158 (Dec. 19, 1988); see also 31 U.S.C \u00a7 1552(a) (providing that appropriation account does not close until five years after an appropriation expires).In fact, the Executive often issues replacement contracts after terminating for convenience, a practice the Comptroller General has approved for decades.10 See U.S General Accounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 3d ed., vol. 1, 5-28 \u2013 5-33 (Jan. 2004) (discussing history of replacement contracts and associated Comptroller General opinions). Moreover, the rule the grantees assert would be inconsistent with this court \u2019 s recognition that the government gets \u201ca second chance to obligate\u201d even after an appropriation has lapsed if a court sets aside the original, timely obligation. Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1071 (D.C Cir. 1986). Considering the longstanding practice of the political branches, as well as our precedent, we are not persuaded that10 The Comptroller General opinion the dissent cites is inapposite because it involves new obligations, not replacement grants. See Dissenting Op. 41. Replacement grants do not require a new obligation of funds. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 24 of 9225the government lacks authority to recommit the funds after termination.11The district court \u2019 s determination that the grantees were likely to succeed on their \u201cconstitutional\u201d Inflation Reduction Act claim rests on both factual and legal error. The court found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115. This factual determination was not supported by any evidence in the record and rested only on the district court \u2019 s assertion that EPA \u201csuspended all eight grants. \u201d Id. at 116. But the suspension of the grants standing alone cannot demonstrate EPA was shutting down the statutory programs without congressional approval. Indeed, EPA repeatedly stated that it planned to recommit the grant money with greater oversight and accountability, contradicting the district court \u2019 s shutdown finding. Absent any clear evidence to the contrary, EPA \u2019 s representations were entitled to a presumption of regularity. See Am. Fed \u2019 n of Gov \u2019 t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Reagan, 870 F.2d 723, 727 (D.C Cir. 1989).Rather than credit EPA \u2019 s statements or explain why the presumption of regularity was overcome, the district court simply declared EPA was shutting down the programs. The court disregarded the government \u2019 s interest in prudent management of the grant programs and the government \u2019 s representations that it planned to properly supervise, rather11 We need not consider for purposes of this appeal whether the recent repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the recission of \u201cunobligated balances,\u201d affects EPA \u2019 s ability to recommit the funds at issue here. If the repeal of the statute bars EPA from recommitting the funds, it stands to reason that the repeal also relieves EPA of any statutory obligation to do so. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 25 of 9226than abandon, the grantmaking process.12 The district court \u2019 s conclusory factual finding of program dismantlement was clearly erroneous. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 118 (D.C Cir. 2001) (explaining that even on clear error review the court is not required to \u201caccept findings that are utterly deficient\u201d).Because EPA issued the grants in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, and there is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. In that case we issued a writ of mandamus because for years the Nuclear Regulatory Commission flagrantly disregarded statutory commands, failed to spend appropriated funds, and plainly stated it had no intention of complying with its statutory obligations. In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 257 \u2013 59. By contrast, EPA entered the grant agreements before the appropriation expired in September 2024, in compliance with any requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act to spend funds. EPA subsequently terminated the agreements because of its concerns about lack of oversight and potential conflicts of interest during the award process.EPA \u2019 s actions here are well within the Executive Branch \u2019 s authority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds and to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly spent for its intended purposes. The grant terminations may be12 The district court also ignored the government \u2019 s evidence of mismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which further supports EPA \u2019 s good faith in deciding to terminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision and accountability. See J.A 107 n.1 Moreover, the dissent focuses primarily on EPA \u2019 s actions against these grantees, but the repeated recounting of these actions tells us little about whether EPA will recommit the funds through a more robust process. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 26 of 9227challenged on the merits as a breach of contract, but nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.The grantees \u2019 false invocation of the separation of powers cannot justify this preliminary injunction, which bars EPA from carrying out basic executive functions to ensure the prudent and effective management of substantial public funds.13IV.The district court also abused its discretion in applying the remaining Winter factors: irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the balance of the equities, and the public interest. While some grantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the litigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the government and the public in the proper stewardship of billions of taxpayer dollars.A.The loss of grant funds during this litigation is not irreparable because the harm is compensable through money damages. The district court concluded the grantees would suffer irreparable harm because their \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cbusiness operations \u2026 depend[] on their grant money. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117. But it is well-established that \u201ceconomic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm. \u201d Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). Pecuniary injuries can be13 The grantees also argue EPA will violate the Appropriations Clause if it reobligates the funds after terminating the grant agreements. The district court did not base its preliminary injunction on this argument, so we do not address it. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 27 of 9228redressed through money damages if a plaintiff proves its case. We have recognized only one exception, for pecuniary loss that \u201cthreatens the very existence of the movant \u2019 s business. \u201d Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C Cir. 1985). This exception generally applies when government action threatens the existence of an independent private entity. See, e.g , Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 F.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C Cir. 2024) (finding irreparable harm when a financial services firm would be forced to shutter if regulatory action took effect during litigation).The grantees do not fall within this exception. The nonprofit entities that may need to suspend operations are entities that were created solely for the purpose of applying for and spending these federal grants. So while their \u201cexistence relies on grant money\u201d as the district court held, that is because these entities were established to benefit from government largesse. Creating such an entity cannot establish an irrevocable claim to government funds or an entitlement to injunctive relief preventing the Executive Branch from supervising and managing those funds. In short, the existential threat alleged by the grantees does not amount to irreparable harm.EPA terminated the grants because of concerns about the integrity of the grantmaking process. While litigation is pending, the grantees may have to scale down their operations or return to the operational status they had before they received federal funds. Although this causes some harm, the harm is readily compensable through damages and therefore is not irreparable.B.The balance of the equities and the public interest factors similarly favor the government. The injunction harms the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 28 of 9229government and the public interest by preventing the Executive Branch from properly and prudently managing billions of dollars in public funds. The grantees have an interest in continued access to government funding. But the government and the public have a stronger interest in protecting the public fisc and eliminating the appearance of impropriety around these grant programs.Moreover, if the grant terminations are later determined to be a breach of contract, the government may be required to pay damages to the grantees, which would substantially, if not entirely, redress the grantees \u2019 interim injuries. By contrast, if the government \u2019 s position is eventually vindicated, it will have no apparent means to recover funds spent down while the litigation has run its course. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Order) (recognizing irreparable harm to the government because the grant \u201cfunds cannot be recouped and are thus irrevocably expended\u201d) (cleaned up). The government \u2019 s (and the public \u2019 s) harm from an erroneous injunction is thus irreparable in a way that the grantees \u2019 harm from an erroneous contract termination is not.Finally, Congress has explicitly channeled breach of government contract claims to the Court of Federal Claims and limited remedies to damages. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 (\u201cThe Court of [Federal] Claims may neither grant declaratory nor injunctive relief. \u201d) (cleaned up). The district court has no jurisdiction over these claims, and even the Court of Federal Claims lacks authority to issue injunctive relief. The public interest favors limiting federal courts to the jurisdiction and remedies provided by Congress. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2562 (2025) (\u201cWhen a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. \u201d). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 29 of 9230The same considerations support vacating the injunction as to Citibank. The district court did not find that the grantees were likely to succeed on any of their independent claims against Citibank, which involve breach of contract, conversion, and replevin. To the contrary, the court found that \u201cCitibank performed its obligations under the FAA in accordance with its responsibilities as a financial agent of the United States. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The injunction against Citibank merely serves to stop Citibank from following the government \u2019 s instructions, which the district court considered unlawful. Because we conclude the injunction against the government should be vacated, the derivative injunction against Citibank must be vacated as well.* * *For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court \u2019 s injunction and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.So ordered. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 30 of 92PILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting: On the majority \u2019 s telling, Plaintiffs bring garden-variety contract claims against EPA \u2019 s reasonable decisions to terminate their grant awards. That version of events fails to contend with the government \u2019 s actual behavior and misapprehends Plaintiffs \u2019 claims, leading the majority to the wrong conclusion at every step of its review of the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction.Three years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. One of the law \u2019 s signature provisions directs the Environmental Protection Agency to distribute $20 billion in grants for investment in projects to develop clean energy infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Congress structured the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to provide jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, especially in low-income and underinvested communities. EPA distributed the grant money by the fall of 2024, as Congress required.After the change in administration, in response to President Trump \u2019 s directives to terminate the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d new leadership at EPA decided to take back the money already awarded to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were holding and spending the money exclusively as Congress intended. Yet EPA\u2014in conjunction with counterparts at the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the U.S Treasury\u2014opened spurious criminal and civil investigations into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and pressured Citibank into \u201cvoluntarily\u201d freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts even though the government lacked probable cause to impose such a freeze. EPA then attempted to take back Plaintiffs \u2019 money by \u201cterminating\u201d all eight grants, comprising the entire $20 billion congressionally mandated program, 24 hours before the government was due in district court for a hearing on Plaintiffs \u2019 application for a temporary restraining order. Those unprecedented and unfounded actions were part of EPA \u2019 s hunt for reasons to shut down the congressionally mandated program and claw back the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 31 of 922funding that had already been disbursed to Plaintiffs and committed to infrastructure projects. EPA \u2019 s termination letter claims the agency conducted a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d but fails to identify any contract breach or violation of law by Plaintiffs.So far, EPA has succeeded in depriving Plaintiffs of access to their funding for six months. The freeze has already caused Plaintiffs to default on promised loans and scuttled affordable housing and energy projects implementing Congress \u2019 s vision. EPA has done all that without presenting to any court any credible evidence or coherent reason that could justify its interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money and its sabotage of Congress \u2019 s law.Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s action to gut the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as contrary to the Constitution \u2019 s separation of powers. Fundamental to our \u201cconstitutional system of separation of powers\u201d is the \u201csettled, bedrock principle[]\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 267 (D.C Cir. 2013); U.S Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, cl. 7; U.S Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Yet that is just what EPA decided to do and has begun to effectuate here. The record strongly supports the district court \u2019 s determination that EPA has frozen and attempted to repossess billions of dollars \u2019 worth of lawfully spent money for no substantiated reason other than disagreements with Congress \u2019 s policy determination\u2014grounds that are entirely inapposite and inadequate, and that the government does not defend here. The agency has no lawful basis\u2014nor even a nonfrivolous assertion of any basis\u2014to interfere with funding that, pursuant to Congress \u2019 s instructions, already belongs to Plaintiffs, who in turn have committed it to energy infrastructure development USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 32 of 923and advanced manufacturing projects according to Congress \u2019 s plan.That constitutional violation alone justifies the district court \u2019 s injunction. The injunction is independently warranted by the arbitrary and capricious character of EPA \u2019 s actions. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s taking of their funds under an irrational process with only pretextual justifications. That is a quintessential APA claim that belongs in the district court, and on which Plaintiffs are likely to succeed.Defendants insist that this is a government contract dispute that we must dismiss because, under the Tucker Act, only the Court of Federal Claims has authority to decide it. Our Tucker Act precedents do not support that contention. They direct us to analyze whether a claim is \u201cat its essence\u201d contractual and, if it is, to cede jurisdiction to the Court of Claims for its expert \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 76, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). That analysis, turning on the source of the right Plaintiffs assert and the nature of the relief they seek\u2014here, constitutional and statutory claims to retain already-disbursed funds to which they remain lawfully entitled\u2014confirms the jurisdiction of the district court. Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968-69 (D.C Cir. 1982). The majority acknowledges the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 constitutional claims. And nothing in the Tucker Act or binding precedent interpreting it supports the majority \u2019 s view that Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is transformed into a contract claim and ousted from the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction merely because it seeks to prevent EPA \u2019 s capricious interference with funds that Plaintiffs obtained through and must spend consistently with a contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 33 of 924In characterizing this case as merely a contract dispute subject to the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional bar, the majority baselessly strips the district court of authority to decide these important claims. The majority holds that a plaintiff cannot bring an arbitrary and capricious challenge to any government action that affects something of value that was originally obtained by contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. Doing so undercuts the Constitution \u2019 s and the APA \u2019 s checks on the Executive \u2019 s illegitimate seizure of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds and subversion of Congress \u2019 s will. The government \u2019 s Tucker Act defense is especially pernicious here. Dismissal of this case presumably will enable the government to carry out its announced plan to immediately and irrevocably seize Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. At best, in the unlikely event the government refrains from immediately draining Plaintiffs \u2019 frozen accounts, the further delay involved in reinitiating litigation in the Court of Federal Claims will itself irreparably harm the infrastructure projects that cannot move forward and may fail without funding. In these circumstances, \u201c[i]t is no overstatement to say that our constitutional system of separation of powers w[ill] be significantly altered\u201d by \u201callow[ing] executive . . . agencies to disregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 267.BACKGROUNDA. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction FundIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act establishes the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to distribute that money for investment in projects to deploy solar and electric energy technology throughout the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065-67 (2022) (codified USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 34 of 925at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434). The program was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and \u201cimprove health outcomes, lower energy costs, and create high-quality jobs for Americans\u2014all while strengthening [the] country \u2019 s economic competitiveness and ensuring energy security. \u201d Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 3 (J.A 1735).Achieving that vision would \u201crequire a tremendous amount of financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- and air pollution-reducing projects across the country. \u201d Id. Because the private sector has historically been hesitant to invest in clean energy projects, Congress designed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to finance clean energy projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A). Specifically, Congress directed EPA to spend $20 billion by September 2024 to fund nonprofit financial institutions, which in turn must use the funds either to recruit private investment for clean energy programs or to assist community projects to reduce air pollution. Id. \u00a7 7434(a)(2)-(3), (c)(3).Pursuant to Congress \u2019 s directive, in July 2023, EPA created two funding programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit lenders to use public seed money to attract private investment for tens of thousands of energy-efficient affordable housing, transportation, and electricity projects throughout the country; and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit organizations to use public seed money to enable community lenders to invest in clean energy projects in low-income and underinvested communities.EPA conducted a rigorous, competitive selection process, which included review of applicants \u2019 detailed program plans USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 35 of 926and budgets, organizational capacity, and experience managing third-party capital and financial risk. EPA selected eight nonprofits\u2014lenders and community organizations\u2014capable of carrying out those aims. The approved workplans and budgets of the applicants EPA selected describe how those organizations will use the federal funds they have since received to expand access to\u2014and recruit private investment for\u2014affordable construction and renovation of energy-efficient businesses, schools, municipal buildings, healthcare facilities, public housing, and transportation, particularly in rural, Tribal, and low-income areas.In compliance with the September 2024 deadline Congress imposed, EPA obligated the grant funds for both programs by the summer of 2024. To enable the grantees to recruit private investment\u2014as Congress required, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A)\u2014EPA deposited the grant funds in accounts opened in the grantees \u2019 names at Citibank. Unlike EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system, that structure gave the grantees title to the full amount of the award funds up front, allowing those funds to serve as assets for the grantees to rely on to raise private capital by reducing financial risk for private investments. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 7-14.The Plaintiff grantees \u2019 legal title to their award funds is spelled out in Account Control Agreements between EPA, Citibank, and each grantee. Those agreements specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for the [grantee]\u201d and state that the grantee is \u201cthe Bank \u2019 s customer with respect to the Accounts and [] the entitlement holder with respect to all financial assets credited . . . to the Accounts. \u201d Account Control Agreement \u00a7 1 (J.A 1144). The Account Control Agreements accordingly direct that Citibank \u201cshall comply with all instructions\u201d it receives from the grantees. Id. \u00a7 2 (J.A 1145). The grantees \u2019 title to the award funds is also reflected in USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 36 of 927Citibank \u2019 s Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, which requires Citibank to act as the government \u2019 s \u201cfinancial agent\u201d to achieve Congress \u2019 s goal by, among other things, establishing \u201caccounts in the names of the three NCIF and five CCIA grant recipients\u201d and maintaining a \u201ccustomer relationship\u201d with each grantee. Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7 I.A.1 (J.A 2145).Under those agreements, EPA retained a security interest in the grantees \u2019 award funds that allows it to assert control over the money in certain circumstances if\u2014and only if\u2014it issues a Notice of Exclusive Control, which it undisputedly has not done.

Grantees provide extensive reporting to EPA on their spending. They make quarterly, semi-annual, and annual written reports regarding their transactions and progress against their EPA-approved workplans, plus quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting. They attend oversight, planning, and compliance meetings with EPA at least weekly. They submit to EPA withdrawal certifications attesting to the propriety of each draw request to Citibank and to its necessity for their workplan. And grantees are also subject to third-party financial audits and audits for federal grant compliance. Id. \u00b6 35 (J.A 372-73).The plaintiffs in this suit are five of the eight NCIF and CCIA grantees, as well as several of their subgrantees. Since mid-2024, they have been putting the grant money to work, committing to loans for projects around the country that will, for example: \u2022 develop and renovate hundreds of energy-efficient affordable housing units; \u2022 fund low-cost loans to small business and homeowners to finance heating and cooling systems and backup battery storage; \u2022 build a fleet of 500 American-made electric trucks to be conveniently and affordably available for lease by small businesses and independent contractors; and \u2022 provide backup power sources to rural hospitals to reduce the risks of harm to patients due to power outages.Those projects will help cut energy costs for consumers and small businesses, create jobs, ameliorate the affordable-USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 38 of 929housing crisis, and improve air quality in low-income and less developed communities.Plaintiffs \u2019 projects provide benefits to people and communities the value of which is many times greater than their cost to the public fisc. Congress structured these programs to enable each dollar of public funding spent to attract multiple dollars of private funding. One Plaintiff, for example, estimates that it will generate up to $4 of private investment for every $1 of federal funds invested in projects. Another Plaintiff \u2019 s workplan obligates it to mobilize $14 of private investment for every $1 of federal funding awarded to the Plaintiff. As of December 2024, it had already achieved a private-public capital mobilization ratio of nearly 7:1. But those projects\u2014as well as many of the Plaintiffs \u2019 ability even to remain in business\u2014cannot continue without Plaintiffs \u2019 access to the funds EPA awarded them. Plaintiffs \u2019 vulnerability to the freeze of their federal grant money is particularly acute given that many of the Plaintiffs were formed specifically to participate in the grant programs and as such do not have other sources of funding.B. EPA \u2019 s ActionsEPA \u2019 s campaign to seize the grant money already owned by Plaintiffs began shortly after the new administration took office, in response to its directives.

Nonetheless, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made clear his intent to take back the funds disbursed through those programs.On February 12, Zeldin released a public statement video in which he described the NCIF and CCIA grant programs as a \u201cscheme\u201d by the \u201cBiden EPA\u201d to \u201cpark[]\u201d 20 billion dollars at an outside financial institution in order to \u201cobligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. \u201d Lee Zeldin (@EPALeeZeldin), X (Feb. 12, 2025, 7:52 PM), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP\">https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP</url>.

The Justice Department first asked the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Washington, D.C , U.S Attorney \u2019 s Office, Denise Cheung, to open a criminal investigation into whether the NCIF and CCIA grants had been \u201cunlawfully\u201d awarded, so that the government could prevent the \u201ccontract awardees [from] continu[ing] to draw down\u201d their funds from their Citibank accounts.

When Cheung informed the Justice Department that probable cause to open a grand jury investigation did not exist, the Justice Department asked her to instead issue a letter requesting that Citibank freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.While Cheung worked in coordination with the FBI to draft the freeze request letter to Citibank, she informed the Justice Department that the government lacked probable cause to believe that Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts were subject to government seizure.

Around the same time, the Deputy Attorney General asked at least one other U.S Attorney \u2019 s office to open a grand jury investigation into the NCIF and CCIA grant programs and seek a court-ordered bank freeze, but, like Cheung, those other prosecutors refused the requests as unsupported.

As the government eventually told the district court, the \u201ceffort to . . . put a criminal freeze on the money\u201d was \u201cobviously\u201d unsuccessful \u201cbecause that didn \u2019 t happen. \u201d Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 26:5-9 (J.A 199).Despite having received multiple, independent assessments that there was no probable cause to believe that \u201cany apparent crime\u201d had been committed in connection with Plaintiffs \u2019 funds, EPA continued without basis to press for investigations of Plaintiffs, and then pointed to the very existence of those investigations as if they supported its efforts to indefinitely prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds.USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 42 of 9213EPA \u2019 s Acting Deputy Administrator Chad McIntosh referred the \u201cGGRF program\u201d to the EPA Office of Inspector General for a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into what he termed a \u201cpattern of reckless financial management, blatant conflicts of interest, astonishing sums of tax dollars awarded to unqualified recipients, and severe deficiencies in regulatory oversight under the prior administration. \u201d Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG 2 (J.A 107).

The Justice Department officials admitted that those investigations had not \u201c uncover[ed] . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d that could justify the government \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money but advised that, before the government would have to defend the freeze in court, it would \u201cmake . . . arguments about how those claims sound in contract and should be pursued in another forum. \u201d Id.The Justice Department recognized that, \u201c[a]t some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period. \u201d Id. That is, in the Justice Department \u2019 s candid estimation, the government had not turned up any wrongdoing that could justify its action to \u201cprevent disbursement of the grant funds. \u201d Id. Rather, it pursued criminal and civil investigations in the hopes of uncovering \u201ccriminal conduct or other improprieties\u201d that could justify freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 44 of 9215In response to the Justice Department \u2019 s instructions, EPA sent a letter to Citibank the next day instructing it to \u201cpause the processing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). EPA stated that it was \u201cworking to review and develop additional account controls to address concerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest related to the [GGRF], including based on incoming responses to oversight questions EPA issued to grant recipients on March 4, 2025,\u201d and asserted that \u201c[t]he GGRF is also the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the U.S Department of Justice and an investigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG). \u201d Id. EPA advised Citibank that, until \u201cadditional account controls are developed and implemented . . . and given the ongoing investigations into the GGRF, it is critical that the Bank not resume processing payment instructions for the GGRF accounts. \u201d Id. EPA stated further that \u201c[t]his interim account control will be rescinded as soon as reasonably practicable once EPA completes its review and implements additional account controls through additional instructions as necessary. \u201d Id.Meanwhile, Plaintiffs had already been unable to access the money in their bank accounts for over two weeks\u2014a period that has now stretched to more than six months. And because the terms of the grant awards generally prohibited Plaintiffs from withdrawing funds unless they would be spent in the following fourteen business days, Plaintiffs were starting to run out of money to make payroll, pay the rent on their offices, and pay third-party contractors for essential auditing, legal, and IT security services. On top of that, without access to their funding, they would soon be unable to meet their commitments under loans for projects they had already agreed to finance. Some of those loan payments could be requested by borrowers at any time; if borrowers requested a loan draw-down while USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 45 of 9216Plaintiffs could not access their funds, Plaintiffs would be forced to default on those loans, imperiling the projects.Plaintiffs remained unable to access the money in their accounts. They repeatedly requested an explanation from EPA or Citibank as to why their funds were inaccessible. They received no substantive reply. Climate United, for example, sent three emails, left a voicemail, and mailed a hard-copy letter to Citibank between February 19 and March 3 before finally receiving a response stating only that Citibank had \u201c received [Climate United \u2019 s] correspondence \u201d and was \u201cawaiting further guidance\u201d from EPA.

When Climate United contacted EPA on February 20, the agency at first offered Climate United a meeting the following week, only to reschedule the meeting three times before cancelling it and becoming entirely non-responsive to Climate United \u2019 s efforts to get in touch.At the same time that EPA was refusing to respond to Plaintiffs \u2019 requests for information, Zeldin made multiple public statements in which he claimed to have \u201cseen [] a lot of self-dealing, a lot of conflicts of interest,\u201d described the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme, and vowed that EPA was \u201cnot going to rest\u201d until it had \u201crecover[ed]\u201d the grant awards.1After three weeks of being kept in the dark without access to their funds, Plaintiffs \u201chad no choice but to sue. \u201d Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 14:8 (J.A 187).

The government then argued that the case should be dismissed as moot because the relief Plaintiffs sought\u2014an injunction preventing EPA from terminating the awards\u2014was no longer available, as EPA had already purported to terminate the awards.Rejecting EPA \u2019 s attempt to moot the case, the district court granted a temporary restraining order. It found that EPA had failed to provide any logical explanation for terminating Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards. Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-48.

Id at 115-16.By the time the district court granted the preliminary injunction in mid-April, Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to access their funding threatened to permanently unravel projects that depended on funding commitments they had incurred before EPA \u2019 s actions to undo the GGRF. A project to renovate 192 affordable housing units in Virginia could lose its $4 million in committed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding if a subgrantee cannot fulfill its funding obligations by September. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 437-38). Projects to construct a community health center in New Jersey and to renovate a historic hotel into 63 rental apartments in rural Iowa were slated to lose their state tax credits and collapse if they did not receive a subgrantee \u2019 s planned funding by July. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 25-26 (J.A 465-67).

Donovan Decl. \u00b6 17 (J.A 436-37).Those harms have only continued to mount as the funding freeze has persisted, and for some projects, it is likely already too late. Due to one subgrantee \u2019 s inability to access its grant funds, a 106-unit affordable housing renovation lost its state tax credits in May, increasing the project \u2019 s cost and placing the project in jeopardy.

Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (J.A 465).In addition to undermining existing projects, EPA \u2019 s actions will soon put many of the Plaintiffs themselves out of business, preventing accomplishment of the projects Congress intended them to fund. Without access to their funding, Plaintiffs are unable to make payroll, pay their bills, or keep current on their rent. Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117-20. Due to EPA \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to make payroll, many employees have started looking for other jobs, left voluntarily, or been laid off. For instance, one Plaintiff has laid off or lost approximately 50% of its staff, and one of its subgrantees was \u201cforced to act financially as though the GGRF award does not exist\u201d by laying off 36 of its employees. Mayopoulos Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. And because Plaintiffs cannot pay their bills, third-party contractors have started to withdraw essential services, including critical accounting, financial management, and award compliance services. Simply put, without access to their funds, Plaintiffs cannot keep their doors open, much less honor their loan commitments.More harmful still, faced with EPA \u2019 s threats to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 funds, existing partners have begun to shun Plaintiffs \u2019 funding offers, pulling out of near-final deals and stopping working on Plaintiffs \u2019 projects. After eight weeks of negotiations, an Alaska-based community finance institution USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 50 of 9221had agreed to a $10 million loan from one of the Plaintiffs; all that was left to officially close the deal was the board \u2019 s approval. Following EPA \u2019 s actions, the board refused to approve the loan. That same plaintiff had completed negotiations with a local green bank in the Midwest to help finance a different project, with only board approval outstanding. The board met the day after Zeldin \u2019 s February 12 comments on X and voted against the loan because of Zeldin \u2019 s public threats and vow to end the NCIF program. A philanthropic entity interested in investing $250 million in a partnership with one of the Plaintiffs broke off discussions following EPA \u2019 s actions. Co-investment and collaboration is critical to Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to efficiently finance projects to benefit the public by lowering \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A).DISCUSSIONAn accurate understanding of the program Congress enacted, together with the complete lack of evidence to support EPA \u2019 s false assertions of improper use or deficient oversight of federal expenditures, confirms that the district court \u2019 s decision to preliminarily enjoin EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions is unassailable. Based on nothing more than the President \u2019 s announced vendetta against the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d EPA determined to cut off access to money that was already disbursed to Plaintiffs and that they were using\u2014pursuant to Congress \u2019 s explicit directions as implemented by EPA\u2014to expand access to solar- and electric-powered housing, cars, buildings, and power generation. The Constitution does not allow the President or his subordinate executive agencies to unilaterally decide to take back money that Congress has appropriated and the agency already lawfully spent merely USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 51 of 9222because the Executive Branch disagrees with Congress \u2019 s policy choices. Neither do the laws governing federal agencies allow them to initiate specious criminal investigations in hopes of digging up pretextual justifications to cover up that unconstitutional action, let alone rely on the very existence of those investigations to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 lawful use of their money.EPA \u2019 s violations of law are so clear that the agency hardly contests them. And the imminent, irreversible harm to Plaintiffs is incontrovertible. These circumstances cry out for preliminary injunctive relief, as the district court rightly recognized. The majority \u2019 s contrary conclusion accepts the government \u2019 s gambit to strip district courts of jurisdiction over the government \u2019 s blatant violations of basic principles of constitutional and administrative law.Plaintiffs received the funds at issue here via federal grant awards. Absent EPA \u2019 s unjustified interference, the money in Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts is theirs to spend in conformity with the terms of the funding agreement. The government has expressly and repeatedly disclaimed any allegation that Plaintiffs have violated those terms. Neither has EPA attempted to regain control of the money by asserting its security interest in Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.EPA has instead frozen and purported to terminate the grant awards based on shifting, post-hoc, and unsupported allegations. Plaintiffs thus challenge EPA \u2019 s actions as arbitrary and capricious, and based on pretextual justifications. In no way is that claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim over which the district court lacks jurisdiction. The reality that Plaintiffs obtained the funds by government contract does not mean that claims they raise against the government \u2019 s interference with their lawful use of those funds sound in contract. Our bindingUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 52 of 9223precedent makes clear that just because Plaintiffs \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d if they had never received the funds through a grant does not mean that they assert a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley Gov \u2019 t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1110 (D.C Cir. 2022).The court \u2019 s holding to the contrary is unsupportable. The court falls short today in its Article III duty to independently say what the law is and thereby hold the Executive Branch to account. Such \u201c[a]bdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design. \u201d Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S 417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).A. Likelihood of Success1. APAEPA \u2019 s conduct is arbitrary and capricious. Agencies may not offer \u201ccontrived reasons\u201d for their decisions, Dep \u2019 t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S 752, 785 (2019), nor can they make any decision that \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S , Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S 29, 43 (1983). It is beyond dispute that an agency \u2019 s own patently unfounded criminal investigations against private companies cannot be invoked to justify the factually baseless and legally unauthorized taking of the companies \u2019 funds. By all indications, that is exactly what EPA did here.Following the President \u2019 s instructions to cut off funding to clean energy projects, EPA vowed to \u201creassume responsibility\u201d of the NCIF and CCIA grant funds. To that end, without probable cause to suspect any criminal wrongdoing related to the grant programs, EPA\u2014in coordination with the Justice Department and the FBI\u2014first pressured Citibank into USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 53 of 9224voluntarily freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts by referring to \u201cpossible criminal violations,\u201d including \u201c[c]onspiracy to defraud the United States\u201d and \u201cwire fraud. \u201d FBI Freeze Ltr. (J.A 99-101). Not satisfied that Citibank \u2019 s voluntary freeze would hold, the agencies attempted to open a criminal investigation into the grants and impose a freeze of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds based on suspected criminal conduct. When those efforts came to nothing, EPA instructed the agency \u2019 s Office of Inspector General to open a civil investigation, immediately sent the referral\u2014including its unfounded allegations of \u201cself-dealing, conflicts of interest, [and] extraordinarily unqualified recipients,\u201d J.A 105\u2014to Citibank, and instructed Citibank to keep the accounts frozen until EPA was able to establish sufficient account controls.When that account freeze expired, the agencies again referenced \u201cpotential fraud\u201d and ongoing criminal and civil investigations to Citibank as support for an indefinite continuation of its account freeze, ostensibly to enable EPA to evaluate Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions. Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). But the very next day\u2014weeks before those responses were due, and mere hours before a hearing on Climate United \u2019 s TRO motion\u2014EPA used the 24-hour delay, which it had requested as a \u201cprofessional courtesy,\u201d to abruptly announce its putative termination of all the NCIF and CCIA awards. EPA then argued that the court should dismiss Climate United \u2019 s suit as moot on the ground that EPA had terminated its grant.When EPA could not point the court to any evidence supporting its allegations of fraud, Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-47, it changed its tune. EPA argued to the district court and then to us that it terminated the grants not because any \u201cparticular plaintiff has engaged in a particular act that constitutes fraud,\u201d but only because of \u201cEPA \u2019 s lack of USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 54 of 9225oversight tools to ensure that the money wasn \u2019 t abused. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 103:9-15; see also Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g Tr. 39:4-15 (J.A 868). EPA insisted that its oversight concern did not in any way depend on Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d\u2014despite the termination letters \u2019 references to \u201cfraud, waste, and abuse\u201d as a basis for the termination. PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507); Termination Ltr. (J.A 390).Each of those actions is consistent with EPA \u2019 s unlawful pursuit of a \u201cshort-term objective [] to prevent disbursement of the grant funds\u201d that had nothing to do with any valid concerns about fraud or oversight, and everything to do with the agency \u2019 s desire to carry out President Trump \u2019 s directive to block implementation of Congress \u2019 s environmental policy. Mar. 9 Emails, <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA\">https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA</url>. That is demonstrated most clearly by EPA \u2019 s pursuit of criminal and civil investigations that it hoped would \u201c uncover . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d to substantiate its asserted justifications for freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. Id. It pursued those baseless (and fruitless) investigations against the advice of at least two experienced federal prosecutors the EPA consulted and the ruling of a magistrate judge that there was no probable cause to believe any improper conduct had occurred.Equally revealing is EPA \u2019 s double-speak: EPA claimed publicly and in communications to the parties that its actions were justified because the program is a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme and a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d that is \u201criddled with self-dealing, conflicts of interest, extraordinarily unqualified recipients . . . and much more,\u201d even as EPA insisted to the district court, which rebuked it for utterly failing to substantiate those allegations, and to our court, that it was not \u201caccusing\u201d and has never \u201caccuse[d] the plaintiffs of waste, fraud and abuse. \u201d Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g 39:12-13 (J.A 868); Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-18. Such shifting and contradictory representations USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 55 of 9226further show that the oversight concerns EPA emphasizes as its sole basis for terminating the awards are post-hoc and pretextual. Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-21.The timing of the termination letters similarly undermines EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns. Only the day before terminating the grants, EPA instructed Citibank to extend the \u201cvoluntary\u201d funding freeze while it waited for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014answers it claimed to need in order to evaluate \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). Later that day, Climate United moved for a TRO to prevent EPA from terminating the awards, among other requested relief. Instead of waiting for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014which EPA had given Plaintiffs another several weeks to submit\u2014EPA abruptly terminated the grants the next day, less than 24 hours before the district court \u2019 s scheduled TRO hearing.That sequence of events\u2014terminate first, gather data later\u2014is emblematic of EPA \u2019 s approach throughout the events underlying this litigation. It is fundamentally at odds with the APA \u2019 s requirement of reasoned decision making. An agency must, at a minimum, \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. \u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). By EPA \u2019 s own admission, it decided to terminate the awards before gathering the relevant oversight data, just as it decided to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money and launch criminal investigations without any reason to believe that Plaintiffs were engaged in \u201ccriminal conduct or other improprieties. \u201d Mar. 9 Emails. At every turn, EPA \u2019 s actions demonstrate that its purported reasons for terminating the grant\u2014its \u201c substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award progress, [and] USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 56 of 9227programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, \u201d Gov. Br. 33\u2014are entirely pretextual. Deciding the outcome before investigating the facts, unleashing the government \u2019 s prosecutorial power on private citizens with no basis to think fraud or crime occurred and, having uncovered no evidence, giving contrived and contradictory reasons for predetermined and unsupported agency action is quintessentially arbitrary and capricious. See Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S.at 782-85.EPA argues that it had legitimate concerns about its ability to ensure that the grant funds were being spent lawfully, making its decision to suddenly terminate the awards reasonable. Gov. Br. 33-34. But the oversight issues it cites are contradicted by the record. EPA \u2019 s explanation not only \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency\u201d and \u201cis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43, but is patently pretextual.EPA points to the use of Citibank as a financial agent, the distribution of grant funding to subgrantee organizations, and modification of the agreement between the presidential election and inauguration as raising \u201cserious concerns\u201d about EPA \u2019 s ability to oversee Plaintiffs \u2019 use of the funds. Gov. Br. 9-11. From EPA \u2019 s telling, unqualified grantees were awarded enormous sums of federal grant funding with virtually no oversight. That narrative finds no support in the record.Start with EPA \u2019 s allegation that Plaintiffs are \u201cextraordinarily unqualified recipients\u201d who \u201chad no prior track record. \u201d Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 105); Gov. Br. 6. That is a grave mischaracterization. Recipients were coalitions of some of the country \u2019 s most reputable nonprofits with decades of relevant experience. They formed coalitions, structured as newly formed subsidiaries, to accommodate theUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 57 of 9228demands of the role that Congress envisioned for the grantees. That organizational design enables the subsidiary to adopt policies and structures most conducive to leveraging private capital\u2014one of Congress \u2019 s key goals for the program\u2014while benefitting from the experience and infrastructure of the parent organizations. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363). Climate United, for instance, is a coalition of three nonprofits with thirty to fifty years of experience each who have collectively managed nearly $30 billion of private and institutional capital to increase environmental sustainability. Id. \u00b6 7 (J.A 363). Power Forward Communities is a coalition of five nonprofits\u2014including household names like United Way and Habitat for Humanity\u2014with more than a century of combined experience financing, managing, and implementing affordable housing projects. Its coalition partners \u2019 past projects total more than $100 billion and have successfully added approximately 1.5 million affordable homes and apartments across the United States for Americans in need. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6 3 (J.A 452).Those coalitions are led by people of proven experience and integrity. Power Forward Communities itself is led by a former President and CEO of Fannie Mae who was also General Counsel of Bank of America; one of its subgrantees is led by a former director of the U.S Office of Management and Budget and HUD Secretary; and another of its subgrantees is led by a former Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo who also served as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Such impressive leadership and proven track records make the coalitions eminently suited to fulfill Congress \u2019 s objectives. It is disingenuous of EPA to insinuate that the coalition structure implies Plaintiffs \u2019 lack of qualifications when it is \u201ccommon practice for established organizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and programs\u201d; coalition applicants were specifically invited toUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 58 of 9229apply for the grants by EPA; and the coalition partners and their leaders are extraordinarily qualified to administer the grant awards. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363); NOFO at 6 (J.A 1738). Nothing in the record materially disputes any of that.Nor do EPA \u2019 s purported concerns about conflicts of interest hold water. Start with the example selected by the majority. Maj. Op. 6 &amp; n.2 The majority highlights that, in urging its Office of Inspector General to open an investigation into the grant program, EPA \u2019 s Acting Deputy Administrator alleged that \u201cJahi Wise, the former director of the GGRF, personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital [(CGC)]\u2014without recusing himself. \u201d Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A 107). But the record squarely contradicts that allegation. Consistent with \u201cEPA Order 5700.5A1, EPA \u2019 s Policy for Competition of Assistance Agreements, and the rigorous ethics and conflict-of-interest review carried out by EPA during the review and selection process for GGRF funding . . . Mr. Wise was recused from reviewing, evaluating, selecting, or approving funding on any grant competition for GGRF funding for which CGC submitted an application. \u201d Hopson Decl. \u00b6 22 (J.A 421). That is, in addition to recusing himself from CGC \u2019 s application for funding, \u201cMr. Wise did not even review applications from CGC \u2019 s competitors for GGRF funds. \u201d Id. Even EPA recognizes that its speculation about conflicts of interest does not support its termination decision. Indeed, after failing to present the district court with any evidence of fraud, conflicts of interest, or anything even approaching \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d EPA pivoted to argue that its decision to terminate the grants was solely \u201cbased on reasons of policy\u201d and did not have anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 59 of 9230EPA \u2019 s characterization of the grants \u2019 funding structure as an \u201cunusual and apparently improper\u201d \u201cscheme [to] remove[] $20 billion from governmental oversight in the days, weeks, and months before a new administration took office\u201d is similarly unfounded. Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A 107). As explained above, Plaintiffs received their awards as lump-sum payments which they held in accounts at Citibank, subject to a security interest held by EPA. That financial structure was specifically chosen to enable Plaintiffs to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to act \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3). If the grant funds are to help attract private financing for clean energy projects, either by recruiting private co-investors or offering credit enhancements that make projects less risky for private investors, the funds need to be Plaintiffs \u2019 own assets and reflected on their balance sheets as such. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 9-14; Bafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32 (J.A 370-72). Under EPA \u2019 s standard grant disbursement system, in contrast, a recipient \u2019 s balance sheet reflects only the portions of the award that have already been expended, rather than the full award amount. Adherence to the agency \u2019 s default payment system would have impeded Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to recruit private capital. To effectuate Congress \u2019 s direction, EPA instead deposited the full award amount in Citibank accounts opened in Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 names. That way, their balance sheets reflected Plaintiffs \u2019 ownership of the full amount of the award, even as they drew down funds from the account only as needed and in compliance with their obligations to fund projects and cover administrative costs.That funding mechanism was contemplated by EPA as early as July 2023\u2014long before any potential change in administration. See NOFO 55-56 (J.A 1787-88) (contemplating departures from standard EPA practice, including a \u201cone-time or periodic balance-sheet USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 60 of 9231capitalization(s)\u201d). And there is nothing improper about it. Rather, \u201cfederal financial agents\u201d like Citibank are \u201croutinely appointed\u201d and are specifically authorized by statute. Transactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C Cir. 1996); 12 U.S.C \u00a7 265. Most relevant to EPA \u2019 s litigating position, the financial agent structure affords EPA more oversight than the agency \u2019 s standard payment system. Citibank \u2019 s interface displays these grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 expenditures broken down by budget category and provides EPA with full, real-time view access into each of the grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 accounts. Those oversight features are absent from EPA \u2019 s standard disbursement system, which reports only the amount of money drawn down by the recipient. EPA \u2019 s determination that the \u201cprior administration \u2019 s designation of a financial agent . . . untenably reduced EPA \u2019 s oversight\u201d has it backwards. Gov. Br. 10.In the same vein, EPA asserts that, because some subgrantees may distribute award funds to other entities, EPA lacks the \u201cvisibility to see how [the subgrantees are] making those decisions or how that money is being used. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 34:2-4; see also Gov. Br. 10. That concern inexplicably disregards the many ways in which EPA can oversee the subgrantees \u2019 activities. EPA approved detailed budgets and workplans that specify how the subgrantees will use the grant money. Just like the grantees, every subgrantee must certify, under threat of \u201cprosecution under 18 U.S.C 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions,\u201d that each requested withdrawal of funds from its Citibank account is \u201cnecessary to execute against the workplan for the Subaward Agreement supported with EPA funding. \u201d Subgrantee Account Control Agreement, Ex. B (J.A 1189). And subgrantees \u2019 progress against that workplan is tracked and reported in quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports to EPA. For instance, Rewiring Community Investment Fund\u2014aUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 61 of 9232Power Forward Communities subgrantee\u2014describes how its inability to access its funding will prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its EPA-approved workplan, which include \u201cestablish[ing] a loan loss reserve to encourage lenders to provide loans with significantly discounted interest rates\u201d to households for energy-efficient, clean heating and cooling systems. Matusiak Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 447). Moreover, many of the subgrantees are financial institutions that are themselves subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators. JCF Ltr. at 3 (May 21, 2025).To the extent EPA takes issue with the fact that grantees may provide \u201csubgrants to others, who then pass it through to others,\u201d that is the structure that Congress, not the prior administration, chose to adopt. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(2) (\u201cThe eligible recipient shall provide funding\u201d to \u201centities that provide financial assistance to qualified projects at the State, local, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of Columbia, including community- and low-income-focused lenders and capital providers. \u201d).Tellingly, when one of the Plaintiffs responded to EPA \u2019 s asserted concerns about its ability to oversee subgrantees by proposing restructuring the $770 million of its grant funding that was slated for distribution to subgrantee community lenders, EPA ignored it. JCF Ltr. at 2-3. Under the proposal, the vast majority of the Plaintiff \u2019 s money would remain unspent in a segregated trust or escrow account that EPA could monitor. Instead of being distributed to the community lenders to lend directly, the funds would be used to secure the loans made by those community lenders to small businesses and communities looking to finance clean energy projects. In that way, the grant funds could have advanced the programs \u2019 goals USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 62 of 9233while largely staying put in an account monitored by EPA. EPA did not respond to the letter, despite repeated follow-up from the Plaintiff. Id. at 1. That lack of engagement further suggests that EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns are not the real reason it terminated Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards.At bottom, each of EPA \u2019 s specific examples of oversight concerns is refuted by the record. And its broad-brush argument is simply untenable in light of the detailed oversight mechanisms available to EPA. EPA \u2019 s assertions that it had such grave oversight concerns that it had to cancel the grant awards overnight run aground on a conceded lack of any indication that Plaintiffs were out of compliance with the award terms, let alone that they were engaging in any conflicts of interest, fraud, or criminal activity. In addition to the real-time visibility Citibank provides EPA into Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 accounts, EPA receives quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports detailing Plaintiffs \u2019 transactions, activities, progress against their workplans, and expenditures by budget category, as well as mandatory quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(a) (J.A 373). Before it purported to halt the program and itself disengaged from constructive communication, EPA had also held meetings with Plaintiffs \u201cat least weekly, and, at times, two to three times per week,\u201d to discuss their \u201cprogram plans, reporting, oversight, and compliance with the EPA Terms and Conditions. \u201d Id. \u00b6 35(b) (J.A 373); Arabshahi Decl. \u00b6 34 (J.A 1981). On top of those controls, Plaintiffs are subject to third-party audits and to \u201ctransaction testing\u201d by EPA, in which EPA conducts a \u201csystematic examination and verification of every dollar spent by [the grantee] to ensure they comply with the grant \u2019 s terms, conditions, and applicable regulations. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(g), (h) (J.A 373). USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 63 of 9234EPA and the majority make much of the fact that the grant awards were amended in December 2024 and January 2025, claiming that these \u201clast-minute\u201d modifications in the waning days of the Biden administration were implemented to \u201cmake it more difficult for the government to terminate the agreements. \u201d Maj. Op. 5; see Gov. Br. 10, 34. EPA specifically contends that the original terms of the awards allowed it to terminate them \u201cbased on [a] change in policy priorities,\u201d per the version of EPA \u2019 s General Terms and Conditions in place before October 2024\u2014a contention the majority credits. Oral Arg. Tr. 102:17-25; see Maj. Op. 5 n. 1. That is incorrect.The original grant agreements, signed in August 2024\u2014months before the election\u2014already incorporated the termination provision from EPA \u2019 s now-operative General Terms and Conditions. Those General Terms and Conditions allow terminations of federal awards based on a change in policy priorities only when that basis for termination is \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d set forth in the award agreement itself. 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4), (b) (emphasis added). (Neither the EPA nor the majority contends that the award agreement itself, apart from the referenced regulation, allows the awards to be terminated based on a change in policy priorities.) The December 2024 amendment to the grant award thus did not alter the permissible bases for termination, which had never allowed termination for changed policy priorities.Plaintiffs \u2019 original award agreements specifically stated that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the General Term and Condition \u2018Termination, \u2019 [otherwise in effect before October 1, 2024,] EPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement only as specified in . . . the version of 2 CFR 200.340 applicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 Fed. Reg. 55262 (July 3, 2024). \u201d J.A 552 (emphasis added). The USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 64 of 9235version of the regulation the awards incorporated from the outset was the one providing \u201cthat an agency may terminate a Federal award if it no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities (e.g unilateral termination) but only when such language is clearly and unambiguously included in the terms and conditions of the award,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, 55,263 (July 3, 2024) (emphasis added).EPA adopted that constraint pursuant to OMB \u2019 s invitation to agencies to opt into the revised rule before its default October 1, 2024, effective date. As of July 2024, EPA announced in the Federal Register that it had \u201cdecided to apply the revised version of 2 CFR 200.340 to EPA financial assistance agreements awarded or amended to add funds on or after July 1, 2024. \u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 55263. The December amendment thus imposed no new limit on EPA \u2019 s \u201ccontrol over [the] grant funding. \u201d Gov. Br. 10.The timing of the amendment also is entirely innocuous. EPA had explained shortly after the awards were announced in April 2024 that it would share draft award terms that month, and that it \u201cexpected the terms to change based on awardee feedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for awardee workplans. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 367). EPA accordingly planned to communicate a \u201cfinal\u201d set of award terms in late June, followed by an iterative process during the fall and winter of 2024 in which EPA would receive grantees \u2019 suggested modifications based on their experience implementing the programs. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17-20 (J.A 366-68). Despite EPA \u2019 s and the majority \u2019 s insinuations to the contrary, nothing about the timing or content of those amendments supports Defendants \u2019 assertion that they were intended to reduce the agency \u2019 s oversight or control in the next administration. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 65 of 9236Neither does the \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which Zeldin repeatedly referenced in public comments smearing Plaintiffs, provide any plausible basis for sincere oversight concerns on the part of EPA \u2019 s new leadership. In the November 2024 Project Veritas video, an EPA staffer is shown saying to a peer on a Tinder date (who was surreptitiously filming him) that EPA was \u201ctrying to get the money out as fast as possible\u201d before Trump \u2019 s inauguration. Lisa Friedman, An Offhand Remark About Gold Bars, Secretly Recorded, Upended His Life, N.Y TIMES (July 1, 2025), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9\">https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9</url>. Whatever the staffer may have meant, those comments cannot have been referring to awards under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund because those had been fully obligated as of August 2024 (in accordance with Congress \u2019 s September 2024 deadline). \u201cEPA Awards $27B in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Grants to Accelerate Clean Energy Solutions, Combat the Climate Crisis, and Save Families Money,\u201d EPA (Aug. 16, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A\">https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A</url>. Anyone with a basic familiarity with the GGRF program would understand that a video of a staffer \u2019 s bluster at a bar in November is irrelevant to the grants at issue here.In sum, the record makes clear that EPA \u2019 s abrupt termination of the grant awards on the eve of the TRO hearing cannot rationally be explained by reference to the agency leadership \u2019 s professed oversight concerns. That alone shows that the agency violated the APA, as EPA \u2019 s explanation for its decision to terminate the awards \u201cruns counter to the evidence before\u201d it. State Farm, 463 U.S at 43. Far more troubling, EPA \u2019 s dogged pursuit of criminal investigations unsupported by probable cause and its unsubstantiated public accusations of criminal activity strongly suggest that the agency \u2019 s professed oversight concerns are pretextual. EPA \u2019 s refusals to discuss its declared concerns with Plaintiffs themselves, engage with their responses, or even wait to consider how they would answer its USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 66 of 9237oversight questions give the lie to its widely trumpeted concerns. Contrived, baseless justifications for the grant terminations do not satisfy the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law,\u201d which \u201cis meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S at 785. The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c[a]ccepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise. \u201d Id. \u201cIf judicial review is to be more than an empty ritual, it must demand something better\u201d by way of reasoned explanation than the false statements EPA broadcast to build a sensationalist public narrative in its favor. Id.2. Separation of PowersIt is equally clear that EPA \u2019 s actions violate the Constitution. Our constitutional system of separation of powers rests on the idea that national \u201cpolicy is for Congress and the President to establish as they see fit in enacting statutes, and for the President and subordinate executive agencies . . . to implement within statutory boundaries. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257. \u201cMoney is the instrument of policy,\u201d Clinton, 524 U.S at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring), and it is Congress\u2014not the executive branch acting unilaterally\u2014that has \u201cexclusive power over the federal purse,\u201d Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. E.P.A , 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C Cir. 1992). Only Congress may authorize \u201cmoney [to] be paid out of the Treasury. \u201d Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S 308, 321 (1937). And when it does so, the executive \u201cmay not ignore\u201d those funding directives \u201cmerely because of policy disagreement with Congress. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260.To hold otherwise would allow \u201cthe executive [to] possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,\u201d 2USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 67 of 9238JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \u00a7 1348, at 215 (Thomas Cooley ed., 4th ed. 1873)\u2014the very concentration of power the Appropriations Clause was intended to prevent. See Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 U.S at 321. It is thus incontrovertible that, \u201c[a]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals. \u201d City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018). As then-Judge Kavanaugh explained, it is a \u201csettled, bedrock principle[] of constitutional law\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259. Insofar as the majority defends a prerogative of EPA to cancel the grants for policy reasons, the majority \u2019 s assertion that \u201cthe [Inflation Reduction] Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, squarely conflicts with Aiken.Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated federal funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and instructed EPA \u201cto make grants\u201d by September 30, 2024, to \u201cnonprofit organization[s] that [are] designed to provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (providing funds \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024\u201d and instructing EPA to make the described grants), (c)(1)(A) (specifying that \u201celigible recipients\u201d must be able to leverage private capital). The statute specifies that grantees, working in partnership with the private sector and with local communities, must provide funding and other assistance to housing and infrastructure projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Id.USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 68 of 9239\u00a7 7434(b). EPA is constitutionally obligated to administer those grants; it cannot unilaterally decide to get rid of the grant programs based on the Administration \u2019 s policy preference to \u201c[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal. \u201d 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357.The district court found that EPA sought to do just that. It found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter,\u201d as shown by EPA \u2019 s public expressions of determination to shut down the grant program, and as confirmed by its action to terminate \u201call eight grants comprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The district court \u2019 s factfinding is amply supported by the record, and the majority \u2019 s conclusion that it was clearly erroneous cannot be squared with EPA \u2019 s remarkable conduct in this case. Maj. Op. 25-26.As already discussed, EPA \u2019 s actions at every turn reveal its determination to permanently defund the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs for no more reason than that President Trump announced that goal. See 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357 (directing agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by preventing the \u201cdisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act\u201d). Without any further planning, consideration, or explanation, EPA acted to prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds. Current agency leadership has demonized the recipients as if the President \u2019 s policy preferences alone license them to slander as fraudulent or criminal any grantee whose activities do not align with those preferences. No matter that all evidence confirms that Plaintiffs were spending their money precisely as Congress intended and authorized.Indeed, EPA \u2019 s hasty decisions to freeze and terminate the grant awards with no evidence of noncompliance and no communication with Plaintiffs cannot be explained as anything USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 69 of 9240other than a decision to do what the President said he wanted only because he said so. The decision to terminate the grants just hours before the district court had a scheduled occasion to rule on whether to restore or preserve Plaintiffs \u2019 access to their award funds is hard to explain as anything but a bald effort to rewrite the statute and undo what was done in compliance with it. Those are not legitimate means to advance the new President \u2019 s policy agenda. Why terminate grant awards that had been made and were being carried out as Congress intended unless EPA \u2019 s real disagreement was with Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice to fund \u201cgreen energy\u201d projects?The majority chides the district court for discounting EPA \u2019 s representations that it intended to reconstitute the grant programs with increased oversight. Maj. Op. 25-26. At oral argument, EPA disavowed any \u201cfrontal assault on the appropriation or Congress \u2019 s objective,\u201d insisting that the agency \u201cintends, as consistent with principles of appropriations law, to continue to make these funds available in a permissible way and in a way that comports with the oversight principles that it thinks are important here. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. at 25. But, as discussed below, since the appropriation \u2019 s deadline to obligate the funds has passed, EPA retains at most a narrow authority to make \u201creplacement\u201d grants and cannot obligate the funds anew.In any event, the district court had ample basis not to credit EPA \u2019 s representations that it will spend the funds as Congress intended. The court observed EPA \u2019 s track record throughout this case of making slanderous and insupportable public statements and disavowing them in court in favor of self-serving contradictory representations. The court knew that EPA instigated unsupported criminal and civil investigations to hunt for justifications to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 money and observed that the agency remained unable to provide any USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 70 of 9241evidence to support its very public assertions of mismanagement and insufficient oversight. Presented with EPA \u2019 s actions and its patent inability to justify them on any other basis, the district court was on unassailably solid evidentiary footing in finding that EPA \u2019 s actions had nothing to do with its professed oversight concerns. EPA simply sought to \u201cdismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115.EPA \u2019 s \u201crepeated[] represent[ations] that it planned to re-commit the funds,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, ring entirely hollow in light of its patent inability to do so. See Bagenstos Amicus Br. 3-11. It is an \u201celementary principle\u201d of federal appropriations law that \u201ca federal agency \u2019 s budget authority lapses on the last day of the period for which funds were obligated. \u201d W. Va. Ass \u2019 n of Cmty. Health Ctrs, Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C Cir. 1984). Here, Congress specified that the appropriation for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund would \u201cremain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a)(1), (2), (3). The appropriation thus expired on that date, after which EPA could no longer use the funding to incur new obligations. See Off. of Nat. Res. Revenue-Coop. Agreements, B-321297, 2011 WL 3343023, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Aug. 2, 2011).Federal appropriations law thus bars EPA from terminating the awards and then re-obligating the funds to reconstitute the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs. \u201cIf an agency deobligates funds after the expiration of the period of availability, the funds are not available for new obligations. \u201d Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation for Additional Project Phases, B-286929, 2001 WL 717355, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Apr. 25, 2001). In other words, once EPA terminates the grant awards, it will no longer have the authority to make new grant awards to fulfill its statutory obligations. The majority suggests that Congress \u2019 s repeal last month of the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 71 of 9242Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could affect EPA \u2019 s asserted authority to recommit the funds and thereby relieve it of any obligation to do so. Maj. Op. 25 n. 11. It does neither. The statute rescinds only \u201cunobligated\u201d funds: Obligated funds, like those at issue here, are unaffected. One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 155 (2025). See generally July 7, 2025, Neitzel Ltr. to Clerk of Court Cislak (noting that Senator Capito described the proposition that OBBBA might \u201cclaw back money\u201d as \u201cridiculous\u201d) (quoting Josh Siegel, Q&amp;A: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, incoming EPW chair, (Nov. 20, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9\">https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9</url>). It is the federal appropriations rule, not the repeal legislation, that prevents EPA from recommitting the funds.EPA \u2019 s assertions that it will nonetheless fulfill Congress \u2019 s plan by labeling its re-obligations as \u201creplacement grants,\u201d Reply Br. 17, are empty promises. The majority, too, cites replacement-grant authority as evidence of EPA \u2019 s intent to continue the program with new grantees rather than terminate it. Maj. Op. 24 &amp; n.10 To qualify as a replacement grant, the re-obligation would have to be \u201csubstantially identical in scope and purpose to the original grant. \u201d The Honorable Lawton Chiles U.S Senate, B-164031, 1976 WL 10353, at *4 (Comp. Gen. June 25, 1976). Those requirements cannot be met by new grants that materially alter the financial structure, number of grantees, or other oversight controls\u2014meaning that EPA would have to retain the very features it claims prompted the agency to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 grants. See NRDC Amicus Br. 9-13.The majority reasons that, because \u201cthere is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. \u201d Maj. Op. 26. The majority \u2019 s factual premise USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 72 of 9243is unsupported, and the validity of Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim follows from Aiken County. We held in Aiken County that executive agencies violate the constitutional separation of powers when they refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress because they disagree with Congress \u2019 s policy choice. 725 F.3d at 260. There, as here, Congress appropriated funds for a particular effort (there, assessing applications to store nuclear waste; here, making competitive grants) and set a statutory deadline for the agency to act. Id. at 257-58. When the agency refused to adhere to the statute due to \u201cpolicy disagreement[s] with Congress,\u201d we held that refusal violated the Constitution, posing a threat to undermine \u201cour constitutional system of separation of powers\u201d that supported judicial intervention. Id. at 260, 267.EPA \u2019 s attempts to dismantle the statutorily mandated NCIF and CCIA programs due to the current agency leadership \u2019 s policy disagreements with Congress run afoul of the Constitution in the same way. In rejecting Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim, the majority says that it is \u201cdeclin[ing] to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim. \u201d Maj. Op. 23. That may well be advisable, but it does not describe the rule of Aiken County that properly applies here. The majority cannot choose to \u201cdecline\u201d to apply our binding precedent. Wherever the line between constitutional and statutory claims lies, Aiken County squarely holds that EPA \u2019 s actions violated the Constitution.B. Irreparable Injury and Balance of EquitiesBaseless allegations of fraudulent or criminal activity, coupled with EPA \u2019 s unfounded interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 grant funds, threaten enormous harm to Plaintiffs and, more importantly, to the communities, businesses, and individuals USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 73 of 9244across the United States who stand to benefit from the uses of the money that Congress prescribed. Without access to their grant awards, Plaintiffs are already out of money to make payments for rent, third-party contractors, and insurance policies critical to continue operating, and many of the Plaintiffs will permanently shutter in the coming months. Plaintiffs have already been forced to defer compensation for, lay off, withdraw offers from, and lose employees with specialized expertise that \u201ccannot be replaced easily, if at all. \u201d Supp. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 7 (J.A 954).Absent funding from Plaintiffs, major projects already underway will fold\u2014projects intended to create demand for and boost the global competitiveness of U.S advanced electric manufacturing capability, provide critically necessary affordable housing and infrastructure, lower energy costs, improve air quality, and reduce climate risks across the United States. If the agency succeeds in taking back the funding provided under the Act, many of those projects will not be able to raise capital from other sources and will irrevocably fail. That is particularly likely because Congress directed grantees to invest in \u201cqualified projects that would otherwise lack access to financing. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(1). As just a single example, one subgrantee community lender has set up projects to install clean-energy microgrids at churches, community centers, and nursing homes in rural Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama to provide sustained power during outages of existing power sources. Without the subgrantee \u2019 s promised funds, those projects are at risk of being left undone. The projects were intended to provide vulnerable populations with \u201cenergy independent safe havens for residents and community members\u201d during increasingly common extreme weather events; instead, when blackouts inevitably happen, \u201c[o]xygen machines that would be powered by solar panels during a blackout will turn off\u201d and \u201c[e]ssential medications that require USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 74 of 9245refrigeration will warm and spoil. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37 (J.A 950).EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions are not just an enormous loss to Plaintiffs and the American people. They defy Congress \u2019 s objectives for authorizing and funding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: to provide financial assistance to pollution-reducing projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (c)(3)(A). By directing Citibank to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money, the government is making it impossible for Plaintiffs to serve as reliable funding partners, ruining their prospects for securing future partnerships, favorable loan terms, qualified staff, and federal grant funding. As one Plaintiff explained:To be an effective financing counterparty, CGC (or any organization) must have certainty of funding sources, be able to move efficiently and reliably in negotiations, and be viewed as credible by involved parties. CGC is made ineffective if potential partners cannot rely on when CGC \u2019 s capital will become available. No credible counterparty will take this funding risk, or be willing to be associated financially with CGC.Kauffman Decl. \u00b6 13 (J.A 429). That reputational harm is devastating to Plaintiffs. Because \u201cpart of [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] purpose is to bridge market failures and attract private co-investment to projects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, confidence in [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] commitments as . . . investor[s] is vital to achieving buy-in from private sector investors. . . . The longer the freeze on [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] funds continues, the more difficult it will be for [them] to originate deals and secure co-investors. \u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23 (J.A 430-31). Worse, the agency \u2019 s action contrary to Congress \u2019 enactment sets off a cycle of skepticism. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 75 of 9246When Plaintiffs \u2019 hard-won partnerships with private investors and community lenders initially hesitant to fund clean-energy projects evaporate, those partners will be all the more reluctant to invest in similar ventures in the future. Plaintiffs \u201chave had to work hard to build relationships and to earn a reputation as [] trustworthy, reliable lending institution[s],\u201d and the \u201cknock-on effects\u201d of the damage EPA has caused to their reputations \u201cwill delay adoption and therefore achievement of GGRF \u2019 s mission. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (J.A 947).These harms are the very definition of irreparable injury. Once a lender \u2019 s reputation as a stable source of promised funding is compromised, it is difficult, if not impossible, to repair. Indeed, investors and loan applicants have already pulled out of near-final agreements due to the uncertainty over whether Plaintiffs will be able to access their funds. Projects underway that miss key deadlines due to Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to make good on their loan commitments will be shut down permanently.More broadly, the distrust bred by EPA \u2019 s actions will make it exceedingly difficult to revive the coordination and cooperation between nonprofit organizations, private investors, private businesses, and community lenders critical to carrying out Congress \u2019 s objective of building important projects at low public cost by spending government grant money to leverage private investment. What is more, without a court-ordered injunction, the government \u2019 s actions portend that EPA will drain the money from Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts with no apparent avenue for Plaintiffs to reclaim it. Once EPA successfully terminates the awards and moves the funds back to Treasury\u2014as it intends to do as soon as the district court \u2019 s injunction is lifted, see Oral Arg. Tr. 4:14-16\u2014it is unlikely that a court would be able to order their return to Plaintiffs or take any other action to fulfill the agency \u2019 s congressional mandate. See City USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 76 of 9247of Houston, Tex. v. Dep \u2019 t of Hous. &amp; Urb.

(explaining that EPA cannot re-obligate the grant funds, nor can a court order it to do so, because the appropriation authorizing those funds expired in September 2024). Under such circumstances, any eventual judicial declaration that the terminations were unlawful would be a hollow victory.On the other side of the ledger, the government claims that allowing Plaintiffs to access their funding will cause \u201csubstantial and irreparable harm to the public fisc. \u201d Gov. Br. 41. But as the government itself submits, its \u201cbases for termination were the grants \u2019 structure and terms\u201d which \u201creflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,\u201d not anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government insists that it is \u201cnot accusing anybody of fraud. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 27:16. That is, the government no longer disputes that Plaintiffs are using the award funds as initially instructed by EPA, and as mandated by Congress. It is hard to see how the public is harmed by Plaintiffs \u2019 use of money allotted by Congress to carry out its duly enacted policies.C. Tucker ActThe government attempts to divert this court \u2019 s attention from its brazenly unlawful actions by arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claims. But the district court at a minimum had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 77 of 9248meritorious separation of powers claim. That alone provides jurisdiction for the preliminary injunction.In any event, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that the Tucker Act bars Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA is wrong. Plaintiffs are not seeking reinstatement of their grant awards or any other form of specific performance of contracts. Nor are they seeking payment of funds from the Treasury. Their suit challenges the government \u2019 s decision to illegally seize their property\u2014money in bank accounts opened in their names, in which the government has only a security interest (which it has not exercised). The grant awards define that money as \u201cgross income earned by\u201d Plaintiffs, meaning that title to the money passed to Plaintiffs when the award funds were deposited in their Citibank accounts. Grant Award at 53 (J.A 1134) (quoting 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.1).Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the funds in their accounts is cemented by the Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, and each grantee, which specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for [Plaintiffs],\u201d and that Plaintiffs are \u201cthe entitlement holder[s] with respect to all financial assets credited from time to time to the Accounts. \u201d J.A 1144. Citibank \u2019 s status as a \u201cfiduciary of the government,\u201d Maj. Op. 14\u2014in which capacity it promises to maintain accounts for Plaintiffs, allow them to \u201caccess and use funds\u201d in their accounts, and provide view access to EPA, Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7\u00a7 I.A.1, I.D.1 (J.A 2145, 2149)\u2014changes nothing about Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the money in their accounts. That Citibank has a contractual obligation to the government to serve as a custodian of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds does not mean that the government owns the funds.Indeed, Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the award funds, which allows the award to serve as a liquid asset instead of an inherently USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 78 of 9249risky \u201cexpected income stream,\u201d is critical to Congress \u2019 s decision to equip grantees to attract private investment and is one of the reasons EPA selected the financial agent structure. Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 7-14. Plaintiffs thus seek an equitable remedy \u201cfor the recovery of specific property or monies,\u201d which stands in contradistinction to money damages, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S 879, 893 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added), the \u201cprototypical contract remedy,\u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.The nature of the relief that Plaintiffs seek\u2014recovery of property that is lawfully theirs\u2014suffices to resolve the Tucker Act question against the government. Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S 731 (1947), reflects that longstanding principle. There, the plaintiff sought an injunction preventing the U.S Maritime Commission from selling shares of stock that the plaintiff alleged it owned under a contract with the Commission. Id. at 734. The Court held that the district court had jurisdiction over the case even though the plaintiff \u2019 s alleged right to the disputed property originated in a contract and depended on interpreting the contract in its favor. The Court nonetheless recognized that the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cclaim rests on [its] right under general law to recover possession of specific property wrongfully withheld\u201d\u2014a claim sounding in tort, not contract. Id. at 735-36. That was so even though the government possessed and had \u201crecord title\u201d to the property. Id. at 737. As the Court explained:[P]ublic officials may become tort-feasors by exceeding the limits of their authority. And where they unlawfully seize or hold a citizen \u2019 s realty or chattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or in equity, he is not relegated to the Court of Claims to recover a money judgment. The dominant interest of the sovereign is then on the side of the victim whoUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 79 of 9250may bring his possessory action to reclaim that which is wrongfully withheld.Id. at 738.We acknowledged in Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis the line drawn in Land v. Dollar between claims to property acquired by contract\u2014which may proceed in district court\u2014and claims to enforce rights to contractual proceeds, which must proceed in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act: \u201cThe Supreme Court many years ago recognized a private party \u2019 s cause of action outside the Tucker Act to challenge the statutory authority of federal officials to claim ownership rights in property allegedly transferred during the course of a contract. \u201d 672 F.2d at 968-69. That principle confirms the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction here. Moreover, these cases underscore that a claim to recover property need not be framed as an unconstitutional taking to proceed in district court.Plaintiffs claim that EPA has unlawfully interfered with their previously disbursed funds in violation of, inter alia, the APA. Appellee Br. at 15. Plaintiffs assert that EPA has \u201cunlawfully seize[d]\u201d their property, and they seek an injunction to \u201creclaim that which is wrongfully withheld. \u201d Dollar, 330 U.S at 738. This case is even clearer in that regard than Land v. Dollar itself, because the government has neither title to nor possession of the disputed funds. Plaintiffs \u2019 action is one to recover their property. It does not seek any money from the Treasury. It is not a contract action so is not \u201crelegated to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. As in Megapulse, Plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cposition is ultimately based, not on breach of contract, but on an alleged governmental infringement of property rights and violation of [a statute]. \u201d 672 F.2d at 969.The Supreme Court itself recently recognized that distinction in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine AdvocacyUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 80 of 9251Coalition, where it declined to stay a district court order requiring the government to issue payments owed to plaintiffs for foreign aid work they had already completed. 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025). The government argued there, as here, that the plaintiffs essentially sought to enforce a government contract so must proceed, if at all, in the Court of Claims. See id. at 756 (Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., dissenting from the denial of the application to vacate the district court \u2019 s order). The Court was unpersuaded that the government thus was likely to establish a sovereign immunity bar against the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Id. at 753. Like the grantees here, the plaintiffs in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition brought APA and constitutional challenges to defendants \u2019 interference with their existing entitlement to grant funding. Their claims depended not on breach of their contracts, but on the unlawfulness of the government \u2019 s actions. The district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA and constitutional claims here is even clearer than it was in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, because here, unlike there, payment was already made.Those same facts\u2014that Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing the government from interfering with money the government has already properly disbursed to them\u2014renders inapplicable the Supreme Court \u2019 s emergency stay orders in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25-A-103, 2025 WL 2415669 (Aug. 21, 2025), and Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025). I respect the reasoning of those orders where they apply, but no part of the district court \u2019 s injunction in this case \u201corder[s] the payment of money\u201d from the Treasury or requires the government to \u201cpay out past-due grant obligations\u201d or to \u201ccontinue paying obligations as they accrue. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Ed., 145 S. Ct. at 968. And, unlike plaintiffs in National Institutes of Health, Plaintiffs here need not seek to enforce theUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 81 of 9252government \u2019 s \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d 2025 WL 2415669, at *1, because these Plaintiffs \u2019 money was already paid before Defendants interfered with it.Rather, what Plaintiffs seek here is to unfreeze their funds and to enjoin EPA from unlawfully interfering with them based on the President \u2019 s announced policy disagreement with Congress \u2019 s objectives. In doing so, Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s decision to replace Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice with one aligning with the President \u2019 s directions. See Executive Order 14154 (ordering agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by stopping the \u201cdisbursement of funds\u201d); J.A 507 (Defendants opposition to motion for preliminary injunction describing contract terminations as \u201creflect[ing] no more than a decision based on reasons of policy\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115-16 (finding that EPA \u201cseeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter\u201d). To the extent National Institutes of Health applies here, it supports the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the policy-based interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. See National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (Barrett, J., concurring) (asserting that a district court likely has jurisdiction over challenges to an agency \u2019 s policies).Binding precedent of this court anchors the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Our \u201clongstanding test for determining whether a claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court pursuant to the Tucker Act\u201d confirms that the Tucker Act does not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106. We explained in Megapulse that, in order to preserve the Court of Claims \u2019 exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cactions based on government contracts,\u201d a plaintiff whose \u201cclaims against the United States are essentially contractual\u201d cannot be allowed to \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 82 of 9253the Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would enable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate statute. \u201d 672 F.2d at 967. Whether a \u201cparticular action\u201d is \u201c\u2018at its essence \u2019 a contract action depends both on [1] the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon [2] the type of relief sought (or appropriate). \u201d Id. at 968. That is a flexible, context-specific inquiry that directs us to \u201cdetermine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract action that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id.Starting with the first prong, to determine whether the \u201csource of the rights\u201d of a claim is contractual, we consider whether the plaintiff \u2019 s arguments turn on the terms of the contract. In Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, for instance, we concluded that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201ca disguised contract action\u201d because the plaintiff did not \u201cseek to enforce any duty imposed upon [the government] by the [relevant contract],\u201d nor did it \u201ccontend [the government] breached the terms\u201d of the contract or \u201cinvoke\u201d the contract in any other meaningful way. 864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in Megapulse, we were \u201cconvinced\u201d that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201cdisguised\u201d contract claims by the fact that the plaintiff did not \u201cclaim a breach of contract\u201d and based its \u201crequest for relief\u201d on non-contractual documents. 672 F.2d at 969.Plaintiffs \u2019 APA challenge to Defendants \u2019 arbitrary and capricious action is clearly not a \u201cdisguised contract action. \u201d Their claim is not premised on EPA \u2019 s violation of the grant agreements \u2019 termination provisions, nor on its failure to perform any duty \u201cimposed\u201d on EPA by the grant award. Rather, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to relief because EPA froze and seeks to seize their funds based on pretextual, internally inconsistent, and unfounded reasons. See, e.g , USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 83 of 9254Plaintiffs \u2019 Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (PI Mot.) 29 (J.A 327) (arguing that \u201cthe record leading up to the termination\u201d\u2014for example, the fact that EPA purported to terminate the grants several days after professing a \u201clack of critical information\u201d about \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud\u201d that would be informed by an ongoing compliance review\u2014\u201chighlights the pretextual nature of EPA \u2019 s stated invocation of waste, fraud, and abuse\u201d). According to Plaintiffs, and as supported by the record, EPA acted entirely outside the bounds of acceptable agency action by first deciding to seize the money Plaintiffs had been awarded and then casting about for after-the-fact justifications\u2014including pressuring Citibank into freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds without any basis, notice, or explanation, and directing DOJ and FBI to open criminal investigations into Plaintiffs \u2019 grant performance without probable cause, or any grounds whatsoever. See PI Mot. 1-4 (J.A 299-302).That is precisely the type of arbitrary and capricious action the APA is designed to address. As the Supreme Court explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency \u2019 s \u201cstated rationale was pretextual,\u201d because \u201ccontrived reasons . . . defeat the purpose of\u201d the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law. \u201d 588 U.S at 773-74, 785. The non-contractual \u201cessence\u201d of Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim has been clear since Plaintiffs filed their complaint and sought a preliminary injunction. They have from the outset sought to show that EPA \u2019 s vague, unsupported, and irrational justifications are merely \u201cpretextual cover to shut down a program approved by Congress that the new Administration does not like. \u201d PI Mot. 29 (J.A 327). That was clear to the district court from the very first hearing. See Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 9:17-18 (J.A 182) (district court observing that the terminations have \u201ca ready, fire, aim\u201d feel). Plaintiffs seek relief based on a quintessential claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action. The APA, andUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 84 of 9255not the contractual terms of the grants EPA awarded them, is the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.As for the second prong of the Megapulse analysis\u2014the \u201ctype of relief sought\u201d\u2014we have described the \u201ccrux of this inquiry\u201d as \u201cboil[ing] down to whether the plaintiff effectively seeks to attain . . . monetary relief from the federal government. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. As explained above, Plaintiffs do not seek money from the Treasury; they seek only to get the government \u2019 s hands off their money. To the extent the injunction preventing the government from interfering with or seizing their funds \u201crequire[s] the same governmental restraint that specific []performance might require in a contract setting,\u201d that is an \u201cinsufficient basis to deny a district court the jurisdiction otherwise available and the remedial powers otherwise appropriate. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971.Both prongs of the Megapulse analysis thus point to the same conclusion: Plaintiffs \u2019 claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action is not a \u201cdisguised\u201d contract action that must be heard by the Court of Claims. That conclusion comports with our longstanding recognition that the Tucker Act was a response to \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. The \u201cunique expertise of the Court of Claims\u201d lies in its \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process,\u201d id.; it is a \u201cspecialized forum\u201d for awarding \u201cdamages for the Government \u2019 s past acts,\u201d Bowen, 487 U.S at 905 n.42, 908 (internal quotation marks omitted).It is far outside the specialized expertise of the Court of Claims to resolve these Plaintiffs \u2019 request for injunctive relief halting EPA \u2019 s naked pursuit of its preferred policy outcome in disregard for the evidence before it and its statutory mandate. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 85 of 9256Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA violated the APA \u2019 s ban on arbitrary and capricious agency action\u2014a claim for which they seek injunctive relief, not payment from the Treasury\u2014is well within the district court \u2019 s remit.That Plaintiffs would have no right to the money to begin with but for the grant awards, which are government contracts, does not alter that conclusion. We have squarely held that the fact that a plaintiff \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d absent a government contract does not mean that the plaintiff asserts a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (explaining that imposing such a \u201c\u2018but-for \u2019 test for identifying the source of the right . . . contravenes Megapulse \u2019 s express rejection of the argument that the mere existence of such contract-related issues converts the action to one based on the contract\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 610 (D.C Cir. 1992) (\u201c[L]itigants may bring statutory and constitutional claims in federal district court even when the claims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the government. \u201d), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 620.At bottom, the government suggests that Plaintiffs \u2019 real complaint is that EPA terminated their grant awards\u2014not that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so\u2014making its claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim. It is obviously true that Plaintiffs are injured by the terminations. But it does not follow that Plaintiffs therefore assert contractual claims. When EPA began its campaign to undo the GGRF, it had already performed on the contracts by disbursing the funds, which by then belonged to Plaintiffs. The fact that those funds may only be used in accordance with grant terms does not mean Plaintiffs \u2019 only legal right to protect them arises from contract. As explained above, Plaintiffs \u2019 theory of relief is that EPA USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 86 of 9257carried out the funding freeze and purported terminations to replace Congress \u2019 s policy choice with its own preferred approach, without regard for whether its actions were supported by evidence or reason. That is a classic claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA. That is what makes the APA, and not their grant awards, the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff[s] base[] [their] claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.Because Plaintiffs bring legitimate APA and constitutional claims over which the district court has jurisdiction, I would not reach their ultra vires theory. But to the extent the majority concludes that Plaintiffs \u2019 ultra vires claim fails because Plaintiffs \u201cessentially\u201d allege only a breach of contract, the majority errs. Maj. Op. 21-22. For all the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual.Citing Ingersoll-Rand, the majority posits that Plaintiffs \u2019 allegations of pretextual agency action are contract claims because \u201cthat challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law\u201d\u2014that is, Plaintiffs \u2019 pretext argument could be rephrased as a claim that EPA \u201cdishonor[ed], with impunity, its contractual obligations. \u201d Maj. Op. 17. But Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual just because EPA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious action included grant terminations. The majority appears to read Ingersoll-Rand as establishing a rule that any claim that could be reconceptualized as a contractual violation that overlaps even in part with the claim Plaintiffs actually bring is necessarily a disguised contract claim. See Maj. Op. 16. Ingersoll-Rand announces no such rule, and any effort to interpret it to do squarely conflicts with our binding precedent.In Ingersoll-Rand, the government terminated its contract with the plaintiff \u201cfor convenience,\u201d as allowed under the terms USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 87 of 9258of the contract. Id. at 75. The plaintiff sued, alleging that the termination violated several regulations constraining the government \u2019 s ability to cancel and administer federal acquisition contracts, and that those regulatory violations meant that the termination was arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 77. We held that the \u201cessential rights at stake\u201d were contractual because the regulations themselves\u2014the violation of which was allegedly arbitrary and capricious\u2014concerned the conditions under which the government could terminate the contract. Id. at 77-78. In effect, the plaintiff had relied on regulations circumscribing the government \u2019 s behavior during the solicitation and performance of contracts to challenge the validity of the contract \u2019 s termination-for-convenience provision. The plaintiff \u2019 s claim thus \u201ccall[ed] for knowledge of the government contracting process\u201d and fell \u201cwithin the unique expertise of the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. at 78. In that context, in which the plaintiff \u2019 s claim centered on the intricacies of the government \u2019 s contracting process and the interaction between contracting regulations and the terms of the plaintiff \u2019 s contract, it made sense to hold that the plaintiff \u2019 s ability to \u201cchallenge the termination based solely on contract principles\u201d supported our determination that its claim \u201csound[ed] genuinely in contract. \u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).Ingersoll-Rand thus establishes that claims that invoke regulations governing federal contracting to challenge government action taken pursuant to a contract are \u201cin essence\u201d contractual and belong in the Court of Claims, where that court \u2019 s expertise in government contracting is particularly relevant. And it supports the majority \u2019 s conclusion that claims based on violations of regulations governing termination procedures are \u201cin essence\u201d contract claims, which is likely correct. See Maj. Op. 11-13. But that does not describe Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Ingersoll-RandUSCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 88 of 9259decidedly does not stand for a general rule that any claim that could have been framed as a breach of \u201cprinciples of federal contract law\u201d must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims\u201d Maj. Op. 17\u2014a rule that could not be squared with our other relevant decisions.That is illustrated most clearly by Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521 (D.C Cir. 1986), a decision authored by then-Judge Scalia and decided the year after Ingersoll-Rand. The plaintiff in Sharp challenged a Department of Defense policy removing him from the Ready Reserve where he served pursuant to a contract\u2014the Ready Reserve Service Agreement. 798 F.2d at 1521-23. The plaintiff alleged that the policy breached his contract and violated a statute governing the Ready Reserve, and that the contract gave him a \u201cvested property interest\u201d in serving in the reserves that the government \u201csought to deny without due process. \u201d Id. at 1523. The plaintiff \u2019 s requested relief included a declaration that the policy was \u201ccontrary to statute or in the alternative that it effects a material breach of the Ready Reserve Service Agreement,\u201d as well as a declaration that the government \u2019 s \u201cfailure to honor the terms of that contract deprived [the plaintiff] of due process. \u201d Id. We held that, while the Tucker Act barred the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s breach of contract claim, it did not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claims that the policy was \u201ccontrary to regulations, statutes and the Constitution. \u201d Id.; accord Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610. That is, the plaintiff \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims that he had been unlawfully deprived of his contractual right to serve in the Ready Reserve were not \u201cin essence\u201d contractual even though his right to serve in the first place depended on contract, and he expressly brought one claim as a pure breach of contract. USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 89 of 9260The majority \u2019 s view of Ingersoll-Rand cannot be reconciled with Sharp. Allen Sharp \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims not only could be based on contract principles, but in fact were also framed that way. If the majority \u2019 s rule were right, the district court could not have exercised jurisdiction over his due process claim. The same analysis is confirmed in Megapulse itself. There, the plaintiff alleged that the government \u2019 s plan to distribute his data violated the Trade Secrets Act and deprived him of his property without due process. 672 F.2d at 962-63. That claim, too, could have been based solely on contract principles, as the government had made a contractual promise not to disseminate the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201climited rights\u201d data. Id. at 962. But that counterfactual did not preclude us from holding\u2014nor even factor into our conclusion\u2014that the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claim. See id. at 966-71.Indeed, in Megapulse, we expressly rejected the idea that the Tucker Act means that \u201can agency action may not be enjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply because that same action might also amount to a breach of contract. \u201d Id. at 971. Rather, district courts have jurisdiction over and can enjoin agency action that violates the APA, even if that action also \u201camounts to\u201d a breach of contract. Id. That is the situation here: Plaintiffs claim that EPA \u2019 s termination was arbitrary and capricious because it relied on pretextual and unsupported justifications, not because it violated the grant award \u2019 s termination provision. The fact that the government \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious decision making could be reframed as a claim that \u201cEPA acted with \u2018impunity \u2019 when terminating the grants\u201d does not transform the claim into a contract action.In relegating to the Court of Claims any statutory, regulatory, or constitutional claim merely because it arguably could to some extent be reframed as a contract action, the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 90 of 9261majority \u2019 s rule precludes district court jurisdiction and injunctive relief for a wide swath of claims that\u2014like Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA \u2019 s actions to freeze their accounts and terminate their grants were arbitrary and capricious\u2014are simply not contract claims. Such a rule effects an unprecedented expansion of the Tucker Act that is divorced from the \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78, and it strips district courts of jurisdiction over all manner of claims over which they have the relevant expertise. It also threatens to \u201cpreclude any review at all of constitutional claims seeking equitable relief, where the constitutional claims stem from contracts,\u201d thereby raising \u201cserious constitutional question[s]. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 611 (internal quotation marks omitted). And it flies in the face of our cases \u2019 longstanding refrain that \u201cthe mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968). Such a rule is unsupported by our precedent, prevents the court from making \u201crational distinctions between actions sounding genuinely in contract and those based on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d and runs directly counter to our acknowledgement that, \u201c[a]lthough it is important on the one hand to preserve the Tucker Act \u2019 s limited and conditioned waiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not do so in terms so broad as to deny a [district] court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual relationship with the government. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968-70.As applied in this case, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are merely contract claims ignores what the USCA Case #25-5123 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 91 of 9262agency did and describes a claim that Plaintiffs did not bring. This case is not an attempt to reframe EPA \u2019 s termination or violation of some grant awards as unlawful agency action. Indeed, throughout this litigation, there has hardly been any dispute that the government did breach the terms of the grant awards. That is not what this case is about. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s asserted power to take baseless and unjustifiable actions to pursue its desired ends\u2014here, the termination of the grant awards\u2014regardless of the means it must employ to get there. It is beyond dispute that questions of such significance to the way our government operates are not relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.CONCLUSIONEmbracing a misguided and breathtakingly expansive conception of the Tucker Act, the majority allows the government to seize Plaintiffs \u2019 money based on spurious and pretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation of major congressional legislation designed to improve the infrastructure, health, and economic security of communities throughout the country. The injunction the district court put in place is eminently supported by Plaintiffs \u2019 likelihood of success on both their APA and constitutional claims, the irreparable harm that will befall them, and the unlawful nullification of Congress \u2019 s duly enacted policy\u2014all of which inure to the detriment of the American people. I respectfully dissent.

Citing concerns about conflicts of interest and lack of oversight, EPA terminated the grants in March 2025. The grantees sued, and the district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering EPA and Citibank to continue funding the grants.We conclude the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, and therefore jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we vacate the injunction. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 3 of 924I.This case involves EPA grants awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, for which Congress appropriated $27 billion. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-169, \u00a7 60103, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065 \u2013 67 (formerly codified at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (2024)). In August 2024, EPA awarded $20 billion to eight nonprofits pursuant to two of the grant programs it created: the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. Five of those grantees are plaintiffs in this case: Climate United Fund ($6.97 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Power Forward Communities, Inc. ($2 billion), Inclusiv, Inc. ($1.87 billion), and Justice Climate Fund, Inc. ($940 million).Each grant was memorialized in an agreement between the nonprofit and EPA. The grant agreements have an unusual structure. Typically, grant funds are held by the U.S Treasury and disbursed incrementally as grantees use the funds for program purposes. EPA structured these grants with a middleman that would hold the funds as a \u201cfinancial agent\u201d of the United States. According to EPA, this was the first time the federal government used a financial agent, as opposed to Treasury, to carry out this kind of grant program. Treasury entered a Financial Agency Agreement (\u201cFAA\u201d) with Citibank. As set forth in the grant agreements, the funds were to be transferred from Treasury to Citibank in a \u201ctwo-step transaction\u201d involving a \u201cdrawdown\u201d by the grantee and a subsequent \u201cdisbursement\u201d to the appropriate Citibank account. J.A 566. The disbursement by the grantee is deemed \u201can allowable cost\u201d under \u201cthe EPA award. \u201d Id.Although the funds are held at Citibank, the grantees \u2019 use of the funds remains highly restricted. The money may be used only \u201cfor the purposes and under the conditions of the [grant USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 4 of 925agreement],\u201d and \u201cmust be maintained\u201d at Citibank until the end of the grant \u2019 s period of performance. J.A 568. The grantees \u2019 use of the funds is further restricted by Account Control Agreements (\u201cACAs\u201d) between EPA, Citibank, and each of the grantees. The ACAs give the government a \u201cright to exclusive control\u201d over the Citibank accounts. J.A 72. If the government exercises that right, Citibank must follow the government \u2019 s transfer instructions \u201cwithout further consent by the [grantee]. \u201d Id. The ACAs expressly acknowledge that Citibank \u201cact[s] as a financial agent of the United States pursuant to the authority of the U.S Department of the Treasury. \u201d J.A 71.The sheer scale of the grant program and the method of allocating billions of dollars drew public attention and criticism. The record includes a widely publicized video in which an EPA employee was recorded describing how \u201cuntil recently\u201d his role was to make sure proper \u201cprocesses are in place to \u2026 prevent fraud and to prevent abuse,\u201d but after the election of President Donald Trump, EPA was \u201cjust trying to get the money out as fast as possible before they come in and \u2026 stop it all. \u201d J.A 705 n.1 The employee compared the situation to \u201cthrowing gold bars off the Titanic. \u201dThe month before President Trump \u2019 s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements\u2014with no apparent consideration from the grantees\u2014to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.1 The week before the1 In December 2024, the government unilaterally modified the grant agreements, including by (1) eliminating any reference to termination for agency priorities; (2) requiring \u201ccredible evidence \u2026 of a violation of Federal criminal law\u201d before the government could exercise its contractual right to terminate for waste, fraud, or abuse; and (3) giving the grantees an expanded right USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 5 of 926inauguration, EPA amended the ACAs to require Citibank to \u201ccontinue to disburse funds\u201d to the grantees, even if the government exercised its right of exclusive control, if the funds are \u201cassociated with financial obligations \u2018properly incurred \u2019 \u201d before the government exercised its right. J.A 658.After the change in administration, EPA reviewed the grants and raised concerns about conflicts of interest during the award process, the political connections of the chosen grantees, lack of government oversight and control over tens of billions of dollars, and last-minute amendments to the grant agreements and ACAs.2 In February 2025, the FBI recommended to Citibank that it \u201cplace an administrative freeze on the account(s) associated with\u201d the grantees \u2019 ACAs. As the government \u2019 s financial agent, Citibank complied and stopped disbursing funds to the grantees. EPA also referred the matter to the Office of Inspector General for investigation. Shortly thereafter, EPA terminated the grant agreements.The grantees sued, seeking to enjoin the terminations as unconstitutional, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious. They sought a preliminary injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank toto cure any nonperformance. There is no serious dispute that these modifications increased the likelihood that a termination by the incoming administration would constitute a breach of contract.2 For example, the Acting Deputy Administrator averred in a letter to the EPAInspector General that \u201cthe former director of the [Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund], personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital \u2013 without recusing himself. \u201d J.A 670. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 6 of 927resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d J.A 171 \u2013 72.The district court entered the injunction. It first held that it had jurisdiction because the grantees \u2019 claims were not essentially contractual and therefore did not need to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A , 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107 \u2013 11 (D.D.C 2025). On the merits, the court concluded the grantees were likely to succeed on their constitutional, regulatory, and arbitrary and capricious claims. The district court found the balance of harms supported an injunction because the nonprofits exist \u201cto fulfill the objectives of a grant\u201d and \u201csufficient protections [are] in place\u201d to prevent \u201creckless spending. \u201d Id. at 117, 120. The district court further concluded that an injunction \u201chalt[ing] any unlawful action\u201d serves the public interest. Id. at 121. The court enjoined Citibank as well, requiring it to disburse funds according to the relevant agreements.We administratively stayed the injunction and ordered the parties to take no action \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d with respect to the disputed funds, thereby prohibiting the grantees from making further commitments in reliance on the disputed funds. We then accelerated consideration of the merits of the appeal.II.While this litigation was pending, Congress enacted legislation repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. See Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 154 (2025) (repealing 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 and rescinding \u201cunobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section\u201d). Our partial administrative stay did not lift the portion of the district court \u2019 s order enjoining the grant terminations, so the funds at issue in this case remain at Citibank and remainUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 7 of 928obligated. Congress \u2019 s repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund therefore did not render this appeal moot.We review the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, its underlying legal conclusions de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 726 (D.C Cir. 2022). We consider the same Winter factors the district court applied, which require a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction to establish that it \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. \u201d Id. at 727 (quoting Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S 7, 20 (2008)).III.The district court erred in concluding the grantees are likely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, and constitutional claims. See Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C Cir. 2014) (describing likelihood of success on the merits as the \u201cmost important factor\u201d when considering a preliminary injunction). The grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims, and their constitutional claim is meritless.A.The grantees first allege the termination of their grants violated Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) regulations and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). As a remedy, they sought and received an injunction barring the termination of their grants and restoring access to the funds held by Citibank. We conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over these USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 8 of 929claims, which are essentially contractual and therefore must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.31.The federal government enjoys sovereign immunity and may be subject to suit only when it has explicitly waived that immunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S 392, 399 (1976). Waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed to protect the prerogatives of the government and to ensure the courts stay within the jurisdiction provided by Congress. See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S 187, 192 (1996); Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S 682, 703 \u2013 05 (1949). The grantees brought their claims in district court, invoking the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity, which applies to claims \u201cseeking relief other than money damages. \u201d 5 U.S.C \u00a7 702. But this waiver applies only if no \u201cother statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought. \u201d Id. For contract claims against the government, the Tucker Act establishes review in the Court of Federal Claims, which may award only damages and cannot provide3 Although the dissent considers this threshold jurisdictional question a \u201cdiver[sion],\u201d Dissenting Op. 47, our authority to assess the lawfulness of EPA \u2019 s actions of course depends on having jurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 94 (1998). Concluding that jurisdiction over most of these claims lies with the Court of Federal Claims, we do not reach their merits. The dissent inverts this fundamental limitation on Article III courts by recounting at great length the integrity and virtue of the previous administration \u2019 s efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and the alleged misdeeds of the current administration in terminating the grants. Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity of the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Politico. See Dissenting Op. 11, 12, 14, 36. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 9 of 9210declaratory or injunctive relief except in narrow circumstances. See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491; Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 963 n.13 (D.C Cir. 1982); Walters v. Sec \u2019 y of Defense, 725 F.2d 107, 112 n.10 (D.C Cir. 1983).When it applies, Tucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and precludes jurisdiction in district court under the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.4 See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C Cir. 1992). The Court of Federal Claims is the \u201csingle, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). Because Congress has limited the forum and the remedies for contract claims against the government, a litigant whose claim is essentially contractual cannot \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act\u201d by simply asking for injunctive relief in district court. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967; Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613 (\u201c[T]he APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d).This jurisdictional inquiry cannot turn on a plaintiff \u2019 s preferred characterization of its claim, lest we \u201cupset the carefully modulated waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of remedies for breach of contract embodied in the Tucker Act. \u201d Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 580 (D.C Cir. 1975); see also McKay v. United States,4 The Tucker Act contains one exception to this rule, not relevant in this suit involving billions of dollars. Damages claims not exceeding $10,000 may be brought in district court, although the Tucker Act \u2019 s remedial restrictions still apply. See 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1346(a)(2); Int \u2019 l Eng \u2019 g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 577 n.4 (D.C Cir. 1975); see also Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-563, \u00a7\u00a7 3(a), 10(a), 14(a), 92 Stat. 2383, 2383 \u2013 84, 2388 \u2013 89 (limiting exception to non-procurement claims). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 10 of 9211516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[I]n the contract context, a distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign \u2019 s immunity from being compelled to perform obligations it prefers to breach and compensate financially, holding that what are \u2018in essence \u2019 claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the Tucker Act and its prohibition on equitable relief by being artfully pled as something else. \u201d).To determine whether jurisdiction was proper in the district court, we must therefore assess whether the grantees \u2019 claims are essentially contractual. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 \u2013 68. The fact that the grantees \u2019 \u201ccomplaint nowhere mentions breach of contract \u2026 cannot alone suffice to establish jurisdiction in the District Court. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77. Instead, for each claim we consider (1) whether \u201cthe source of the rights\u201d asserted is contractual or is \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds\u201d and (2) whether \u201cthe type of relief sought\u201d is a typical contract remedy. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 \u2013 71; see Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.2.The grantees first allege EPA \u2019 s termination of their agreements violated OMB regulations. By terminating for \u201cagency priorities,\u201d EPA allegedly relied on a basis for termination not set forth in the grant agreements, in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4). Furthermore, EPA allegedly failed to provide written notice of termination as required by 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a). Despite the grantees \u2019 characterization, their claims are essentially contractual and therefore the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear them.First, the source of the grantees \u2019 right to the relief they seek is their agreements, which are contracts for Tucker Act purposes. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) (per curiam); Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp. v. United States,USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 11 of 9212990 F.3d 1330, 1338 \u2013 41 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Medina v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2231 (2025) (explaining that courts have historically described federal grants as contracts). Each grantee \u2019 s right to the funds arises \u201conly upon creation and satisfaction of its contract with the government; in no sense d[oes] it exist independently of that contract. \u201d Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C Cir. 1985). While the grantees attempt to ground their claims in OMB guidance, the substance of these claims may be understood \u201cas entirely contained within the terms of the contract\u201d or in principles of contract law. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.The claim that EPA violated 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4) expressly refers to and incorporates the grant agreements. The grantees interpret this OMB guidance as prohibiting the government from terminating based on agency priorities unless the grant agreements reserve the right to terminate on those grounds. Even assuming this is what the guidance requires, the grantees \u2019 claim turns on the government \u2019 s rights under the agreements\u2014a question of contract interpretation that the parties fiercely dispute. Because this claim perforce incorporates the grant agreements, it is not based \u201csolely\u201d on the regulation or on \u201ctruly independent legal grounds. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78; Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70.The claim that EPA failed to give proper notice of termination in violation of 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.341(a) is not an independent legal ground for a slightly different reason. This allegation \u201ccould be phrased\u201d as a claim that the government stopped performing on the contract without sufficient warning. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. Federal contract law addresses USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 12 of 9213when defective notice by the government is actionable,5 and therefore the substance of the grantees \u2019 claim can be analyzed \u201csolely on contract principles. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. As we have explained, the fact that the government \u2019 s termination of a contract \u201calso arguably violates certain other regulations does not transform the action into one based solely on those regulations. \u201d Id. Indeed, \u201c[i]f the mere allegation\u201d of violations of the regulations governing federal contracting and grantmaking \u201cwere to bring claims of this type within the jurisdiction of the district court, Congress \u2019 intent to limit contract remedies against the government to damages in the [Court of Federal Claims] would be effectively circumvented. \u201d Id. (cleaned up). Because the substance of the grantees \u2019 notice claim sounds in federal contract law, the claim is essentially contractual and can be heard only in the Court of Federal Claims. The grantees cannot avoid the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional channeling by disguising a breach of contract claim as a claim that the government violated the regulations governing grantmaking.Furthermore, the guidance documents on which the grantees rely likely do not create enforceable private rights because they merely set out principles for agencies to follow when making grants. See Guidance for Federal Financial Assistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089 \u2013 90 (Apr. 22, 2024). These guidance provisions fall within subtitle A of Title 2, which sets forth OMB \u2019 s \u201cguidance to Federal agencies on5 See, e.g , Decker &amp; Co. v. West, 76 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201c[H]arm should accompany a defect in an otherwise proper termination notice in order for the contractor to seek relief based on that defect. \u201d); Philadelphia Regent Builders v. United States, 634 F.2d 569, 572 \u2013 73 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (declining to treat government \u2019 s termination as defective because government \u2019 s regulatory violations were \u201charmless technical defects\u201d). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 13 of 9214government-wide policies for the award and administration of Federal financial assistance. \u201d 2 C.F.R \u00a7 1.100(a). \u201cPublication of the OMB guidance in the [Code of Federal Regulations] does not change its nature\u2014it is guidance, not regulation. \u201d Id. \u00a7 1.105(b). But in any event, as the dissent concedes, Dissenting Op. 58, these regulatory claims are essentially contractual, and we have no jurisdiction to consider them.Second, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction because the remedy the grantees seek is contractual in nature. The grantees requested an injunction barring EPA from terminating the grants, \u201cexcept as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant award, and applicable law,\u201d and ordering Citibank to resume disbursements \u201cin accordance with the ACA. \u201d The grantees maintain they own the funds and seek an injunction barring unlawful interference, rather than an order for specific performance. But the grantees \u2019 \u201cownership\u201d of the funds goes only as far as the grant agreements and the ACAs permit. And the funds are held by Citibank, which acts as a fiduciary of the government. Despite their characterization, in substance, the grantees are seeking specific performance of their agreements with the government.6 As then-Judge Scalia6 The dissent \u2019 s only legal argument that we have jurisdiction turns on the claim that the grantees have \u201ctitle\u201d to the billions of dollars in government funding. To demonstrate the grantees \u2019 ownership, however, the dissent relies on the grant agreements and the ACAs\u2014that is, on the disputed and ongoing contracts that govern the parties \u2019 relationship. Dissenting Op. 48. The dissent \u2019 s argument merely reinforces that this dispute is contractual and belongs in the Court of Federal Claims. And even assuming the grantees had somehow secured title, that would simply mean the grantees might have a Takings Clause claim for damages, a claim they have not made and which in any event would also have to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. See Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 14 of 9215explained, \u201c[t]he waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] does not run to actions seeking declaratory relief or specific performance in contract cases. \u201d7 Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C Cir. 1986). \u201c[A] complaint involving a request for specific performance must be resolved by the [Court of Federal] Claims. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 80.In sum, the grantees cannot manufacture district court jurisdiction through artful pleading. Because the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims are essentially contractual, they must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.3.Nor can the grantees repackage their contract claims by invoking the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. The grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims are also essentially2170, 2173 (2019) (explaining the Tucker Act \u201cprovides the standard procedure for bringing [takings] claims\u201d against the federal government and that \u201c[e]quitable relief [is] not available\u201d if \u201cmonetary relief \u2026 under the Tucker Act\u201d is).7 The dissent \u2019 s reliance on Sharp is entirely misplaced. In Sharp, there was no dispute that the plaintiff was a military officer, that he had an interest in his employment, and that the deprivation of that interest without due process could be litigated in district court under Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S 61, 71 (1974). See Sharp, 798 F.2d at 1523. Here, by contrast, the rights and interests of the grantees are disputed. The grantees assert they \u201cperformed\u201d on their contracts when Treasury deposited federal funds at Citibank, the government \u2019 s financial agent. Even overlooking the oddity of this argument, whether the grantees have performed depends entirely on the terms of the disputed contracts\u2014a question that must be adjudicated in the Court of Federal Claims. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 15 of 9216contractual, considering both the source of the legal right asserted and the remedy sought.The grantees assert the government acted arbitrarily because it \u201coffered no facts or individualized reasoning to justify\u201d the grant terminations. And the grantees insist they can challenge the sufficiency of the government \u2019 s reasons for terminating the grants separately from the issue of whether the terminations were allowed under the agreements. But this court has expressly and repeatedly rejected attempts to manufacture district court jurisdiction by framing contract claims as violations of the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580. Despite the grantees \u2019 characterizations, the remedy they seek is specific performance of their contracts, and they have identified no right to that relief that is \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the grant agreements. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970.As already discussed in reference to the grantees \u2019 regulatory claims, the grantees seek to set aside their grant terminations, which means they seek specific performance. Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 79 \u2013 80. This is a \u201ctypical contract remedy\u201d that indicates a claim is \u201cfounded upon a contract for purposes of the Tucker Act. \u201d Spectrum Leasing, 764 F.2d at 894 \u2013 95; see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613.The APA \u2019 s substantive bar on arbitrary and capricious action does not give the grantees an independent right to specific performance of their grant agreements. To the extent the grantees argue the government acted arbitrarily by failing to follow the terms of the grant agreements, that argument can be evaluated only by \u201creference to and incorporation of\u201d the agreements. Richardson, 512 F.2d at 578. The source of the right asserted is therefore not \u201ctruly independent\u201d of the contracts. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 16 of 9217To the extent the grantees argue the terminations were arbitrary regardless of whether they were permitted under the agreements, that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law. That law prohibits the government from \u201cdishonor[ing], with impunity, its contractual obligations\u201d even when a contract allows the government to terminate for convenience. Maxima Corp. v. United States, 847 F.2d 1549, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (cleaned up). The grantees \u2019 argument that the termination was arbitrary and capricious is simply a claim that EPA breached the grant agreements by terminating with \u201cimpunity. \u201d That claim must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.The grantees insist the APA gives them an independent right to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract terminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA \u2019 s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court.8 See Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77 \u2013 78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (\u201c[D]ecisions made by contracting officers pursuant to contract clauses fall outside the contemplation of the [APA]. \u201d). The APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action did not \u201cdestroy the Court of [Federal] Claims by implication. \u201d Richardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (cleaned up).8 The dissent \u2019 s analysis focuses on the grantees \u2019 \u201ctheory of relief\u201d and concludes that because the grantees have \u201clegitimate\u201d APA claims and request injunctive relief, the district court has jurisdiction. Dissenting Op. 56 \u2013 57. But Supreme Court and circuit precedent require that we look beyond plaintiffs \u2019 characterization of their claims and determine whether the claims are \u201cbased on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d not simply whether plaintiffs have made good faith legal arguments. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969 \u2013 70. On this central question, the dissent has nothing to offer. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 17 of 9218In sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims that the federal government terminated a grant agreement arbitrarily or with impunity. Claims of arbitrary grant termination are essentially contractual and fall outside the APA \u2019 s waiver of sovereign immunity.This conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court \u2019 s recent decision in a stay posture that a very similar arbitrary and capricious challenge to federal grant terminations likely could not be brought in district court. See Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968. In that case, state plaintiffs sued in district court and claimed the Department of Education \u2019 s decision to terminate several grants was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The district court enjoined the terminations. The Court stayed the injunction on the ground that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because \u201cthe Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on \u2018any express or implied contract with the United States. \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1491(a)(1)). The Supreme Court has doubled down on this conclusion in another case staying an injunction against discretionary grant terminations: \u201cThe [APA] \u2019 s \u2018limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity \u2019 does not provide the District Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims \u2018based on \u2019 \u201d the plaintiffs \u2019 grants \u201cor to order relief designed to enforce any \u2018obligation to pay money \u2019 pursuant to those grants. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Aug. 21, 2025) (quoting Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968).The Court \u2019 s reasoning requires respect and strongly supports our conclusion that the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious challenge to the grant terminations is a disguised contract claim that cannot be heard in district court. See Trump v. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025) (\u201cAlthough our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 18 of 9219court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. \u201d); Priests for Life v. HHS, 808 F.3d 1, 25 (D.C Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that Supreme Court stay orders are \u201cextremely strong signals\u201d); see generally Trevor N. McFadden &amp; Vetan Kapoor, The Precedential Effects of The Supreme Court \u2019 s Emergency Stays, 44 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol \u2019 y 827, 831 (2021) (arguing some emergency orders are \u201cauthoritative with respect to future cases considering the same legal questions\u201d).In the face of this overwhelming authority, the grantees nonetheless maintain that jurisdiction over their arbitrary and capricious claims is proper. But the two cases on which they rely cannot support that conclusion.The grantees point out that this court reviewed an agency \u2019 s grant termination under the APA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious standard in Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 923 F.2d 188, 193 (D.C Cir. 1991). But the court in that case made no mention of the Tucker Act, nor did it engage with our decisions in Richardson and Ingersoll-Rand. This drive-by jurisdictional holding does not bind us. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env \u2019 t, 523 U.S 83, 91 (1998). Just one year later, we extensively considered the jurisdictional framework and \u201cdecline[d] to overrule this Court \u2019 s very specific holdings that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613. As the Supreme Court \u2019 s stay order in Department of Education confirms, Kansas City is an outlier and does not support district court jurisdiction over the grantees \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claims.Second, the grantees point to Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, which held that a state agency could maintain an USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 19 of 9220arbitrary and capricious claim in district court to challenge the federal government \u2019 s withholding of grant funds. 763 F.2d 1441, 1451, 1453 (D.C Cir. 1985). In that case, the federal government was required by law to pay block grant funds to Maryland according to a statutory formula. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1397a(a) \u2013 (b), 1397b(b) (1982). We explained that Maryland \u2019 s claim was not contractual for purposes of the Tucker Act because it \u201cturn[ed] on the interpretation of statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the parties. \u201d Maryland, 763 F.2d at 1449. There was no \u201ccontract within the meaning of the Tucker Act\u201d\u2014only statutes and regulations that dictated how much Maryland was entitled to receive, how the funds could be spent, and under what circumstances the federal government could withhold payment. Id.By contrast, these grant agreements are \u201ccontracts\u201d within the meaning of the Tucker Act because they include the traditional contract elements of offer, acceptance, and consideration. See, e.g , Dep \u2019 t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; Columbus Reg \u2019 l Hosp., 990 F.3d at 1338 \u2013 41. The grantees do not suggest that any of these elements is lacking. Moreover, the Inflation Reduction Act did not specify who was to receive money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or in what amount. Those determinations were to be made \u201con a competitive basis\u201d at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees obtained federal funds only because they were awarded discretionary EPA grants, the terms of which are governed by the grant agreements. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *4 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that Department of Education \u201ccontrols\u201d when a district court seeks to remedy \u201cthe government \u2019 s denial of previously awarded discretionary grants\u201d). The dispute over the termination of these agreements does not turn solely, or USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 20 of 9221really at all, on the statute, and the relief sought is continued performance of the agreements.In short, the grantees cannot circumvent the Court of Federal Claims by arguing that EPA \u2019 s termination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.4.Finally, the grantees cannot bring their regulatory or arbitrary and capricious claims in district court by arguing that the EPA Administrator acted ultra vires. The grantees invoke the Larson-Dugan doctrine, which, like the Ex parte Young exception to state sovereign immunity, holds that sovereign immunity does not bar suits against federal officers whose \u201cpowers are limited by statute\u201d and whose actions go \u201cbeyond those limitations\u201d or are \u201cconstitutionally void. \u201d Larson, 337 U.S at 689, 701 \u2013 02; see also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S 609, 621 \u2013 23 (1963). The grantees insist Administrator Zeldin exceeded his lawful authority by terminating the agreements in violation of the OMB guidance provisions and the APA \u2019 s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. We disagree.The Supreme Court in Larson recognized that the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity does not apply to contract claims: \u201cThe Government, as representative of the community as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any plaintiff who presents a disputed question of property or contract right. \u201d 337 U.S at 704. As already explained, the grantees \u2019 regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims essentially allege the government (1) violated the terms of the grant agreements and (2) acted with impunity. If proven, these claims establish breach of contract. They do not establish that the government (or any official) acted in excess of statutory limits or in contravention of the Constitution, as is required toUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 21 of 9222invoke the Larson-Dugan exception.9 See Larson, 337 U.S at 695 (squarely rejecting the contention that \u201can officer given the power to make decisions\u201d only has sovereign immunity when he \u201cmake[s] correct decisions\u201d).The grantees cannot bootstrap district court jurisdiction through the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity because their regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims are essentially contractual.B.The grantees also maintain that EPA violated the \u201cSeparation of Powers\u201d by not enforcing the Inflation Reduction Act, citing In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C Cir. 2013). The grantees contend that Congress directed how and when the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund appropriations were to be spent and that EPA violated those directives by canceling the grant agreements. Although the district court had jurisdiction over this claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the merits.As an initial matter, this is not a constitutional claim at all, but rather a claim that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction Act. Claims that agency officials acted in excess of their statutory authority do not ipso facto allege violations of the \u201cSeparation of Powers. \u201d See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S 462,9 This is consistent with the general principle that \u201c[i]t is not illegal for a party to breach a contract. \u201d United States v. Blankenship, 382 F.3d 1110, 1133 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it[]\u2014and nothing else. \u201d United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S 839, 919 \u2013 20 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Holmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in 3 The Collected Works of Justice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick ed. 1995)). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 22 of 9223474 (1994) (distinguishing between \u201cclaims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other\u201d); cf. 5 U.S.C \u00a7 706(2) (distinguishing judicial review of agency action \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity\u201d and action \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations\u201d). As we recently explained, when a \u201csupposed separation-of-powers violation turns entirely on whether [executive] officials violated the governing statutes, \u2026 Dalton requires us to analyze the claim as an ultra vires one. \u201d Nat \u2019 l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, No. 25-5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *19 \u2013 20 (D.C Cir. Aug. 15, 2025); see also Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 WL 2326021, at *6 \u2013 9 (D.C Cir. Aug. 13, 2025). The grantees here allege violations of the statute, not the Constitution, and we decline to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim.We conclude EPA did not violate the Inflation Reduction Act when it terminated these grants. The grantees have identified no statutory provision that barred the cancellation of the grants. In relevant part, the Inflation Reduction Act \u201cappropriated to the Administrator\u201d $20 billion \u201cto make grants[] on a competitive basis\u201d and provided that the funds are \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (2024). The grantees interpret these provisions as a mandate that EPA spend the full $20 billion, a mandate that EPA allegedly violated when it cancelled grants after the September 2024 appropriation deadline. But even assuming the statute required EPA to obligate all $20 billion by the appropriation deadline, EPA did so. EPA later cancelled the grants, but the Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants. And EPA repeatedly represented that it planned to recommit the funds. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 23 of 9224The grantees and the dissent insist EPA \u2019 s promise to recommit the funds was hollow because the Inflation Reduction Act appropriation had lapsed by the time EPA terminated the grants, and therefore EPA had no ability to recommit the funds. But the grantees cite no authority for the proposition that when an agency cancels a grant after an appropriation has lapsed, any recommitment of those funds requires deobligation and a new appropriation by Congress. Indeed, such a categorical rule would be inconsistent with the longstanding position of the Government Accountability Office\u2014a legislative agency\u2014that the Executive Branch may issue replacement contracts even after an appropriation has lapsed. See Funding of Replacement Contracts, 68 Comp. Gen. 158, 158 (Dec. 19, 1988); see also 31 U.S.C \u00a7 1552(a) (providing that appropriation account does not close until five years after an appropriation expires).In fact, the Executive often issues replacement contracts after terminating for convenience, a practice the Comptroller General has approved for decades.10 See U.S General Accounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 3d ed., vol. 1, 5-28 \u2013 5-33 (Jan. 2004) (discussing history of replacement contracts and associated Comptroller General opinions). Moreover, the rule the grantees assert would be inconsistent with this court \u2019 s recognition that the government gets \u201ca second chance to obligate\u201d even after an appropriation has lapsed if a court sets aside the original, timely obligation. Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1071 (D.C Cir. 1986). Considering the longstanding practice of the political branches, as well as our precedent, we are not persuaded that10 The Comptroller General opinion the dissent cites is inapposite because it involves new obligations, not replacement grants. See Dissenting Op. 41. Replacement grants do not require a new obligation of funds. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 24 of 9225the government lacks authority to recommit the funds after termination.11The district court \u2019 s determination that the grantees were likely to succeed on their \u201cconstitutional\u201d Inflation Reduction Act claim rests on both factual and legal error. The court found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115. This factual determination was not supported by any evidence in the record and rested only on the district court \u2019 s assertion that EPA \u201csuspended all eight grants. \u201d Id. at 116. But the suspension of the grants standing alone cannot demonstrate EPA was shutting down the statutory programs without congressional approval. Indeed, EPA repeatedly stated that it planned to recommit the grant money with greater oversight and accountability, contradicting the district court \u2019 s shutdown finding. Absent any clear evidence to the contrary, EPA \u2019 s representations were entitled to a presumption of regularity. See Am. Fed \u2019 n of Gov \u2019 t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Reagan, 870 F.2d 723, 727 (D.C Cir. 1989).Rather than credit EPA \u2019 s statements or explain why the presumption of regularity was overcome, the district court simply declared EPA was shutting down the programs. The court disregarded the government \u2019 s interest in prudent management of the grant programs and the government \u2019 s representations that it planned to properly supervise, rather11 We need not consider for purposes of this appeal whether the recent repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the recission of \u201cunobligated balances,\u201d affects EPA \u2019 s ability to recommit the funds at issue here. If the repeal of the statute bars EPA from recommitting the funds, it stands to reason that the repeal also relieves EPA of any statutory obligation to do so. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 25 of 9226than abandon, the grantmaking process.12 The district court \u2019 s conclusory factual finding of program dismantlement was clearly erroneous. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 118 (D.C Cir. 2001) (explaining that even on clear error review the court is not required to \u201caccept findings that are utterly deficient\u201d).Because EPA issued the grants in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, and there is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. In that case we issued a writ of mandamus because for years the Nuclear Regulatory Commission flagrantly disregarded statutory commands, failed to spend appropriated funds, and plainly stated it had no intention of complying with its statutory obligations. In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 257 \u2013 59. By contrast, EPA entered the grant agreements before the appropriation expired in September 2024, in compliance with any requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act to spend funds. EPA subsequently terminated the agreements because of its concerns about lack of oversight and potential conflicts of interest during the award process.EPA \u2019 s actions here are well within the Executive Branch \u2019 s authority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds and to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly spent for its intended purposes. The grant terminations may be12 The district court also ignored the government \u2019 s evidence of mismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which further supports EPA \u2019 s good faith in deciding to terminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision and accountability. See J.A 107 n.1 Moreover, the dissent focuses primarily on EPA \u2019 s actions against these grantees, but the repeated recounting of these actions tells us little about whether EPA will recommit the funds through a more robust process. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 26 of 9227challenged on the merits as a breach of contract, but nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.The grantees \u2019 false invocation of the separation of powers cannot justify this preliminary injunction, which bars EPA from carrying out basic executive functions to ensure the prudent and effective management of substantial public funds.13IV.The district court also abused its discretion in applying the remaining Winter factors: irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the balance of the equities, and the public interest. While some grantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the litigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the government and the public in the proper stewardship of billions of taxpayer dollars.A.The loss of grant funds during this litigation is not irreparable because the harm is compensable through money damages. The district court concluded the grantees would suffer irreparable harm because their \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cbusiness operations \u2026 depend[] on their grant money. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117. But it is well-established that \u201ceconomic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm. \u201d Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). Pecuniary injuries can be13 The grantees also argue EPA will violate the Appropriations Clause if it reobligates the funds after terminating the grant agreements. The district court did not base its preliminary injunction on this argument, so we do not address it. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 27 of 9228redressed through money damages if a plaintiff proves its case. We have recognized only one exception, for pecuniary loss that \u201cthreatens the very existence of the movant \u2019 s business. \u201d Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C Cir. 1985). This exception generally applies when government action threatens the existence of an independent private entity. See, e.g , Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 F.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C Cir. 2024) (finding irreparable harm when a financial services firm would be forced to shutter if regulatory action took effect during litigation).The grantees do not fall within this exception. The nonprofit entities that may need to suspend operations are entities that were created solely for the purpose of applying for and spending these federal grants. So while their \u201cexistence relies on grant money\u201d as the district court held, that is because these entities were established to benefit from government largesse. Creating such an entity cannot establish an irrevocable claim to government funds or an entitlement to injunctive relief preventing the Executive Branch from supervising and managing those funds. In short, the existential threat alleged by the grantees does not amount to irreparable harm.EPA terminated the grants because of concerns about the integrity of the grantmaking process. While litigation is pending, the grantees may have to scale down their operations or return to the operational status they had before they received federal funds. Although this causes some harm, the harm is readily compensable through damages and therefore is not irreparable.B.The balance of the equities and the public interest factors similarly favor the government. The injunction harms the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 28 of 9229government and the public interest by preventing the Executive Branch from properly and prudently managing billions of dollars in public funds. The grantees have an interest in continued access to government funding. But the government and the public have a stronger interest in protecting the public fisc and eliminating the appearance of impropriety around these grant programs.Moreover, if the grant terminations are later determined to be a breach of contract, the government may be required to pay damages to the grantees, which would substantially, if not entirely, redress the grantees \u2019 interim injuries. By contrast, if the government \u2019 s position is eventually vindicated, it will have no apparent means to recover funds spent down while the litigation has run its course. See Nat \u2019 l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Order) (recognizing irreparable harm to the government because the grant \u201cfunds cannot be recouped and are thus irrevocably expended\u201d) (cleaned up). The government \u2019 s (and the public \u2019 s) harm from an erroneous injunction is thus irreparable in a way that the grantees \u2019 harm from an erroneous contract termination is not.Finally, Congress has explicitly channeled breach of government contract claims to the Court of Federal Claims and limited remedies to damages. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 (\u201cThe Court of [Federal] Claims may neither grant declaratory nor injunctive relief. \u201d) (cleaned up). The district court has no jurisdiction over these claims, and even the Court of Federal Claims lacks authority to issue injunctive relief. The public interest favors limiting federal courts to the jurisdiction and remedies provided by Congress. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2562 (2025) (\u201cWhen a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. \u201d). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 29 of 9230The same considerations support vacating the injunction as to Citibank. The district court did not find that the grantees were likely to succeed on any of their independent claims against Citibank, which involve breach of contract, conversion, and replevin. To the contrary, the court found that \u201cCitibank performed its obligations under the FAA in accordance with its responsibilities as a financial agent of the United States. \u201d Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The injunction against Citibank merely serves to stop Citibank from following the government \u2019 s instructions, which the district court considered unlawful. Because we conclude the injunction against the government should be vacated, the derivative injunction against Citibank must be vacated as well.* * *For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court \u2019 s injunction and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.So ordered. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 30 of 92PILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting: On the majority \u2019 s telling, Plaintiffs bring garden-variety contract claims against EPA \u2019 s reasonable decisions to terminate their grant awards. That version of events fails to contend with the government \u2019 s actual behavior and misapprehends Plaintiffs \u2019 claims, leading the majority to the wrong conclusion at every step of its review of the district court \u2019 s preliminary injunction.Three years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. One of the law \u2019 s signature provisions directs the Environmental Protection Agency to distribute $20 billion in grants for investment in projects to develop clean energy infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Congress structured the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to provide jobs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, especially in low-income and underinvested communities. EPA distributed the grant money by the fall of 2024, as Congress required.After the change in administration, in response to President Trump \u2019 s directives to terminate the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d new leadership at EPA decided to take back the money already awarded to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were holding and spending the money exclusively as Congress intended. Yet EPA\u2014in conjunction with counterparts at the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the U.S Treasury\u2014opened spurious criminal and civil investigations into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and pressured Citibank into \u201cvoluntarily\u201d freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts even though the government lacked probable cause to impose such a freeze. EPA then attempted to take back Plaintiffs \u2019 money by \u201cterminating\u201d all eight grants, comprising the entire $20 billion congressionally mandated program, 24 hours before the government was due in district court for a hearing on Plaintiffs \u2019 application for a temporary restraining order. Those unprecedented and unfounded actions were part of EPA \u2019 s hunt for reasons to shut down the congressionally mandated program and claw back the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 31 of 922funding that had already been disbursed to Plaintiffs and committed to infrastructure projects. EPA \u2019 s termination letter claims the agency conducted a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d but fails to identify any contract breach or violation of law by Plaintiffs.So far, EPA has succeeded in depriving Plaintiffs of access to their funding for six months. The freeze has already caused Plaintiffs to default on promised loans and scuttled affordable housing and energy projects implementing Congress \u2019 s vision. EPA has done all that without presenting to any court any credible evidence or coherent reason that could justify its interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money and its sabotage of Congress \u2019 s law.Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s action to gut the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as contrary to the Constitution \u2019 s separation of powers. Fundamental to our \u201cconstitutional system of separation of powers\u201d is the \u201csettled, bedrock principle[]\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 267 (D.C Cir. 2013); U.S Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, cl. 7; U.S Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Yet that is just what EPA decided to do and has begun to effectuate here. The record strongly supports the district court \u2019 s determination that EPA has frozen and attempted to repossess billions of dollars \u2019 worth of lawfully spent money for no substantiated reason other than disagreements with Congress \u2019 s policy determination\u2014grounds that are entirely inapposite and inadequate, and that the government does not defend here. The agency has no lawful basis\u2014nor even a nonfrivolous assertion of any basis\u2014to interfere with funding that, pursuant to Congress \u2019 s instructions, already belongs to Plaintiffs, who in turn have committed it to energy infrastructure development USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 32 of 923and advanced manufacturing projects according to Congress \u2019 s plan.That constitutional violation alone justifies the district court \u2019 s injunction. The injunction is independently warranted by the arbitrary and capricious character of EPA \u2019 s actions. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s taking of their funds under an irrational process with only pretextual justifications. That is a quintessential APA claim that belongs in the district court, and on which Plaintiffs are likely to succeed.Defendants insist that this is a government contract dispute that we must dismiss because, under the Tucker Act, only the Court of Federal Claims has authority to decide it. Our Tucker Act precedents do not support that contention. They direct us to analyze whether a claim is \u201cat its essence\u201d contractual and, if it is, to cede jurisdiction to the Court of Claims for its expert \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 76, 78 (D.C Cir. 1985). That analysis, turning on the source of the right Plaintiffs assert and the nature of the relief they seek\u2014here, constitutional and statutory claims to retain already-disbursed funds to which they remain lawfully entitled\u2014confirms the jurisdiction of the district court. Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968-69 (D.C Cir. 1982). The majority acknowledges the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 constitutional claims. And nothing in the Tucker Act or binding precedent interpreting it supports the majority \u2019 s view that Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is transformed into a contract claim and ousted from the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction merely because it seeks to prevent EPA \u2019 s capricious interference with funds that Plaintiffs obtained through and must spend consistently with a contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 33 of 924In characterizing this case as merely a contract dispute subject to the Tucker Act \u2019 s jurisdictional bar, the majority baselessly strips the district court of authority to decide these important claims. The majority holds that a plaintiff cannot bring an arbitrary and capricious challenge to any government action that affects something of value that was originally obtained by contract. Maj. Op. 16-18. Doing so undercuts the Constitution \u2019 s and the APA \u2019 s checks on the Executive \u2019 s illegitimate seizure of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds and subversion of Congress \u2019 s will. The government \u2019 s Tucker Act defense is especially pernicious here. Dismissal of this case presumably will enable the government to carry out its announced plan to immediately and irrevocably seize Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. At best, in the unlikely event the government refrains from immediately draining Plaintiffs \u2019 frozen accounts, the further delay involved in reinitiating litigation in the Court of Federal Claims will itself irreparably harm the infrastructure projects that cannot move forward and may fail without funding. In these circumstances, \u201c[i]t is no overstatement to say that our constitutional system of separation of powers w[ill] be significantly altered\u201d by \u201callow[ing] executive . . . agencies to disregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 267.BACKGROUNDA. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction FundIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act establishes the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to distribute that money for investment in projects to deploy solar and electric energy technology throughout the country, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065-67 (2022) (codified USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 34 of 925at 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434). The program was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and \u201cimprove health outcomes, lower energy costs, and create high-quality jobs for Americans\u2014all while strengthening [the] country \u2019 s economic competitiveness and ensuring energy security. \u201d Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 3 (J.A 1735).Achieving that vision would \u201crequire a tremendous amount of financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- and air pollution-reducing projects across the country. \u201d Id. Because the private sector has historically been hesitant to invest in clean energy projects, Congress designed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to finance clean energy projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A). Specifically, Congress directed EPA to spend $20 billion by September 2024 to fund nonprofit financial institutions, which in turn must use the funds either to recruit private investment for clean energy programs or to assist community projects to reduce air pollution. Id. \u00a7 7434(a)(2)-(3), (c)(3).Pursuant to Congress \u2019 s directive, in July 2023, EPA created two funding programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit lenders to use public seed money to attract private investment for tens of thousands of energy-efficient affordable housing, transportation, and electricity projects throughout the country; and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit organizations to use public seed money to enable community lenders to invest in clean energy projects in low-income and underinvested communities.EPA conducted a rigorous, competitive selection process, which included review of applicants \u2019 detailed program plans USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 35 of 926and budgets, organizational capacity, and experience managing third-party capital and financial risk. EPA selected eight nonprofits\u2014lenders and community organizations\u2014capable of carrying out those aims. The approved workplans and budgets of the applicants EPA selected describe how those organizations will use the federal funds they have since received to expand access to\u2014and recruit private investment for\u2014affordable construction and renovation of energy-efficient businesses, schools, municipal buildings, healthcare facilities, public housing, and transportation, particularly in rural, Tribal, and low-income areas.In compliance with the September 2024 deadline Congress imposed, EPA obligated the grant funds for both programs by the summer of 2024. To enable the grantees to recruit private investment\u2014as Congress required, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A)\u2014EPA deposited the grant funds in accounts opened in the grantees \u2019 names at Citibank. Unlike EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system, that structure gave the grantees title to the full amount of the award funds up front, allowing those funds to serve as assets for the grantees to rely on to raise private capital by reducing financial risk for private investments. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 7-14.The Plaintiff grantees \u2019 legal title to their award funds is spelled out in Account Control Agreements between EPA, Citibank, and each grantee. Those agreements specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for the [grantee]\u201d and state that the grantee is \u201cthe Bank \u2019 s customer with respect to the Accounts and [] the entitlement holder with respect to all financial assets credited . . . to the Accounts. \u201d Account Control Agreement \u00a7 1 (J.A 1144). The Account Control Agreements accordingly direct that Citibank \u201cshall comply with all instructions\u201d it receives from the grantees. Id. \u00a7 2 (J.A 1145). The grantees \u2019 title to the award funds is also reflected in USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 36 of 927Citibank \u2019 s Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, which requires Citibank to act as the government \u2019 s \u201cfinancial agent\u201d to achieve Congress \u2019 s goal by, among other things, establishing \u201caccounts in the names of the three NCIF and five CCIA grant recipients\u201d and maintaining a \u201ccustomer relationship\u201d with each grantee. Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7 I.A.1 (J.A 2145).Under those agreements, EPA retained a security interest in the grantees \u2019 award funds that allows it to assert control over the money in certain circumstances if\u2014and only if\u2014it issues a Notice of Exclusive Control, which it undisputedly has not done. Form of Notice of Exclusive Control (J.A 1152); Oral Arg. Tr. 28:6-22. EPA has only an unexercised security interest; it does not own the funds in the grantees \u2019 accounts. See United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S 198, 209-10 (1983); Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S 356, 392 n.8 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting the distinction between \u201cthe government possess[ing] merely a secured interest in the property\u201d and \u201cown[ing] the funds\u201d).In addition to serving as the mechanism for conveying to the grantees legal title to the award funds, the financial agent structure affords EPA greater oversight of the grantees \u2019 use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system: While EPA \u2019 s traditional disbursement system reports only the amounts withdrawn by the recipient and the remaining award funds, the financial agent structure allows EPA real-time \u201cview access,\u201d enabling it to see the grantees \u2019 and their subrecipients \u2019 accounts to follow how much they are spending, with all amounts broken down by budget category, and to see income in the form of portfolio earnings and loan repayments. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 33 (J.A 372). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 37 of 928Other oversight mechanisms provide further, detailed confirmation of grantees \u2019 lawful use of their funds. Grantees provide extensive reporting to EPA on their spending. They make quarterly, semi-annual, and annual written reports regarding their transactions and progress against their EPA-approved workplans, plus quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting. They attend oversight, planning, and compliance meetings with EPA at least weekly. They submit to EPA withdrawal certifications attesting to the propriety of each draw request to Citibank and to its necessity for their workplan. And grantees are also subject to third-party financial audits and audits for federal grant compliance. Id. \u00b6 35 (J.A 372-73).The plaintiffs in this suit are five of the eight NCIF and CCIA grantees, as well as several of their subgrantees. Since mid-2024, they have been putting the grant money to work, committing to loans for projects around the country that will, for example: \u2022 develop and renovate hundreds of energy-efficient affordable housing units; \u2022 fund low-cost loans to small business and homeowners to finance heating and cooling systems and backup battery storage; \u2022 build a fleet of 500 American-made electric trucks to be conveniently and affordably available for lease by small businesses and independent contractors; and \u2022 provide backup power sources to rural hospitals to reduce the risks of harm to patients due to power outages.Those projects will help cut energy costs for consumers and small businesses, create jobs, ameliorate the affordable-USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 38 of 929housing crisis, and improve air quality in low-income and less developed communities.Plaintiffs \u2019 projects provide benefits to people and communities the value of which is many times greater than their cost to the public fisc. Congress structured these programs to enable each dollar of public funding spent to attract multiple dollars of private funding. One Plaintiff, for example, estimates that it will generate up to $4 of private investment for every $1 of federal funds invested in projects. Another Plaintiff \u2019 s workplan obligates it to mobilize $14 of private investment for every $1 of federal funding awarded to the Plaintiff. As of December 2024, it had already achieved a private-public capital mobilization ratio of nearly 7:1. But those projects\u2014as well as many of the Plaintiffs \u2019 ability even to remain in business\u2014cannot continue without Plaintiffs \u2019 access to the funds EPA awarded them. Plaintiffs \u2019 vulnerability to the freeze of their federal grant money is particularly acute given that many of the Plaintiffs were formed specifically to participate in the grant programs and as such do not have other sources of funding.B. EPA \u2019 s ActionsEPA \u2019 s campaign to seize the grant money already owned by Plaintiffs began shortly after the new administration took office, in response to its directives.

Nonetheless, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made clear his intent to take back the funds disbursed through those programs.On February 12, Zeldin released a public statement video in which he described the NCIF and CCIA grant programs as a \u201cscheme\u201d by the \u201cBiden EPA\u201d to \u201cpark[]\u201d 20 billion dollars at an outside financial institution in order to \u201cobligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight. \u201d Lee Zeldin (@EPALeeZeldin), X (Feb. 12, 2025, 7:52 PM), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP\">https://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP</url>.

The Justice Department first asked the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Washington, D.C , U.S Attorney \u2019 s Office, Denise Cheung, to open a criminal investigation into whether the NCIF and CCIA grants had been \u201cunlawfully\u201d awarded, so that the government could prevent the \u201ccontract awardees [from] continu[ing] to draw down\u201d their funds from their Citibank accounts.

When Cheung informed the Justice Department that probable cause to open a grand jury investigation did not exist, the Justice Department asked her to instead issue a letter requesting that Citibank freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.While Cheung worked in coordination with the FBI to draft the freeze request letter to Citibank, she informed the Justice Department that the government lacked probable cause to believe that Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts were subject to government seizure.

Around the same time, the Deputy Attorney General asked at least one other U.S Attorney \u2019 s office to open a grand jury investigation into the NCIF and CCIA grant programs and seek a court-ordered bank freeze, but, like Cheung, those other prosecutors refused the requests as unsupported. Id. As the government eventually told the district court, the \u201ceffort to . . . put a criminal freeze on the money\u201d was \u201cobviously\u201d unsuccessful \u201cbecause that didn \u2019 t happen. \u201d Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 26:5-9 (J.A 199).Despite having received multiple, independent assessments that there was no probable cause to believe that \u201cany apparent crime\u201d had been committed in connection with Plaintiffs \u2019 funds, EPA continued without basis to press for investigations of Plaintiffs, and then pointed to the very existence of those investigations as if they supported its efforts to indefinitely prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds.USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 42 of 9213EPA \u2019 s Acting Deputy Administrator Chad McIntosh referred the \u201cGGRF program\u201d to the EPA Office of Inspector General for a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into what he termed a \u201cpattern of reckless financial management, blatant conflicts of interest, astonishing sums of tax dollars awarded to unqualified recipients, and severe deficiencies in regulatory oversight under the prior administration. \u201d Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPAOIG 2 (J.A 107).

The Justice Department officials admitted that those investigations had not \u201c uncover[ed] . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d that could justify the government \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 money but advised that, before the government would have to defend the freeze in court, it would \u201cmake . . . arguments about how those claims sound in contract and should be pursued in another forum. \u201d Id.The Justice Department recognized that, \u201c[a]t some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period. \u201d Id.

USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 44 of 9215In response to the Justice Department \u2019 s instructions, EPA sent a letter to Citibank the next day instructing it to \u201cpause the processing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). EPA stated that it was \u201cworking to review and develop additional account controls to address concerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest related to the [GGRF], including based on incoming responses to oversight questions EPA issued to grant recipients on March 4, 2025,\u201d and asserted that \u201c[t]he GGRF is also the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the U.S Department of Justice and an investigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG). \u201d Id.EPA advised Citibank that, until \u201cadditional account controls are developed and implemented . . . and given the ongoing investigations into the GGRF, it is critical that the Bank not resume processing payment instructions for the GGRF accounts. \u201d Id.EPA stated further that \u201c[t]his interim account control will be rescinded as soon as reasonably practicable once EPA completes its review and implements additional account controls through additional instructions as necessary. \u201d Id.Meanwhile, Plaintiffs had already been unable to access the money in their bank accounts for over two weeks\u2014a period that has now stretched to more than six months. And because the terms of the grant awards generally prohibited Plaintiffs from withdrawing funds unless they would be spent in the following fourteen business days, Plaintiffs were starting to run out of money to make payroll, pay the rent on their offices, and pay third-party contractors for essential auditing, legal, and IT security services. On top of that, without access to their funding, they would soon be unable to meet their commitments under loans for projects they had already agreed to finance. Some of those loan payments could be requested by borrowers at any time; if borrowers requested a loan draw-down while USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 45 of 9216Plaintiffs could not access their funds, Plaintiffs would be forced to default on those loans, imperiling the projects.Plaintiffs remained unable to access the money in their accounts. They repeatedly requested an explanation from EPA or Citibank as to why their funds were inaccessible. They received no substantive reply. Climate United, for example, sent three emails, left a voicemail, and mailed a hard-copy letter to Citibank between February 19 and March 3 before finally receiving a response stating only that Citibank had \u201c received [Climate United \u2019 s] correspondence \u201d and was \u201cawaiting further guidance\u201d from EPA.

Supp. 3d at 115 (\u201cNow, in a shift in position, [EPA Defendants] contend that the termination was based on the agency \u2019 s changed priorities. \u201d).The district court preliminarily found that EPA froze and terminated Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards in violation of the APA as, despite being \u201crepeatedly pressed on the issue,\u201d EPA \u201coffer[ed] no rational explanation for why it suspended the grants and then immediately terminated the entire NCIF and CCIA grant programs overnight. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 114. And the court held that EPA violated the constitutional separation of powers by seeking to \u201ceffectively unilaterallyUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 48 of 9219dismantle a program that Congress established. \u201d Id. at 116. Specifically, it found that \u201csuspend[ing] all eight grants comprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs,\u201d coupled with \u201cthe agency \u2019 s public statements . . . regarding the future of the program,\u201d showed that EPA \u201cseeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter\u201d notwithstanding the agency \u2019 s hollow representations in court that it intended to re-obligate the funds following the terminations. Id at 115-16.By the time the district court granted the preliminary injunction in mid-April, Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to access their funding threatened to permanently unravel projects that depended on funding commitments they had incurred before EPA \u2019 s actions to undo the GGRF. A project to renovate 192 affordable housing units in Virginia could lose its $4 million in committed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding if a subgrantee cannot fulfill its funding obligations by September. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 437-38). Projects to construct a community health center in New Jersey and to renovate a historic hotel into 63 rental apartments in rural Iowa were slated to lose their state tax credits and collapse if they did not receive a subgrantee \u2019 s planned funding by July. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 25-26 (J.A 465-67). And construction of 302 affordable housing units in Texas and 236 units in Maryland will not move forward, and will eventually collapse, without a subgrantee \u2019 s committed funding. Donovan Decl. \u00b6 17 (J.A 436-37).Those harms have only continued to mount as the funding freeze has persisted, and for some projects, it is likely already too late. Due to one subgrantee \u2019 s inability to access its grant funds, a 106-unit affordable housing renovation lost its state tax credits in May, increasing the project \u2019 s cost and placing the project in jeopardy. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, Climate United,USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 49 of 9220No. 25-cv-698, Dkt. No. 112-1 (D.D.C May 12, 2025) (hereinafter Mayopoulos Supp. Decl.). Another project to construct a 160-home subsidized rental apartment community in Detroit most likely lost its critical HUD housing assistance commitment because of a subgrantee \u2019 s inability to provide a promised $4 million bridge loan in June. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Brown Decl. \u00b6 18 (J.A 437). And a $34 million project to build 90 rental homes in Texas was projected to fall through due to a subgrantee \u2019 s inability to provide its $3.6 million of committed funding by the end of June. Moon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (J.A 465).In addition to undermining existing projects, EPA \u2019 s actions will soon put many of the Plaintiffs themselves out of business, preventing accomplishment of the projects Congress intended them to fund. Without access to their funding, Plaintiffs are unable to make payroll, pay their bills, or keep current on their rent. Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117-20. Due to EPA \u2019 s interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to make payroll, many employees have started looking for other jobs, left voluntarily, or been laid off. For instance, one Plaintiff has laid off or lost approximately 50% of its staff, and one of its subgrantees was \u201cforced to act financially as though the GGRF award does not exist\u201d by laying off 36 of its employees. Mayopoulos Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. And because Plaintiffs cannot pay their bills, third-party contractors have started to withdraw essential services, including critical accounting, financial management, and award compliance services. Simply put, without access to their funds, Plaintiffs cannot keep their doors open, much less honor their loan commitments.More harmful still, faced with EPA \u2019 s threats to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 funds, existing partners have begun to shun Plaintiffs \u2019 funding offers, pulling out of near-final deals and stopping working on Plaintiffs \u2019 projects. After eight weeks of negotiations, an Alaska-based community finance institution USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 50 of 9221had agreed to a $10 million loan from one of the Plaintiffs; all that was left to officially close the deal was the board \u2019 s approval. Following EPA \u2019 s actions, the board refused to approve the loan. That same plaintiff had completed negotiations with a local green bank in the Midwest to help finance a different project, with only board approval outstanding. The board met the day after Zeldin \u2019 s February 12 comments on X and voted against the loan because of Zeldin \u2019 s public threats and vow to end the NCIF program. A philanthropic entity interested in investing $250 million in a partnership with one of the Plaintiffs broke off discussions following EPA \u2019 s actions. Co-investment and collaboration is critical to Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to efficiently finance projects to benefit the public by lowering \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3)(A).DISCUSSIONAn accurate understanding of the program Congress enacted, together with the complete lack of evidence to support EPA \u2019 s false assertions of improper use or deficient oversight of federal expenditures, confirms that the district court \u2019 s decision to preliminarily enjoin EPA \u2019 s unlawful actions is unassailable. Based on nothing more than the President \u2019 s announced vendetta against the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d EPA determined to cut off access to money that was already disbursed to Plaintiffs and that they were using\u2014pursuant to Congress \u2019 s explicit directions as implemented by EPA\u2014to expand access to solar- and electric-powered housing, cars, buildings, and power generation. The Constitution does not allow the President or his subordinate executive agencies to unilaterally decide to take back money that Congress has appropriated and the agency already lawfully spent merely USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 51 of 9222because the Executive Branch disagrees with Congress \u2019 s policy choices. Neither do the laws governing federal agencies allow them to initiate specious criminal investigations in hopes of digging up pretextual justifications to cover up that unconstitutional action, let alone rely on the very existence of those investigations to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 lawful use of their money.EPA \u2019 s violations of law are so clear that the agency hardly contests them. And the imminent, irreversible harm to Plaintiffs is incontrovertible. These circumstances cry out for preliminary injunctive relief, as the district court rightly recognized. The majority \u2019 s contrary conclusion accepts the government \u2019 s gambit to strip district courts of jurisdiction over the government \u2019 s blatant violations of basic principles of constitutional and administrative law.Plaintiffs received the funds at issue here via federal grant awards. Absent EPA \u2019 s unjustified interference, the money in Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts is theirs to spend in conformity with the terms of the funding agreement. The government has expressly and repeatedly disclaimed any allegation that Plaintiffs have violated those terms. Neither has EPA attempted to regain control of the money by asserting its security interest in Plaintiffs \u2019 funds.EPA has instead frozen and purported to terminate the grant awards based on shifting, post-hoc, and unsupported allegations. Plaintiffs thus challenge EPA \u2019 s actions as arbitrary and capricious, and based on pretextual justifications. In no way is that claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim over which the district court lacks jurisdiction. The reality that Plaintiffs obtained the funds by government contract does not mean that claims they raise against the government \u2019 s interference with their lawful use of those funds sound in contract. Our bindingUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 52 of 9223precedent makes clear that just because Plaintiffs \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d if they had never received the funds through a grant does not mean that they assert a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley Gov \u2019 t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1110 (D.C Cir. 2022).The court \u2019 s holding to the contrary is unsupportable. The court falls short today in its Article III duty to independently say what the law is and thereby hold the Executive Branch to account. Such \u201c[a]bdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design. \u201d Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S 417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).A. Likelihood of Success1. APAEPA \u2019 s conduct is arbitrary and capricious. Agencies may not offer \u201ccontrived reasons\u201d for their decisions, Dep \u2019 t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S 752, 785 (2019), nor can they make any decision that \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S , Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S 29, 43 (1983). It is beyond dispute that an agency \u2019 s own patently unfounded criminal investigations against private companies cannot be invoked to justify the factually baseless and legally unauthorized taking of the companies \u2019 funds. By all indications, that is exactly what EPA did here.Following the President \u2019 s instructions to cut off funding to clean energy projects, EPA vowed to \u201creassume responsibility\u201d of the NCIF and CCIA grant funds. To that end, without probable cause to suspect any criminal wrongdoing related to the grant programs, EPA\u2014in coordination with the Justice Department and the FBI\u2014first pressured Citibank into USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 53 of 9224voluntarily freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts by referring to \u201cpossible criminal violations,\u201d including \u201c[c]onspiracy to defraud the United States\u201d and \u201cwire fraud. \u201d FBI Freeze Ltr. (J.A 99-101). Not satisfied that Citibank \u2019 s voluntary freeze would hold, the agencies attempted to open a criminal investigation into the grants and impose a freeze of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds based on suspected criminal conduct. When those efforts came to nothing, EPA instructed the agency \u2019 s Office of Inspector General to open a civil investigation, immediately sent the referral\u2014including its unfounded allegations of \u201cself-dealing, conflicts of interest, [and] extraordinarily unqualified recipients,\u201d J.A 105\u2014to Citibank, and instructed Citibank to keep the accounts frozen until EPA was able to establish sufficient account controls.When that account freeze expired, the agencies again referenced \u201cpotential fraud\u201d and ongoing criminal and civil investigations to Citibank as support for an indefinite continuation of its account freeze, ostensibly to enable EPA to evaluate Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions. Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). But the very next day\u2014weeks before those responses were due, and mere hours before a hearing on Climate United \u2019 s TRO motion\u2014EPA used the 24-hour delay, which it had requested as a \u201cprofessional courtesy,\u201d to abruptly announce its putative termination of all the NCIF and CCIA awards. EPA then argued that the court should dismiss Climate United \u2019 s suit as moot on the ground that EPA had terminated its grant.When EPA could not point the court to any evidence supporting its allegations of fraud, Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at 346-47, it changed its tune. EPA argued to the district court and then to us that it terminated the grants not because any \u201cparticular plaintiff has engaged in a particular act that constitutes fraud,\u201d but only because of \u201cEPA \u2019 s lack of USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 54 of 9225oversight tools to ensure that the money wasn \u2019 t abused. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 103:9-15; see also Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g Tr. 39:4-15 (J.A 868). EPA insisted that its oversight concern did not in any way depend on Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct\u201d\u2014despite the termination letters \u2019 references to \u201cfraud, waste, and abuse\u201d as a basis for the termination. PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507); Termination Ltr. (J.A 390).Each of those actions is consistent with EPA \u2019 s unlawful pursuit of a \u201cshort-term objective [] to prevent disbursement of the grant funds\u201d that had nothing to do with any valid concerns about fraud or oversight, and everything to do with the agency \u2019 s desire to carry out President Trump \u2019 s directive to block implementation of Congress \u2019 s environmental policy. Mar. 9 Emails, <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA\">https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA</url>. That is demonstrated most clearly by EPA \u2019 s pursuit of criminal and civil investigations that it hoped would \u201c uncover . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties \u201d to substantiate its asserted justifications for freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. Id. It pursued those baseless (and fruitless) investigations against the advice of at least two experienced federal prosecutors the EPA consulted and the ruling of a magistrate judge that there was no probable cause to believe any improper conduct had occurred.Equally revealing is EPA \u2019 s double-speak: EPA claimed publicly and in communications to the parties that its actions were justified because the program is a \u201ccriminal\u201d scheme and a \u201cclear-cut case of waste and abuse\u201d that is \u201criddled with self-dealing, conflicts of interest, extraordinarily unqualified recipients . . . and much more,\u201d even as EPA insisted to the district court, which rebuked it for utterly failing to substantiate those allegations, and to our court, that it was not \u201caccusing\u201d and has never \u201caccuse[d] the plaintiffs of waste, fraud and abuse. \u201d Apr. 2 PI Hr \u2019 g 39:12-13 (J.A 868); Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-18. Such shifting and contradictory representations USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 55 of 9226further show that the oversight concerns EPA emphasizes as its sole basis for terminating the awards are post-hoc and pretextual. Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-21.The timing of the termination letters similarly undermines EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns. Only the day before terminating the grants, EPA instructed Citibank to extend the \u201cvoluntary\u201d funding freeze while it waited for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014answers it claimed to need in order to evaluate \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of interest. \u201d Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 65). Later that day, Climate United moved for a TRO to prevent EPA from terminating the awards, among other requested relief. Instead of waiting for Plaintiffs \u2019 responses to its oversight questions\u2014which EPA had given Plaintiffs another several weeks to submit\u2014EPA abruptly terminated the grants the next day, less than 24 hours before the district court \u2019 s scheduled TRO hearing.That sequence of events\u2014terminate first, gather data later\u2014is emblematic of EPA \u2019 s approach throughout the events underlying this litigation. It is fundamentally at odds with the APA \u2019 s requirement of reasoned decision making. An agency must, at a minimum, \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. \u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). By EPA \u2019 s own admission, it decided to terminate the awards before gathering the relevant oversight data, just as it decided to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money and launch criminal investigations without any reason to believe that Plaintiffs were engaged in \u201ccriminal conduct or other improprieties. \u201d Mar. 9 Emails. At every turn, EPA \u2019 s actions demonstrate that its purported reasons for terminating the grant\u2014its \u201c substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award progress, [and] USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 56 of 9227programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, \u201d Gov. Br. 33\u2014are entirely pretextual. Deciding the outcome before investigating the facts, unleashing the government \u2019 s prosecutorial power on private citizens with no basis to think fraud or crime occurred and, having uncovered no evidence, giving contrived and contradictory reasons for predetermined and unsupported agency action is quintessentially arbitrary and capricious. See Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S.at 782-85.EPA argues that it had legitimate concerns about its ability to ensure that the grant funds were being spent lawfully, making its decision to suddenly terminate the awards reasonable. Gov. Br. 33-34. But the oversight issues it cites are contradicted by the record. EPA \u2019 s explanation not only \u201cruns counter to the evidence before the agency\u201d and \u201cis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise,\u201d State Farm, 463 U.S at 43, but is patently pretextual.EPA points to the use of Citibank as a financial agent, the distribution of grant funding to subgrantee organizations, and modification of the agreement between the presidential election and inauguration as raising \u201cserious concerns\u201d about EPA \u2019 s ability to oversee Plaintiffs \u2019 use of the funds. Gov. Br. 9-11. From EPA \u2019 s telling, unqualified grantees were awarded enormous sums of federal grant funding with virtually no oversight. That narrative finds no support in the record.Start with EPA \u2019 s allegation that Plaintiffs are \u201cextraordinarily unqualified recipients\u201d who \u201chad no prior track record. \u201d Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A 105); Gov. Br. 6. That is a grave mischaracterization. Recipients were coalitions of some of the country \u2019 s most reputable nonprofits with decades of relevant experience. They formed coalitions, structured as newly formed subsidiaries, to accommodate theUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 57 of 9228demands of the role that Congress envisioned for the grantees. That organizational design enables the subsidiary to adopt policies and structures most conducive to leveraging private capital\u2014one of Congress \u2019 s key goals for the program\u2014while benefitting from the experience and infrastructure of the parent organizations. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363). Climate United, for instance, is a coalition of three nonprofits with thirty to fifty years of experience each who have collectively managed nearly $30 billion of private and institutional capital to increase environmental sustainability. Id. \u00b6 7 (J.A 363). Power Forward Communities is a coalition of five nonprofits\u2014including household names like United Way and Habitat for Humanity\u2014with more than a century of combined experience financing, managing, and implementing affordable housing projects. Its coalition partners \u2019 past projects total more than $100 billion and have successfully added approximately 1.5 million affordable homes and apartments across the United States for Americans in need. Mayopoulos Decl. \u00b6 3 (J.A 452).Those coalitions are led by people of proven experience and integrity. Power Forward Communities itself is led by a former President and CEO of Fannie Mae who was also General Counsel of Bank of America; one of its subgrantees is led by a former director of the U.S Office of Management and Budget and HUD Secretary; and another of its subgrantees is led by a former Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo who also served as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Such impressive leadership and proven track records make the coalitions eminently suited to fulfill Congress \u2019 s objectives. It is disingenuous of EPA to insinuate that the coalition structure implies Plaintiffs \u2019 lack of qualifications when it is \u201ccommon practice for established organizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and programs\u201d; coalition applicants were specifically invited toUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 58 of 9229apply for the grants by EPA; and the coalition partners and their leaders are extraordinarily qualified to administer the grant awards. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 8 (J.A 363); NOFO at 6 (J.A 1738). Nothing in the record materially disputes any of that.Nor do EPA \u2019 s purported concerns about conflicts of interest hold water. Start with the example selected by the majority. Maj. Op. 6 &amp; n.2 The majority highlights that, in urging its Office of Inspector General to open an investigation into the grant program, EPA \u2019 s Acting Deputy Administrator alleged that \u201cJahi Wise, the former director of the GGRF, personally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital [(CGC)]\u2014without recusing himself. \u201d Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPAOIG (J.A 107). But the record squarely contradicts that allegation. Consistent with \u201cEPA Order 5700.5A1, EPA \u2019 s Policy for Competition of Assistance Agreements, and the rigorous ethics and conflict-of-interest review carried out by EPA during the review and selection process for GGRF funding . . . Mr. Wise was recused from reviewing, evaluating, selecting, or approving funding on any grant competition for GGRF funding for which CGC submitted an application. \u201d Hopson Decl. \u00b6 22 (J.A 421). That is, in addition to recusing himself from CGC \u2019 s application for funding, \u201cMr. Wise did not even review applications from CGC \u2019 s competitors for GGRF funds. \u201d Id. Even EPA recognizes that its speculation about conflicts of interest does not support its termination decision. Indeed, after failing to present the district court with any evidence of fraud, conflicts of interest, or anything even approaching \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d EPA pivoted to argue that its decision to terminate the grants was solely \u201cbased on reasons of policy\u201d and did not have anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 59 of 9230EPA \u2019 s characterization of the grants \u2019 funding structure as an \u201cunusual and apparently improper\u201d \u201cscheme [to] remove[] $20 billion from governmental oversight in the days, weeks, and months before a new administration took office\u201d is similarly unfounded. Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPAOIG (J.A 107). As explained above, Plaintiffs received their awards as lump-sum payments which they held in accounts at Citibank, subject to a security interest held by EPA. That financial structure was specifically chosen to enable Plaintiffs to carry out Congress \u2019 s directive to act \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(c)(3). If the grant funds are to help attract private financing for clean energy projects, either by recruiting private co-investors or offering credit enhancements that make projects less risky for private investors, the funds need to be Plaintiffs \u2019 own assets and reflected on their balance sheets as such. See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 9-14; Bafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32 (J.A 370-72). Under EPA \u2019 s standard grant disbursement system, in contrast, a recipient \u2019 s balance sheet reflects only the portions of the award that have already been expended, rather than the full award amount. Adherence to the agency \u2019 s default payment system would have impeded Plaintiffs \u2019 ability to recruit private capital. To effectuate Congress \u2019 s direction, EPA instead deposited the full award amount in Citibank accounts opened in Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 names. That way, their balance sheets reflected Plaintiffs \u2019 ownership of the full amount of the award, even as they drew down funds from the account only as needed and in compliance with their obligations to fund projects and cover administrative costs.That funding mechanism was contemplated by EPA as early as July 2023\u2014long before any potential change in administration. See NOFO 55-56 (J.A 1787-88) (contemplating departures from standard EPA practice, including a \u201cone-time or periodic balance-sheet USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 60 of 9231capitalization(s)\u201d). And there is nothing improper about it. Rather, \u201cfederal financial agents\u201d like Citibank are \u201croutinely appointed\u201d and are specifically authorized by statute. Transactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C Cir. 1996); 12 U.S.C \u00a7 265. Most relevant to EPA \u2019 s litigating position, the financial agent structure affords EPA more oversight than the agency \u2019 s standard payment system. Citibank \u2019 s interface displays these grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 expenditures broken down by budget category and provides EPA with full, real-time view access into each of the grantees \u2019 and subgrantees \u2019 accounts. Those oversight features are absent from EPA \u2019 s standard disbursement system, which reports only the amount of money drawn down by the recipient. EPA \u2019 s determination that the \u201cprior administration \u2019 s designation of a financial agent . . . untenably reduced EPA \u2019 s oversight\u201d has it backwards. Gov. Br. 10.In the same vein, EPA asserts that, because some subgrantees may distribute award funds to other entities, EPA lacks the \u201cvisibility to see how [the subgrantees are] making those decisions or how that money is being used. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 34:2-4; see also Gov. Br. 10. That concern inexplicably disregards the many ways in which EPA can oversee the subgrantees \u2019 activities. EPA approved detailed budgets and workplans that specify how the subgrantees will use the grant money. Just like the grantees, every subgrantee must certify, under threat of \u201cprosecution under 18 U.S.C 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions,\u201d that each requested withdrawal of funds from its Citibank account is \u201cnecessary to execute against the workplan for the Subaward Agreement supported with EPA funding. \u201d Subgrantee Account Control Agreement, Ex. B (J.A 1189). And subgrantees \u2019 progress against that workplan is tracked and reported in quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports to EPA. For instance, Rewiring Community Investment Fund\u2014aUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 61 of 9232Power Forward Communities subgrantee\u2014describes how its inability to access its funding will prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its EPA-approved workplan, which include \u201cestablish[ing] a loan loss reserve to encourage lenders to provide loans with significantly discounted interest rates\u201d to households for energy-efficient, clean heating and cooling systems. Matusiak Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 447). Moreover, many of the subgrantees are financial institutions that are themselves subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators. JCF Ltr. at 3 (May 21, 2025).To the extent EPA takes issue with the fact that grantees may provide \u201csubgrants to others, who then pass it through to others,\u201d that is the structure that Congress, not the prior administration, chose to adopt. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(2) (\u201cThe eligible recipient shall provide funding\u201d to \u201centities that provide financial assistance to qualified projects at the State, local, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of Columbia, including community- and low-income-focused lenders and capital providers. \u201d).Tellingly, when one of the Plaintiffs responded to EPA \u2019 s asserted concerns about its ability to oversee subgrantees by proposing restructuring the $770 million of its grant funding that was slated for distribution to subgrantee community lenders, EPA ignored it. JCF Ltr. at 2-3. Under the proposal, the vast majority of the Plaintiff \u2019 s money would remain unspent in a segregated trust or escrow account that EPA could monitor. Instead of being distributed to the community lenders to lend directly, the funds would be used to secure the loans made by those community lenders to small businesses and communities looking to finance clean energy projects. In that way, the grant funds could have advanced the programs \u2019 goals USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 62 of 9233while largely staying put in an account monitored by EPA. EPA did not respond to the letter, despite repeated follow-up from the Plaintiff. Id. at 1. That lack of engagement further suggests that EPA \u2019 s purported oversight concerns are not the real reason it terminated Plaintiffs \u2019 grant awards.At bottom, each of EPA \u2019 s specific examples of oversight concerns is refuted by the record. And its broad-brush argument is simply untenable in light of the detailed oversight mechanisms available to EPA. EPA \u2019 s assertions that it had such grave oversight concerns that it had to cancel the grant awards overnight run aground on a conceded lack of any indication that Plaintiffs were out of compliance with the award terms, let alone that they were engaging in any conflicts of interest, fraud, or criminal activity. In addition to the real-time visibility Citibank provides EPA into Plaintiffs \u2019 and their subgrantees \u2019 accounts, EPA receives quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports detailing Plaintiffs \u2019 transactions, activities, progress against their workplans, and expenditures by budget category, as well as mandatory quarterly conflict-of-interest reporting by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(a) (J.A 373). Before it purported to halt the program and itself disengaged from constructive communication, EPA had also held meetings with Plaintiffs \u201cat least weekly, and, at times, two to three times per week,\u201d to discuss their \u201cprogram plans, reporting, oversight, and compliance with the EPA Terms and Conditions. \u201d Id. \u00b6 35(b) (J.A 373); Arabshahi Decl. \u00b6 34 (J.A 1981). On top of those controls, Plaintiffs are subject to third-party audits and to \u201ctransaction testing\u201d by EPA, in which EPA conducts a \u201csystematic examination and verification of every dollar spent by [the grantee] to ensure they comply with the grant \u2019 s terms, conditions, and applicable regulations. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 35(g), (h) (J.A 373). USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 63 of 9234EPA and the majority make much of the fact that the grant awards were amended in December 2024 and January 2025, claiming that these \u201clast-minute\u201d modifications in the waning days of the Biden administration were implemented to \u201cmake it more difficult for the government to terminate the agreements. \u201d Maj. Op. 5; see Gov. Br. 10, 34. EPA specifically contends that the original terms of the awards allowed it to terminate them \u201cbased on [a] change in policy priorities,\u201d per the version of EPA \u2019 s General Terms and Conditions in place before October 2024\u2014a contention the majority credits. Oral Arg. Tr. 102:17-25; see Maj. Op. 5 n. 1. That is incorrect.The original grant agreements, signed in August 2024\u2014months before the election\u2014already incorporated the termination provision from EPA \u2019 s now-operative General Terms and Conditions. Those General Terms and Conditions allow terminations of federal awards based on a change in policy priorities only when that basis for termination is \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d set forth in the award agreement itself. 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.340(a)(4), (b) (emphasis added). (Neither the EPA nor the majority contends that the award agreement itself, apart from the referenced regulation, allows the awards to be terminated based on a change in policy priorities.) The December 2024 amendment to the grant award thus did not alter the permissible bases for termination, which had never allowed termination for changed policy priorities.Plaintiffs \u2019 original award agreements specifically stated that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the General Term and Condition \u2018Termination, \u2019 [otherwise in effect before October 1, 2024,] EPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement only as specified in . . . the version of 2 CFR 200.340 applicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 Fed. Reg. 55262 (July 3, 2024). \u201d J.A 552 (emphasis added). The USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 64 of 9235version of the regulation the awards incorporated from the outset was the one providing \u201cthat an agency may terminate a Federal award if it no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities (e.g unilateral termination) but only when such language is clearly and unambiguously included in the terms and conditions of the award,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, 55,263 (July 3, 2024) (emphasis added).EPA adopted that constraint pursuant to OMB \u2019 s invitation to agencies to opt into the revised rule before its default October 1, 2024, effective date. As of July 2024, EPA announced in the Federal Register that it had \u201cdecided to apply the revised version of 2 CFR 200.340 to EPA financial assistance agreements awarded or amended to add funds on or after July 1, 2024. \u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 55263. The December amendment thus imposed no new limit on EPA \u2019 s \u201ccontrol over [the] grant funding. \u201d Gov. Br. 10.The timing of the amendment also is entirely innocuous. EPA had explained shortly after the awards were announced in April 2024 that it would share draft award terms that month, and that it \u201cexpected the terms to change based on awardee feedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for awardee workplans. \u201d Bafford Decl. \u00b6 19 (J.A 367). EPA accordingly planned to communicate a \u201cfinal\u201d set of award terms in late June, followed by an iterative process during the fall and winter of 2024 in which EPA would receive grantees \u2019 suggested modifications based on their experience implementing the programs. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17-20 (J.A 366-68). Despite EPA \u2019 s and the majority \u2019 s insinuations to the contrary, nothing about the timing or content of those amendments supports Defendants \u2019 assertion that they were intended to reduce the agency \u2019 s oversight or control in the next administration. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 65 of 9236Neither does the \u201cgold bars\u201d video, which Zeldin repeatedly referenced in public comments smearing Plaintiffs, provide any plausible basis for sincere oversight concerns on the part of EPA \u2019 s new leadership. In the November 2024 Project Veritas video, an EPA staffer is shown saying to a peer on a Tinder date (who was surreptitiously filming him) that EPA was \u201ctrying to get the money out as fast as possible\u201d before Trump \u2019 s inauguration. Lisa Friedman, An Offhand Remark About Gold Bars, Secretly Recorded, Upended His Life, N.Y TIMES (July 1, 2025), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9\">https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9</url>. Whatever the staffer may have meant, those comments cannot have been referring to awards under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund because those had been fully obligated as of August 2024 (in accordance with Congress \u2019 s September 2024 deadline). \u201cEPA Awards $27B in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Grants to Accelerate Clean Energy Solutions, Combat the Climate Crisis, and Save Families Money,\u201d EPA (Aug. 16, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A\">https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A</url>. Anyone with a basic familiarity with the GGRF program would understand that a video of a staffer \u2019 s bluster at a bar in November is irrelevant to the grants at issue here.In sum, the record makes clear that EPA \u2019 s abrupt termination of the grant awards on the eve of the TRO hearing cannot rationally be explained by reference to the agency leadership \u2019 s professed oversight concerns. That alone shows that the agency violated the APA, as EPA \u2019 s explanation for its decision to terminate the awards \u201cruns counter to the evidence before\u201d it. State Farm, 463 U.S at 43. Far more troubling, EPA \u2019 s dogged pursuit of criminal investigations unsupported by probable cause and its unsubstantiated public accusations of criminal activity strongly suggest that the agency \u2019 s professed oversight concerns are pretextual. EPA \u2019 s refusals to discuss its declared concerns with Plaintiffs themselves, engage with their responses, or even wait to consider how they would answer its USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 66 of 9237oversight questions give the lie to its widely trumpeted concerns. Contrived, baseless justifications for the grant terminations do not satisfy the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law,\u201d which \u201cis meant to ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Com., 588 U.S at 785. The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c[a]ccepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise. \u201d Id. \u201cIf judicial review is to be more than an empty ritual, it must demand something better\u201d by way of reasoned explanation than the false statements EPA broadcast to build a sensationalist public narrative in its favor. Id.2. Separation of PowersIt is equally clear that EPA \u2019 s actions violate the Constitution. Our constitutional system of separation of powers rests on the idea that national \u201cpolicy is for Congress and the President to establish as they see fit in enacting statutes, and for the President and subordinate executive agencies . . . to implement within statutory boundaries. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257. \u201cMoney is the instrument of policy,\u201d Clinton, 524 U.S at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring), and it is Congress\u2014not the executive branch acting unilaterally\u2014that has \u201cexclusive power over the federal purse,\u201d Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. E.P.A , 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C Cir. 1992). Only Congress may authorize \u201cmoney [to] be paid out of the Treasury. \u201d Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S 308, 321 (1937). And when it does so, the executive \u201cmay not ignore\u201d those funding directives \u201cmerely because of policy disagreement with Congress. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260.To hold otherwise would allow \u201cthe executive [to] possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,\u201d 2USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 67 of 9238JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \u00a7 1348, at 215 (Thomas Cooley ed., 4th ed. 1873)\u2014the very concentration of power the Appropriations Clause was intended to prevent. See Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 U.S at 321. It is thus incontrovertible that, \u201c[a]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals. \u201d City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018). As then-Judge Kavanaugh explained, it is a \u201csettled, bedrock principle[] of constitutional law\u201d that neither the President nor his \u201csubordinate executive agencies\u201d may \u201cdecline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections. \u201d Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259. Insofar as the majority defends a prerogative of EPA to cancel the grants for policy reasons, the majority \u2019 s assertion that \u201cthe [Inflation Reduction] Act does not limit the Administrator \u2019 s discretion to withhold or terminate grants,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, squarely conflicts with Aiken.Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated federal funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and instructed EPA \u201cto make grants\u201d by September 30, 2024, to \u201cnonprofit organization[s] that [are] designed to provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a) (providing funds \u201cto remain available until September 30, 2024\u201d and instructing EPA to make the described grants), (c)(1)(A) (specifying that \u201celigible recipients\u201d must be able to leverage private capital). The statute specifies that grantees, working in partnership with the private sector and with local communities, must provide funding and other assistance to housing and infrastructure projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Id.USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 68 of 9239\u00a7 7434(b). EPA is constitutionally obligated to administer those grants; it cannot unilaterally decide to get rid of the grant programs based on the Administration \u2019 s policy preference to \u201c[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal. \u201d 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357.The district court found that EPA sought to do just that. It found that \u201cEPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter,\u201d as shown by EPA \u2019 s public expressions of determination to shut down the grant program, and as confirmed by its action to terminate \u201call eight grants comprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The district court \u2019 s factfinding is amply supported by the record, and the majority \u2019 s conclusion that it was clearly erroneous cannot be squared with EPA \u2019 s remarkable conduct in this case. Maj. Op. 25-26.As already discussed, EPA \u2019 s actions at every turn reveal its determination to permanently defund the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs for no more reason than that President Trump announced that goal. See 90 Fed. Reg. at 8357 (directing agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by preventing the \u201cdisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act\u201d). Without any further planning, consideration, or explanation, EPA acted to prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds. Current agency leadership has demonized the recipients as if the President \u2019 s policy preferences alone license them to slander as fraudulent or criminal any grantee whose activities do not align with those preferences. No matter that all evidence confirms that Plaintiffs were spending their money precisely as Congress intended and authorized.Indeed, EPA \u2019 s hasty decisions to freeze and terminate the grant awards with no evidence of noncompliance and no communication with Plaintiffs cannot be explained as anything USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 69 of 9240other than a decision to do what the President said he wanted only because he said so. The decision to terminate the grants just hours before the district court had a scheduled occasion to rule on whether to restore or preserve Plaintiffs \u2019 access to their award funds is hard to explain as anything but a bald effort to rewrite the statute and undo what was done in compliance with it. Those are not legitimate means to advance the new President \u2019 s policy agenda. Why terminate grant awards that had been made and were being carried out as Congress intended unless EPA \u2019 s real disagreement was with Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice to fund \u201cgreen energy\u201d projects?The majority chides the district court for discounting EPA \u2019 s representations that it intended to reconstitute the grant programs with increased oversight. Maj. Op. 25-26. At oral argument, EPA disavowed any \u201cfrontal assault on the appropriation or Congress \u2019 s objective,\u201d insisting that the agency \u201cintends, as consistent with principles of appropriations law, to continue to make these funds available in a permissible way and in a way that comports with the oversight principles that it thinks are important here. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. at 25. But, as discussed below, since the appropriation \u2019 s deadline to obligate the funds has passed, EPA retains at most a narrow authority to make \u201creplacement\u201d grants and cannot obligate the funds anew.In any event, the district court had ample basis not to credit EPA \u2019 s representations that it will spend the funds as Congress intended. The court observed EPA \u2019 s track record throughout this case of making slanderous and insupportable public statements and disavowing them in court in favor of self-serving contradictory representations. The court knew that EPA instigated unsupported criminal and civil investigations to hunt for justifications to claw back Plaintiffs \u2019 money and observed that the agency remained unable to provide any USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 70 of 9241evidence to support its very public assertions of mismanagement and insufficient oversight. Presented with EPA \u2019 s actions and its patent inability to justify them on any other basis, the district court was on unassailably solid evidentiary footing in finding that EPA \u2019 s actions had nothing to do with its professed oversight concerns. EPA simply sought to \u201cdismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter. \u201d Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115.EPA \u2019 s \u201crepeated[] represent[ations] that it planned to re-commit the funds,\u201d Maj. Op. 23, ring entirely hollow in light of its patent inability to do so. See Bagenstos Amicus Br. 3-11. It is an \u201celementary principle\u201d of federal appropriations law that \u201ca federal agency \u2019 s budget authority lapses on the last day of the period for which funds were obligated. \u201d W. Va. Ass \u2019 n of Cmty. Health Ctrs, Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C Cir. 1984). Here, Congress specified that the appropriation for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund would \u201cremain available until September 30, 2024. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(a)(1), (2), (3). The appropriation thus expired on that date, after which EPA could no longer use the funding to incur new obligations. See Off. of Nat. Res. Revenue-Coop. Agreements, B-321297, 2011 WL 3343023, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Aug. 2, 2011).Federal appropriations law thus bars EPA from terminating the awards and then re-obligating the funds to reconstitute the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs. \u201cIf an agency deobligates funds after the expiration of the period of availability, the funds are not available for new obligations. \u201d Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation for Additional Project Phases, B-286929, 2001 WL 717355, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Apr. 25, 2001). In other words, once EPA terminates the grant awards, it will no longer have the authority to make new grant awards to fulfill its statutory obligations. The majority suggests that Congress \u2019 s repeal last month of the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 71 of 9242Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could affect EPA \u2019 s asserted authority to recommit the funds and thereby relieve it of any obligation to do so. Maj. Op. 25 n. 11. It does neither. The statute rescinds only \u201cunobligated\u201d funds: Obligated funds, like those at issue here, are unaffected. One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Pub. L. No. 119-21, \u00a7 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 155 (2025). See generally July 7, 2025, Neitzel Ltr. to Clerk of Court Cislak (noting that Senator Capito described the proposition that OBBBA might \u201cclaw back money\u201d as \u201cridiculous\u201d) (quoting Josh Siegel, Q&amp;A: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, incoming EPW chair, (Nov. 20, 2024), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9\">https://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9</url>). It is the federal appropriations rule, not the repeal legislation, that prevents EPA from recommitting the funds.EPA \u2019 s assertions that it will nonetheless fulfill Congress \u2019 s plan by labeling its re-obligations as \u201creplacement grants,\u201d Reply Br. 17, are empty promises. The majority, too, cites replacement-grant authority as evidence of EPA \u2019 s intent to continue the program with new grantees rather than terminate it. Maj. Op. 24 &amp; n.10 To qualify as a replacement grant, the re-obligation would have to be \u201csubstantially identical in scope and purpose to the original grant. \u201d The Honorable Lawton Chiles U.S Senate, B-164031, 1976 WL 10353, at *4 (Comp. Gen. June 25, 1976). Those requirements cannot be met by new grants that materially alter the financial structure, number of grantees, or other oversight controls\u2014meaning that EPA would have to retain the very features it claims prompted the agency to interfere with Plaintiffs \u2019 grants. See NRDC Amicus Br. 9-13.The majority reasons that, because \u201cthere is no evidence the agency sought to dismantle the programs without congressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees \u2019 claims. \u201d Maj. Op. 26. The majority \u2019 s factual premise USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 72 of 9243is unsupported, and the validity of Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim follows from Aiken County. We held in Aiken County that executive agencies violate the constitutional separation of powers when they refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress because they disagree with Congress \u2019 s policy choice. 725 F.3d at 260. There, as here, Congress appropriated funds for a particular effort (there, assessing applications to store nuclear waste; here, making competitive grants) and set a statutory deadline for the agency to act. Id. at 257-58. When the agency refused to adhere to the statute due to \u201cpolicy disagreement[s] with Congress,\u201d we held that refusal violated the Constitution, posing a threat to undermine \u201cour constitutional system of separation of powers\u201d that supported judicial intervention. Id. at 260, 267.EPA \u2019 s attempts to dismantle the statutorily mandated NCIF and CCIA programs due to the current agency leadership \u2019 s policy disagreements with Congress run afoul of the Constitution in the same way. In rejecting Plaintiffs \u2019 separation of powers claim, the majority says that it is \u201cdeclin[ing] to adopt a principle that would convert every statutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim. \u201d Maj. Op. 23. That may well be advisable, but it does not describe the rule of Aiken County that properly applies here. The majority cannot choose to \u201cdecline\u201d to apply our binding precedent. Wherever the line between constitutional and statutory claims lies, Aiken County squarely holds that EPA \u2019 s actions violated the Constitution.B. Irreparable Injury and Balance of EquitiesBaseless allegations of fraudulent or criminal activity, coupled with EPA \u2019 s unfounded interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 grant funds, threaten enormous harm to Plaintiffs and, more importantly, to the communities, businesses, and individuals USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 73 of 9244across the United States who stand to benefit from the uses of the money that Congress prescribed. Without access to their grant awards, Plaintiffs are already out of money to make payments for rent, third-party contractors, and insurance policies critical to continue operating, and many of the Plaintiffs will permanently shutter in the coming months. Plaintiffs have already been forced to defer compensation for, lay off, withdraw offers from, and lose employees with specialized expertise that \u201ccannot be replaced easily, if at all. \u201d Supp. Bafford Decl. \u00b6 7 (J.A 954).Absent funding from Plaintiffs, major projects already underway will fold\u2014projects intended to create demand for and boost the global competitiveness of U.S advanced electric manufacturing capability, provide critically necessary affordable housing and infrastructure, lower energy costs, improve air quality, and reduce climate risks across the United States. If the agency succeeds in taking back the funding provided under the Act, many of those projects will not be able to raise capital from other sources and will irrevocably fail. That is particularly likely because Congress directed grantees to invest in \u201cqualified projects that would otherwise lack access to financing. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434(b)(1). As just a single example, one subgrantee community lender has set up projects to install clean-energy microgrids at churches, community centers, and nursing homes in rural Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama to provide sustained power during outages of existing power sources. Without the subgrantee \u2019 s promised funds, those projects are at risk of being left undone.

They defy Congress \u2019 s objectives for authorizing and funding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: to provide financial assistance to pollution-reducing projects \u201cin partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector. \u201d 42 U.S.C \u00a7 7434 (c)(3)(A). By directing Citibank to freeze Plaintiffs \u2019 money, the government is making it impossible for Plaintiffs to serve as reliable funding partners, ruining their prospects for securing future partnerships, favorable loan terms, qualified staff, and federal grant funding. As one Plaintiff explained:To be an effective financing counterparty, CGC (or any organization) must have certainty of funding sources, be able to move efficiently and reliably in negotiations, and be viewed as credible by involved parties. CGC is made ineffective if potential partners cannot rely on when CGC \u2019 s capital will become available. No credible counterparty will take this funding risk, or be willing to be associated financially with CGC.Kauffman Decl. \u00b6 13 (J.A 429). That reputational harm is devastating to Plaintiffs. Because \u201cpart of [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] purpose is to bridge market failures and attract private co-investment to projects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, confidence in [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] commitments as . . . investor[s] is vital to achieving buy-in from private sector investors. . . . The longer the freeze on [Plaintiffs \u2019 ] funds continues, the more difficult it will be for [them] to originate deals and secure co-investors. \u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23 (J.A 430-31). Worse, the agency \u2019 s action contrary to Congress \u2019 enactment sets off a cycle of skepticism. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 75 of 9246When Plaintiffs \u2019 hard-won partnerships with private investors and community lenders initially hesitant to fund clean-energy projects evaporate, those partners will be all the more reluctant to invest in similar ventures in the future. Plaintiffs \u201chave had to work hard to build relationships and to earn a reputation as [] trustworthy, reliable lending institution[s],\u201d and the \u201cknock-on effects\u201d of the damage EPA has caused to their reputations \u201cwill delay adoption and therefore achievement of GGRF \u2019 s mission. \u201d Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (J.A 947).These harms are the very definition of irreparable injury. Once a lender \u2019 s reputation as a stable source of promised funding is compromised, it is difficult, if not impossible, to repair. Indeed, investors and loan applicants have already pulled out of near-final agreements due to the uncertainty over whether Plaintiffs will be able to access their funds. Projects underway that miss key deadlines due to Plaintiffs \u2019 inability to make good on their loan commitments will be shut down permanently.More broadly, the distrust bred by EPA \u2019 s actions will make it exceedingly difficult to revive the coordination and cooperation between nonprofit organizations, private investors, private businesses, and community lenders critical to carrying out Congress \u2019 s objective of building important projects at low public cost by spending government grant money to leverage private investment. What is more, without a court-ordered injunction, the government \u2019 s actions portend that EPA will drain the money from Plaintiffs \u2019 accounts with no apparent avenue for Plaintiffs to reclaim it. Once EPA successfully terminates the awards and moves the funds back to Treasury\u2014as it intends to do as soon as the district court \u2019 s injunction is lifted, see Oral Arg. Tr. 4:14-16\u2014it is unlikely that a court would be able to order their return to Plaintiffs or take any other action to fulfill the agency \u2019 s congressional mandate. See City USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 76 of 9247of Houston, Tex. v. Dep \u2019 t of Hous. &amp; Urb.

(explaining that EPA cannot re-obligate the grant funds, nor can a court order it to do so, because the appropriation authorizing those funds expired in September 2024). Under such circumstances, any eventual judicial declaration that the terminations were unlawful would be a hollow victory.On the other side of the ledger, the government claims that allowing Plaintiffs to access their funding will cause \u201csubstantial and irreparable harm to the public fisc. \u201d Gov. Br. 41. But as the government itself submits, its \u201cbases for termination were the grants \u2019 structure and terms\u201d which \u201creflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,\u201d not anything to do with Plaintiffs \u2019 \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cconduct. \u201d PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government insists that it is \u201cnot accusing anybody of fraud. \u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 27:16. That is, the government no longer disputes that Plaintiffs are using the award funds as initially instructed by EPA, and as mandated by Congress. It is hard to see how the public is harmed by Plaintiffs \u2019 use of money allotted by Congress to carry out its duly enacted policies.C. Tucker ActThe government attempts to divert this court \u2019 s attention from its brazenly unlawful actions by arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claims. But the district court at a minimum had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 77 of 9248meritorious separation of powers claim. That alone provides jurisdiction for the preliminary injunction.In any event, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that the Tucker Act bars Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA is wrong. Plaintiffs are not seeking reinstatement of their grant awards or any other form of specific performance of contracts. Nor are they seeking payment of funds from the Treasury. Their suit challenges the government \u2019 s decision to illegally seize their property\u2014money in bank accounts opened in their names, in which the government has only a security interest (which it has not exercised). The grant awards define that money as \u201cgross income earned by\u201d Plaintiffs, meaning that title to the money passed to Plaintiffs when the award funds were deposited in their Citibank accounts. Grant Award at 53 (J.A 1134) (quoting 2 C.F.R \u00a7 200.1).Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the funds in their accounts is cemented by the Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, and each grantee, which specify that Citibank \u201cmaintains the Accounts for [Plaintiffs],\u201d and that Plaintiffs are \u201cthe entitlement holder[s] with respect to all financial assets credited from time to time to the Accounts. \u201d J.A 1144. Citibank \u2019 s status as a \u201cfiduciary of the government,\u201d Maj. Op. 14\u2014in which capacity it promises to maintain accounts for Plaintiffs, allow them to \u201caccess and use funds\u201d in their accounts, and provide view access to EPA, Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A \u00a7\u00a7 I.A.1, I.D.1 (J.A 2145, 2149)\u2014changes nothing about Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the money in their accounts. That Citibank has a contractual obligation to the government to serve as a custodian of Plaintiffs \u2019 funds does not mean that the government owns the funds.Indeed, Plaintiffs \u2019 title to the award funds, which allows the award to serve as a liquid asset instead of an inherently USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 78 of 9249risky \u201cexpected income stream,\u201d is critical to Congress \u2019 s decision to equip grantees to attract private investment and is one of the reasons EPA selected the financial agent structure. Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 7-14. Plaintiffs thus seek an equitable remedy \u201cfor the recovery of specific property or monies,\u201d which stands in contradistinction to money damages, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S 879, 893 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added), the \u201cprototypical contract remedy,\u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.The nature of the relief that Plaintiffs seek\u2014recovery of property that is lawfully theirs\u2014suffices to resolve the Tucker Act question against the government. Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S 731 (1947), reflects that longstanding principle. There, the plaintiff sought an injunction preventing the U.S Maritime Commission from selling shares of stock that the plaintiff alleged it owned under a contract with the Commission. Id. at 734. The Court held that the district court had jurisdiction over the case even though the plaintiff \u2019 s alleged right to the disputed property originated in a contract and depended on interpreting the contract in its favor. The Court nonetheless recognized that the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cclaim rests on [its] right under general law to recover possession of specific property wrongfully withheld\u201d\u2014a claim sounding in tort, not contract. Id. at 735-36. That was so even though the government possessed and had \u201crecord title\u201d to the property. Id. at 737. As the Court explained:[P]ublic officials may become tort-feasors by exceeding the limits of their authority. And where they unlawfully seize or hold a citizen \u2019 s realty or chattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or in equity, he is not relegated to the Court of Claims to recover a money judgment. The dominant interest of the sovereign is then on the side of the victim whoUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 79 of 9250may bring his possessory action to reclaim that which is wrongfully withheld.Id. at 738.We acknowledged in Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis the line drawn in Land v. Dollar between claims to property acquired by contract\u2014which may proceed in district court\u2014and claims to enforce rights to contractual proceeds, which must proceed in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act: \u201cThe Supreme Court many years ago recognized a private party \u2019 s cause of action outside the Tucker Act to challenge the statutory authority of federal officials to claim ownership rights in property allegedly transferred during the course of a contract. \u201d 672 F.2d at 968-69. That principle confirms the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction here. Moreover, these cases underscore that a claim to recover property need not be framed as an unconstitutional taking to proceed in district court.Plaintiffs claim that EPA has unlawfully interfered with their previously disbursed funds in violation of, inter alia, the APA. Appellee Br. at 15. Plaintiffs assert that EPA has \u201cunlawfully seize[d]\u201d their property, and they seek an injunction to \u201creclaim that which is wrongfully withheld. \u201d Dollar, 330 U.S at 738. This case is even clearer in that regard than Land v. Dollar itself, because the government has neither title to nor possession of the disputed funds. Plaintiffs \u2019 action is one to recover their property. It does not seek any money from the Treasury. It is not a contract action so is not \u201crelegated to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. As in Megapulse, Plaintiff \u2019 s \u201cposition is ultimately based, not on breach of contract, but on an alleged governmental infringement of property rights and violation of [a statute]. \u201d 672 F.2d at 969.The Supreme Court itself recently recognized that distinction in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine AdvocacyUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 80 of 9251Coalition, where it declined to stay a district court order requiring the government to issue payments owed to plaintiffs for foreign aid work they had already completed. 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025). The government argued there, as here, that the plaintiffs essentially sought to enforce a government contract so must proceed, if at all, in the Court of Claims. See id. at 756 (Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., dissenting from the denial of the application to vacate the district court \u2019 s order). The Court was unpersuaded that the government thus was likely to establish a sovereign immunity bar against the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Id. at 753. Like the grantees here, the plaintiffs in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition brought APA and constitutional challenges to defendants \u2019 interference with their existing entitlement to grant funding. Their claims depended not on breach of their contracts, but on the unlawfulness of the government \u2019 s actions. The district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 APA and constitutional claims here is even clearer than it was in AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, because here, unlike there, payment was already made.Those same facts\u2014that Plaintiffs seek an injunction preventing the government from interfering with money the government has already properly disbursed to them\u2014renders inapplicable the Supreme Court \u2019 s emergency stay orders in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Ass \u2019 n, No. 25-A-103, 2025 WL 2415669 (Aug. 21, 2025), and Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025). I respect the reasoning of those orders where they apply, but no part of the district court \u2019 s injunction in this case \u201corder[s] the payment of money\u201d from the Treasury or requires the government to \u201cpay out past-due grant obligations\u201d or to \u201ccontinue paying obligations as they accrue. \u201d Dep \u2019 t of Ed., 145 S. Ct. at 968. And, unlike plaintiffs in National Institutes of Health, Plaintiffs here need not seek to enforce theUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 81 of 9252government \u2019 s \u201cobligation to pay money,\u201d 2025 WL 2415669, at *1, because these Plaintiffs \u2019 money was already paid before Defendants interfered with it.Rather, what Plaintiffs seek here is to unfreeze their funds and to enjoin EPA from unlawfully interfering with them based on the President \u2019 s announced policy disagreement with Congress \u2019 s objectives. In doing so, Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s decision to replace Congress \u2019 s legislated policy choice with one aligning with the President \u2019 s directions. See Executive Order 14154 (ordering agencies to \u201cTerminat[e] the Green New Deal\u201d by stopping the \u201cdisbursement of funds\u201d); J.A 507 (Defendants opposition to motion for preliminary injunction describing contract terminations as \u201creflect[ing] no more than a decision based on reasons of policy\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115-16 (finding that EPA \u201cseeks to dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a policy matter\u201d). To the extent National Institutes of Health applies here, it supports the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the policy-based interference with Plaintiffs \u2019 funds. See National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (Barrett, J., concurring) (asserting that a district court likely has jurisdiction over challenges to an agency \u2019 s policies).Binding precedent of this court anchors the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction. Our \u201clongstanding test for determining whether a claim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court pursuant to the Tucker Act\u201d confirms that the Tucker Act does not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106. We explained in Megapulse that, in order to preserve the Court of Claims \u2019 exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cactions based on government contracts,\u201d a plaintiff whose \u201cclaims against the United States are essentially contractual\u201d cannot be allowed to \u201cavoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 82 of 9253the Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would enable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate statute. \u201d 672 F.2d at 967. Whether a \u201cparticular action\u201d is \u201c\u2018at its essence \u2019 a contract action depends both on [1] the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon [2] the type of relief sought (or appropriate). \u201d Id. at 968. That is a flexible, context-specific inquiry that directs us to \u201cdetermine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract action that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the Court of Claims. \u201d Id.Starting with the first prong, to determine whether the \u201csource of the rights\u201d of a claim is contractual, we consider whether the plaintiff \u2019 s arguments turn on the terms of the contract. In Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, for instance, we concluded that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201ca disguised contract action\u201d because the plaintiff did not \u201cseek to enforce any duty imposed upon [the government] by the [relevant contract],\u201d nor did it \u201ccontend [the government] breached the terms\u201d of the contract or \u201cinvoke\u201d the contract in any other meaningful way. 864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in Megapulse, we were \u201cconvinced\u201d that the plaintiff \u2019 s claims were not \u201cdisguised\u201d contract claims by the fact that the plaintiff did not \u201cclaim a breach of contract\u201d and based its \u201crequest for relief\u201d on non-contractual documents. 672 F.2d at 969.Plaintiffs \u2019 APA challenge to Defendants \u2019 arbitrary and capricious action is clearly not a \u201cdisguised contract action. \u201d Their claim is not premised on EPA \u2019 s violation of the grant agreements \u2019 termination provisions, nor on its failure to perform any duty \u201cimposed\u201d on EPA by the grant award. Rather, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to relief because EPA froze and seeks to seize their funds based on pretextual, internally inconsistent, and unfounded reasons. See, e.g , USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 83 of 9254Plaintiffs \u2019 Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (PI Mot.) 29 (J.A 327) (arguing that \u201cthe record leading up to the termination\u201d\u2014for example, the fact that EPA purported to terminate the grants several days after professing a \u201clack of critical information\u201d about \u201cconcerns regarding potential fraud\u201d that would be informed by an ongoing compliance review\u2014\u201chighlights the pretextual nature of EPA \u2019 s stated invocation of waste, fraud, and abuse\u201d). According to Plaintiffs, and as supported by the record, EPA acted entirely outside the bounds of acceptable agency action by first deciding to seize the money Plaintiffs had been awarded and then casting about for after-the-fact justifications\u2014including pressuring Citibank into freezing Plaintiffs \u2019 funds without any basis, notice, or explanation, and directing DOJ and FBI to open criminal investigations into Plaintiffs \u2019 grant performance without probable cause, or any grounds whatsoever. See PI Mot. 1-4 (J.A 299-302).That is precisely the type of arbitrary and capricious action the APA is designed to address. As the Supreme Court explained in Department of Commerce v. New York, agency action is arbitrary and capricious when the agency \u2019 s \u201cstated rationale was pretextual,\u201d because \u201ccontrived reasons . . . defeat the purpose of\u201d the \u201creasoned explanation requirement of administrative law. \u201d 588 U.S at 773-74, 785. The non-contractual \u201cessence\u201d of Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim has been clear since Plaintiffs filed their complaint and sought a preliminary injunction. They have from the outset sought to show that EPA \u2019 s vague, unsupported, and irrational justifications are merely \u201cpretextual cover to shut down a program approved by Congress that the new Administration does not like. \u201d PI Mot. 29 (J.A 327). That was clear to the district court from the very first hearing. See Mar. 12 TRO Hr \u2019 g Tr. 9:17-18 (J.A 182) (district court observing that the terminations have \u201ca ready, fire, aim\u201d feel). Plaintiffs seek relief based on a quintessential claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action. The APA, andUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 84 of 9255not the contractual terms of the grants EPA awarded them, is the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.As for the second prong of the Megapulse analysis\u2014the \u201ctype of relief sought\u201d\u2014we have described the \u201ccrux of this inquiry\u201d as \u201cboil[ing] down to whether the plaintiff effectively seeks to attain . . . monetary relief from the federal government. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. As explained above, Plaintiffs do not seek money from the Treasury; they seek only to get the government \u2019 s hands off their money. To the extent the injunction preventing the government from interfering with or seizing their funds \u201crequire[s] the same governmental restraint that specific []performance might require in a contract setting,\u201d that is an \u201cinsufficient basis to deny a district court the jurisdiction otherwise available and the remedial powers otherwise appropriate. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971.Both prongs of the Megapulse analysis thus point to the same conclusion: Plaintiffs \u2019 claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action is not a \u201cdisguised\u201d contract action that must be heard by the Court of Claims. That conclusion comports with our longstanding recognition that the Tucker Act was a response to \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes. \u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. The \u201cunique expertise of the Court of Claims\u201d lies in its \u201cknowledge of the government contracting process,\u201d id.; it is a \u201cspecialized forum\u201d for awarding \u201cdamages for the Government \u2019 s past acts,\u201d Bowen, 487 U.S at 905 n.42, 908 (internal quotation marks omitted).It is far outside the specialized expertise of the Court of Claims to resolve these Plaintiffs \u2019 request for injunctive relief halting EPA \u2019 s naked pursuit of its preferred policy outcome in disregard for the evidence before it and its statutory mandate. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 85 of 9256Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA violated the APA \u2019 s ban on arbitrary and capricious agency action\u2014a claim for which they seek injunctive relief, not payment from the Treasury\u2014is well within the district court \u2019 s remit.That Plaintiffs would have no right to the money to begin with but for the grant awards, which are government contracts, does not alter that conclusion. We have squarely held that the fact that a plaintiff \u201cwould have no claims to assert\u201d absent a government contract does not mean that the plaintiff asserts a \u201ccontract right. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (explaining that imposing such a \u201c\u2018but-for \u2019 test for identifying the source of the right . . . contravenes Megapulse \u2019 s express rejection of the argument that the mere existence of such contract-related issues converts the action to one based on the contract\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 610 (D.C Cir. 1992) (\u201c[L]itigants may bring statutory and constitutional claims in federal district court even when the claims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the government. \u201d), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 620.At bottom, the government suggests that Plaintiffs \u2019 real complaint is that EPA terminated their grant awards\u2014not that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so\u2014making its claim \u201cin essence\u201d a contract claim. It is obviously true that Plaintiffs are injured by the terminations. But it does not follow that Plaintiffs therefore assert contractual claims. When EPA began its campaign to undo the GGRF, it had already performed on the contracts by disbursing the funds, which by then belonged to Plaintiffs. The fact that those funds may only be used in accordance with grant terms does not mean Plaintiffs \u2019 only legal right to protect them arises from contract. As explained above, Plaintiffs \u2019 theory of relief is that EPAUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 86 of 9257carried out the funding freeze and purported terminations to replace Congress \u2019 s policy choice with its own preferred approach, without regard for whether its actions were supported by evidence or reason. That is a classic claim of arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA. That is what makes the APA, and not their grant awards, the \u201csource of the rights upon which the plaintiff[s] base[] [their] claims. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.Because Plaintiffs bring legitimate APA and constitutional claims over which the district court has jurisdiction, I would not reach their ultra vires theory. But to the extent the majority concludes that Plaintiffs \u2019 ultra vires claim fails because Plaintiffs \u201cessentially\u201d allege only a breach of contract, the majority errs. Maj. Op. 21-22. For all the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual.Citing Ingersoll-Rand, the majority posits that Plaintiffs \u2019 allegations of pretextual agency action are contract claims because \u201cthat challenge turns, in substance, on principles of federal contract law\u201d\u2014that is, Plaintiffs \u2019 pretext argument could be rephrased as a claim that EPA \u201cdishonor[ed], with impunity, its contractual obligations. \u201d Maj. Op. 17. But Plaintiffs \u2019 APA claim is not \u201cessentially\u201d contractual just because EPA \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious action included grant terminations. The majority appears to read Ingersoll-Rand as establishing a rule that any claim that could be reconceptualized as a contractual violation that overlaps even in part with the claim Plaintiffs actually bring is necessarily a disguised contract claim. See Maj. Op. 16. Ingersoll-Rand announces no such rule, and any effort to interpret it to do squarely conflicts with our binding precedent.In Ingersoll-Rand, the government terminated its contract with the plaintiff \u201cfor convenience,\u201d as allowed under the terms USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 87 of 9258of the contract. Id. at 75. The plaintiff sued, alleging that the termination violated several regulations constraining the government \u2019 s ability to cancel and administer federal acquisition contracts, and that those regulatory violations meant that the termination was arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 77. We held that the \u201cessential rights at stake\u201d were contractual because the regulations themselves\u2014the violation of which was allegedly arbitrary and capricious\u2014concerned the conditions under which the government could terminate the contract. Id. at 77-78. In effect, the plaintiff had relied on regulations circumscribing the government \u2019 s behavior during the solicitation and performance of contracts to challenge the validity of the contract \u2019 s termination-for-convenience provision. The plaintiff \u2019 s claim thus \u201ccall[ed] for knowledge of the government contracting process\u201d and fell \u201cwithin the unique expertise of the Court of Claims. \u201d Id. at 78. In that context, in which the plaintiff \u2019 s claim centered on the intricacies of the government \u2019 s contracting process and the interaction between contracting regulations and the terms of the plaintiff \u2019 s contract, it made sense to hold that the plaintiff \u2019 s ability to \u201cchallenge the termination based solely on contract principles\u201d supported our determination that its claim \u201csound[ed] genuinely in contract. \u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).Ingersoll-Rand thus establishes that claims that invoke regulations governing federal contracting to challenge government action taken pursuant to a contract are \u201cin essence\u201d contractual and belong in the Court of Claims, where that court \u2019 s expertise in government contracting is particularly relevant. And it supports the majority \u2019 s conclusion that claims based on violations of regulations governing termination procedures are \u201cin essence\u201d contract claims, which is likely correct. See Maj. Op. 11-13. But that does not describe Plaintiffs \u2019 arbitrary and capricious claim. Ingersoll-RandUSCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 88 of 9259decidedly does not stand for a general rule that any claim that could have been framed as a breach of \u201cprinciples of federal contract law\u201d must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims\u201d Maj. Op. 17\u2014a rule that could not be squared with our other relevant decisions.That is illustrated most clearly by Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521 (D.C Cir. 1986), a decision authored by then-Judge Scalia and decided the year after Ingersoll-Rand. The plaintiff in Sharp challenged a Department of Defense policy removing him from the Ready Reserve where he served pursuant to a contract\u2014the Ready Reserve Service Agreement. 798 F.2d at 1521-23. The plaintiff alleged that the policy breached his contract and violated a statute governing the Ready Reserve, and that the contract gave him a \u201cvested property interest\u201d in serving in the reserves that the government \u201csought to deny without due process. \u201d Id. at 1523. The plaintiff \u2019 s requested relief included a declaration that the policy was \u201ccontrary to statute or in the alternative that it effects a material breach of the Ready Reserve Service Agreement,\u201d as well as a declaration that the government \u2019 s \u201cfailure to honor the terms of that contract deprived [the plaintiff] of due process. \u201d Id. We held that, while the Tucker Act barred the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s breach of contract claim, it did not displace the district court \u2019 s jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claims that the policy was \u201ccontrary to regulations, statutes and the Constitution. \u201d Id.; accord Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610. That is, the plaintiff \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims that he had been unlawfully deprived of his contractual right to serve in the Ready Reserve were not \u201cin essence\u201d contractual even though his right to serve in the first place depended on contract, and he expressly brought one claim as a pure breach of contract. USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 89 of 9260The majority \u2019 s view of Ingersoll-Rand cannot be reconciled with Sharp. Allen Sharp \u2019 s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims not only could be based on contract principles, but in fact were also framed that way. If the majority \u2019 s rule were right, the district court could not have exercised jurisdiction over his due process claim. The same analysis is confirmed in Megapulse itself. There, the plaintiff alleged that the government \u2019 s plan to distribute his data violated the Trade Secrets Act and deprived him of his property without due process. 672 F.2d at 962-63. That claim, too, could have been based solely on contract principles, as the government had made a contractual promise not to disseminate the plaintiff \u2019 s \u201climited rights\u201d data. Id. at 962. But that counterfactual did not preclude us from holding\u2014nor even factor into our conclusion\u2014that the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff \u2019 s claim. See id. at 966-71.Indeed, in Megapulse, we expressly rejected the idea that the Tucker Act means that \u201can agency action may not be enjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply because that same action might also amount to a breach of contract. \u201d Id. at 971. Rather, district courts have jurisdiction over and can enjoin agency action that violates the APA, even if that action also \u201camounts to\u201d a breach of contract. Id. That is the situation here: Plaintiffs claim that EPA \u2019 s termination was arbitrary and capricious because it relied on pretextual and unsupported justifications, not because it violated the grant award \u2019 s termination provision. The fact that the government \u2019 s arbitrary and capricious decision making could be reframed as a claim that \u201cEPA acted with \u2018impunity \u2019 when terminating the grants\u201d does not transform the claim into a contract action.In relegating to the Court of Claims any statutory, regulatory, or constitutional claim merely because it arguably could to some extent be reframed as a contract action, the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 90 of 9261majority \u2019 s rule precludes district court jurisdiction and injunctive relief for a wide swath of claims that\u2014like Plaintiffs \u2019 claim that EPA \u2019 s actions to freeze their accounts and terminate their grants were arbitrary and capricious\u2014are simply not contract claims. Such a rule effects an unprecedented expansion of the Tucker Act that is divorced from the \u201ccongressional intent to provide a single, uniquely qualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78, and it strips district courts of jurisdiction over all manner of claims over which they have the relevant expertise. It also threatens to \u201cpreclude any review at all of constitutional claims seeking equitable relief, where the constitutional claims stem from contracts,\u201d thereby raising \u201cserious constitutional question[s]. \u201d Transohio, 967 F.2d at 611 (internal quotation marks omitted). And it flies in the face of our cases \u2019 longstanding refrain that \u201cthe mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have. \u201d Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968). Such a rule is unsupported by our precedent, prevents the court from making \u201crational distinctions between actions sounding genuinely in contract and those based on truly independent legal grounds,\u201d and runs directly counter to our acknowledgement that, \u201c[a]lthough it is important on the one hand to preserve the Tucker Act \u2019 s limited and conditioned waiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not do so in terms so broad as to deny a [district] court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual relationship with the government. \u201d Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968-70.As applied in this case, the majority \u2019 s conclusion that Plaintiffs \u2019 claims are merely contract claims ignores what the USCA Case #25-5122 Document #2132901 Filed: 09/02/2025 Page 91 of 9262agency did and describes a claim that Plaintiffs did not bring. This case is not an attempt to reframe EPA \u2019 s termination or violation of some grant awards as unlawful agency action. Indeed, throughout this litigation, there has hardly been any dispute that the government did breach the terms of the grant awards. That is not what this case is about. Plaintiffs challenge EPA \u2019 s asserted power to take baseless and unjustifiable actions to pursue its desired ends\u2014here, the termination of the grant awards\u2014regardless of the means it must employ to get there. It is beyond dispute that questions of such significance to the way our government operates are not relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.CONCLUSIONEmbracing a misguided and breathtakingly expansive conception of the Tucker Act, the majority allows the government to seize Plaintiffs \u2019 money based on spurious and pretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation of major congressional legislation designed to improve the infrastructure, health, and economic security of communities throughout the country. The injunction the district court put in place is eminently supported by Plaintiffs \u2019 likelihood of success on both their APA and constitutional claims, the irreparable harm that will befall them, and the unlawful nullification of Congress \u2019 s duly enacted policy\u2014all of which inure to the detriment of the American people. I respectfully dissent.

And thank you for joining me for my 2026 Budget Address. I want to begin with a simple truth: a great city doesn't happen by accident; it's built to last. Built to weather tough seasons. Built to serve not just this year, but the next generation. Built to keep its promises to the people who call it home. That's what this budget is about: building a city to last. </p><p>As some of you know, this theme is personal to me right now. Just a few weeks ago, my wife Sarah and I welcomed our second daughter into the world: Estelle Bloom Frey. It's been beautiful. It's been humbling. And, like any new parent will tell you, it's been a little messy. But more than anything, it's been clarifying. Holding Estelle reminds me that the work we do here is not just about the next fiscal year. It's about the Minneapolis we're building for her, for my older daughter Frida, and for every family in our city.</p><p>A city where their streets are safe. Where their neighbors have homes. Where small businesses succeed and culture blossoms. And where city government isn't a punchline--it's a promise kept. This year's budget reflects that commitment. It's honest, disciplined, and focused on the core services that make Minneapolis strong so that decades from now, our city is still standing tall, still working for its people, still built to last. It is the most cliche, overused political, rhetorical flourish to say that budgets are more than numbers, they are expressions of our values. But some things are cliche because they are true. Budgets show what we prioritize and what kind of city we choose to be. And sometimes, that means not chasing every new idea but investing in the things that already work.</p><p>Doing the work</p><p>This budget didn't happen in a vacuum. Over the last several months, our City departments and budget team rolled up their sleeves. They went through their budgets line by line. They evaluated every program, every vacancy, every dollar spent. And they used data to come forward with real solutions to close our gap without breaking the services residents rely on. That's the kind of government residents expect, and I couldn't be prouder of their work.</p><p>Contrast that with Washington: agencies dismantled, departments hollowed out, services cut off midstream, and people left wondering if their government works at all. Here in Minneapolis, we do it differently: we plan ahead, we govern responsibly, and we bring our staff along. All of them. </p><p>Disciplined budget</p><p>Despite this hard work, this was not an easy budget year. But it's also not a crisis budget. This is a disciplined budget.</p><p>We knew this year would require focus and tough calls because good governance sometimes means refocusing and doubling down on what works. Our first and most important task was reducing the projected levy increase. In a post-pandemic world, the value of large office buildings is going down in every major city, and Minneapolis is no exception. Unfortunately, that has a pronounced impact on our tax base and budget. With no action, this year's property tax levy increase was projected to reach 13%. That would have been unacceptable and unaffordable to working families. The impact on renters and homeowners alike would have been unsustainable. Minneapolis has been a national leader on affordable housing, but a 13% levy increase would have set us back dramatically.</p><p>Today, I am proud to announce our City staff have identified savings and cuts that reduce the projected levy increase by 40%, bringing it down from 13% to 7.8%. Our approach to identifying these savings was straightforward: protect the core services our residents rely on every day; invest in proven programs instead of launching new ones that are untested or unsustainable; keep City staff--the people who make this city work--on the job; and do everything possible to keep the levy down, recognizing that this money belongs to the people of Minneapolis and we need to manage it wisely. </p><p>And we achieved all of this without layoffs. Because our people--our plow drivers, 911 dispatchers, housing inspectors, and public safety officers--are the backbone of city government. In a proud union city like ours, protecting those jobs protects the services residents count on.</p><p>We also worked smarter. In past years, departments submitted long lists of proposals for new programs. Last year, we had 145 new spending proposals. This year, we said don't give us any. Instead, we told departments: evaluate what isn't working or has shifted to other jurisdictions; identify programs that have delivered -- and distinguish them from those that have not; take a closer look at vacant positions and cut them if they aren't absolutely needed; and recommend reductions that don't impact core city services.</p><p>Here's what that looked like. Reducing Open Streets from four events to three, keeping the program alive but scaling responsibly. Sunsetting vacant positions that departments agreed weren't critical to operations. Shifting funding from untested new initiatives to ones we know work: like the Stable Homes Stable Schools program that's already keeping thousands of students housed. Scaling back select pilots that weren't yet operational. And ending double overtime for MPD - saving taxpayer dollars while still meeting our public safety obligations.</p><p>We also generated new revenue responsibly, with tools that are standard and resident-friendly. Adding credit card processing fees for utility payments, which many cities, the state, and the county already do. And expanding convenient payment options like Venmo, making it easier for residents to pay on time and avoid incurring a fee.</p><p>And let's be real: part of responsible budgeting this year was planning for the unknown. Washington, D.C. is in chaos. Federal cuts have become a regular threat. And with Donald Trump in office, the uncertainty isn't just about politics, it's about whether cities like ours can rely on federal partnership at all. That's why we budgeted intelligently. We saved where we could. Because when you don't know what's coming down the road, the smartest move is to make sure you're ready.</p><p>The result? $23 million in savings, a levy increase held to 7.8%, and a budget that reflects both discipline and vision, while making sure we're still able to provide necessary services to our residents.</p><p>Every decision came back to one question: Will this make Minneapolis stronger for the long term? Will this make Minneapolis a city built to last?</p><p>Building for the future</p><p>One of the reasons Minneapolis can make strategic, long-term investments--even in a tight budget year--is because we've earned and maintained a AAA bond rating from the three major rating agencies. I know that sounds like accounting jargon. But here's why it matters. A \"AAA rating\" is the highest a city can receive. It signifies strong, responsible financial management. And it saves taxpayers millions, because we can borrow for major projects at lower interest rates. That strong financial footing allows us to move forward on capital projects that make a visible, daily difference in the lives of residents. A few examples--</p><p>- Rebuilding the Nicollet Avenue Bridge over Minnehaha Creek. This $63 million project, mostly funded by state and federal dollars, will replace a failing bridge and keep a critical connection open for our neighborhoods.</p><p>- Reimagining the former Kmart site on Nicollet. We're reopening Nicollet Avenue and transforming the site into a vibrant hub with affordable housing, local businesses, and space for the community to gather.</p><p>- Minneapolis Democracy Center. At the former 3rd Precinct site, we're creating a new home for Election &amp; Voter Services alongside a community partner, turning a place of division into a place for civic engagement.</p><p>- Upper Harbor Terminal. Local artists are helping reimagine our riverfront, creating permanent public art that tells the stories of the Northside community.</p><p>These investments are the backbone of a city built to last--stronger streets, safer bridges, better transit, and corridors that support local commerce. And alongside these community-focused investments, our capital plan also fulfills court-enforceable commitments under the state settlement agreement and federal consent decree to modernize public safety, including:</p><p>- A Public Safety Training and Wellness Center to provide modern training facilities for police and firefighters.</p><p>- And 4th Precinct modernization and 5th Precinct roof replacement, along with an Evidence Warehouse, Forensic Garage, and K9 Facility upgrades--critical improvements that meet our legal obligations and strengthen safety.</p><p>All of these projects are possible because we've managed our finances carefully and responsibly.</p><p>Good governance today means a stronger, safer, more resilient city tomorrow.</p><p>Investing in the core of our city</p><p>Even as we tightened our focus, this is not an austerity budget. This is a recalibration--an investment in the fundamentals that make Minneapolis strong: housing; safety; climate; economic inclusion; and the good governance that ties it all together.</p><p>Affordable housing </p><p>At the foundation of a successful city is a safe, stable home.</p><p>We know that when families have a roof over their heads, everything else gets stronger: kids do better in school, parents can focus on work, and neighborhoods become safer and more connected. That's why this budget doubles down on the strategies we know are working.</p><p>Stable Homes Stable Schools continues to be a cornerstone of our housing strategy. Thousands of Minneapolis kids have stayed in their schools because their families were able to stay in their homes. We are keeping this program strong because it's not just housing policy that's proven to be successful--it's education and public safety policy too.</p><p>We're making ongoing investments in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which remains our most effective tool to keep housing in reach for all residents and creating more options so residents can live in the neighborhood of their choice. Year after year, this fund has delivered hundreds of units for the residents who need them most.</p><p>And we're continuing support for the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, because public housing is one of the most important sources of stability for thousands of residents. Every dollar we invest preserves long-term, deeply affordable homes for generations.</p><p>At the same time, we're growing and preserving housing, we're also confronting homelessness and encampments with urgency and compassion. Over the last several years, we've implemented a coordinated, multi-departmental, multi-jurisdictional response--connecting unsheltered residents to housing and services, and when necessary, closing encampments that pose health and safety risks. And we've seen significant improvements. With $1 million in funding - we're continuing that progress, investing in additional shelter because our neighbors deserve a place to sleep at night and a roof over their heads. Shelter is a critical link to permanent housing, and until recently--was covered by significant funding from the State. This investment recognizes that the work of getting unhoused people off the streets MUST continue, but we also must work together with our partners at the county and state to ensure those dollars are restored.</p><p>Our approach hasn't changed: lead with housing and services; prioritize safety for residents and neighbors; and coordinate every step with our partners. This work is hard. It's complex. But it is necessary, and our City team has shown that when we align our resources and stay persistent, we can get more people in homes.</p><p>In short, this budget says clearly: housing is the foundation. When we keep families stable, we keep our neighborhoods and our city strong.</p><p>Community safety</p><p>A strong city also means a safe city. And safety has the be the top priority for any mayor of any city. This budget keeps our city moving toward a 21st-century public safety system--one that is effective, accountable, and built to last. And we're doing it by investing in the full spectrum of safety, from first response to violence prevention.</p><p>First, we're continuing the work of police recruitment. The Minneapolis Police Department is the most diverse it has been in our city's history. Applicants and recruits are coming on board in numbers we have not seen in years - and we now have more than 600 officers.</p><p>We are fully funding the work required under our state settlement agreement and federal consent decree, and as planned in our biennial budget, we are adding two new compliance positions to the Implementation Unit. This ensures we don't just meet our obligations on paper--we follow through with the oversight, training, and accountability that build public confidence.</p><p>And public safety in Minneapolis isn't just about police. It's about a comprehensive approach. Our Behavioral Crisis Response program continues, connecting residents in crisis to the help they need. Our violence prevention efforts continue to focus on community-led, data-driven strategies that break cycles of violence before they begin. And we're maintaining our full sworn complement of firefighters, while also adding 15 firefighters to the general fund in 2026 to keep pace with service demands and keep residents safe.</p><p>Our emergency preparedness work also remains strong. Already this year, our Emergency Management team has put the training into action, preparing the City for multiple storms and making sure we're ready for whatever comes our way.</p><p>This is what a modern, resilient safety system looks like: a department meeting its legal and moral obligations, supported by civilian professionals, and prevention strategies--all working together to keep Minneapolis safe and built to last.</p><p>Climate action and public health</p><p>When we talk about building a city that lasts, it's not just about streets and bridges--it's also about the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our families and neighbors. This budget makes real, tangible investments to ensure Minneapolis is both climate-resilient and healthy for the next generation.</p><p>On the climate front, we've done more to combat climate change in the last year than the previous 10 years combined. We are continuing to lead with our Climate Legacy Initiative (CLI), which through more than $8.4 million, is delivering cleaner energy, greener infrastructure, and a roadmap to meet our ambitious emissions goals. The CLI is retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, expanding renewable power across city facilities, and investing in neighborhoods most vulnerable to climate impacts. </p><p>Our Zero Waste Plan is moving us closer to a future where far less ends up in the landfill, and where every household has the tools to reduce, reuse, and recycle.</p><p>And through the Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction Project - we're providing $1.5 million in up-front capital to retrofit City buildings and equipment, cutting energy use, lowering costs, and shrinking our carbon footprint.</p><p>This is how you prepare for the impacts of climate change while keeping the city functional and beautiful.</p><p>On the public health front, we are confronting the opioid crisis with compassion and data-driven strategies. Through a combination of opioid settlement funds and federal grants, we are making key investments. Let me explain the vision we're working toward.</p><p>When someone is heavily addicted to opioids, help is often not accepted whether they're intoxicated or going through withdrawal. But there is a middle zone, where people are more open to accepting care. By investing in Brixadi, we can expand that middle zone, easing withdrawal symptoms so more people are ready for treatment and long-term recovery. And then, when we do bring someone in for treatment, we need health professionals ready to provide care immediately. Not in a week and a half, not when the next appointment becomes available, but right now.</p><p>That's where our Mobile Medical Unit comes in. It will drive literally to where people are at. It will offer service and care and ultimately, we can provide people access to Brixadi, making the likelihood of treatment and a possibility for recovery directly within reach. </p><p>But we aren't stopping there. </p><p>Our Narcan vending machines, will make sure life-saving overdose reversal medication is not only close at hand, but free. And through our hospital-based intervention program, First Step, we're connecting overdose survivors to treatment and support the moment they are ready to accept help.</p><p>We're doing the work to save lives, so that healthy people can live them. </p><p>Economic inclusion and small business growth</p><p>A strong Minneapolis is an inclusive Minneapolis--one where every resident, no matter where they come from or what barriers they face, can participate in our economy and see themselves in our city's success. That's why this budget continues to support the Ownership and Opportunity Fund, our tool to help Black, Brown, and immigrant local entrepreneurs not just open businesses, but build wealth and lasting roots in our city. Because inclusion isn't just about participation, it's about ownership.</p><p>We're also keeping up the investments that turn economic inclusion into real action. We're maintaining our support for Black businesses and immigrant entrepreneurs and families, because immigration is a cornerstone of our city's economic and cultural vibrancy. While the Trump administration vilifies immigrants, Minneapolis welcomes them. We are a proud Welcoming City, and that's not just a title, it's a commitment. Our policies, programs, and budget reflect that commitment by supporting immigrant entrepreneurs, expanding access to City programs regardless of status, and funding trusted services that help people build a life here. Because in Minneapolis, we don't scapegoat immigrants; we stand with them, invest in them, and grow stronger because of them.</p><p>Our budget also makes strategic investments to keep downtown clean, safe, and successful year-round.</p><p>We are moving forward with the reimagining of Nicollet Mall to a 24-hour downtown corridor that supports business, arts, and culture - including new events like the Big Honkin' Truck Parade and Dinner Du Nord. Expect more of them! </p><p>Vibrant Downtown Storefronts will continue to activate empty retail spaces, attract new businesses, and keep our street-level experience lively for residents and visitors.</p><p>And through the Developer Technical Assistance Program with $350,000 in funding, we are maintaining and improving the public spaces and amenities that keep downtown functional and inviting.</p><p>And then there's our parks system, the shining gem of our city. It's the very reason I chose to live here, and I know I'm not unique. Consistently rated as the best park system in the entire country, the Minneapolis Park and Rec Board has done extraordinary work expanding recreational opportunities for kids and families, maintaining and improving world-class facilities, like North Commons, and creating beautiful park spaces within a 10-minute walk of anyone that calls Minneapolis home. That's why they awarded us the gold medal of excellence, and why we're investing an additional $3.2 million in 2026 to keep this great work going. </p><p>These investments are not just about physical spaces--they are about confidence in our city's future. </p><p>A city built to last</p><p>Minneapolis is on solid footing. This budget keeps it that way by investing wisely in a city built to last. Homes that are stable; streets and bridges that are safe; a public safety system that is trusted and effective; a downtown that succeeds; a city government that works. That's the city I want our daughters--and every child--to inherit.</p><p>This budget says that in Minneapolis, we believe in doing the work. In making smart choices today to protect the city we'll hand off tomorrow. In keeping our promises to the people who rely on us. When our kids are adults, they won't remember this year's levy number. They won't know the line-item adjustments or the capital plan schedule. But they will live in the city we're building together. A city where their streets are safe. Where everyone has a place to call home. Where small businesses succeed in corridors that are alive with arts and culture. Where city government is not a punchline, but a promise kept.</p><p>We have done the hard work to make sure Minneapolis can weather the unknown, grow stronger, and keep moving forward. So, let's take pride in the discipline we've shown, the values we've upheld, and the future we're securing--together.</p><p>This is the city I love. This is the city I am proud to lead. And this is the budget I am proud to present.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>ADJOURNMENT</p><p>The meeting was adjourned at 10:28 a.m.Casey Joe Carl,</p><p>City Clerk4086697</p><p>publicnotices.finance-commerce.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BTMLPN-4094729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BTMLPN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GM7-WGY3-RS3C-H0C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474704</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 BridgeTower MediaAll Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BridgeTower Legal &amp;

The contributors to this symposium reflect on the research themes and the book\u2019s legacy from their disciplinary perspectives. The first response explores the tensions between the elevation of cities as sites for climate action and the persistent lack of state action, arguing for meaningful public participation and a labour of making visible how city-based practices respond to climate change. The second response examines how the book has enabled generations of scholars to appreciate the complex constitution of city actors and how they interact/enact global climate governance yet remain frustratingly marginal in the discipline of International Relations. The third response explores how the book positioned the urban as a problem space, a manageable scale of intervention, and a political space with the capacity to enact innovation, triggering new questions about the potential and limits of the expanding responsibilities of cities. The fourth response argues that as cities become active in adaptation, they need to engage in an anticolonial politics of love and hospitality that sheds \u2018security\u2019 and makes the self vulnerable to \u2018others\u2019 for an effective response to climate change. The symposium concludes with a recap by Betsill and Bulkeley which underscores the variety of interdisciplinary debates that the book has generated, and its influence on current thinking on debates on climate change governance.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><h>Introduction: the legacy of cities and climate change (3C)</h><h>Vanesa Cast\u00e1n Broto and Simon Marvin</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DOI: 10.1177/23996544241296741a</p><h>The University of Sheffield, UK</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2023, it was 20 years since the publication of Michelle Betsill and Harriet Bulkeley\u2019s \u2018Cities and Climate Change\u2019 (3C), a book that marked a change of thought on the role of cities in governing climate change.1 This book spearheaded a wave of academic debates and policy thought that put cities at the forefront of climate policy. The book is recognized for having made three significant contributions to environmental governance and urban geographies. First, it situated the work of cities in space, demonstrating the variety of governance arrangements that enable climate action in different urban contexts. The book constituted a critical starting point for debates on multi-level governance and policy fragmentation that are still vibrant today. Second, the book opened a range of institutional-focused approaches to understanding the role of cities in environmental governance. </p><p>The book stimulated debates about the results and implications of climate action at the urban level and the extent to which these constitute transformative change. Third, the book extended the conventional understanding of the role of cities in the global arena. The book raised novel questions about how global cities influence climate actions in cities and how cities and urban networks have become global actors in international climate politics. In doing so, \u2018Cities and Climate Change\u2019 fostered a new generation of thinking on the role of cities in climate policy. In this symposium, we would like to constructively reflect on how the legacy of this book is still relevant in geographical studies on global environmental governance, local environmental policy, and critical urban geography.</p><p>The critical point of departure in 3C concerns a conception of the state as a unitary actor \u2013 the conception of a fixed territorial entity operating at the national scale whose interests are uniform. This assumption informed a cascading model of subnational governance whereby the nation-state interests are unproblematically translated down the governmental hierarchy and applied at the local scale. This perspective was already under critical reassessment at the time of 3c\u2019s publication \u2013 particularly with the growing censure of the hollowing of the state, the critiques of scale and territory, and the re-assessment of policy implementation and the emergence of governance \u2013 that together essentially regarded the concept of the unitary state as a \u2018fiction.\u2019 Yet that model remained prevalent in policy and practice and was recycled and reproduced in environmental governance and action. Concepts of unitary state action were being re-mobilized in the new ideas about climate action that appeared to be overlooking the 1990s enthusiasm for local government action that had come to dominate sustainability agendas, most notably Agenda 21. This shift generated critical new questions: Why is the local government emerging as a key actor? Where is the local government in climate change governance? And what about all the other actors who also bear responsibility for climate mitigation? What about private actors and civil society? This became consolidated in a question that would come to inform academic debates in the coming decades \u2013 where is climate governance located?</p><p>The book responded to these questions with critical concern about the enthusiasm for local government as a place of environmental governance because of the displacement of responsibility to local governments already stretched in their capacity and resources. 3C responded by carefully exploring empirical cases as a means to find a potential answer to the problem of, on the one hand, recognizing the sub-national scale of action while, on the other, also allocating responsibilities somewhat \u2013 a fundamental dilemma for which the book finds and answers in the notion of multi-level governance. The concept of multi-level governance, the book finds, plays a crucial role in climate governance. The book had influence by bringing together detailed empirical evidence of how climate governance was carried out. The Cities for Climate Protection Programme, which inspired and oriented the empirical analysis of the book, was one of the first transnational municipal networks to take the international stage. It was established by the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) created by the International Union of Local Authorities (today\u2019s UCLG) and the UN Environmental Programme in the wake of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992. The Cities for Climate Protection Programme constituted an early demonstration of the value of network approaches in climate action. Focused on emissions mitigation, the focus of the programme was on 650 cities in the US, UK and Australia. Perhaps one of its main achievements was constructing climate change as an issue to be addressed at the local level. The Programme became a model for future policy development work, reflected in the recent highlight of networks as effective means for mitigation at the global level. The book was the first analysis of this pioneering programme demonstrating the role that cities already had in international climate governance at the time. This became much more visible in the intervening decade, notably at the COP15 in Copenhagen, where the triumphal portrayal of local governments\u2019 leadership underscored the failure of nation-state-based international negotiations.</p><p>The contributors to this symposium reflect on the research themes and the book\u2019s legacy from their disciplinary perspectives focusing on the following themes. Anna Davies explores the tensions between the elevation of cities as sites for climate action and the persistent lack of state action, arguing that the lack of public participation in city-based initiatives has been a critical factor. David Gordon examines how C3 has enabled generations of scholars to appreciate the complexity of city actors and how they enact global climate governance yet remain frustratingly marginal in the discipline of International Relations. Pauline McGuirk and Robyn Dowling, explore how C3 positioned the urban as a problem space, a manageable scale of intervention, and a political space with the capacity to enact innovation is triggering new questions around the potential and limits of the expanding responsibilities of cities. Ankit Kumar argues that as cities become active in adaptation they need to engage in an anticolonial politics of love and hospitality that sheds \u2018security\u2019 and makes the self-vulnerable to \u2018others\u2019 for an effective response to climate change. In the last contribution, Michele Betsil and Harriet Bulkeley reflect on their own journey since C3 was published. Together these contributions demonstrate the enormous capacity of C3 to generate interdisciplinary debates that changed both academic and policy thought around the locations of climate change governance.</p><h>Staying with the trouble: The persistent challenge of public participation in cities and climate change</h><h>Anna Davies</h><p>DOI: 10.1177/23996544241296741b</p><h>Geography, School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland</h><p>Since the publication of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>, urban environments have become increasingly marked out in academic and public discourse as major sites for innovation, action and socio-environmental transition; frequently characterized as living laboratories where experimental interventions seeking positive social, economic and environmental change can be tested. Whether this is articulated through initiatives with prefixes such as smart-, 15 min-, circular-, edible- or net zero-cities, the challenges of climate change commonly play a central role in justifying action (Watts, 2017). Certainly, the elevated profiles of cities through these initiatives have created new vocabularies and institutions for, and sites of, climate politics (Davies et al., 2021). However, while cities remain popular spaces for grassroots climate protests, radical city state action to back up the urgent rhetoric has been slow to emerge. Reasons for this are manifold (see Rivas et al., 2022), but I argue that a lack of embedded and enduring public participation remains a key factor. In this brief intervention I set out how <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> still provides inspiration and motivation for staying with the trouble (Haraway, 2016) of establishing and embedding infrastructures for meaningful public participation in city-based climate action, specifically focusing on an intervention \u2013 Climate Smart \u2013 that sought to expand climate change adaptation capacity and capabilities of young people by increasing their visibility of climate change adaptation risks and confronting the complexities of responding to these risks. Haraway\u2019s concept of \u2018staying with the trouble\u2019 (2016) is apposite here as it calls for thinking deeply about how we live in, respond to and address complex challenges involving interconnections between people and place; to engage intimately with the \u2018trouble\u2019 we are in and not expect simple or easy solutions to building capabilities for climate change adaptation.</p><p>Considering public participation in sub-national government decision making has a long and well-established history in academia and planning practice prior to the emergence of climate change as a matter of policy concern in urban environments (Arnstein, 1969). The centrality of public engagement and action in progressing society towards more sustainable development at the local scale was also brought into sharp relief during the 1990s following the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the adoption of Agenda 21 which recognized the essential role of publics in developing localized action plans on both normative and pragmatic grounds (Elelman and Feldman, 2018; Wild and Marshall, 1999). When <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> was published researchers were also beginning to call for more public participation in the shaping of policy responses to climate change, particularly in relation to climate change adaptation (see Few et al., 2007), although progress has been limited, particularly in relation to public participation in climate change adaptation planning (H\u00fcgel and Davies, 2020). Understanding why the challenge of engaging publics in shaping policy and practice in relation to climate change persists is crucial.</p><p>Examining the context in which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> emerged finds some familiar features: International conflicts with the Iraq war were ongoing in 2003 and we are still experiencing the wider ramifications of the conflict being played out in Ukraine; stark impacts from climate change were already being felt in 2003 \u2013 the hottest summer in Europe for 500 years \u2013 while the summer of 2023 was the hottest globally by some margin; and enduring vulnerabilities exacerbated by global pandemics plagued both periods (SARS in 2003; COVID-19 2020\u201321). At the same time urbanization trends continue, rising from 46 to 57% globally over the past 20 years and technological developments (particularly digital technologies) have continued apace. The spread of mobile digital data, wi-fi connectivity, and smart phone ownership have all dramatically reshaped how we access information and interact with others. Nonetheless, while traditional and social media coverage of climate change has increased significantly in the last two decades, the capacity to act on the consequences of climate change remains highly uneven (Lee et al., 2015). In this context of enduring issues <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> still brings visibility to the complex challenges of expanding public participation in climate action.</p><h>Visibility and complexity</h><p>Underpinning the foundational work of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> are rich case studies from UK, USA and Australia and the transnational city climate change networks of which they were part. At the time of publication, the very act of adopting the city as a unit of analysis was novel. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> used city case studies to tease out the multiscalar and multiactor relations in these spaces allowing for nuanced analysis of actions and interactions in places; and revealing how city-based practices reach beyond their boundaries into other locations and spheres of action. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> helped to make visible processes and practices around decision making in the city. This work provided the baseline for future studies in more diverse contexts which culminated in the development of global city database examining 100 cities and their climate change actions (Cast\u00e1n Broto and Bulkeley, 2013). This has been influential in studies of city actions for climate change and has also inspired broader activities of making climate change more visible across a range of sectors and actors within urban areas. Activities building on the foundations provided by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> include the mapping of urban food sharing initiatives, nature based solutions and energy communities, which all seek to disrupt conventional understandings of practices within a city (see Almassy et al., 2018; Davies et al., 2020; Jensen et al., 2017). Increasing visibility in this way is productive, although such counter mapping alone does not disrupt enduring patterns of power and inequalities within and between places. Further unpicking of the complex and dynamic relations within city-based assemblages is required.</p><p>Through its forensic analysis <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> revealed the complexity of city governance not as means to reduce that complexity or delineate discrete problems to be solved, rather to identify how that complexity creates socio-ecological tensions and potential ruptures which provide opportunities for doing things differently (Gillard et al., 2016). In particular, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> sought to move beyond technical fixes and narrow managerial governance preoccupations, elevating the inherently social and political processes that are suffused with uneven and unsettled agency. This move to acknowledging the multiple and intertwining spheres and tiers of relations as complex assemblages is seen both within and beyond research examining cities and climate change, from urban dwelling (McFarlane, 2011) and sharing cities (McLaren and Agyeman, 2015) to smart and sustainable cities (Cugurullo, 2021). In parallel, conceptual frameworks focusing on matters of expansion and inclusion in urban environments were emerging which centred urban intersectionality through climate change riskscapes (Davies et al., 2020) and calls for multispecies approaches (Gandy and Jasper, 2020) to ensure just transitions for people and the planet.</p><p>Expansive and inclusive approaches recognize the diversity of experiences and capabilities amongst urban inhabitants as part of calls for a just transition to decarbonized futures. Following McArdle (2021) and Amorim Maia et al. (2022) the goal of such intersectional work is to ensure that cities addressing climate change do not perpetuate existing inequalities and, beyond this, also provide for restorative climate justice. This cannot happen without engaging publics in ways that work for them and which recognize the multifacted and interlocking dimensions of climate change riskscapes that people inhabit. As noted by Davies et al. (2020: 197), \u2018when considering climate change, social justice principles cannot be appended after the fact\u2019. Beyond this, exploring more-than-human rights to the city through a multispecies lens (Shingne, 2022), for example, resonates with calls in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> to challenge power embedded in urban decision making processes that elevates certain groups over others. Certainly, following Houston et al. (2018), greater consideration of who speaks for (and with) the non-human in our cities is urgently needed and the principles of seeking more inclusive, ethical relationships hold true for all cities.</p><h>Capacities, capabilities and response-abilities</h><p>One concrete example of where the tentacles of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> foundational work on public engagement, visibility and complexity provided a clear motivation is the Climate Smart initiative which focuses on building adaptive capacities for inclusive climate adaptation planning (Hugel and Davies, 2024). This collaborative project and the resulting learning platform and serious game focuses on the differential challenges that communities within Dublin face as a result of climate change; their diverse climate riskscapes (Davies and H\u00fcgel, 2021). This initiative began with discussions between researchers and young people in an inner-city area that is particularly vulnerable to coastal and river flooding, and which is also experiencing socio-economic deprivation and gentrification pressures, to better understand their knowledge, issues and concerns in relation to climate change and adaptation planning. These discussions underpin the resources that were subsequently developed for the climate smart platform, including videos and quizzes as well as a serious online game where you adopt the persona of Dublin Mayor and develop and implement your adaptation strategy. Embracing rather than shying away from complexity, game play is shaped by scientific knowledge (current flood predictions for Dublin in 2050 are used and randomized flood events happen in each round of the game), democratic processes (a randomly generated electorate is created for each game, upset enough of the electorate and you are removed from office and the game ends early), resource constraints (players have \u20ac10 mill per year to spend on interventions and 5 years to adapt their city) and diverse advice provided by economic, social and environmental experts (H\u00fcgel and Davies, 2022). Cumulatively, the goal of the Climate Smart platform is to communicate the challenges and uncertainties that pervade interventions in complex adaptive systems such as climate change adaptation whilst also demonstrating that positive action can still be taken. It is just one intervention in an active space of climate innovation with new plans, declarations, targets, and networks emerging and evolving over time and space (Davies et al., 2021). These innovations unfold across schools and streets, appearing in museums and theatres while enacting new mechanisms for participation and engagement that are replete with creativity, and imagination (see Stripple et al., 2021).</p><p>So where\u2019s the trouble? Considerable gaps still remain between ambitions and actions. While urgent action is needed and public participation is seen as a key part of such action, supporting mechanisms such as the Climate Smart platform require time to build and ongoing resources to embed them as part of vital decision making infrastructures. While researchers, through co-design processes, can and do help initiate, design, test and evaluate the efficacy of such mechanisms, ultimately long-term city-level commitment to building and maintaining public participation infrastructures is required to build trust, capabilities and climate action. Certainly there is a danger that without such investment in the short-term city leaders of the future may argue that there is no time to \u2018waste\u2019 on public participation activities in the context of an emergency response to climate change adaptation. This would be catastrophic. Returning to the work of Haraway (2016: 34), we need to cultivate collective ways of knowing and doing by:Learning to stay with the trouble of living and dying together on a damaged earth [that] will prove more conducive to the kind of thinking that would provide the means to building more livable future \u2026 [to accept] more modest possibilities of partial recuperation and getting on together. Call that staying with the trouble.

Climate Just. Carbon neutral. A quick glance across the landscape of contemporary climate governance and one is confronted by the ambition and activity of local governments around the world. Cities making bold claims, setting aggressive targets, and implementing innovative policy actions; going \u2018further &amp; faster\u2019 (GCoM, 2021), being recognized as \u2018climate champions\u20192 and included as official partners in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement.3 Cities have pushed, prodded, and pulled themselves into the global climate conversation over the past 30+ years and offer a potent(ial) counterpoint to the \u2018dangerous incrementalism\u2019 (Allan, 2019) of the inter-state process. Yet questions abound as to whether cities can live up to their ambitious claims. Amidst a flurry of scholarship aiming to address this query, we might also pause, take a breath, and look back before we look forward, drawing insight and inspiration from the now-classic <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> (C3) by Michele Betsill and Harriet Bulkeley. Interdisciplinary, insightful, and innovative, C3 is a foundational text but also a template for the kind of scholarship needed to understand and assess the engagement of cities in global climate governance. I want to use the space provided to offer a few brief comments on how C3 speaks to this crucial moment, with a focus on two themes: the emergent power dynamics shaping how cities \u2018do\u2019 climate governance and the tensions inherent in attempting to fuse urban and global interests through the novel governance spaces constituted by transnational municipal networks (TMNs).</p><h>Cities and Climate Change: A key juncture</h><p>Though the history of city engagement in world politics in general, and climate politics in particular, extends far deeper (Alger, 1990; Ewen and Hebbert, 2007) C3 was published at an auspicious moment. The first decade of concerted city engagement in global climate politics had just concluded and a second wave of activity was about to break across the reefs of international climate inaction. C3 thus captures and holds up for interrogation the engagement of cities in global climate politics at an opportune time: a nascent global movement about to explode in numbers, ambition, and activity.</p><p>C3 cracked open the door for scholars of world politics to take seriously the ways in which cities were operating outside of and beyond the confines of domestic politics. More narrowly it created an opening for scholars, for me personally in very profound ways, to think about \u2018how\u2019 climate change is governed globally in and through cities. C3 challenges the spatial rigidity of mainstream International Relations literature, with cities conceptualized as neither hermetically sealed nor hierarchically contained but rather as situated within complex political configurations that structure how climate change is defined, operationalized, and acted upon in/through urban space. The book shines a light onto the complex multi-dimensional politics that shape \u2018why\u2019 cities come to define and understand climate change in particular ways (or as a particular sort of problem amenable to particular sorts of responses), what kind of role cities see for themselves as climate governors, and how governance is carried out. Cities, as per C3, are part of the global firmament of organizations working to respond to the issue of climate change, and their positionality in that global context has enabled scholars to look at both local and global climate governance from a new point of view.</p><h>Why do cities govern climate change the ways that they do?</h><p>To understand why cities \u2018do\u2019 climate governance in particular ways (or at all for that matter) C3 implores us to consider not only local and domestic factors but also the embeddedness of cities in a global context, and specifically the influence of TMNs. In so doing C3 helped direct attention to TMNs as institutional innovations through which local and global climate governance are interwoven, not merely another actor on the stage seeking to exert influence, but emergent governance <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">spaces</emphasis> populated by a diverse array of actors. The landscape of TMNs has changed and expanded in meaningful ways over the past 20+ years (Acuto and Leffel, 2021) and as a result we can now understand TMNs such as those studied in C3 as part of a broader domain of global urban (climate) governance (Acuto, 2020; Gordon, 2018). Nonetheless, the analytic framework deployed in C3, centred on the political struggles over how climate change is defined, discussed, and dealt with in and by cities, remains incredibly germane. As Betsill and Bulkeley aptly note, climate policy at the city-level is about the making (or not) of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">difficult decisions</emphasis> (p. 193), and cannot be resolved via recourse to better, more rational, or more readily available information. In so doing C3 pushes back on the tragedy of the commons orientation that has tended to dominate scholarship on global climate politics and focuses instead on the contested politics of winners and losers, and the processes of imposition and resistance, that shape the substance, orientation, and impact of climate policy initiatives regardless of the scale of intervention (Aklin and Mildenberger, 2020; Colgan et al., 2021).</p><p>Power and authority are thus central to understanding what happens within these new governance spaces, and here Betsill and Bulkeley\u2019s core concern with how global and local imperatives are being fused together remains a guiding light. While recent scholarship explores the conditions under which network secretariats (Lecavalier and Gordon, 2020), philanthropic entities (Fuentenebro and Acuto, 2022; Papin and Beauregard, 2023) and private sector interests (Davidson and Gleeson 2015; Gordon, 2020; Leal and Paterson 2023) are able to exert influence over the content and orientation of city climate policy, here I want to highlight the prescience of C3 in focusing attention on the power dynamics inherent in still-embryonic mechanisms of governance: methodologies of standardizing, measuring, accounting, and reporting urban GHG emissions.</p><p>C3 ultimately lands on the relative inability of TMNs at the time to shape city engagement or actions beyond that which they were already willing to do (p. 5) the intervening years allow us to re-examine practices such as these in a new light. That early orientation of TMNs towards (ac)countability, most readily observable within ICLEIs Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) 5-milestone framework, has become a widespread and taken-for-granted feature of contemporary city climate governance in the years since. This is most evident in the uptake of public disclosure practices by cities to third party platforms like CDP Cities and the Carbon<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> Climate Registry, and the emergence of a constellation of technical tools \u2013 software applications, training resources \u2013 and consultancies geared towards building the capacity of cities to regularize how they measure, monitor, and account for their climate emissions and activities (Gordon, 2016; Hughes et al. 2020).</p><p>Betsill &amp; Bulkeley cast a critical eye on this phenomenon in its early form and their take \u2013 that directing scarce city resources to the task of measurement and reporting, nudging local actions and interventions towards those most amenable to quantification (p. 183) \u2013 remains a useful corrective to bear in mind. All the moreso in light of the acceleration of this trend across the broader domain of global urban climate governance (where a growth industry has formed emerged around techniques of modelling, measurement, and monitoring) underpinned by a combination of cities\u2019 desire to be perceived as \u2018investable\u2019 (read fiduciarily responsible) partners by global financial actors (Rashidi et al., 2019; Bigger and Millington, 2020) and the potentially homogenizing effects this has on city climate policies (Westman et al., 2023).</p><h>On whose behalf do cities govern?</h><p>C3 draws our attention towards the spatial tensions inherent in global climate governance and demand that we inquire into <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">whose</emphasis> interests are reflected in global urban climate governance (p. 191)? TMNs, as Betsill and Bulkeley observe, are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">closed</emphasis> arenas; governance spaces to which a select few have access and even fewer are able to upload, modularize, and mobilize specific understandings, policies, and priorities related to climate governance. The chasm between a dispersed politics of transnational city communication, coordination, and cooperation and a place-based politics of the urban is rendered in great detail across the chapters of C3 and TMNs to this day operate largely outside the reach of local interests, and city-network connections are forged through narrow, though variably more/less dense, interlinkages (particular city officials or politicians). If city climate governance is, as C3 convincingly suggests, an (at least partially) extra-urban phenomenon then how can we think about the political foundations on which transformative, ambitious city objectives rest?</p><p>This has important implications, of which I want to raise two. First, it demands that we carefully scrutinize the content and orientation of city climate governance. Though the discourse of climate justice and just transition has been incorporated into both city climate plans (Diezmart\u00ednez and Short Gianotti, 2022) and TMN programming, early analysis suggests that such a phenomenon remains more performative gesture than indication of a fundamental restructuring of city efforts (Angelo et al., 2020). The power differential between civil society and local interests on one hand, and the global financial, corporate, and private sector organizations that dominate the landscape of global urban climate governance on the other, must be rebalanced if transformative urban climate governance is to live up to its ambitious claims.</p><p>Second, it suggests the need to think carefully about the political foundations on which ambitious city agendas rest. Scholars have alerted us to the crucial importance of supportive political coalitions to the sustainability of transformative climate agendas (Bernstein and Hoffmann, 2018; Stokes, 2020) and, assertions of the \u2018pragmatism\u2019 and post-political orientation of cities aside cities are no different in this regard. Yet cities also experience a crushing need to secure an enormous amount of financial resources if they are to implement truly transformative agendas at the urban scale and as such face a strong imperative to take actions that satisfy the interests of multinational corporations and global financial actors to gain access to flows of private investment and climate finance (Sareen and Waagsaether, 2023). The latter suggests a dis-embedding of the city from local context; the former reminds us of the need for cities to remain tethered to the particulars of place and the needs of local populations. Together they suggest a complex politics of contestation unavoidable at the urban scale (Paterson et al., 2022). Here a Polanyian approach that explores the comparative efforts to re-embed city climate policy in specific social contexts could provide a useful addendum to the multi-level governance framework deployed in C3 (Thompson et al., 2020).</p><p>As I pored through \u2018Cities and Climate Change\u2019 for the first time in quite a while my mind wandered to the looking glass through which Alice steps in the eponymous novel by Lewis Carrol. Just as Alice steps through the looking glass into a world both similar and different to the one she calls home, \u2018Cities and Climate Change\u2019 opens the reader up to a world of cities engaged in, and with, the world; one by and large unseen by scholars of world politics at the moment of its publication in 2003. Whereas Alice is challenged by the unfamiliar logics she confronts, C3 serves as a cipher, one that has enabled generations of appreciative scholars to better conceptualize cities, the ways they interact in and through new infrastructures of global governance, and the diverse array of global climate governance they individually and collectively enact. The book helped kick off an explosion of scholarship on the global governance of not only climate change but global migration, public health, and human security among others (Aust, 2020; Durmus and Oomen, 2021; Gordon and Ljungkvist, 2022; Ljungkvist, 2021). Its cautious and empirically grounded skepticism underscores the need for continued critical interrogation of the myriad interests working to enable, shape, and constrain city climate governance into the future.</p><h>Rethinking urban governance: the lessons of Cities and Climate Change</h><p>DOI: 10.1177/23996544241296741d</p><h>Pauline McGuirk</h><h>School of Geography and Sustainable Communities, University of Wollongong</h><h>Robyn Dowling</h><h>School of Architecture, Design and Planning, University of Sydney</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s contribution to scholarship goes well beyond shifting how we understand the multilevel governance of climate change and the role of cities therein. The influence of the book\u2019s central ideas have gone far beyond this to spur the wider field of urban governance studies, opening out conceptual pathways for unpacking the workings of urban governance, the configuration of the capacity to govern, the politics of governance, and the politics of centring the urban in the governance of complex societal challenges. Our commentary on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s influence and legacy is focused on three key points.</p><p>First, the book was, of course, foundational in recognizing cities \u2013 and municipalities in particular \u2013 as crucial political actors in climate governance, with independent agency. It unpacked climate governance as a complex multilevel process wherein traditional analytical divisions between the global, national and local scales lose their purchase and the multiscalar dynamics that constitute the relations of governance come to the fore. And this, in turn, revealed how relations of power in governance need to be understood with few assumptions about the operation of hierarchy or about how the authority to govern is established. A more subtle lens is needed. Bulkeley and Betsill deployed that subtlety in clearly demonstrating how city governance actions are not just responses to top-down imperatives or opportunities, that cascade hierarchically down levels of government, but they are constructed by and in \u2018relations of power and influence between subnational and national state and non-state actors, and through multilevel, transnational networks\u2019 (p. 188). This stance opened out the way we understand cities\u2019 capacities as governance actors able to take effect beyond the discrete scale of the urban, and how we might understand the potential of cities in the multiscalar emergence of governance regimes more generally (whether about environment, society, economy, technology).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s multi-scalar conception of cities as political actors also seeded a wider body of work that adopted relational understandings of urban governance that have refined our grasp on how cities\u2019 governance capabilities, and indeed their progressive political possibilities might be expanded or contained (Allen and Cochrane, 2010; Baud et al., 2021; Bartels, 2020; McCann and Ward, 2012; McGuirk and Dowling, 2021; Robinson, 2015). The book revealed city governance actors to be simultaneously embedded in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> actively constitutive of multi-level regimes of governance but also increasingly enmeshed in topological relations of formal and informal networks of policy mobility, learning, capacity building etc. And so it provided a crucial stepping off point for developing more refined understandings of how multiscalar and topological dynamics matter, both for the potential to open up new urban politics and for where they may reach their limits (Davidson and Ward, 2022). Here we can look to a growing body of work on the proliferation of inter-urban networks around, for example, urban public space, housing crises, urban commons, public health, night-time economies, etc (e.g. Acuto and Leffel, 2021; Davidson et al., 2019). Equally, we could look to the flourishing of recent work on new muncipalism (Bianchi, 2023; Blanco et al., 2020; Russell, 2022; Thompson, 2021) that draws from the book\u2019s attention to the potential of municipal governments as multiscalar change agents, with the capacity to insert new progressive political agenda into social, economic and environmental governance regimes \u2013 from housing, to solidarity economies, to low carbon transition and climate justice \u2013 through various tactics that \u2018jump scale\u2019 or build capacity topologically. But the book did not resile from recognizing how these efforts encounter institutional limits and are undercut or derailed by scalar dynamics that narrow their opportunity structure (Pinto et al., 2023).</p><p>Our second point is to highlight the way <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s expanded conceptions of how the capacity to govern is produced as a \u2018dispersed form of rule.\u2019 And in fleshing out what this distributed conception of governance means analytically, the book also opened out recognition of the location of politics in urban governance, again widening our lens on the spectrum of political possibility.</p><p>Through the prism of urban carbon governance, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s provided cogent examples of how the capacity to govern is realized through plural pathways, via diverse programs and projects loosely coordinated around a \u2018will to improve\u2019 (Li 2007), involving a multiplicity of actors and interventions working through multiple sites, elements, devices and mechanisms, objects and subjects. And all of this operating in an expanding set of domains, from transport and energy infrastructure, to the home, and citizen subjectivities. Beyond this, the book\u2019s empirical richness has encouraged attention to the actual political practices of governing as they occur across state and non-state, public and private domains and how these practices are cohered in place through irreducibly contextual means: forged through specific socio-material-political intersections in place (see McGuirk et al., 2016).</p><p>The legacy of the book\u2019s view on the politics of city governance has been equally expansive in effect. Bulkeley and Betsill insisted that climate governance is not a clearcut challenge but a political question of crafting problemisations such that governance issues come to matter in particular ways in particular places, as objects and subjects of governance are constituted in response to particular problematics: that is, they drew our attention to what we might now call material politics. They revealed how particular forms of problematization allowed for the extension of governance authority to intervene into new spaces and in new ways, leaving other trajectories, spaces and interests out of scope. Refusing the notion of policy problems as self-evident and of policy trajectories as common sense, the book\u2019s approach has provided urban governance studies more broadly with resources for critically understanding urban governance as always produced in a field of power and contested meaning (see, e.g., Teo, 2023).</p><p>In a generative vein, the book\u2019s distributed conception of governance also opened out our lens on the location of politics in urban governance. In our own work for example in the Australian context, we adopted Bulkely and Betsill\u2019s wide-spectrum lens on the material politics of urban energy governance (McGuirk et al., 2019) to explore how the particular problematisation of energy efficiency as a climate change issue endowed political capacity on commercial office buildings as key sites of governance intervention, whereby smart building energy management systems became authorized as key devices in energy governance. The book\u2019s wide lens on dispersed governance and its broad political spectrum furnished a means to grasp the broad ecology of interventions, actors and actions, sites, devices and moments through which the capacity to govern and the politics of governance is played out (Bissell, 2018). In our case, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s emphasis on problematisation and its politics allowed us to see the political consequences of shaping governance regimes around building energy performance, consolidating this over more disruptive transformations of the energy production regime or challenging energy intensive social practices. More broadly, the book\u2019s expansive take on how and where politics can be located, offers a generative stance that has much to offer contemporary engagements with emergent, multifaceted governance \u2018problems\u2019 facing cities (and society more widely): from governance of AI and AI urbanism, to housing crises, to public health management.</p><p>This brings us to our final point which is to highlight <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis>\u2019s prescience in identifying the mobilization of cities (and indeed cities\u2019 self-nomination) as key players in governing a wider raft of complex challenges in and through the city. The book pointed to both the climate governance action of cities in the absence (or turgid pace) of national/international action and to how the urban was being drawn upon in multiscalar governance assemblages. Two decades later, the notion that \u2018cities can save the planet\u2019 (Angelo and Wachsmuth, 2020) \u2013 that they can deliver solutions to a range of complex social, environmental and economic challenges \u2013 is a common place (Acuto et al., 2018; Barnett, 2022; Lawton, 2020). Barnett (2022) recently referred to this as \u2018task responsibilisation\u2019 of urban actors and processes in governing societal futures. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> opened the door to attending to the urbanization of complex problems/solution sets: from climate change, to (now) poverty, food security, AI-fuelled socio-technical transformations and more.</p><p>Indeed, in our own urban governance work, this has led us to our current research on urban governance innovation where we\u2019ve been looking at how this task responsibilisation of the urban is driving the \u2018imperative to innovate\u2019 and the consequences for urban governance (McGuirk et al., 2022). The central themes of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> \u2013 the multiscalar, the diversification of actors authorized to govern, the shifting politics of problematisation as cities and local governments are involved \u2013 are writ large in our emergent analyses. Our work thus far is revealing the widening dispositif of actors and mechanisms that constitute innovative urban governance initiatives (often self-consciously cast as such) and the broad spectrum of politics and political possibility (Sisson et al., 2023). And, perhaps not surprisingly, we find ourselves mirroring the very point that Bulkeley and Betsill return to in the book\u2019s conclusion. This is the on-going importance of the state as a governance actor. As we reflect on what the task responsibilisation of the urban for governing complex problems means for the urban state, we return to a prescient point made in the conclusion \u2018the role of the state is not governed by some determinate and finite notion of capacity but rather through negotiations in which actors and institutions mutually define their respective roles\u2026shifts in the scale of state activity and authority should therefore be viewed as a reorganization of the social relations between actors, a reorganisation which may reinforce the power of the state\u2019 (p. 191). For us, then, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change</emphasis> continues both to provoke and to provide us with conceptual resources; as it does, we argue, for urban governance studies more generally.</p><h>Cities of love: Climate change, urban justice and an anticolonial politics</h><h>Ankit Kumar</h><p>DOI: 10.1177/23996544241296741e</p><h>Department of Geography, The University of Sheffield</h><p>Bulkeley and Betsill\u2019s (2003) arguments on a key role of cities in response to climate change stand the test of time. For the first time, this book presented evidence from different Western cities that the \u2018traditional analytical divisions between international and domestic politics, local, national and global scales, as well as state and non-state actors, no longer apply\u2019. They argued that, contrary to normative understandings, climate change governance was not just a matter of global negotiations and national policies, but also local action, even though these local movements are deeply influenced by national, transnational, and global actors and actions (186).</p><p>Since the book came out 20 years ago, there has been increasing talk of climate justice, yet social justice within and beyond climate change discussions, locally and globally, has taken a beating. From the Kyoto Protocol to Paris and post-Paris discussions, \u2018the moral tenor of global climate governance has moved away from the principle of common but differentiated responsibility toward a perverse moral concept \u2026 \u201ccommon but shifted responsibility\u201d\u2019 (Okereke and Coventry, 2016:847). Other key changes in the last 20 years overlap with climate change. We have a more entrenched neoliberalism manifesting in some places as austerity politics. This has stripped urban areas and local governments of resources and autonomy. There is a supposed \u2018global\u2019 development paradigm under the Sustainable Development Goals that calls for a bigger role for non-state actors, especially big business, and philanthropy. The transition from emission reduction targets for the global North under the Kyoto Protocol to targets for everyone under the Paris Agreement has been seen as evidence of a more \u2018global\u2019 development paradigm where roles and responsibilities are much more dissipated than before (Horner and Hulme, 2019). Finally, there is a global rise of populism and ethnonationalism. This populism is insidious in that it often supports particular forms of climate action while opposing social justice. This insidious nature also manifests in calls for social justice between nation-states and its denial within the nation-states. In light of these developments, I invite Bulkeley and Betsill (2003) to reflect on how the role of cities or urban areas more broadly might have progressed or regressed in the last 20 years. Here I offer some provocations for this.</p><p>In light of the developments briefly outlined above, (re)reading this book, I found myself inadvertently whispering <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">justice</emphasis> every time the word climate change came up. And then asking myself, does that particular statement stand true? For example, \u2018climate protection has been adopted as a core activity of the environment division\u2019 in Denver (171). Would it also be true <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">now</emphasis> that climate justice has been adopted as a core activity of the environment division? By doing this, I do not mean to question Bulkeley and Betsill\u2019s (2003) arguments. Rather, I want to, collectively, re-read their arguments in the present-day climate context. I want to ask how cities might be embedding in/justice in their climate change work, alongside and despite the state. Here I pick 4 points:</p><p>First, Bulkeley and Betsill (2003) identify that \u2018climate change has been added to other rationales \u2026. [like financial saving or better local environment] rather than providing a justification for policy action in and of itself\u2019 (173). How might this translate to a wider climate justice action? Perhaps a pertinent question is: which cities are actively involved in a social justice agenda and how are they using climate change as an additional justification for action? It might be worth remembering here that the advent of a politics of environmental justice was always rooted in racial justice.</p><p>Second, they identify the centrality of the \u2018availability of financial resources\u2019 in enabling local actions (175). Importantly, Bulkeley and Betsill (2003) note that local authorities that most effectively engaged with global climate networks did so due to \u2018the financial and political resources it offers than by access to technical and best practice information\u2019 (186). Finance is always a looming question in climate change governance. Where is the finance coming from and for what purposes? As the power of local authorities diminishes in many parts of the world whether through a desire for centralization or through a politics of austerity, and corporations step in to fill the gap, where do concerns for justice stand?</p><p>Third, the \u2018powers of local government in the critical areas of land use planning, transport and energy management\u2019 (184) comes through as an important point. The question of energy, whether in the form of electricity and heating at home or for mobility, is central to climate justice. We can ask here, where do we see changes happening that centre justice? How and where are cities promoting more equitable consumption and using these as vehicles of climate justice actions? Subsidized public transport, for example, is an intervention one can think of.</p><p>Fourth, Bulkeley and Betsill\u2019s (2003) remind us that it matters very much \u2018how the issue is defined and understood\u2019 and that local constituencies can relate climate action with \u2018other dividends, such as reducing local air pollution, improving the local economy, enhancing the liveability of urban spaces, and addressing social and economic inequities\u2019 (184). Perhaps, this is where we can most clearly ask if justice matters for cities taking climate action. Is justice one of the \u2018dividends\u2019 that come to matter? If it does, then is there a geography to this?</p><p>Bulkeley and Betsill\u2019s (2003) arguments for a key role of the urban or the local were based largely on what cities could do to mitigate global climate change or rather their own impacts on the Earth\u2019s climate. 20 years since, the question of climate change adaptation is progressively urgent. The links between climate justice and adaptation are important. Here, the argument is that \u2018socially just outcomes should be a priority if adaptation is to be fair, inclusive, and sustainable\u2019 and that \u2018adaptation rooted in equity and justice principles can have an \u201cintrinsic\u201d value (a goal in itself) and an \u201cinstrumental\u201d value (in achieving wider goals)\u2019 (Singh et al., 2022: 656). It well established that \u2018vulnerable and historically disadvantaged communities\u2014especially those in the Global South or less resourced cities and localities in the Global North\u2014will disproportionately shoulder the costs of climate change as well as its negative implications for health, livelihoods, and economic security\u2019 (Olazabal et al., 2021: 828). In addition, the centrality of justice to the question of climate adaptation in is embedded in critiques that \u2018seek to interrogate environmental determinist narratives of risk, techno-managerial decision-making pathways, hegemonic state development policies, geopolitical contentions at multiple borderlands, and the active marginalization of the plurality of worldviews\u2019. For these and other reasons, the question of climate justice and climate adaptation becomes more complicated than that of mitigation.</p><p>When it comes to greenhouse gases emissions, as Bulkeley and Betsill (2003) show, cities can contribute to global mitigation, (somewhat) independent of states. This is because the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is an open and shared space with flows of carbon emissions, and the warming they cause, circumventing political boundaries. Yet, the impacts of such warming are differential, and a \u2018global\u2019 climate change adaptation needs to be premised on sharing resources and spaces. This is hindered by political boundaries maintained by surveillance and carceral infrastructures. If cities are effective in \u2018lobbying national governments\u2019 and \u2018exercise a degree of influence\u2019 (Bulkeley and Betsill, 2003: 2\u20133), how might this translate to climate change adaptation? My argument is that cities need to engage in an anticolonial politics of love and hospitality that sheds \u2018security\u2019 for an effective response to climate change. An effective response that brings climate change mitigation and adaptation together.</p><p>I take the example of the Sanctuary Cities movement (Kumar, 2023). This movement is often credited as an example of actions cities extend <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">within, but without</emphasis>, states. Sanctuary cities offer support and \u2018safe space\u2019 to undocumented migrants, refugees, and those fleeing violence, by \u2018providing identification, housing, health and labour market [and]\u2026. non-collaboration with deportation agencies\u2019. Yet Roy (2019: 769) links the proponents of sanctuary jurisdictions and those of \u2018expansion of police power\u2019. Sanctuary cities here are not premised on a resistance to the state; rather, as Roy explains, they are expressions of resistance to particular parts of the state. For example, in the United states sanctuary cities were articulated as \u2018resistance to Trumpism\u2019 (Roy, 2019: 768). Sanctuary cities are premised on the \u2018liberalism\u2019 of local governments, including the local police. Yet, the police have a long history of brutality as \u2018state violence\u2019 (Roy, 2019: 768). This history of violence and carceral infrastructure targets mainly Black, Brown, Indigenous, and Dalit bodies, supported by the local state, is starkly at odds with movements for social justice that sanctuary cities purport.</p><p>What can then cities do to progress climate, justice and climate justice actions, besides and despite the state? Roy (2019) calls for a \u2018shift from sanctuary to abolition\u2019 (775). Building on this, I argue for a politics of love for the \u2018other,\u2019 one that rejects \u2018security\u2019 (Kumar, 2023). A politics beyond the state needs to engage with a politics of abolition. Where might we find these cities of love, these cities of climate justice?</p><h>Response: When cities broke into the global stage: 20 years since the publication of \u2018Cities and Climate Change\u2019</h><p>DOI: 10.1177/23996544241296741f</p><h>Michele Betsill</h><h>University of Copenhagen</h><h>Harriet Bulkeley</h><h>Durham University and Utrecht University</h><p>We appreciate the opportunity to reflect on how the field of climate urbanism has evolved since the 2003 publication of our book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities and Climate Change: Urban Sustainability to Global Environmental Governance</emphasis>. When we were conducting our own research on cities and climate change in the late 1990s, there were relatively few scholars working in this area. This was partly because the problem of climate change was largely understood as a global collective action problem requiring the international cooperation of states, and partly because the long-standing divide between cities and nature meant that questions of the (more than local) environment were rarely considered as urban issues. Against a backdrop of increasing state recalcitrance on the need for meaningful action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the US and Australia where we were working at the time, the green shoots of urban opportunities for action provided a source of hope and concepts of multilevel and transnational governance the means for connecting them to the global arena.</p><p>We were certainly not alone in finding cities a fertile ground for exploring the opportunities for climate action. During the 2000s, the field of climate urbanism grew significantly, expanding into a range of disciplines as reflected in the contributions to this symposium, including international relations (Gordon), human geography (Cast\u00e1n Broto and Marvin; Kumar), urban studies (McGuirk and Dowling), and public policy and administration (Davies). Relatedly, a host of concepts, approaches and methods were deployed to understand the climate/urban phenomenon, such that the field is now characterized by an eclectic mix of theoretical perspectives and varied conclusions about the weight and importance of urban climate action.</p><p>As the field has grown, we see a more critical engagement with the nature of urban climate politics and its limitations, and a shift from a concern only with the opportunities that cities might provide for responding to the climate challenge to more fundamental questions about what kinds of opportunities these are and for whom. Yet, there remains a tendency to speak about the nature of climate urbanism based on case studies of large cities and the global North, despite repeated calls to shift our analyses from these sites and deploy large-scale and quantitative methods.</p><p>The expansion of work on cities and climate change across different disciplines has enriched wider debates, such that, for example, the role of cities as actors on the global stage is now much more prominent within policy studies and public administration. The ways in which cities provide sites for climate politics and the subsequent reconfiguration of what constitutes climate politics has been significant in international relations. Likewise, the fields of urban studies and planning have now embraced the importance of understanding cities as both actors and sites of climate politics and of the manifold ways in which this is reconfiguring the very fabric and nature of the urban, what it means to inhabit the climate changing city, and indeed how the urban can be governed in the context of indeterminate climate futures. Over the past decade in particular, there has been a clear expansion of debates concerning how and with what implications efforts to reconfigure, inhabit and govern the city in relation to climate change matter in terms of (environmental) justice. Concerns have grown not only about who is benefiting from climate action, but also about how climate change may itself be a means used to perpetuate continuing forms of exclusion and injustice in the city.</p><p>20 years on, the field is broader, richer, more nuanced, and more political than we could have imagined looking at those first pioneering cities that made climate change their cause. As we move into a third decade of work in this area, and with no less than an IPCC Special Report dedicated to this topic on the horizon, we can also identify areas of emerging new scholarship and fertile ground for new endeavours. One relates to what appears to be a curious path-dependency of equating the primary site of urban climate politics with the local state, whereas research on climate politics more broadly considers a much wider set of actors. We see much potential for casting the net much wider and going beyond engagement with the multiple civil society and private sector actors involved in local climate policy and with communities and social movements mobilizing around questions of climate politics and justice. Rapidly growing research on urban climate finance and the role of private actors in this domain contributes to a deeper interrogation of the political foundations of the city, as Gordon puts it, and what this means for the ways in which climate urbanism is (and is not) unfolding. Likewise, attending to other key private sector actors, including land holders, utilities, and sites of production and consumption, appears to be fertile ground for further exploring what McGuirk and Dowling view as a reorganization of urban social relations and renegotiation of the power of the local state.</p><p>A second area concerns issues of where and with whom responsibility for urban climate action lies. Kumar rightly highlights the necessity of considering whether and how climate in/justice is embedded in urban climate governance. For good normative and political reasons, climate justice debates often focus on those being put at risk or excluded from the benefits and processes of climate responses, and there has been a growing emphasis on including issues such as race and gender through an intersectional lens. As Davies suggests, this requires that we \u2018stay with the trouble\u2019 and tensions that arise with an increasing emphasis on a participatory politics that is both diverse and inclusive. An equally pressing justice concern relates to the actions of those who have the most responsibility and capacity to address climate change and their role in urban responses. For example, we can think of the now well-known figures concerning the relative contribution of global elites to emissions, or the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities which has orchestrated much of international climate politics as being of equal relevance to the urban context. Likewise, those with power, land, and resources, which in many urban areas particularly in the global South are not necessarily the local state, also bear a responsibility to foster climate resilience. Yet to date little scholarship has been directed to these questions.</p><p>Finally, important considerations about how we understand the nature of the urban and its boundaries lie at the intersection of questions about the multiplicity of sites and actors of urban climate politics and those concerning questions of justice and responsibility. The vast majority of climate urbanism research has worked with a largely bounded notion of the urban as a place, even while exploring its governance through multilevel and transnational perspectives. As we further interrogate cities\u2019 contributions to the climate problem and the kinds of possible solutions, the position of the urban within global flows (e.g. finance, goods, heat, or nature) is increasingly apparent. Questions of consumption inevitably tie particular urban sites and dynamics to supply chains and resource frontiers, while research on urban nature now positions cities in complex patterns of migratory species, upstream and downstream catchment management issues, and the ways in which cities are providing distinct new ecologies for often rare species. As this vibrant field continues to grow, we look forward to further thought-provoking work that asks these deeper questions about how climate change is reworking our understanding, imagination, and hopes for urban futures.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link to PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"10117723996544241296741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"61903\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Almassy D, Pinter L, Rocha S, , et al.
