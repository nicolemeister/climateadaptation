There is injustice here, because developing nations, which have done relatively little to endanger the planet, are the ones who will eventually pay the price and suffer severe climate-related losses. Since it is generally acknowledged that wealthier nations have historically contributed more to climate change, they are expected to provide financial assistance to developing countries. </p><p>Climate finance can help them build resilience by funding disaster recovery, infrastructure improvements, and sustainable development projects. The Loss and Damage Fund, for example, provides grants to small-island developing states and least developed countries to help them cope with climate-related disasters. </p><p>\"As the host of the Board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, the Philippines will continue to advocate for scientific and evidence-based, investment-led, and transformative solutions to the climate crisis,\" President Marcos said.  </p><p>Wealthy nations have pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to support climate finance initiatives. However, many have fallen short of their commitments, and some funds have been provided as loans rather than grants, benefiting the lending nations. Rich countries must ensure that climate finance is accessible, sufficient, and fairly distributed to those who need it most. </p><p>Climate finance can also help the shipping industry, which contributes to global emissions, accelerate its transition to greener technologies. The cost of decarbonizing the global shipping fleet is estimated at $8 billion to $28 billion per year. The IMO has set ambitious decarbonization targets, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Financial institutions are increasingly aligning their portfolios with net-zero goals, supporting the transition to sustainable shipping. </p><p>The Paris Agreement reaffirms the obligations of developed countries, while also enjoining other Parties to extend voluntary contributions. Developed country parties are urged to continue to spearhead mobilization of climate finance from a wide variety of sources. Such mobilization of climate finance should take measures beyond previous efforts. </p><p>Climate finance should not be looked upon as an act of charity or a transfer of wealth from rich nations to developing nations, because any measure taken to save Planet Earth benefits all its inhabitants, rich and poor. Imagine climate change as a wildfire spreading across a forest, like the wildfires that are currently spreading across Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Alberta, Canada. Aside from the loss of lives and property, wildfire smoke has adverse effects on the heart and lungs that can last for months, and can even worsen the risk of stroke, and significantly impair brain function. These effects are not limited to Canada, but will threaten US air quality as well and affect their health. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA), in a move not only to help Canada but also to keep US air quality safe, is deploying resources to augment the wildfire response team. They know that if the well-protected areas refuse to help put out the flames elsewhere, the fire will eventually spread and threaten everyone. </p><p>This assistance is not charity - it is self-preservation. By ensuring all areas can effectively combat the flames, the whole forest survives, protecting the resources and stability that benefit everyone. </p><p>Climate change does not respect borders. Even if wealthier nations focus solely on their own resilience, unchecked climate disasters in vulnerable countries will inevitably disrupt global supply chains, increase migration pressures, and create instability that affects everyone. Helping others is not a trade-off - it's an investment in global security. </p><p>In her book \"Hope in the Dark: Untold Histories, Wild Possibilities,\" Rebecca Solnit extols the advantage of cooperation that should give us hope: \"Together we are very powerful, and we have a seldom-told, seldom-remembered history of victories and transformations that can give us confidence that yes, we can change the world because we have many times before.

Climate justice soughtFilipinos are all too familiar with the effects of climate change, and environmental watchdogs say the survey demonstrates the growing urgency to demand climate justice for vulnerable nations like the Philippines. The poll results affirm what we've known for a long time: Filipinos have a strong sense of justice and majority support taxing the climate polluters to compensate for the damages they cause,' Oxfam Pilipinas Climate Justice portfolio manager Cheng Pagulayan said in a statement. These taxes should rightfully go to the vulnerable communities most impacted by the climate crisis and to supporting community-based renewable energy investments,' he added. How should the taxes be imposed? About 79% of Filipinos said the government should not just raise taxes on oil and gas companies, but also require revenues be directed toward communities most affected by the climate crisis. Meanwhile, 81% called on the government to close loopholes that have allowed wealthy individuals and international firms to evade financial and ecological accountability. At least three in five Filipinos also believe the government is not doing enough to curb the political influence of wealthy and polluting industries."]}, {"relevance_score": 44, "title": "Climate justice", "published": "2024-12-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sustainable development seems to be struggling uphill globally at the end of 2024.

As we approached the sitio, we were welcomed by flashy tarpaulins and a sign saying, 'Welcome to Sitio Bulacnin'.

It is an existential one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now serving as Secretary-General of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), a bloc of 74 countries disproportionately affected by climate change, Nasheed is once again at the forefront of the fight.</p><p>'We are suffering more and more,' Nasheed told Business\u00adMirror in an exclusive interview on a quick visit to Manila. 'One storm can wipe away 20 percent of your GDP. In the Caribbean, 40 percent overnight. This is the scale.'</p><p>Before taking the helm of the CVF, Nasheed was best known for ushering in democratic reforms in the Maldives.</p><p>His presidency dismantled 30 years of dictatorship, restored civil liberties, and introduced democracy to millions of Maldivians who never thought such a word could exist.</p><p>Even as president, however, the most pressing threat he faced came not from politics-but from the sea.</p><p>Rising sea levels threatened to engulf entire islands. Ocean acidication weakened marine ecosystems. Coral bleaching wiped out large sections of the reefs that had long sustained the country's fisheries and tourism, the backbone of the Maldives' economy.</p><p>'It's depressing to see that [environmental degradation].... We are trying to convince others and everyone that there is a better way of doing things...done more responsibly,' Nasheed said.</p><p>What has changed, what has not?</p><p>In his decades-long campaign, Nasheed acknowledged that while it's undeniably slow, he has still seen some progress.</p><p>Media outlets are more willing to connect natural disasters to human-induced climate change. Lawmakers are starting to lead discussions on how to transition to a greener economy.</p><p>Even the private sector has started moving, albeit cautiously.</p><p>'When in the '90s, for instance, people just didn't believe. They said, 'Ah, this is just the weather.' But now people have come to realize that there is something going on,' he said.</p><p>Even the business sector has begun to move. In Southeast Asia alone, green investments rose by 20 percentage points-from $5.2 billion in 2022 to $6.3 billion in 2023, according to a joint report by Bain and Company, GenZero, and Temasek.</p><p>But while public awareness and private capital have increased, support from the world's wealthiest countries remains deeply lacking.</p><p>Fund for arms, little for climate crisis</p><p>OVER the last two decades, CVF member states have suffered an estimated $525 billion in losses due to climate-related disasters.</p><p>The long-promised $100-billion annual climate finance pledge-originally made by developed countries in 2009-was barely met as well.</p><p>In fact, Nasheed recalled that this promise was made to him personally during the Copenhagen climate summit.</p><p>'It was promised to me.... They pledged, but the money doesn't come,' he said. 'And even the Loss and Damage Fund, so far it only has $700 million.... But the real value of what was given to developing countries...I don't think it would reach even $200 million to $300 million.'</p><p>Nasheed believes the reason lies in the Global North's continuing unwillingness to acknowledge responsibility.</p><p>'One is Western countries' unwillingness to recognize.... They have not accepted that they have damaged the planet so much that it is their fault and because of their wrongs that we are suffering,' he said.</p><p>'We are not suffering from what we did. We suffer from what they have done,' the CVF chief added.</p><p>Instead of financing climate action, Nasheed observed that many developed countries have diverted funds to rearmament and military spending-especially in the wake of geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>'In the 1970s, there was a UN resolution to spend 0.7 percent of GDP on development aid. But no one is sticking to that. And now, even while it is so low, they are reducing the amounts,' Nasheed said.</p><p>Bearing the brunt</p><p>NOWHERE is climate injustice more visible than in nations like the Maldives and the Philippines-countries that have not contributed much to the global emissions but face the worst of its consequences.</p><p>Stronger and more frequent storms threaten to wipe out entire atolls in the Maldives, while saltwater intrusion and coral bleaching undermine its tourism and fishing sectors.</p><p>In the Philippines, successive recent typhoons like Crising, Dante, and Emong have displaced thousands of people and damaged thousands of homes.</p><p>Despite these risks, the use of fossil fuel is still staggering.</p><p>Independent energy think tank Ember earlier found that 59 percent of the global energy mix was still provided by fossil fuels in 2024.</p><p>Nasheed said the urgency for transition is clear, but unfortunately, implementation for most countries remains sluggish.</p><p>In the Philippines alone, Ember reported that solar and wind contribute just 3.8 percent as it heavily relied on fossil fuels (79 percent) in 2024-despite the country's vast solar potential and favorable wind corridors.</p><p>'The thing about renewables is it's cheaper than fossil fuels. I mean, renewables today can be around four to five US cents a unit .... even [the] cheapest fossil fuel, you can't get it below 10 cents, US cents,' Nasheed explained.</p><p>Nasheed also dispelled the notion that shifting to green energy would displace thousands of workers.</p><p>In fact, he argued that a green transition could generate more employment if planned with a 'just transition' framework, allowing fossil fuel workers to shift into renewable sectors.</p><p>This complements the earlier finding of the International Labour Organization (ILO) that the shift to a green economy could create up to 24 million jobs worldwide by 2030.</p><p>'Any transition would have leading problems, but I think it will only get better,' Nasheed added.</p><p>Adaptation over relocation</p><p>WITH sea levels rising, some nations have explored 'diaspora strategies' in case relocation becomes inevitable. But Nasheed is adamant that adaptation-not relocation-must be the priority.</p><p>'We want to stay where we are,' he said.</p><p>He recalled a turning point during a visit to a Maldivian island, when an elderly woman approached him and asked: 'President, where are you going to take the sounds, the flowers, the butterflies, the colors?'</p><p>'You can relocate people. But you can't relocate the essence of a place,' the former Maldivian president explained.</p><p>The science supports his fears. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), even if global warming is limited to 1.5\u00b0C, many small island states will still experience 'high multiple interrelated risks' which could lead to irreversible loss of habitable coastal land.</p><p>But rather than flee, Nasheed believes countries should fight for survival by investing in coastal barriers, marine restoration, and early warning systems-like how The Netherlands has begun embracing the concept of 'sponge city,' which integrates urban floodplains and drainage areas to manage stormwater instead of blocking it.</p><p>For countries like the Philippines, Nasheed also recommended recreating natural lakes and wetlands to help absorb floods-rather than relying solely on costly hard infrastructure.</p><p>'It's about working with nature, not against it. We need biological solutions, not just engineering ones,' he said.</p><p>Rethinking climate finance</p><p>NONE of this would be possible, however, without adequate funding.</p><p>Nasheed argues that instead of relying solely on broken promises from the Global North, countries should innovate in climate financing.</p><p>He advocates using public funds-including the Loss and Damage Fund-to de-risk and leverage private-sector investments.</p><p>'There are trillions of dollars in private capital seeking good investments,' Nasheed said. 'But they won't come unless there's project preparation-and once you do that, there will still be a funding gap.'</p><p>To bridge that gap, he proposes expanding carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, particularly through mandatory carbon offsets.</p><p>Countries that exceed their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on emissions, he said, should be required to pay into carbon exchanges that fund conservation efforts elsewhere.</p><p>He also supports 'debt-for-climate' swaps, where developing countries are relieved of sovereign debt burdens in exchange for investing in conservation and adaptation.</p><p>'The point is, yes, we need the public money. But we must also use it smartly to unlock more,' Nasheed added.</p><p>Wanted: More young people in science</p><p>FOR the former island president, the stakes of inaction extend far beyond GDP losses or sea-level rise.</p><p>'This is not like the wars our parents lived through,' he said. 'This is doomsday. If Gen Z gives up, then we have lost this planet.'</p><p>He acknowledged the weight of the burden on today's youth-an inheritance they didn't ask for, but one they must carry.</p><p>'Everyone is inheriting things they didn't do. That's why it's called inheritance,' Nasheed said. 'But we cannot allow this generation to inherit a dead planet.'</p><p>With time running out, he urged young people to take up space in climate leadership and science.</p><p>'I think nations should invest more in research, in science. We need more young people studying it...because this isn't going to be fixed by one generation alone,' he said.</p><p>Globally, the race is on to reduce carbon emissions by 45 percent in 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.</p><p>'Some days, it's bad. You know, you think no one is listening. You think . . . it's not happening [the way you expected]. But don't give up.... [We] really have to [keep] having these conversations with the younger generations. And they must never stop doing the good work that they need to do,' Nasheed said.</p><p>The climate clock is ticking.

What was widely expected to be a tepid checkpoint in the electoral cycle turned out to be a national reawakening. The results-marked by an 81-percent turnout, the highest since the Edsa era-signaled a seismic shift in voter behavior, party alignments, and political momentum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Contrary to the linear trends projected by preelection surveys, the final senatorial tally revealed a last-minute upheaval-what might be called a political 'parting of the Red Sea.' Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan, once consigned to the margins of viability, surged into the Top 5. Newcomers like Heidi Mendoza broke through the electoral noise with campaigns powered by integrity and grassroots connections-not dynastic machinery.</p><p>These outcomes defied the myth of stable public opinion. In truth, voter sentiment in the Philippines remains VUCA: volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Filipinos are not passive respondents to surveys; they are alert political agents who pivot quickly in response to moral cues and political developments. The last days of the campaign-shaped by images of former president Rodrigo Duterte being flown to The Hague and the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte-became catalysts for a collective reckoning.</p><p>The mythology of Duterte-style populism collapsed in real time. Once buoyed by a sense of authenticity and strength, the Duterte brand is now weighed down by scandals, legal peril, and fatigue. While some loyalists like Sens. Bong Go and Ronald dela Rosa clung to Senate seats, they now represent nostalgia more than a future promise. Sara Duterte, impeached and increasingly isolated, has failed to project a compelling national narrative or agenda.</p><p>In contrast, the elections ushered in what might be described as a meritocratic renewal. Candidates like Aquino and Pangilinan were not simply 'anti-Duterte' figures. They were seen as competent, credible, and principled-a rational middle ground between elitist detachment and populist spectacle. Mendoza, who lacked political machinery but earned over 8 million votes, personified the electorate's yearning for moral leadership.</p><p>The Iglesia ni Cristo's (INC) endorsement of Bam Aquino further illustrates this recalibration. Often pragmatic in its choices, the INC sent a signal to voters and elites alike: Aquino represented stability without chaos, reform without rupture. His victory embodied a strategic pivot toward governance over drama.</p><p>What's emerging is not just an opposition revival, but a post-populist reorientation. The Pink Movement, once dismissed as moralistic and disorganized, has regained credibility. But it must evolve. Its future lies not in purity politics or spontaneous mobilization, but in building sustained, inclusive, and programmatic political infrastructure.</p><p>The 2025 midterms also revealed a new kind of voter-particularly among the youth and first-time voters. These digital natives are not swayed by spectacle alone. They are tuned into meaning, not just noise. They respond to ethical narratives, and they act decisively when authenticity aligns with competence. They are reshaping politics not from above, but from within-quietly, persistently, and irreversibly.</p><p>This shift holds deep implications for 2028. For the first time in a decade, there is no clear heir to the presidency. The once-dominant Marcos-Duterte bloc is fractured. The private sector, weary of erratic leadership, is leaning toward stability, rules-based governance, and accountability. A rare alignment is emerging: moral voter energy, a discredited authoritarian camp, a directionless administration, and a reformist opposition coalescing around democratic values.</p><p>But this opportunity is fragile. Momentum alone will not sustain it. To transform this moment into a genuine turning point, political actors must invest in civic infrastructure-recruiting new leaders, professionalizing party systems, and linking reformist energy with tangible legislative and executive strategies. Civil society must push for policy clarity on climate justice, education, innovation, and inclusive prosperity.</p><p>The lesson of May 2025 is not simply that voters are awake. It is that they are discerning. They have shed their binary loyalties and transactional expectations. They are no longer choosing between evil and the lesser evil-but between chaos and competence, spectacle and substance.</p><p>If the forces now stirring can hold together, May 2028 could mark more than another electoral cycle. It could inaugurate a new political era: democratic, grounded, and built on a foundation of integrity. The sea has parted-not forever, and not without risk-but enough for a narrow path to emerge.

The SC said large-scale mining and exploration of mineral resources are legal under the Constitution and the Philippine Mining Act of 1995, adding that it is the State\u2019s duty to promote these activities \u201cto support national development, while also ensuring environmental protection and safeguarding the rights of affected communities. \u201dLocal ordinances are not considered \u201claws\u201d that can prohibit mining under Section 19 of RA 7942, according to the ruling. The power of LGUs to issue ordinances comes from Congress, and interpreting \u201claws\u201d to include local ordinances would, in effect, allow LGUs to override Congressional authority to regulate mining, it said."]}, {"relevance_score": 48, "title": "Climate Reality PH inducts new leaders into global network for climate action", "published": "2025-04-24", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Manila, April 24 -- \"The global sustainability revolution is unstoppable, and it's unstoppable because of advocates like you and the millions of people around the world demanding stronger, more ambitious climate action,\" said former US Vice President and The Climate Reality Project (TCRP) Founder Al Gore, welcoming the participants of TCRP Leadership Corps Training in Bacolod City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This event is part of The Reality Tour, TCRP's global initiative to build momentum for bold climate ambition ahead of the United Nations'climate summit in Brazil in November 2025.</p><p>Designed as a training to build foundational knowledge, skills, and network to generate collective action to support effective and urgent climate action, the event trained over 90 new Climate Reality leaders poised to drive climate action in their communities.</p><p>Building movements from the grassroots</p><p>The newly minted leaders are now part of a 3.5 million-strong global network of supporters and catalysts for change spanning 190 countries.

Fifty-eight countries including the Philippines belonging to the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) were responsible for spearheading the Paris Agreement in 2015. This agreement seeks to limit global warming to well below two degrees centigrade by the end of the 21st century, by aiming to keep warming within the safer limit of 1.5 degrees centigrade. Latest findings show that global warming could reach this latter threshold between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.</p><p>The foregoing Global Stocktake on the Paris Agreement has underpinned the agenda of all Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change meetings from 2015 to the ongoing COP 28 in Dubai. Stock-taking precedes Accelerated Adaptation Action in the CVC agenda. At COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh last year, agreement was forged for establishing a Loss and Damage Fund.</p><p>This is the context of the Philippine position articulated in President Marcos' prepared speech for COP 28 in which he asked world leaders to support the Philippines' bid to host the Loss and Damage Fund. He emphasized the urgency of operationalizing this Fund so that the developing and vulnerable countries could respond concretely to the serious impact of droughts, floods and rising see levels aggravated by climate change. Only a fortnight ago, the country marked the 10th anniversary of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), one of the most powerful typhoons in history, that affected more than 14 million people across 44 provinces, claiming the lives of over 8,000 people, and displacing millions more.</p><p>The President pointed out that the government has focused on transformative solutions to curb the impact of climate change and address biodiversity loss and pollution. \"More than just an environmental issue; for us, it is a matter of survival, of justice, and of protecting the rights of our people,\" he said. Hence, the Philippine Development Plan has prioritized fast-tracking climate action and establishing sustainable and livable cities.</p><p>While the government has established a People's Survival Fund that supports efforts of local government units to implement climate change adaptation programs and projects, the scale and scope of what needs to be done requires a greater magnitude of support that will be provided by the Loss and Damage Fund.

He believes that the situation has become so bad that dynasties have achieved unbridled power. They have become more powerful than the law itself. This is why grave crimes like plunder, murder, treason and economic sabotage go unpunished. Impunity and shamelessness is a result of unbridled power. Cull the power, quash the impunity, states Espiritu.</p><p>The legislature had 38 years to enact the Anti-Dynasty Law to comply with the 1987 Constitution. They failed for self interest. At this point, there is no hope for the bill to pass unless someone champions it. Espiritu presents himself as that champion.</p><p>But he makes one caveat. The bill will never get passed unless civil society demands it. Citizens should voice out their indignation over the abuses of dynasties on social media and in the streets, if need be. </p><p>Exposing the impunities of government officials and organizing protests is nothing new to Espiritu. As a leader of multiple mass-based groups, he has mobilized hundreds of rallies to expose the dirt of politicians whilst demanding positive change. If there is anything dynasties are afraid of, it is being exposed for their abuses. Espiritu commits to do that. He is rebel, reformist and guerilla warrior. He is loud, straightforward, intelligent and unafraid. He is exactly what the Senate needs, considering the many dumb, treasonous and/or non-performers in it.</p><p>He plans to stand against unprogrammed and confidential funds (aka pork barrel). He intends to push for stiffer penal consequences for plunder including detention, without bail, for mere show of cause. He vows to expose the corrupt by exposing their hidden wealth and private lifestyles. In short, Espiritu plans to break the code of silence among dynasties who cover for each other's abuses.</p><p>The jaded will write off Espiritu as unwinnable. After all, he has neither the funds nor the political machine of dynasties. Espiritu is well aware of what he is up against but maintains that the possibility of winning exist.

As the world grapples with increasingly severe climate impacts, the financial toll is staggering. Trillions of dollars are needed to both recover from past damage and invest in climate resilience and emissions reduction. Yet, despite the urgent need, global efforts to mobilize climate finance remain inadequate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the heart of the issue lies a dual challenge: mobilizing adequate funding while ensuring that every dollar aligns with the climate priorities of vulnerable nations. Unfortunately, the latter often takes a backseat in global negotiations, where the focus is primarily on annual financial commitments.</p><p>This issue took center stage at the 2024 Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, where organizations including Climate Reality, the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC), the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative, and the Climate Vulnerable Forum emphasized that effective climate action requires not only sufficient funding (quantity) but also ensuring that every dollar delivers maximum impact (quality).</p><p>Following the money</p><p>At an official United Nations COP29 side event, the organizations called for robust local-level tracking and validation, presenting case studies from the Philippines, South Africa, and Ghana to demonstrate how critical it is to ensure that funds actually reach those who need them most.</p><p>Between 2010 and 2022, international commitments for climate finance to the Philippines reached over $11 billion-split between over $5.4 billion for mitigation and $5.5 billion for adaptation. However, as of November 2023, only $4.2 billion (or 38 percent) had been disbursed: approximately $1.6 billion for mitigation and $2.6 billion for adaptation.</p><p>South Africa's experience, on the other hand, underscores the challenges of loan-driven financing. Over $505 million in adaptation funds were committed between 2010 and 2022, with $504 million disbursed, primarily as loans. Mitigation funding followed a similar trend, with over $3 billion committed and $1.3 billion disbursed, also predominantly as loans.</p><p>Ghana presents a more balanced picture. Most adaptation funding ($500 million committed, $400 million disbursed) came as grants, though nearly $300 million originated as loans. Mitigation finance was largely grant-driven, with $660 million committed and $612 million disbursed.</p><p>These findings emerged through the efforts of ICSC and the African Climate Reality Project following the climate finance tracking workshoplast July, which equipped campaigners with the basic skills for climate finance data mining and validation.</p><p>Importance of local tracking and validation</p><p>While these figures provide crucial insights, they only tell part of the story. Validating project implementation on the ground is equally vital. ICSC's 2024 reportunderscored the need for robust tracking mechanisms to ensure funds are used effectively and align with local priorities.</p><p>Triangulating data with what's being funded on the ground ensures accountability and aligns funds with actual needs, contributing to national discussions of how much more investments are needed to advance national and local climate targets.</p><p>Nana Mariam Yussif, African Climate Reality Project's West Africa Hub Coordinator, visited the Worobong South Forest Reserve in Ghana, a project supported by the African Development Bank. This project successfully restored 4,800 hectares of degraded forest, enhancing biodiversity and improving livelihoods. However, challenges such as incomplete infrastructure and abrupt project termination highlighted the critical need for better tracking and accountability to ensure long-term sustainability and community wellbeing.</p><p>\"Without proper tracking and accountability measures, climate finance projects also have the potential to leave communities behind, making them more vulnerable, after they have already adopted a new way of life,\" said Yussif.</p><p>Drawing the bottom line</p><p>Financing climate action isn't just about securing billions or trillions. It's about ensuring every dollar counts. Without accountability, the risks are two-fold: insufficient funding and misaligned priorities.</p><p>Currently, reporting systems prioritize the source of funds, obscuring their actual impact. This must change. Institutionalizing accountability mechanisms is essential. Until then, civil society organizations play a pivotal role in taking charge of the campaign for transparency.</p><p>This isn't just about numbers. It's about justice, equity, and the legacy we leave for future generations. Only by ensuring that every dollar aligns with the priorities of vulnerable communities can we truly deliver climate justice.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.
