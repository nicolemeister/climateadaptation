The complaints of the Aetas were being validated, according to lawyer Roman Antonio, the newly appointed director of the National Commission for Indigenous Peoples in Central Luzon, in a phone interview. AgroforestryShould the lands be titled properties before 1997, Antonio said Section 56 of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, or Republic Act No. 8371, states that indigenous communities should recognize and respect these. In Friday's poverty reduction program launch, Aeta leaders agreed to undertake an integrated agro-forestry program by the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Pampanga provincial government. The agencies would give agricultural support through seeds, seedlings and tools in farm plots within 8 ha inside the Floridablanca National Agricultural School.

But an unclear and short-sighted property rights regime is choking its potential; existing rules are partially to be blamed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forest lands, which are State-owned lands, span 15.8 million hectares or half of the country\u2019s total land area. The 1987 Constitution states that all lands of the public domain, forest lands included, belong to the State. It can either manage them directly or partner with private entities, as long as Filipino citizens own at least 60% of the company involved and these agreements last 25 years, renewable for another 25. This legal framework along with existing policies, designed to regulate the exploitation of natural resources like mining and logging, now constrains investment in regenerative and non-extractive activities such as reforestation and carbon sequestration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHORT-TERM TENURE STIFLES LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS</p><p>The current tenure framework on forest lands does not match the biological and economic realities of forest and carbon development. While fast-growing trees like falcatta can be harvested in six to 15 years, high- value hardwoods such as narra, mahogany, and teak, and famous dipterocarp species like yakal and lauan take 20 to 25 years to mature just for a single-growth cycle. On top of this, renewing agreements can take anywhere from a year to even over a decade, leaving some existing investors in limbo and potential ones at bay.</p><p>A similar challenge exists for green and blue carbon projects \u2014 those that protect or restore ecosystems while capturing and storing carbon dioxide to help fight climate change and generate income through carbon credits. Whether involving tree plantations or mangrove ecosystems, these initiatives typically require project lifespans of 25 to 100 years to generate credible climate benefits and financial returns. However, legal agreements on forest lands remain capped at 25 years, renewable for another 25 years. This mismatch undermines investor confidence and reduces the bankability of carbon projects in the country.</p><p>UNCLEAR OWNERSHIP OF TREES AND CARBON</p><p>Moreover, a fundamental question remains unresolved: who owns the trees, and the carbon sequestered in forest lands? On private land, ownership is clear. On forest lands, however, it is less so.</p><p>Under the Revised Civil Code, ownership of land extends to what is attached to it. But can an exception be made for planted trees and sequestered carbon in forest lands? Can legal ownership of renewable resources be separated from land ownership?</p><p>Current forest tenure agreements generally recognize that tenure holders own the trees they plant, but this recognition is not backed by a stable legal framework. Such uncertainty dampens project sustainability. A more explicit legal separation between land, tree, and carbon rights, therefore, is needed to assure tenure holders, local communities, and investors.</p><p>Other countries offer more progressive models. In Australia and New Zealand, ownership of land, planted trees, and carbon credits can be distinct and transferable. This legal clarity enables dynamic investment flows and long-term planning \u2014 conditions that are lacking in the Philippine context.</p><p>POLICY INSTABILITY UNDERMINES SECTOR CONFIDENCE</p><p>The Philippine government has a history of implementing blanket bans as band-aid solutions to a systemic problem. Since the 1970s, the Philippine government has issued 44 different logging bans. The most far- reaching is Executive Order No. 23 (2011), which prohibits the harvesting and transport of timber from natural and residual forests. While intended to curb illegal logging and promote forest recovery, the policy inadvertently harmed legitimate tree farmers and wood processors, many of whom have ceased operations due to supply constraints. Regrettably, illegal logging persists \u2014 often at a larger scale than what regulated tenure holders could produce. A blanket, reactive approach to forest governance penalizes compliant stakeholders while failing to address systemic enforcement.</p><p>TIME FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT</p><p>A shift in perspective is essential: tree planting and carbon farming are renewable, nature-based practices and should not be regulated under the same legal framework as non-renewable resource extraction, such as mining or fossil fuel development. As environmental priorities, methodologies, and technologies evolve, so too must the legal tools used to manage natural resources.</p><p>The most direct solution would be to amend or repeal constitutional restrictions that limit the duration of tenure on forest lands. But for now, below are low-hanging policy proposals that offer promising solutions:</p><p>\u2022 Legally define carbon rights as separate from land rights, establishing who owns carbon credits and under what conditions they may be traded (Carbon Rights bill).</p><p>\u2022 Legally classify planted trees as personal property, distinct from land ownership (Tree Growing Agreement bill).</p><p>\u2022 Extend the maximum lease period of private lands for foreigners from 75 years to 99 years (amendments to the Investor\u2019s Lease Act). This measure has already been ratified by both the House and Senate and is just awaiting the President\u203as signature. This bill includes agroforestry and ecological preservation as part of the activities that can be undertaken.</p><p>\u2022 Make comprehensive data on forest lands publicly accessible (Integration of forest lands in the national cadastre system).</p><p>Together, these reforms would lay the foundation for a more modern, climate-aligned system of resource governance.</p><p>Finally, there is a need to strengthen the property rights of the indigenous peoples (IPs) as private landowners who can directly enter business with either local or foreign investors. The IPs own vast hectares of land, most of them in the uplands, making them suitable for forestry and carbon-related projects. Their lands are private in nature and therefore they should not be asking for permits or clearances from the State when it comes to the utilization of natural resources in their domains. Moreover, as long-standing stewards of the land, they have safeguarded our forests for centuries, making them natural leaders in forest conservation and management.</p><p>SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS DRIVE SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>Ultimately, tree plantation activities or carbon farming depend on a strong property rights regime. Investors, local communities, and indigenous groups need clear legal assurances that the trees they plant and the carbon they sequester can be owned, traded, and passed on.</p><p>The Philippines stands at a crossroads. It can remain bound by outdated frameworks and miss out on the opportunities of the green and blue economies \u2014 or it can enact forward-looking reforms that align the governance of resources with the demands of climate action and sustainable development.</p><p>Who owns the trees and the carbon? The answer should be just as simple: The person or community who planted and cared for them. The State\u2019s role should be to ensure a clear and stable property rights system that supports responsible stewardship \u2014 not to impose and promulgate outdated rules designed for extractive industries on regenerative, sustainable activities.</p><p>ANGELA ARNANTE is a public policy advocate and is the assistant director of Policy and External Relations at the Foundation for Economic Freedom.</p>", "publisher": "BusinessWorld", "instances": ["The most direct solution would be to amend or repeal constitutional restrictions that limit the duration of tenure on forest lands.

The Accelerated and Reformed Right of Way Act and Lifelong Returning and Development Act should be included as part of the legislative priority agenda for the 20th Congress.</p><p>1. Konektadong Pinoy (KP) bill. This was certified as urgent by the President on 27 Jan. 2025 and passed on third reading by both Houses. This bill will simplify the approval process for data transmission companies by removing the need for a congressional franchise, making it easier for new and existing providers to expand.</p><p>KP is expected to drive investments in digital infrastructure, particularly, in data centers, which are critical for artificial intelligence development and other emerging technologies. It will help strengthen digital connectivity, support innovation, and create more opportunities for private sector participation in the country's digital economy.</p><p>2. An Act Liberalizing the Lease of Private Lands by Foreign Investors. This has been approved on third reading by both Houses and is pending bicameral conference discussions.</p><p>The reform measure seeks to extend land lease limits to foreign investors from 50 years to 99 years and allows the lease for agriculture, agroforestry, and ecological conservation purposes including carbon farming, tree plantation development, and ecotourism. It will help foreign investment without allowing land ownership, which would need a constitutional amendment.</p><p>3. Accelerated and Reformed Right-of-Way Act. This bill has passed the House of Representatives and is pending for second reading approval in the Senate.</p><p>The bill aims to make right-of-way acquisition more efficient and ensure just and timely compensation to affected property owners. This can attract more infrastructure investments which, in turn, would make market access and distribution of goods more efficient, boosts productivity of both business and workers, reduces transportation costs, etc., thereby leading to increased economic growth.</p><p>Congress should maintain economic growth enhancing foreign assisted public works projects in the list of programmed appropriations in the National Budget with assured funding instead of transferring these to unprogrammed appropriations with no definite sources of financing.</p><p>4. Lifelong Learning Development Framework Act. This bill has passed second reading in the Senate, but it is still at the committee level in the House of Representatives. This is a priority bill under the Second Congressional Commission on Education.</p><p>Executive measures. The Executive Department should rigorously implement reforms related to the ease of doing business and improved agricultural production and productivity These include:</p><p>1. Proper implementation and promotion of the CREATE MORE Act. Some key amendments in CREATE More Law include: reducing corporate income tax to 20 percent from 25 percent; extending maximum income tax holiday to 14 to 17 years from four to seven years; and clarifications on provisions on VAT refund.</p><p>2. Improving non-fiscal incentives. Beyond implementing the Ease of Doing Business Law, the government should adopt a customer service-oriented approach. Dubai's 'Golden Visa' program exemplifies this, assigning government personnel to assist investors for a smooth, fast, and streamlined process. A similar system, implemented by bodies like Anti-Red Tape Authority, would greatly benefit investors.</p><p>3. Public-private collaborations in agriculture. This will help improve agricultural production through providing financing, inputs, technology, and capacity building to help equip farmers with business skills. They can also invest in post-harvest handling and processing facilities, such as building cold storage warehouses, processing plants, and packaging facilities.</p><p>In summary, Congress has a brief period from June 2 to June 13, to pass the reforms, which are up for bicameral deliberations, like the KP Bill and extending land lease to 99 years, before it adjourns. For the other pending bills, the President and the 20th Congress should prioritize their immediate passage to help the government reach its economic growth target.</p><p>The President should also pursue reforms that can be done through executive action such as promoting improved fiscal incentives, enhancing non-fiscal incentives, and implementing public-private partnerships to improve the growth of the agriculture sector.</p><p>Gary B.

These forests are not only a critical refuge for the country's vanishing wildlife but are imperative natural defenses against the looming impacts of climate change. They are key to ensuring food security in a country ravaged by centuries of unimpeded logging, mining and deforestation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This also holds true in many countries elsewhere where indigenous peoples (IPs) have long co-existed with their natural environment. This harmonious existence allowed them to develop traditions and customs that recognize the importance of preserving the land and its resources and passing these to future generations. For them, forest preservation is inextricably linked to their very existence.</p><p>That same concept applies in the Philippines. Despite centuries of colonization, many IPs managed to preserve their rich culture, including their mindset and practice of living harmoniously with the land.</p><p>In Apayao province, one of the country's last ecological frontiers, we find the Isnag tribes who developed a unique forest conservation system called lapat. The concept is simple. Once the community elders or chieftains declare a part of the forest as lapat, no one is allowed to forage or hunt there for a certain period. This will allow the forest to regenerate and become a safe breeding ground for wildlife. The period of lapat implementation can vary, depending on the necessity.</p><p>Lapat is not only applied in the forest but also in other natural ecosystems such as rivers. Once a portion of a river is declared a lapat, then fishing in that spot is prohibited until the elders say otherwise.</p><p>The Isnags believe that by implementing lapat, they can sustain their rich forests and rivers, recognizing these as their food sources. Certainly, lapat worked as Apayao remains predominantly forested while its surrounding provinces have been stripped of their primary forests.</p><p>In recent years, researchers have sighted Philippine Eagles and giant Rafflesia flowers within Apayao's remote forests.</p><p>Then there's the muyong system of Ifugao, home to the renowned Banaue Rice Terraces. Muyong is an Ifugao term that translates to forest or woodlot. It can be viewed from various perspectives such as forest conservation strategy, watershed protection or assisted natural regeneration.</p><p>Muyong plots are typically small, ranging from 0.6 to 2.4 hectares, and these are usually situated on hilly terrains and the upper elevations. In Banaue, for example, designated muyong plots lie above the famed rice terraces. This is by no means a coincidence. The inhabitants are pretty much aware that maintaining the forests sustains creeks and brooks that irrigate their rice paddies. These are also important food sources as they host wild fruits, vegetables and wildlife.</p><p>Muyong does not only apply to existing forests, as some locals establish plots in denuded areas. They do so by planting a mix of native and exotic species, usually fruit-bearing trees. Essentially, they can turn barren hills or slopes into thriving agroforestry farms, gradually restoring biodiversity and ecological services.</p><p>Undoubtedly, muyong hugely contributed to the productivity and stability of Ifugao's rice terraces since time immemorial.</p><p>There are many more of these sustainability forest management systems across the country and elsewhere. However, these remain under-appreciated. Whilst government strategies have been focused on adopting Western sustainability models, the IPs have long successfully lived harmoniously with the forest.</p><p>It is high time that our so-called educated leaders listen to indigenous voices and to learn from their time-tested models.</p><p>Sure. Challenges and times have changed. And yes, there is also the need to integrate modern and scientific approaches. But in a lot of cases, the solutions are already there. Concrete examples exist. So when we talk about forest management and addressing climate change and food security, we can always learn from the examples of our indigenous communities.</p><p>Think about it. They withstood colonial attempts and managed to preserve their rich culture and ecological heritage. The forests within their ancestral domains are now critical water sources, supplying communities and cities and irrigating lowland farms.</p><p>Thankfully, there are now emerging platforms, locally and internationally, providing opportunities for these indigenous systems to be communicated and legitimized as concrete strategies for forest conservation and sustainability as a whole.</p><p>But more needs to be done.

Magdiwata towers over this bustling town of about 80,000 people that serves as the center of trade and commerce of Agusan del Sur province.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">San Francisco's old-timers and those who had frequented it long enough could immediately compare the mountain's condition through the years. Today, it is almost lush green, far from the barren landscape that it was more than 20 years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over two decades of protection and restoration work, mainly spearheaded by the San Francisco Water District (SFWD), had made the difference in Magdiwata's ecological health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A recent flora and fauna study done by experts from the Caraga State University (CSU) has established its rich biodiversity, raising its importance for environmental conservation and preservation.</p><p>Reforestation effort began in 1997, after then President Fidel V. Ramos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 282 in 1993 that set aside some 1,000 hectares for a community forest management project and 1,658 ha as Mt. Magdiwata watershed forest reserve, out of a vast reservation assigned to state-owned National Development Co. in 1980.</p><p>At that time, forest cover was only 695 ha, a result of decades of large-scale logging operations from the 1960s through the 1970s, and then timber poaching on the remaining trees in the 1980s to supply lumber-milling plants that proliferated around town.</p><p>The water district took up the cudgels for Magdiwata's protection as the water distributed to households through its pipelines comes from the mountain's springs.</p><p>SFWD general manager Elmer Luzon recalled how they convinced farmers tilling in the upland area to transfer their farms to the buffer zone, located downhill, to give way to reforestation activities.</p><p>These farmers were given technical and financial support to pursue agroforestry through organic farming methods. Their community was then organized to become the 'social fence' that will prevent activities destructive to the mountain and its nascent forest cover.</p><p>More than a decade into the effort, Luzon said they discovered the doubling of water production capacity of SFWD's major spring sources. In 2017, they calculated that four spring sources SFWD had tapped into could supply the needs of up to 12,000 households, including the growing number of commercial establishments then.</p><p>This bolstered SFWD's resolve to protect Magdiwata.</p><p>Last year, SFWD commissioned the flora and fauna study to support the formulation of its watershed management plan.</p><p>'The plan aims to strike a balance between addressing socioeconomic concerns and protecting the environment, while respecting the diverse social and cultural beliefs of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur,' Luzon said.</p><p>The 220-page report, 'Biodiversity Update on Flora and Fauna and the Socioeconomic Study of the Mt. Magdiwata Watershed and Forest Reserve (MMWFR) and Indicative Watershed Management Plan,' came out in December last year, after nearly five months of fieldwork and analysisHome to 'Ibong Adarna'</p><p>The ecological richness of Magdiwata, which has now 97 percent forest cover, came to light in the study done by biodiversity expert Romell A. Seronay, director of CSU's Center for Research in Environmental Management and Eco-Governance, and Nilo Calomot, an environmental science expert at CSU.</p><p>The vibrant Philippine trogon (Harpactes ardens), one of the most colorful endemic birds in the country, which is associated with the mythical 'Ibong Adarna,' is among the many captivating discoveries of Seronay and Calomot in Magdiwata.</p><p>The bird appeared on July 7 last year, when the research team was deep in their fieldwork.</p><p>Calomot, who also serves as a consultant for SFWD, described the presence of the Ibong Adarna species as a symbol of Magdiwata's rich biodiversity. He cited the watershed's ecological role not just as a crucial water source for local communities but more importantly as a biodiversity haven.</p><p>The study described the watershed as a tropical lowland evergreen forest teeming with life, providing shelter to towering trees, rare plant species and diverse wildlife.</p><p>The study found that the forest supports 167 plant species, including rare varieties like Ficus fiskei and Artocarpus blancoi, plants that play vital roles in soil stabilization and maintaining water quality.</p><p>The lush forest floor teems with species such as the poison dart plant (Aglaonema commutatum) and zebra plant (Alocasia zebrina), which thrive in the moisture-rich environment, supporting a range of amphibians and reptiles. Among them are the rare Nyctixalus spinosus, a tree frog, and the venomous North Philippine temple pit viper (Tropidolaemus subannulatus). Vital stopover</p><p>The report also noted an abundance of birdlife on Mt. Magdiwata, identifying 47 bird species within the watershed, of which 29 were endemic to the Philippines.</p><p>Among the most abundant are the Philippine bulbul (Hypsipetes philippinus), whose calls echo through the forest. The diversity of avian life reflects the health of the ecosystem, which also serves as a vital stopover for migrating birds, according to the report.</p><p>Aside from birds, the watershed is also home to 132 species of volant mammals, including fruit bats like Cynopterus brachyotis, which play key roles in pollination and seed dispersal, further supporting the forest's biodiversity.</p><p>The report also documented a diverse array of plant life, totaling 167 species across 61 families and 112 genera in its initial survey.</p><p>The survey highlights the predominant presence of towering tree species, particularly from the Dipterocarpaceae family, including notable species such as bagtikan (Parashorea malaanonan), red lauan (Shorea negrosensis), white lauan (Shorea contorta), almon (Shorea almon), mayapis (Shorea palosapis) and tanguile (Shorea polysperma).</p><p>In addition, researchers also found trees from the Burseraceae family, like Canarium species, that also play a prominent role in shaping the landscape.</p><p>They noted that the dominance of these tall, canopy-forming trees significantly influences the forest structure, limiting the growth of understory species. The understory is primarily made up of plants from the Araceae family, such as the poison dart plant, snakeplant (Dracaena trifasciata), badjang or swamp taro (Crytospermum merkusii), Schismatoglottis calyptrata and uway or rattan (Calamus spp.).</p><p>Ongoing threats</p><p>Most of the plant species identified, so far, are trees that contribute to the high canopy cover throughout the watershed. These are followed by a variety of shrubs, which tend to grow as wildlings around the mother trees of species like tanguile, mayapis, and pili-pili.</p><p>The survey also noted the presence of herbs and ferns, adding further layers of complexity to the watershed's flora that help sustain its ecosystem that, in turn, help regulate water supply for agricultural and domestic use.</p><p>The watershed is home to 15 species listed as conservation priorities by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, including the critically endangered Amboyna wood or Pterocarpus indicus and the vulnerable Aquilaria cumingiana. These species are at significant risk due to habitat loss and illegal exploitation, underscoring the need for ongoing conservation efforts.</p><p>The Mt.

At that time, forest cover was only 695 ha, a result of decades of large-scale logging operations from the 1960s through the 1970s, and then timber poaching on the remaining trees in the 1980s to supply lumber-milling plants that proliferated around town. The water district took up the cudgels for Magdiwata's protection as the water distributed to households through its pipelines comes from the mountain's springs. SFWD general manager Elmer Luzon recalled how they convinced farmers tilling in the upland area to transfer their farms to the buffer zone, located downhill, to give way to reforestation activities. These farmers were given technical and financial support to pursue agroforestry through organic farming methods. Their community was then organized to become the 'social fence' that will prevent activities destructive to the mountain and its nascent forest cover. More than a decade into the effort, Luzon said they discovered the doubling of water production capacity of SFWD's major spring sources. In 2017, they calculated that four spring sources SFWD had tapped into could supply the needs of up to 12,000 households, including the growing number of commercial establishments then. This bolstered SFWD's resolve to protect Magdiwata. Last year, SFWD commissioned the flora and fauna study to support the formulation of its watershed management plan."]}, {"relevance_score": 24, "title": "PHL enhances readiness, participation in global carbon market", "published": "2025-01-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> THE Philippines is enhancing readiness for carbon market mechanisms and is eyeing participation in the global carbon market with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other partners.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking at the kick-off of a three-day policy dialogue as part of the 2nd Philippines-Japan Week on Monday, DENR Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said the Philippines is also working on improving its monitoring, reporting, and verification systems related to carbon trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this connection, the DENR will release information within the first quarter of the year on the 1.2-million hectares of classified forest land as priority investment areas for reforestation, agroforestry, and forest-related development, said Yulo-Loyzaga.</p><p>Yulo-Loyzaga led key Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) officials on Monday in welcoming the agency's counterpart from Japan to mark the 2nd Philippines-Japan Environment Week.</p><p>The event, at the Dusit Thani Hotel in Makati, is organized by the Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan.</p><p>'This event is a testament to our commitment that we formalized in our Memorandum of Cooperation, which we signed in December of 2023.
