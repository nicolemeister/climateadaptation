In a plenary session at the 2024 Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (APMCDRR) on Tuesday, Japan Vice Minister for Policy Coordination Hara Hiroaki shared how the billions of dollars it invested to accelerate disaster risk reduction in the country has reaped fruits. In 2019, Japan was struck by Super Typhoon Hagibis, which left about USD15 billion in economic losses across the country. However, before the disaster, Japan had already been funding a three-year USD50 billion national resiliency plan, which focused on reducing the risk of flooding caused by the rise in river levels, among others. Another initiative was the USD1 billion integrated flood management project for the Abukuma River in Fukushima. The Abukuma River in Fukushima Prefecture underwent extensive reinforcement against flood with the budget of USD1 billion under a three-year plan,\" Hara said.

They have also perfected their programs of Disaster Management for earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, etc.</p><p> Surely, in no time, everything will go back to normal as damage from floods and landslides are already being assessed. As we struggle to normalize things in our disaster-laden country brought about by typhoons, surges not to mention the debilitating traffic, Japan will just jump back in a jiffy.</p><p>    The latest \"hilarious\" news that has kept social media wired up and in a frenzy is that of our palace jester. In fairness to him, he is doing quite a good job in amusing and distracting the people from the more crucial issues.</p><p> Clap! Clap! Clap! Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo was challenged to take public transport from his home to the Palace after saying that there was \"no mass transport crisis\" in Metro Manila. The public became furious with such a statement because of the sacrifice, horror, anguish they experience in their daily commute.</p><p> It's about everything  from the long lines in the terminals due to lack of mass transport, the heat, the stench, the pushing and the fighting in the waiting areas (more often than not shed without roofs), the danger in the jeepneys and buses where drivers run their vehicles like there is no tomorrow and the traffic just about everywhere. And the Palace jester says, \"there is no mass transport crisis\".</p><p> Sanamagan! Does the President really know how his officials are treating us? Why do we feel like we are being treated like pigs or monkeys? Why can't his officials be more civilized? Why don't they even sympathize with the daily agony Filipinos have to go through? Isn't it the job of the government to make us feel secured and protected? Why have our government officials grown so callous? In case Panelo has difficulty discerning, a \"crisis\" is defined as a time of intense difficulty, trouble, or danger a time of confusion, or suffering. It is a situation in which something or someone is affected by one or more very serious problems.</p><p> But then again, I think he was hired to be a Palace jester, so why take him seriously  just ignore him. We are actually barking at the wrong tree.</p><p> Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade and Metro Manila Development Authority should be the ones resolving our problems. They don't need emergency powers.</p><p> They need brains and the will to govern. That's all!    Last November 2016 an official of the Energy Regulation Commission committed suicide because of corruption in his office.</p><p> According to veteran journalist Charie Villa, the sister of the late ERC Director Francisco Villa Jr. his brother was allegedly being pressured to approve procurement contracts and hiring consultants without proper bidding and procedure.</p><p> She said that her brother revealed ERC contracts that were executed even before the actual bidding process. I wonder now if the government had shed some light on those allegations and revelations of corrupt practices in the ERC.</p><p> The case of National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms, Inc., Petitioner, vs.</p><p> Energy Regulatory Commission, et al. Respondents (G.</p><p>R. No.</p><p> 226443), stemmed from the petition for review on certiorari filed by NASECORE assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision dated February 29, 2016 and Resolution dated August 18, 2016, which affirmed ERC Orders dated June 21, 2011 and February 4, 2013. The Court held that ERC's order was in violation of its statutory mandate to approve rates that will provide electricity to consumers \"in the least cost manner.\" Thus, it remanded to ERC the case for determination of a reasonable and fair valuation of the regulatory asset base that will provide electricity to consumers \"in the least cost manner.</p><p>\" In partially granting the petition, the SC found that the ERC failed to properly consider COA's findings as well as to comply with its statutory mandate to approve a rate that provides electricity to consumers \"in the least cost manner\" as expressly provided in ERC's charter. Section 38 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines and Book V, Title I, Subtitle B, Chapter 4, Section 22 of the Administrative Code of 1987 specifically authorizes COA to examine accounts of public utilities in connection with the fixing of rates of every nature.</p><p> The Court said that Meralco and other electricity distribution utilities are monopolies that are regulated by the State, particularly on the rates they charge consumers. The same rationale in regulating power acquisition costs by distribution utilities applies to the allowable depreciation of capital assets by distribution utilities in the present case.</p><p> Supreme Court en banc voided recently ERC's rule allowing Meralco to revalue depreciable assets at replacement cost. The SC ordered ERC to formulate reasonable parameters for depreciating capital assets that will provide electricity to consumers at least cost.</p><p> This unanimous decision was penned by Justice Antonio T Carpio. By the way, if you remember, Justice Carpio is one of the longest-serving SC justices who declined his automatic nomination for chief justice.</p><p> In the words of Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, \"Senior Associate Justice Carpio is the best top magistrate that the country never had.\" Let's rejoice that we can still hope for justice in this chaotic country of ours with people who stand firm by their principles in life.</p>", "publisher": "The Philippine Star", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 63, "title": "Safety and security", "published": "2019-10-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what is the fate of Oscar Albayalde on his alleged involvement with the \"ninja cops\"?

They allegedly presented another Chinese, identified in earlier reports as Ding Wengkun.</p><p> At the Senate inquiry, PNP-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group Benjamin Magalong and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) chief Aaron Aquino accused Albayalde of intervening in the case. The two retired police officials said Albayalde called up to ensure that the cops would be spared from being axed.</p><p> In addition to these accusations, former Central Luzon police chief Rudy Lacadin directly implicated Albayalde by saying that the former chief did not only try to influence the outcome of the investigation but also admitted partaking in the drug loot. Of course, Albayalde denied all the allegations and rejected calls for his resignation but a few days after, he stepped down as PNP chief.</p><p> Last Friday, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee and the justice committee recommended the filing of criminal charges against Albayalde and the 13 cops. Will El Presidente save Albayalde from this mess? After the PNP, what's next for the former chief? Will he be given a new position like the others? Abangan!    The magnitude 6.</p><p>3 earthquake that hit Mindanao last week, gave us another wake-up call.

Five persons were reported dead and dozens injured.</p><p> Badly hit was Magsaysay town in Davao del Sur, the earthquake's epicenter. According to local disaster management officials at least 30 people were reported injured.</p><p> In Davao Occidental, Harry Camoro, officer of the provincial disaster risk reduction and management said the coastal towns of Malita and Don Marcelino became ghost towns minutes after the quake. As of press time local officials in affected areas are still assessing the total cost of the damage inflicted by the earthquake.</p><p> The City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office reported that SM Ecoland, SM Lanang, and Abreeza suffered \"significant damages\" while school buildings are under inspection in Davao City.

In every natural or man-made disaster, the firemen and their equipment will always be the front liners.</p><p> The training of firemen is the key to managing risk reduction and ultimately prevention. So, what is happening? It scares me to think that in many remote places there is not a single fire truck with the right equipment and trained firemen.</p><p> How many fire departments must a city or a town have? How many fire trucks? How many trained firemen? Let's get our act together!    Until our leaders change their perspective of safety, the condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or injury and security, the state of being free from danger or threat (against criminal activity), we will continue to endanger and lose more lives.

That Saturday, Oct.</p><p> 12, we were scheduled to travel on Japan's Shinkansen from Osaka to Hiroshima, but because it was a long holiday weekend (Monday was Health Sports Day) and the typhoon had made landfall, train stations were packed with travelers. We managed to change our reservation of non-reserved seats, which allows you to sit only in particular cars on the train, to reserved seats on the JR West Line, and redeem the tickets on vending machines.</p><p> Leaving behind a wet Osaka on the Shinkansen traveling below its 300 km/hour and a bento box for lunch, the experience couldn't have been more Japanese.

The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, located in the park where the ruins of the Atomic Dome stand, is a somber reminder of the horrors of war  but it is also a reminder of how a city can rise, literally, from the ashes.</p><p> The park is beautiful with a river dividing it, it is lively with music, people, dogs being walked, and above all this is a certain kind of quietness. Perhaps out of respect for those who died, for the city that was decimated.</p><p> In a dimly lit room in the museum and laid on black exhibit tables are clothing, shoes and hats worn by people in Hiroshima that day. In contrast, on the ground floor where sunlight streams through glass walls was a special exhibit of drawings by survivors, first collected in 1974 after a 77-year-old man walked into a radio station and showed what he had drawn, his recurring nightmare three decades after the bomb dropped.</p><p> In 2002, the radio station again called for survivors to submit and they now total 3,500. There are drawings of corpses floating in the river, of people fleeing the flames, a father carrying the body of his son wrapped in a straw mat  but because they are made with colored pencils and crayons, we are reminded of what that day left behind as if through the eyes of children. Seeing these, I loved Hiroshima even more and felt like I was there for the first time.</p><p> Outside the city is a town called Takehara, which is often compared to Kyoto but with fewer tourists and a little quieter. Houses from hundreds of years ago still stand, many of them converted into restaurants, boutiques, bakeries, shops that sell souvenirs and teach you to make bamboo windmills (a tip: bring cash, they don't accept credit cards).</p><p> A ferry ride away is Rabbit Island where the rabbits outnumber the people living there by 300 percent (there are 30 human residents and 1,000 or so rabbits). The rabbits are all over, sleeping, playing with each other, waiting for tourists bearing food and cameras.</p><p> OSAKA SO FUN</p><p> If Tokyo has Shibuya, Osaka has Dotonbori  this crazy fun district of restaurants, cafes, shops and the neon Glico Running Man. On Dotonbori bridge there's always that one person holding a sign for \"free kisses\" and a hundred more taking pictures with the neon billboards in the background.</p><p> What really amuses me about this area are the extravagant signs on the restaurants  a giant octopus for takoyaki, a cow for yakiniku, giant sushi and sashimi  you don't even have to look at the menus to know what they're serving, you just have to look at what's dangling above your head. To see just how sprawling Osaka is, head to Harukas 300 Observatory (ticket was included in our JR West package).</p><p> Best time to go is late afternoon to catch the city in daylight, sunset and nighttime from the 60th floor. Then there's Universal Studios Japan (USJ), which is unlike any other Universal Studios in the world just because of the Japanese's love for dressing in costumes.</p><p> Halloween was three weeks away when we were there but I had never seen so many people wearing headbands of a cleaver slicing their heads or a shark eating them. USJ has the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, so set aside a full day to enjoy it all.</p><p> Don't miss Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which is ranked as the World's Number One Ride for five consecutive years. With ultra-realistic images of your fave characters, it feels like you're in Hogwarts alternately playing Quidditch and battling Dementors.</p><p> The Three Broomsticks restaurant has two kinds of Butterbeer  frozen and regular (the frozen gets my vote). Choose to dine al fresco because you have the lake and Hogwarts Castle in the background.</p><p> It was a long fun day in the park and when others wanted to stay on till closing time, it was easy for me to get back to Namba alone. I had my ICOCA card and, as Hermione would have me do, I waved a wand and alohamora'd (unlocked) my way back to the city.</p><p>    For more information and to book tours and attractions, visit www.klook.</p><p>com.
