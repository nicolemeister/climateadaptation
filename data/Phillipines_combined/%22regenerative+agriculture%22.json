Apparently, it has been a Western system taught to us, even if we are a tropical country. We do not have winters, and with our tropical climate we are better off planting perennials, not annuals. We also can make soil using our ruminant friends, or our grass-eating animals. There are small ruminants like rabbits, bigger ones like goats and the biggest ones which are cows. He passionately explains how ruminants eat grass and have microbes that are perfect for soil-building.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Make soil? Yes, we can make soil using the 'lasagna method' of alternating green and brown natural substances in a one-meter by one-meter space. He mentions grass, leaves, cuttings and cardboard, manure and other brown things. We did this at our little farm and I have been enjoying a bounty of fruits since we started this practice, including the spraying of BD or biodynamic spray every new moon. Sounds weird? This is how we go with what Nature gives us. Free sunlight, free water (from rainfall), free organic matter and so we get free soil.</p><p>This soil is the best for compost while vermicast is perfect as a potting medium for seeds. You can also buy garden soil, potting soil and vermicast separately, depending on what you need to do - sow seeds, add to plants or fertilize soil.</p><p>But know that you can make soil if need be. I saw Al Linsangan in Coron Natural Farms also make a one-meter cube with wire as guide, and he just dumps leaves and brown matter and as the organic matter decomposes, the soil gets compacted and compressed, leaving more room to add organic matter on top. And you just keep doing this, until you have built enough soil for your planting needs.</p><p>I also know of people who throw seeds in any area with soil. After eating fruits, you can dispose of seeds in a vacant lot, as long as there is earth. If those fruits are organic, the seeds will sprout and before you know it, you will have a seedling. That happens with coffee fruits which are not harvested on time. They fall, they sow in soil and soon you have what we all 'wildlings' - planting material which just grew on its own, not in a manicured nursery or breeding medium. Though one is not sure what the resulting tree would be, it nevertheless will be a tree.</p><p>But to do things more properly, guided by man's knowledge and experience, we look for the best trees to get the best seeds. The tree which fruits a lot should be a good target to get seeds from. Seed breeders, however, really break down the genetics of seeds and retain only the good parts and remove the ones which they think the market does not like. And we always use soil to plant these seeds and not solutions or hydroponics.</p><p>Nicolo is also a fan of grass, root crops and biodynamic components which make healthy soil. But he believes the soil and its ecosystem is not complete without livestock, the way Nature planned it all along. You need to have ruminants (rabbits, cows, goats, carabaos) that eat the grass because they will then produce microbes that they excrete with their manure. It is not the grass that makes the organic material, it's the microbes in the manure that they produce which is beneficial to the soil and makes it organic. Interesting, is it not?</p><p>I have not yet tried having livestock and have just gotten a few chickens for our egg requirements. The goats my brother sent to me were sent back because they pick on our coffee trees. Cows will be the next ruminant of choice, but I still have to prepare myself for these guys. Nicolo suggests rabbits, too, as ruminants for small farms and this is why many entrepreneurs have also gone into raising rabbits as a business.</p><p>But whatever you decide to get as partners in organic fertilizer production, always think of how soil is a living thing made up of microbes, worms and organic substances. There are plants that may need some river sand, carbonized rice hull and garden soil for growing. And fertilizers can also be made as mentioned above and this production makes everything around it bears fruit like crazy. The coffee trees near our compost pit have shown us the difference - with thicker foliage, plenty of fruits and a healthier look.</p><p>It is what you feed the soil that is the secret sauce. Just like with people, it is what we eat that makes us look younger and healthier. It's not the superficial face creams, or the facials and treatments we get, but what is inside us. And that is a reflection of what we eat. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of whole foods - fruits and vegetables, hopefully organically-grown.</p><p>The components to make soil are in your kitchen. I keep a bucket or two (suggested by biofertilizer expert Olive Puentespina) and discard fruit and vegetable peel, anything organic like banana leaves and even brown substances like cardboard in this pail and we sprinkle a compost filler to prevent it from smelling bad until I fill it up and take it to the backyard or the farm. There, it combines with other composting materials which heat up under a tarpaulin cover. Our farm guys turn the 'soil' every so often until it is ready for use and it has lots of wiggly worms underneath and inside the soil. You have just made earth, your own soil from discards in your kitchen.</p><p>The next time you see a recycle bin, you know where it's going. Don't give it to the garbage truck. Instead, make your own soil. And just leave the garbage - the other unnecessary garbage like white paper, plastic, meat, shellfish - for the trucks to collect for landfills.</p>", "publisher": "The Philippine Star", "instances": ["I recently had an interesting interview with Regenerative Agriculture practitioner Nicolo Aberasturi and he gave me some insights about why we till the soil.

Michael or Mike Melendres started Melendres Farms after graduation from UP Los Ba\u00f1os, and started with that one kilo he tried to peddle in Manila's central market. At the time, customers said they had no need for organic vegetables. But Mike persisted and persevered in his venture because he knew about food safety. He knew organic is the only safe way to consume vegetables and fruits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As his farm grew, demand also increased for organic produce, making him look for other farmers who had the same farm practices. He also taught farmers how to make compost and other techniques to be able to produce organic vegetables profitably. As he was less of a teacher and more of a farmer, he aligned with other experts who formed a service company that teaches farm management, organic and regenerative agriculture. With the added number of farmers learning his organic ways, Mike set up another company to help scale up the distribution of the produce he could now access from other farmers whose practices he could vouch for as truly organic.</p><p>As more people became interested in organic farming and landowners approached him to make their real estate productive, this service company trained farmers and landowners in organic production. Earthman, as he calls this group, was tasked with just teaching and training. Mike was slowly creating a vertically-integrated system, from production to training and distribution.</p><p>Good, clean and safe food is his mantra. Because Mike knows that if agriculture used chemicals and pesticides, he would not be producing food that is safe for human consumption. He is into safe ways, non-use of preservatives and anything that may adulterate food. Because of his focus on safe food, he had to do something about our staple food which is rice. He was fortunate to find partners who had a Japanese technology of preserving rice through fermentation and again, not with the use of artificial preservatives.</p><p>Being mindful that the rice value chain is already mature, he knew that the only way to enter the rice chain could only be through innovation. But what can you do to innovate on a product as everyday and ordinary as rice?</p><p>The next chapter of his organic journey took him to rice production, and Biotech JP in a joint venture allowed him to produce rice for different dietary concerns. This is the specialty market in rice that gives added value and helps many people with diet limitations. He has a low-protein rice which is prescribed for those with measured protein intake (e.g. kidney patients with protein-limited diets) and for diabetics, they developed a low sugar, lower calorie cooked rice product. The production line allows him to also make normal pre-cooked rice for those who have a need for healthy rice in remote settings (e.g. camping expeditions, disaster relief, etc). The rice products come in convenient special packaging that you can toss in the microwave or dip in boiling water. I am sure nutritionists will soon be knocking at his door to try these products made from real rice and not from a root crop or other carbohydrate sources. In fact, the rice they use is RC160, which is a collaboration between the Japanese and Philippine rice strains - thus, it is soft like the premium Japanese rice or like Tubigan, an inbred rice variety developed by PhilRice.</p><p>What I really like about what Mike is doing is that he is consistently and continuously finding ways to produce safe food. He says that what we actually need to focus on is food safety not just food security. What use is food if it is not safe and eventually causes people to suffer from lifestyle or chronic diseases?</p><p>This is why he started his business producing just organic food. And knowing how much chemicals and pesticides can go into traditional food production, he chose the path less traveled - the organic route. He is hopeful that organic demand will steadily rise as it has risen over the last 20 years. As more people become aware about the importance of eating clean and safe food, he has adjusted his target to sell one million kilos of organic vegetables a day, and not just a year. It is a pretty audacious goal but he is unfazed. From one kilo to one million kilos in a year, Melendres will carry on until he achieves his goal to have a healthier nation.</p><p>He is very busy attending to the many areas of the business as he runs the whole system of integrated companies. Today he is looking to add export markets for the innovative rice products which is already being shipped to Slovakia. With all the certifications in hand, he is looking at expanding the exports to organic conscious countries like those in Europe and Australia.</p><p>Does he see organic demand rising and ever-increasing? He says a loud yes as he has his hands full with production of vegetables and to help the Filipino consume more vegetables to keep up with minimum nutritional requirements. The Filipino per capita consumption of vegetables must increase and vegetables are also a cheaper way of fulfilling healthier caloric requirements, as long as they are organically-grown.</p><p>Mike has come a long way from just setting up his humble Melendres farm 20 years ago. He teaches other farmers and landowners, he also can include your production in his distribution network and he will carry on with selling the idea of organic farming to get more farmers to plant cleaner, safer food for all.</p><p>Kudos to Mike and his team for making sure he reaches more households, especially when he already produces one million kilos of organic vegetables a day!</p><p>Let's be mindful not just about food security, but about food safety.

The project also aims to encourage farmers to implement regenerative agriculture in their farm practices to ensure sustainability of their production. Regenerative agriculture refers to the use of various practices such as intercropping, cover cropping and composting to rejuvenate soil health and reduce wastage as well as carbon emissions. The goal is in line with the corporate vision of Nestl\u00e9 of sourcing at least 20 percent of their green coffee beans from farmers practicing regenerative agriculture and 50 percent by 2030 until it becomes 100 percent by 2050.

But in a place that is as rocky as Coron, Palawan and with thin top soil, how do you do that? Well, Al Linsangan III of Coron Natural Farms may have the answer and the example to copy, even for challenged areas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Al has always been in tourism and I got to know him as a sustainable tourism advocate some 12 years ago when we had a seminar in Coron. He also ran tours around the islands and would often be challenged by food supply, which had to be imported from Puerto Princesa and even as far as Baguio. Almost everything in Coron had to be sourced from the outside as locals claimed the island was built on rock and could not support agriculture.</p><p>Though admittedly making mistakes the first few years as he tried conventional agriculture, chemicals and pesticides included, Al did not give up. Some three years after making many errors in planting, he went around and studied how others did it. He then became a convert of Regenerative Agriculture, making his own soil, mulching and in the process also discovering heirloom and local seeds. He also took a few courses online with University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) on Permaculture and Organic Agriculture. When I visited his farm two years ago, I saw the results of his perseverance and dedication.</p><p>Coron Natural Farms sits on three hectares of land, but he needs only 15 square meters to show how one can grow 30 varieties of vegetables and fruits for a cycle menu which includes sinigang, tinola, pinakbet and salads. He also dedicated just 3,500 square meters for rice as he had waste water from three fish ponds that he did not want to just leave as waste. The waste water from fish ponds was rich enough for rice to grow in. He redirected the water to a rice field within his property. Last I saw, he had a rice field, fish pools, soil mounds and free-range chickens running around a fenced but 'exposed to the sun' area.</p><p>All these did not happen overnight. Al started with just pots, growing lettuce one pot at a time. If you are successful, a few pots can give you a variety of lettuce. Next to a number of pots, he started the 15-square meter plots with different varieties of vegetables. He now calls this his 15x30 model. A singular unit can feed a family and can save a group about P4,500/month if you grow your own food, considering today's vegetable prices.</p><p>Al had his share of mistakes and he always reminds us to not give up but to also moderate your passion. He claims that once you start growing your own vegetables, you can tend to be overly excited and scale up immediately. He warns us to just stick to what vegetables you love to eat, so you never have to think of commercializing or scaling up to sell, as scale brings about the problems most farmers encounter. You tend to want more produce, want to sell, want to find more buyers and end up being frustrated. For him, he only plants what his family can consume and what his business of day tours requires. Call it simple self-sufficiency.</p><p>When the pandemic and lockdowns happened, Al's farm model was tested and it succeeded with flying colors. His 15x30 model provided food for his family and his community. They also could harvest fish, rice, eggs and chicken. Institutions like Kansas State University got wind of it and helped spread the word to at least 41 communities, households and families who now use this system of 'self-sufficiency.' Even SEARCA, a research institute from Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna, helped spread the word about Al's successful model of farming.</p><p>You can imagine how one can just sit around while waiting for the vegetables to grow and fruits to come at the right season. Al says you can actually do this - sit around watching Nature do its work. But he would rather get more inspired to do a little more. He is now making a 1,000-square meter model to be a small sample of his three-hectare property. Since many urban areas merely have pocket gardens, he also developed his city rooftop to be a demo site for container gardening and tower gardening, today's examples of urban agriculture. So, he has tried a micro model using pots and is now doing several models for every space requirement or limitation.</p><p>And Al is not stopping just yet. He not only brings tourists to dive spots and beaches in Coron, he also brings them island hopping. Today, he has added Coron Natural Farms as a tour destination for almost anyone who may be interested in sustainable food production and sustainable tourism. Tourists now can pay to visit his farm, where they can learn about permaculture, natural farming and building soil.</p><p>I asked for his tips for being good and green. He emphasizes growing the food you love to eat. He also believes in trying it small first, then growing the space later and ever so carefully and slowly. And last but not least, to do it with your first end in mind - which is to simply be self-sufficient, and not for competitive commerce. He does other activities for the cash flow, but he can surely grow his own food and naturally, at that.</p><p>Being a Tagbanua or a Palawan native, he imitates the forest for his plants and the ocean waters for his fish. No pesticides, no chemicals, just being inspired by Nature and copying how the oceans and the seasons behave, ever so gently. And never going hungry for your favorite food.</p>", "publisher": "The Philippine Star", "instances": ["Al has always been in tourism and I got to know him as a sustainable tourism advocate some 12 years ago when we had a seminar in Coron.

They're changing farming by using a method called syntropic farming, which mimics nature's balance. They grow various crops like coconuts, bananas, and cacao in their forest. This approach is both sustainable and profitable. By leading syntropic farming in the Philippines, they're not only producing food, but also showing how nature and farming can work together for a better future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">READ: Tuning into nature: Meet the Bukidnon couple pioneering syntropic farming in the country</p><p>Inspired by Ernst Gotsch, a Swiss geneticist and farmer who developed the idea of syntropic farming, Marvi and Rogen share the benefits of this agricultural approach. At its core, this approach taps into nature's regenerative processes. The foundation of syntropic farming lies in the principle of syntropy, the accumulation, and organization of energy.</p><p>Syntropic farming practices</p><p>Syntropic farming encompasses a range of practices designed to foster resilience and sustainable growth. Syntropic farming operates on the principle of syntropy, which embodies life's innate drive to gather and organize energy, fostering a harmonious and flourishing order within ecosystems. This accumulation of energy is exemplified through the diversity and intricate interconnectedness of species, strengthening the ecosystem's resilience. Drawing inspiration from the natural ecological composition and structure, this method coordinates the gradual growth of plant species in a sequence that emulates nature's adaptive patterns, ensuring sustainable development and ongoing rejuvenation.</p><p>Constant Soil Cover. A cornerstone of syntropic farming is the practice of maintaining consistent soil cover. This is achieved through the strategic presence of organic matter and densely planted crops. This practice offers a multitude of advantages, including protection against erosion, moisture retention, and the nurturing of essential soil microorganisms. The result is a healthier and more conducive environment for plant growth.</p><p>Biomass production. Intensive management techniques, such as regular pruning and mowing. By prioritizing this practice, the system generates substantial organic matter. This, in turn, enriches the soil, fostering the conditions for robust plant growth and development.</p><p>The spatial arrangement of plants. An integral aspect of syntropic farming involves the meticulous spatial arrangement of plant life to ensure harmonious growth. For instance, taller and more established trees can be strategically positioned to provide shade and shelter for smaller, sun-sensitive plants. This could also involve placing ground-cover plants beneath taller crops, which helps prevent soil erosion, retains moisture, and suppresses weed growth. Moreover, in a syntropic farming system, the spatial arrangement could include planting nitrogen-fixing plants near crops that require high nitrogen content, thereby enhancing soil fertility naturally.</p><p>This careful synchronization of plant placement optimizes the utilization of available resources. Moreover, it minimizes competition among plants, leading to a balanced and flourishing ecosystem where each organism thrives without interference.</p><p>The transformational impact of syntropic farming</p><p>Self-sufficiency. One of the standout advantages of syntropic farming lies in its ability to create self-sufficient ecosystems. By harnessing the inherent capabilities of diverse plant species, this method minimizes the reliance on external inputs. Each plant contributes to various ecosystem functions, resulting in a balanced and self-regulating environment. This self-sufficiency not only reduces the need for external resources but also encourages a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system.</p><p>Biodiversity. The deliberate arrangement of diverse plant species not only enhances the ecosystem's overall resilience but also facilitates increased productivity. The symbiotic relationships formed between different plants contribute to the optimization of resources, leading to improved yields without resorting to excessive use of chemicals or synthetic inputs.</p><p>Soil restoration: The practice actively contributes to restoring soil fertility and health. The continuous addition of organic matter, facilitated by the decomposition of plant residues, replenishes soil nutrients and promotes the growth of beneficial microorganisms. This gradual enhancement of the soil's vitality results in improved soil structure, water retention, and overall ecosystem stability.</p><p>Syntropic farming offers a promising alternative approach to agriculture by aligning with nature's regenerative patterns, it presents a holistic and sustainable method. In a world challenged by environmental concerns, the principles of syntropic farming can guide us toward a more harmonious coexistence with the environment.</p><p>Photo courtesy of Anitu Food Forest</p><p>Read more about farming and gardening at agriculture.com.ph</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

Because these commercial preparations are free or donated, the tribal people readily use them, much to the demise of age-old natural methods.</p><p>What is interesting to note is that these come free along with tools like pruning shears, but many do not come with the instructions for use. So a fertilizer is used inappropriately and produces foliage or leaves, but without fruits or flowers! They have shears that have rusted due to lack of knowledge on maintenance of these simple tools. So our trainers recommended they clean them with a natural vinegar solution (fermented banana is like alcohol) to disinfect pruning shears that they can wear on their belts. The shears must be disinfected between plants as diseases can spread when these are used without disinfecting. Simple. Efficient. Old world knowledge that has worked since the beginning of time.</p><p>We visited three tribes in the hinterlands of Bukidnon and what a revelation even for us, as trainers for coffee production and processing, that old reliable methods such as organic composting sounded so new an idea to these upland dwellers. They can actually make their own compost, their own pest controllers from madre de cacao leaves, garlic, onions, pepper and ginger. Similar to concocting a mix for sawsawan (dipping sauce), farmers can actually make their own tonics, teas and solutions of what works in their farm. Now that's sustainability in the real sense of the word.</p><p>They excitedly took down notes, asked a lot of questions and were very open to learning the new 'old' stuff that natural farming is composed of. The answers to their challenges were right under their noses, so to speak. We got leaves and animal manure from around the area and taught them how to 'turn' the compost to make sure a micro-biome develops in the mound we started.</p><p>Note that there is no electricity in most of these upland communities and they rely only on solar power for simple lights, and there also is no WiFi signal to communicate with the rest of the world. So our trainers take the trek for almost an hour, unless a 4x4 vehicle is available. That is how far away they are from basic necessities, and sustainability really means going back to what their ancestors used to do. Make your own compost, grow your own food.</p><p>We shared about basic knowledge on fertilizers - NPK for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium - and what the numbers on sacks of fertilizers meant (e.g; 14-0-0, 14-14-14 and other variants). We shared how honeybees need to be around flowers and how they can pollinate crops, and why biodiversity is important.</p><p>If you think about it, these are 'old world' information, but clouded by so much information from the internet or sales agents who sell their 'wonder' products to the NGOs who support these IPs, and what you get is a confused datu (chieftain) who cannot tell what is old truth and what are new ideas about increasing yield of trees and decimating pests and insects.</p><p>But I would like to think we built trust between our trainers and the IP communities we visited. Firstly, we were not there to sell them anything - just old ideas that can be used in their farms. We were there to show them how to use the pruning shears to better the condition of their trees and make mulch in the process. We showed them how easy it is to not depend on commercial preparations but on stuff they can get from their own backyards. Self-sufficiency is the order of the day. And that was much appreciated, as seen in their level of interest as we conducted the 'Train the Trainors' program. The chieftains set their egos aside and listened to what we had to say.</p><p>Ultimately, we did not teach them anything like rocket science. It was simple information to grow their own food, care for their coffee trees and make their own fertilizers and pest control sprays. And they brought in women and the youth to listen in so they can learn together. Maybe what we said was starting to make sense because they participated in all the activities, including a first time 'coffee tasting' session. They now are excited to 'taste' the results of our experiment - to use organic and natural methods, to prune their coffee trees and finally to sort their produce and make sure they only produced quality coffee.</p><p>I managed to buy some green coffee to roast back home so we can send them their coffee as roasted by us. And they can compare our roast with what they are used to serving at the tribal hall - sometimes a watery brew made from old ground coffee powder, sometimes a brew that had a 'diesel' or petrol after taste. It's time they tasted what potential good taste their coffee has.</p><p>I wanted to learn as much from them as they wanted to learn from us. As we learned about their culture, they learned about today's coffee market preferences. As we learned to partake of their native snacks like boiled sweet potato and cassava boiled in coconut milk, they also tried donuts and fried chicken our sponsors brought for lunch. It was a true exchange of yesterday's culture and today's food and drinks. But what is common and has not changed is coffee.</p><p>I look forward to seeing them again to check what they have applied among our many suggestions to make their coffee sustainable, organic and a premium product.</p><p>That's what we have to do - one sitio at a time, one community at a time.</p>", "publisher": "The Philippine Star", "instances": ["You may think Indigenous Peoples (IPs) or cultural communities may already have innate knowledge about organic and natural farming.

Because when things get complicated, we realize we need to go back to the basics.</p><p>For many years now, we have been grappling with climate change, which has turned into a global crisis that is affecting food and water security, biodiversity, and life itself. The degradation of our forests and decline of ecosystems, which are our own doing in a bid to fast track modernization, is becoming a serious concern as future generations may have to live less of these natural resources.</p><p>While many of us opted to live in modern cities, our indigenous peoples have lived in communion with nature.

Dr. Jabez is a passionate advocate of circularity and permaculture because he sees what industrial farming has done to our environment. How does he see all this? He is a drone operator, a licensed one, who sees how human behavior has changed the landscape of cities and adjoining towns.</p><p>He can see how Metro Manila is like a big 'gash' that, like a wound, is enlarging to include nearby towns in its being 'citified' - removing trees and natural flora and fauna because of urbanization.</p><p>He tells us that he is scared we are losing our greenscapes fast and soon we will have to go farther and farther from the city to be with Nature. A drone is used in his case to study migratory patterns of people, which includes use of cars and other polluting vehicles. Where people keep moving in droves, farms and agriculture areas disappear.</p><p>So, as a scientist, Dr. Jabez encourages people to help Nature repopulate forests and farms through permaculture design. Working with Nature will ensure the biodiversity we need to keep the climate cooler for starters.</p><p>Aside from drones that look at cities from above, Dr. Jabez also looks at the ground below. Water tables are getting polluted because of chemicals seeping through the soil from runoffs. In Laguna, for example, they have found arsenic in the soil and water system. Arsenic is colorless and is invisible to the naked eye. But it is toxic and this can infect water systems like a virus.</p><p>But do the people know? They don't know their local water sources are slowly killing them. Thanks to people like Dr. Jabez who went the extra mile to have their community water tested. Have you tested your water at home? Or do you just resign and buy mineral water from outside? Maybe it's time you did what Dr. Jabez did - test your water.</p><p>Everyday I hear stories of communities becoming less agricultural because of changes in people's habits. The advent of technology can also be responsible for our declining interest in agriculture. Children these days prefer to look at gadgets than at the phases of the moon or the magic of sunrise and sunset.</p><p>It used to be that people marked the setting of the sun as a signal to say start walking home from the forest. The setting of the sun also meant it was time for supper or dinner. Sunrise was a signal to start our day in the fields and start walking to school.</p><p>But today kids use the alarm clock on their gadgets, then read the news on the same device. It truly has changed how we run our lives.</p><p>So, how do we correct the continuous decline in forest areas, decline in the interest in agriculture and general non-interest in growing our own food? We have to nurture kids who have a penchant for science and encourage them to discover new creative ways to return Nature to what it used to be. We have to develop curiosity in children so they can experiment, discover and maybe find new ways to restore Nature to how it was before. Curious students will become the scientists we so need to correct the damage our past generations and today's generation are causing further and continuous harm to Nature.</p><p>It takes a scientist with a heart to care about his community and Mother Nature in general. And thanks to people like Flores we may just save our farms from being infected by bad water and save our forests by constantly viewing them from above, using his drones.</p><p>Where does passion start and science begin? Dr. Jabez started with coffee and actually started a coffee shop in Laguna. But that is not how I met him. I met him because he graced the graduation of our Organic Agriculture class in December and learned about his interest in drones - not to pry into people's lives, but to use it to know what we can do to restore balance and harmony in Nature. I really admire his use of technology to benefit science.</p><p>If you want to hear more from Dr. Jabez, tune in to our podcast where he discusses how we can all benefit from thinking of and being with Nature.</p>", "publisher": "The Philippine Star", "instances": ["To understand what permaculture is, a visit to the UP Open University permaculture garden in Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna is a good start.

Since there is a risk of erosion, they practice no-till farming to reduce this risk and avoid damaging their soil ecology.</p><p>Instead of planting high-maintenance crops, they planted improved grasses like Mulato II and Mombasa. Improved grasses are low-maintenance and can thrive by themselves after four to eight months.</p><p>Mulato II is grazing-resistant, drought-tolerant, shade-tolerant and low-maintenance, while Mombasa may not be as grazing-resistant it is still just as useful and beneficial.</p><p>Maximized Soil Cover. Before planting the improved grasses, cut weeds were evenly distributed on the pasture to suppress the growth of non-palatable weeds. Additionally, native cover crops like Centrosema and pueraria were sown in their pasture to aid in nitrogen-fixing.</p><p>Centrosema and pueraria are legumes and help the soil increase in fertility over time. Other native vegetation and herbaceous plants are left alone to thrive in the pasture.</p><p>Diversity. Terra Grande Farms mimic a natural forest with seven layers of vegetation. Four hectares of the farm is used as their pasture area. It is then divided into nine paddocks that are 2500-4000 sqm each. Each paddock has a capacity of 200 goats for three days, and has a one month rotation period.</p><p>Instead of clearing all the pasture areas to achieve full sunlight, they planted shade-tolerant grasses in order to utilize areas that are partially to fully-shaded and could not support native grasses and vegetation.</p><p>They have primary and secondary canopy layers that include mango trees, coconut trees, Gmelina (Gmelina arborea), narra, buri palm, and other native trees.</p><p>Shrub layers include madre de cacao, bagalnga (Melia dubia), lagnob (Ficus septica), alingala, alagasi, niyog-niyogan, and other forages for our goats. While they still have space to add more shrubs like oranges, lemons, or berries, they hold off on it because the goats will inevitably eat and mow down edible vegetation.</p><p>Living Roots. Continuous living roots are essential in regenerative farming. Aside from temporal consideration, roots should occupy different strata in order to maximize soil capacity.

In these practices, a system is created for water to be captured and used when needed.</p><p>As a civil engineer, Silvano used his knowledge and understanding of water resources management and applied it in the farm to maximize water resources.</p><p>Balance. Balance should be achieved during planning and design. Data collection, experiments, and refinement must be done throughout execution in order to discover the balance needed to achieve the goals of the farm.</p><p>The buildings, nursery, and pasture areas of Terra Grande Farms are well-designed for the number and breed of goats they intend to raise. If they did not seek balance, then they would have had to address problems such as overgrazing or undergrazing at the pasture, as well as overstocking at the goat house where problems including abortion, fast spread of a disease, and other management problems may occur.</p><p>Harmony.

For instance, we are seeing these climate fintech firms introduce eco-friendly investment opportunities such as green bonds, responsible investment funds, and financial backing for projects that cut down carbon emissions.</p><p>Another major development in global sustainability practices is the acceleration of disclosure preparation regarding the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in the EU and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US. The CSRD has expanded the range of companies that are required to disclose what sustainability measures they have adopted and implemented. It is said that thousands of additional companies in Europe are now being obliged to disclose detailed information on how their operations affect the environment, social matters, and how they manage related risks and opportunities, thus influencing them to rethink their sustainable strategies. On the other hand, the US SEC had advanced proposals on rules on climate-related disclosures that are expected to increase accountability and encourage more sustainable business practices. These regulations signal a paradigm shift where sustainability reporting moves from being a voluntary, often inconsistent effort, to a standardized and enforceable requirement.</p><p>Another global trend is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for sustainability, which sustainability specialists project will be further amplified in 2024. Because of AI\u2019s potential to optimize resource use, and improve energy efficiency, the call for its use in sustainability practices has expanded with the belief that it can contribute to significant reductions in environmental impact.

Regenerative agriculture aims to restore the natural ecosystem functions of the land by enhancing soil organic matter, improving soil structure, and promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms. Cover cropping and fallowing are two practices that can be used in regenerative agriculture to achieve these goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">READ: Regenerative agriculture may be the answer to degrading soil conditions</p><p>Cover cropping is a farming technique that utilizes certain crops with the primary purpose of covering the soil rather than generating income and profits. These crops are usually grown during the off-season or after the main crop has been harvested. The most common cover crops in the Philippines are legumes such as mungbean and cowpea. Cover cropping is an effective way to maintain and improve soil health, and it has become increasingly popular in sustainable agriculture practices.</p><p>Fallowing is a land management practice that involves leaving farmland idle or without crops for a period of time in order to allow the land to regenerate and recover its fertility. Fallowing is a strategy to manage soil fertility, as soil nutrients can become depleted over time because of the continuous cultivation of land without rest or replenishment. By leaving the land to fallow for a period, it allows natural processes to replenish soil nutrients and improve soil health.</p><p>Cover cropping and fallowing are both practices that aim to improve soil health and productivity. However, cover cropping may be a more sustainable and beneficial practice than fallowing for these reasons:</p><p>Soil health</p><p>Cover crops improve soil health by adding organic matter, improving soil structure, and promoting healthy soil microbial communities. One of the main ways that cover cropping helps in the conservation of nutrients is by reducing soil erosion. When soil is left exposed, it can be easily washed away by rain and wind, taking important nutrients with it. By growing cover crops, soil erosion can be greatly reduced, as the plant roots hold the soil in place and the plant canopy helps minimize the force of raindrops hitting the soil.</p><p>Cover crops also help in nutrient conservation by improving soil structure and increasing organic matter content. As cover crops grow, they take up nutrients from the soil, and when they are terminated and left to decompose, the nutrients are released back into the soil, making them available for the next crop. Cover crops also help increase soil organic matter, adding nutrients to the soil. Organic matter also improves soil structure, allowing for better water infiltration and nutrient uptake.</p><p>In contrast, fallowing can lead to soil erosion and reduced soil fertility. This is because fields left to fallow fields may lack the protective cover of vegetation, making the soil vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Soil erosion is the process of the wearing away and removal of soil by natural forces or human activities. This erosion can wash away valuable topsoil and nutrients, leaving the soil less fertile than before.</p><p>Weed suppression</p><p>Cover crops compete with weeds for resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight. By growing vigorously using these resources, cover crops can outcompete and reduce the growth of weeds. While some cover crops have tall and dense foliage that can shade out weeds, preventing them from getting enough sunlight to grow. Moreover, certain cover crops, such as sunn hemp, produce chemicals that can inhibit the growth of weeds. These chemicals, called allelochemicals, are released into the soil and can prevent weed seeds from germinating or stunt the growth of nearby weeds.</p><p>Compared to fallowing, leaving the field with no crops can lead to an increase in weed populations as crops are not actively suppressing them.</p><p>Pest management</p><p>Cover crops can provide habitat for beneficial insects that prey on crop pests, reducing the need for synthetic pesticides. Cover crops can attract beneficial insects such as ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which feed on and control harmful insect pests. These insects can help to reduce the populations of pest species naturally. With fallowing, pest populations may increase because they are not being controlled by any pest management practices.</p><p>READ: Introduction to Integrated Pest Management, Part 4: Biological management practices for pest control</p><p>Biodiversity</p><p>Cover crops provide a diverse and complex habitat for a range of beneficial organisms such as pollinators, birds, and beneficial insects. These organisms play a crucial role in controlling pests, improving soil health, and promoting crop yields. Furthermore, cover crops can enhance soil health by increasing soil organic matter, improving soil structure, and suppressing soil-borne diseases. Healthy soils can support a wide range of microorganisms and other organisms that contribute to overall biodiversity. In fallowing, biodiversity is reduced since there are no crops to support a diverse ecosystem.</p><p>Given these, cover cropping is a more sustainable and beneficial practice than fallowing as it improves soil health, suppresses weeds and pests, and enhances biodiversity.</p><p>Read more about farming and gardening at agriculture.com.ph</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.
