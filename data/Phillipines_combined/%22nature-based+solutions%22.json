NbS evolve from that natural state and are both nourished by and support their environment. </p><p>Take a mangrove forest - it's not a building block or standalone solution like a sea wall, but a living system that's dependent on abiotic factors such as river flow and sediment and connected with other biotic factors such as coral reefs, fish, and other species.  </p><p>For example, in most cases, you should not plant a thin strip of mangroves before a sea wall, as it is likely to be eroded from behind by wave energy reflected from the wall.  </p><p>To function well, mangroves in a coastal protection scheme should have the ability to \"move\" as they are part of a dynamic system. Also, to survive and grow with sea-level rise, the trees will require a continuous water flow that delivers sediment, nutrients, and freshwater. </p><p>The second impediment concerns governmental regulations on coastal protection, for example specifying the requirement of an offshore breakwater in Vietnam. These vary by country and by region. Overturning these rules can be challenging, even when breakwaters interrupt the natural sediment supply from the sea to the coastline. </p><p>We have also seen the request for mangroves within a project, only to discover what the client really wanted was a concrete sea dike with a park, or guidelines on how to build walls within the mangrove forest. The mangroves merely ticked the proverbial green box and played no significant role in the coastal protection scheme. </p><p>Third, the availability of land remains an issue, particularly where areas suitable for planting mangroves are close to a city or agricultural areas.  </p><p>Mangroves can grow naturally, but land must be turned over for this, either seaward or landward. Seaward can be difficult if the water depth is too deep for mangroves to grow. When it's landward, councils, farmers, and local landowners are often hesitant to surrender their land, especially when it's an important source of income. This means that financial compensation schemes are required. </p><p>Understanding the ROI </p><p>Consequently, the biggest obstacle preventing mangroves from flourishing beyond pilot projects is financing, despite many projects paying for themselves when you calculate their overall economic impact. After all, mangroves dampen waves, which means that the sea dike can be lower or will last longer. Lower sea dikes mean less use of materials and lower construction costs. From that alone, the project can already be financially feasible. </p><p>The impact on local communities can be profound. Jobs are created in seed collection, planting, and maintaining the forests, and maintenance is ongoing just as it would be for a dike or sea wall - a cost often neglected. Fishermen also benefit. In a project in Pakistan, locals reported a threefold increase in their fishing and crab catches. In a project in the Mekong, involving the restoration of wetlands and a flooded forest, a modest one percent increase in the fish catch would be enough to justify the entire cost of the restoration project. </p><p>Like most NbS, mangrove projects rarely fit accepted ROI models, and those making the investment are not necessarily the people who benefit most. Furthermore, even when it leads to substantial cost savings, such as dispensing with the need to heighten sea walls, cautious engineers often fail to place their faith in the natural solution. </p><p>Overcoming the barriers </p><p>We must first appreciate that mangroves and other NbS are different. They are living systems. Implementing them necessitates an understanding of the biotic and abiotic systems and how they work with each other. Partnering with an NbS expert with experience in mangroves and local conditions is obvious but vital. </p><p>Another priority is ensuring stakeholders factor in the social value of the NbS as an additional economic benefit. The precise calculation and how to communicate it need to be simple for investors and communities to determine the actual ROI. </p><p>Finally, we need better blueprints or design guidelines for implementation. Engineers require them to be as prescriptive as possible - not an inspirational catalog but detailed how-to guidelines. Such as what kind of mangrove trees? At what height? What sort of flow, sediment, and bed depth? Formulae to correlate the size and age of the mangrove strip with its wave-dampening efficacy, and how that translates to a percentage reduction in the height of a sea wall or a decrease in the buffer level. Then, how does that translate into dollar or euro savings? The guidelines are needed for the whole project cycle, encompassing design, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance, including guidance on economic opportunities and stakeholder processes. </p><p>Offering firm guidelines for banks and engineers to incorporate into their standards is the way forward. The same specificity should apply to other NbS, from developing salt marshes to oyster beds. </p><p>Nature is a powerful ally. However, we need to increase our understanding of natural engineering and articulate the social and financial benefits. Only then will mangroves and other NbS turn from pilot projects into full-scale coastal defense strategies. </p><p>Petra Dankers is the leading professional for nature-based solutions, and Jasper Leuven is a coastal engineer and nature-based solutions specialist with a focus on the APAC region at Royal HaskoningDHV, the international engineering consultancy.

As we celebrate this year's International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystems, we at the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) invite you to shift our focus to these valuable natural resources and extraordinary models of resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the most recent estimates of the FAO in 2020, our region has the largest extent of mangroves globally. It is said that the ASEAN region is home to around 40 per cent of the world's mangrove forests, where at least 47 of the 70 known mangrove species globally can be found in an estimated total area of 4.5 million hectares. Indonesia alone has about 24 per cent of the world's mangroves. If Lao PDR were not a landlocked country, we would probably find mangrove ecosystems in every ASEAN nation.</p><p>This is both an asset and a responsibility for us in the ASEAN region. Mangrove ecosystems, often dubbed as 'rainforests of the sea,' deliver invaluable services from which we benefit. Mangroves serve as breeding and feeding grounds for local terrestrial and aquatic species and act as 'stopover sites' for migratory bird species. In addition, mangroves also contribute to ecological balance by stabilising and reducing sedimentation and siltation in coral reefs, while promoting land expansion through accumulated soil and debris. </p><p>Furthermore, especially amid the climate crisis and extreme weather events we are experiencing, mangroves act as frontline defenders, shielding communities from storm surges, high waves, storms, and tsunamis. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that mangroves protect more than 15 million people and around USD 65 billion worth of properties annually from coastal disasters. Additionally, they function as vital high-capacity carbon sinks. It is estimated that mangroves can store 11 billion tonnes of carbon, thrice the amount stored by tropical forests of the same size. Mangroves also provide other social and economic benefits, such as food sources, supporting local livelihoods, and providing areas for rest and recreation.</p><p>Unfortunately, large mangrove areas have declined due to human activities and natural climate change-related events. In addition to their exposure to frequent and extreme weather events, studies also show that rising sea levels have become a primary threat to mangrove ecosystems. Without any action, one-fourth of the world's mangrove area is expected to be submerged in the next 50 years. We are at the brink of seeing almost half of our mangrove ecosystems collapse, washing away all the benefits we enumerated earlier. </p><p>Considering all these and the urgent need for regional collective action, the Member States have adopted the ASEAN Strategy on Sustainable Mangrove Ecosystem Management in 2024. Presented by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of Indonesia, in collaboration with the ASEAN Senior Officials on Forestry, this comprehensive strategic framework embodies a shared vision of enhancing the resilience and vitality of mangrove ecosystems across the ASEAN region. It adopts a holistic approach that integrates science, policy, community engagement, and international cooperation. In addition, the ASEAN Flyway Network and the ASEAN Mangrove Network have been established to promote regional collaboration in rehabilitating mangroves, wetlands, and other threatened natural resources in the region. They also serve as venues for sharing best practices and lessons learned in ecosystem restoration.</p><p>Aligned with these initiatives, the ACB, as a technical and scientific cooperation support centre for the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM GBF), actively works with the ASEAN Member States on mangrove conservation, specifically on achieving Target 2 and Target 3 of the KM GBF. Target 2 aims to ensure that by 2030, at least 30% of degraded ecosystems, including mangroves, are under effective restoration. Meanwhile, Target 3, '30\u00d730' goal aims to protect at least 30% of the planet's terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas by 2030. These goals call for establishing effectively conserved, ecologically represented, well-connected, and equitably governed systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures.

For example, Indonesia, with 23% of the world's mangrove area, is firmly committed to mangrove conservation and restoration. From 2019 to 2023, Indonesia, through several funding sources, rehabilitated around 70,000 hectares of mangrove forests, and from 2024 to 2025, they will rehabilitate a large-scale mangrove area of about 600,000 hectares. By 2018, Malaysia planted 6.62 million seedlings across 28.74 square kilometres through 13 coastal erosion prevention and rehabilitation initiatives. On the other hand, Viet Nam planted 19.68 square kilometres of protected coastal forests in 2015. As part of its National Greening Program, the Philippines mapped 500 square kilometres of mangroves and beach forests for development, planting, and enrichment. In addition, the Philippine Master Plan for Climate-Resilient Forest Development 2015-2028 is estimated to yield more than 300 million tonnes of net carbon benefits from avoided deforestation and new plantations of mangrove forests and watersheds. In Singapore, the National Parks Board collaborated with the OCBC Bank in establishing the OCBC Mangrove Park in Sungei Durian on Pulau Ubin.

The choice of Biliran as initial site for their company's reforestation program has been strategic, he said, \"because that is one of the provinces recurrently visited by strong typhoons, so that is symbolic in our quest for solutions to climate change risks.

He explained that the carbon offset of Shell is done via global trading, so these are offered even to offshore corporations - and most takers are companies from the United States and Europe that have been purchasing carbon credits for environmental, social and governance (ESG) compliance or to fulfill their net zero goals. Typically, they will buy carbon offset, so for the issued certificates, they can use that for tax reduction and will also support them in their net zero targets,\" he pointed out. Del Valle conveyed \"for our nature-based solutions, we have two types of offers - B2B and B2C. For business clients, we have been doing that under Shell Fleet Solutions. For example, if a company buys 100 liters of diesel for its fleets, there's computation of the carbon emissions for that. And whatever that computation is, the company can buy certificates to offset its carbon emissions for that fuel usage - and that's where Shell can help. And for B2C or individual customers, they can also buy carbon offset certificates from Shell when they will fill up their vehicles at the company's mobility stations. They don't have tax reduction, but it is something that they will do for the environment and to help solve the global dilemma of climate change, and there's growing number of customers who are really environmentally conscious, especially the Gen-Zs,\" he stressed.", "For business clients, we have been doing that under Shell Fleet Solutions.

Del Valle qualified that prior to the Biliran tree planting, Shell's issuance of carbon credit certificates is being done by leveraging on its international network of nature-based solutions, including tree planting and reforestation ventures in Indonesia and China. At Shell, we have partners around the world to do reforestation. We've just started last year our tree planting in Biliran. But globally, we've been doing it for a long time already - like in Indonesia and China, we've been doing it for the last 10 years,\" he stated. For the Biliran tree planting, he highlighted that Shell's approach had been science-based and that was concretized via partnership with Australian university that has expertise in forestry. How we do the tree planting is really science-based - like the distance of the trees planted are concretely measured, what is the terrain needed and what is the overall ecosystem of the environment; then it's also location-based, so those are all analyzed when we choose a site for our tree planting,\" he specified.", "At Shell, we have partners around the world to do reforestation.
