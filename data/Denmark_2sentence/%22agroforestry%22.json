The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match\u2014a leader in oral nicotine delivery\u2014creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands.

As of June 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35.4% of PMI\u2019s total 2023 second-quarter net revenues.

Projektet ROBUST er lavet i et konsortium med K\u00f8benhavns Universitet, Center for Frilandsdyr, Skovdyrkerne, Them Andelsmejeri, Sinatur Hotel og Konference og fire \u00f8kologiske landm\u00e6nd. Det er en stor anerkendelse af skovlandbrug som dyrkningsmetode, at GUDP, under Milj\u00f8- og F\u00f8devareministeriet, og F\u00d8L har bevilliget projektet, der skal udvikle og fremme skovlandbrug i Danmark.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00d8kologisk Landsforening vil sammen med de \u00f8vrige 10 projektpartnere udvikle, unders\u00f8ge og udbrede skovlandbrug i Danmark. En af m\u00e5ls\u00e6tningerne er at dokumentere effekten af skovlandbrug p\u00e5 de v\u00e6sentligste gr\u00f8nne parametre som: kulstoflagring i jord og vedmasse, kv\u00e6lstofudvaskning, naturv\u00e6rdi, konkurrence med afgr\u00f8der, foderv\u00e6rdi af l\u00f8vbiomasse og dyrevelf\u00e6rd, samt at modellere effekterne af at udbrede skovlandbrug p\u00e5 en st\u00f8rre national skala og unders\u00f8ge de produktions\u00f8konomiske effekter. Sidel\u00f8bende vil der blive udviklet og etableret fire nye \u00f8kologiske skovlandbrug, og forretningspotentialet for produkter herfra vil blive belyst ned gennem hele v\u00e6rdik\u00e6den fra prim\u00e6rproducenter til forarbejdnings- og afs\u00e6tningsvirksomheder.</p><p>Skovlandbrug er et forholdsvis ukendt dyrkningssystem herhjemme, og der findes ikke mange studier af systemet, der dokumenterer potentialerne under danske forhold. Udenlandsk forskning har dog vist, at skovlandbrug har potentiale til at levere p\u00e5 produktion, dyrkningssikkerhed, natur, biodiversitet, dyrevelf\u00e6rd, jordbundskvalitet, klima og vandmilj\u00f8. Ligeledes indeholder systemet muligheder for at finde nye fodermidler og g\u00f8re landbruget til leverand\u00f8r af r\u00e5varer til fiber, energi- og byggeindustrien.</p><p>Dermed taler skovlandbrug direkte ind i de forventninger, der er til fremtidens landbrug - nemlig et produktivt landbrug i pagt med klima og natur, hvor det kan rykke gr\u00e6nsen for, hvordan der skabes samspil mellem drift og natur, og hvor der er fokus p\u00e5 bredden og kompleksiteten af de ydelser, som landbruget kan og skal levere i fremtidens samfund.</p><p>\"Der er brug for at \u00e6ndre de produktionssystemer, vi kender i dag. Vi skal ikke bare have mere af det samme. Vi skal have nye l\u00f8sninger, der l\u00f8ser b\u00e6redygtighedsproblemerne mere grundl\u00e6ggende, vurderer Mette Kronborg, som er projektleder p\u00e5 ROBUST og tilf\u00f8jer: Skovlandbrug er ikke l\u00f8sningen p\u00e5 alt, men det vil givetvis kunne v\u00e6re en del af de l\u00f8sninger, som kan g\u00f8re landbruget mere b\u00e6redygtigt.\"</p><p>Projektet l\u00f8ber frem til juli 2024 og har et samlet budget p\u00e5 16.6 mio. kr., som udover midler fra GUDP og F\u00d8L, udg\u00f8res af egenfinansiering fra de enkelte projektpartnere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fakta:</emphasis></p><p>Skovlandbrug er det danske ord for, hvad man p\u00e5 engelsk kalder agroforestry.

Skovlandbrug er alt andet end d\\xC3t. I skovlandbruget er den endimensionelle arealanvendelse p\u00e5 fladen skiftet ud med et tredimensionelt landbrug, der ogs\u00e5 ser potentialerne i h\u00f8jden og i dybden. I stedet for ubrudte markflader vil vi se en mosaik af r\u00e6kker og felter, der integreret i hinanden b\u00e5de rummer tr\u00e6er, buske, dyr, gr\u00f8ntsager og korn.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yderligere info/cases:</emphasis></p><p>Mette Kronborg, Skovlandbrugskonsulent, 51900915</p><p>Marendine Ladegaard, pressemedarbejder, 20164434</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Projektpartnere:</emphasis></p><p>\u00d8kologisk Landsforening v/Mette Kronborg</p><p>K\u00f8benhavns Universitet, Inst. for F\u00f8devare- og Ressource\u00f8konomi v/ Professor Henrik Meilby</p><p>K\u00f8benhavns Universitet, Inst. for Geovidenskab og Naturforvaltning v/ Studieadjunkt Rasmus H.
