We increased our Key Client order intake and have further expanded our Global Excellence Centers to enhance project delivery and support our teams worldwide. Margin performance was strong while making substantial strategic investments to position us well for future growth and drive further cost efficiencies. Large contracts\u2019 ramp up, a concluded UK Spending Review and the commencement of the water cycle AMP8 have positioned us well for growth in the second half of 2025. While some uncertainty around market dynamics remains, our healthy backlog and pipeline give us confidence in our future.

This was largely offset by a softer UK market, where revenues declined by 8% year-on-year due to the delayed outcome of the government\u2019s Spending Review. In addition, a pause in Australia\u2019s infrastructure market and a shift in our US Environment business towards a higher quality portfolio also weighed on overall growth.</p><p>Total backlog was supported by significant order intake from clients in Pharmaceuticals, Data Centers, Energy Transition, US Water, and Rail, offsetting contracts winding down in US Environmental Restoration, Semiconductors and Mobility clients in UK and Australia. </p><p>We are well positioned for growth in the second half of 2025, supported by the ramp-up of large contracts, increased UK spending, and improved market stability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OPERATING EBITA MARGIN</emphasis>Operating EBITA margin was 11.3% for the quarter, up from last year\u2019s underlying margin of 10.8% after adjusting for the \u20ac6.6 million Middle East provision release. Margin improvement was supported by strategic levers, including the expansion of our Key Clients program, now representing 67% of Net Revenues (up from 59% last year) and a rise in Global Excellence Centers\u2019 contribution to 15% (from 13% last year), with headcount now at 5,100 and preparations for the opening of our new center in Bucharest, Romania underway. Continued project selectivity, combined with ongoing investments in people and digital platforms, supported further efficiency gains. We remain on track with our strong margin trajectory towards the 12.5% target for 2026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REVIEW OF THE HALF YEAR 2025</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROFIT &amp; LOSS ITEMS</emphasis>Net revenues totaled \u20ac1,937 million and were stable on an organic basis year-on-year. The operating EBITA margin was strong at 11.1% (H1\u201824: 11.1%&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;). Non-operating costs were \u20ac31 million, driven by right-sizing and restructuring efforts mainly in the UK in the first quarter. Net finance expenses decreased to \u20ac20 million (H1\u201824: \u20ac23 million), mostly driven by on average lower interest rates on loans and borrowings. Net income from operations decreased by 4% to \u20ac121 million (H1\u201824: \u20ac126 million), or \u20ac1.35 per share (H1\u201824: \u20ac1.40). </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BALANCE SHEET &amp; CASH FLOW</emphasis>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 68 days at the end of H1\u201925 (H1\u201824: 66 days). Net Working Capital as a percentage of annualized quarterly gross revenues was 13.4% (H1\u201824: 12.7%), with a strong June revenue performance driving up the receivables position. Free cash flow in the quarter was a positive \u20ac2 million resulting in \u20ac-136 million for the half year (H1\u201824: \u20ac-88 million), in line with seasonal trends and impacted by \u20ac26 million higher cash out versus last year as 2024 benefitted from lower cash taxes in the US, and we made prepayments for Q4 2025. Net debt increased to \u20ac1,039 million (H1\u201824: \u20ac1,016 million) leading to a Net Debt / Operating EBITDA ratio of 1.8x (H1\u201824: 1.9x), well within the strategic range of 1.5-2.5x. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RESILIENCE</emphasis></p><p>(38% of net revenues) in \u20ac millions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half Year</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Second Quarter</emphasis></p><p>Period ended 30 June 2025</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change Net revenues7267270% 358 373 -4%Organic growth&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;2.7%8.6% 1.5%9.0% Operating EBITA&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt; 103 93 10% Operating EBITA margin (%)14.2%12.8% Order intake 802 809 -1% 327 361 -9%Backlog net revenues 1,041 1,048 -1% Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;7.0%8.5% Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;6.9%8.3%</p><p>Strong growth in Energy Transition in Germany, Climate Adaptation in the Netherlands, and Water Optimization in the US was partially offset a temporary slowdown in the UK due to delays in the AMP8 cycle not offsetting reduced infrastructure-related environmental work. Strong backlog development was supported by large framework contracts renewed at the start of the year, and underpinned by key wins in Water, Energy Transition, and Nuclear. In the UK, revenue from AMP8 Water contracts is set to gradually increase, with orders starting to be called off at the end of the second quarter. Additionally, our expanding Energy Transition backlog is expected to support near-term revenue growth. The margin benefited from disciplined project selection and effective cost management. Significant investments in talent for Energy Transition and in AI-driven Water solutions further strengthens our position to capture growth opportunities in these markets. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PLACES</emphasis></p><p>(36% of net revenues) in \u20ac millions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half Year</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Second Quarter</emphasis></p><p>Period ended 30 June 2025</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change Net revenues706751-6% 352 377 -7%Organic growth&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;-3.0%0.8% -3.2%2.7% Operating EBITA&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt; 64 77 -17% Operating EBITA margin (%)9.1%10.3% Order intake 747 850 -12% 383 467 -18%Backlog net revenues 1,616 1,575 3% Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;5.5%0.1% Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;1.9%5.1%</p><p>Net revenues were impacted by delays in major capital expenditure decisions from Industrial Manufacturing and Property &amp; Investment clients, which was partially offset by strong performance in the US Pharmaceutical and Data Center sectors. The acquisition of KUA in Germany further enhanced our position in the high-growth Data Center sector. Solid order intake was supported by a significant US Pharma win, driving near term growth. Furthermore, the conclusion of the UK Spending Review and substantial European government spending plans are enhancing pipeline opportunities with Key Clients in areas such as housing, defense, transport hubs and healthcare, positioning us well for the second half of the year. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOBILITY</emphasis></p><p>(24% of net revenues) in \u20ac millions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half Year</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Second Quarter</emphasis></p><p>Period ended 30 June 2025</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change Net revenues4594346% 2322186%Organic growth&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;0.0%7.7% 1.8%7.1% Operating EBITA&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt; 48 45 6% Operating EBITA margin (%)10.5%10.5% Order intake 468 491 -5% 241 218 10%Backlog net revenues 892 642 39% Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;39.7%16.0% Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;1.0%10.3%</p><p>North America delivered a steady performance, supported by the planned ramp-up of large US and Canadian projects secured last year. Overall, results were tempered by the delayed outcome of UK\u2019s Spending Review and a pause in Australia\u2019s infrastructure market. However, we ended the quarter with significant rail contract wins in Netherlands, Canada and the UK. In Germany, integration of the WSP Rail acquisition is progressing well and unlocking new growth opportunities. The benefits from rightsizing initiatives in the UK and Australia, implemented in the first quarter, are expected to become more evident in the coming quarters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTELLIGENCE</emphasis></p><p>(2% of net revenues) in \u20ac millions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half Year</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Second Quarter</emphasis></p><p>Period ended 30 June 2025</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2024</emphasis></p><p>change Net revenues4647-1% 2324-2%Organic growth&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;0.4%4.3% 1.2%1.7% Operating EBITA&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt; 2 5 -48% Operating EBITA margin (%)5.2%10.0% Order intake 37 44 -15% 25 20 22%Backlog net revenues 98 121 -19% Backlog organic growth (%, yoy)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;-12.4%6.1% Backlog organic growth (%, ytd)&lt;sup&gt;1)&lt;/sup&gt;-12.9%-2.3%</p><p>Revenue was driven by our Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) solutions, which supported key rail clients in North America, as well as strong demand for our Tolling and Travel IQ products in the US.

This was reflected in low provisions, low impairments and loan-to-value ratios at 53% at the end of 2024. All in all, this indicates continually high credit quality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The development in total home finance lending in the Danske Bank Group across mortgage and bank home loans was stable. Housing market activity started the year at a relatively weak level, however, over the year, Realkredit Danmark experienced an increase in activity. We expect that, among other things, the decline in interest rates will have a positive effect on the housing market in 2025, with decent price increases of 4-5% broadly across Denmark.</p><p>In the commercial market, we continued to have a strong market position. The loss level is low and there was an overall increase in lending in 2024. After some years with low transaction activity, where the interests of buyers and sellers have been difficult to align, we experienced renewed optimism in the market in 2024, which gives rise to expectations of a positive trend in 2025.</p><p>We have strengthened our advisory services and financial solutions within home finance across bank and mortgage finance products as part of the Danske Bank Group\u2019s Forward \u201928 strategy, and this was well received by our customers in 2024.</p><p>For both the private and the commercial segment, Realkredit Danmark and Danske Bank further strengthened the focus on contributing to the green transition. In the private segment, we expanded our collaboration with the OBH engineering consultancy firm so that customers can now also get advice about climate proofing of homes. In the commercial segment, we entered into partnerships with one of Europe\u2019s largest architecture and engineering consultancies, Sweco, and climate tech company Comundo, and our customers can now more easily get an overview of energy data and receive the right advice to improve the energy efficiency of their properties.</p><p>Towards the end of 2024, we also strengthened our collaboration with Tryg, and our partnership will in future focus even more on the necessary climate adaptation. All people in Denmark currently have access to home financing and home insurance, but if we want to maintain that level of protection in Denmark, it is crucial that climate adaptation is given even greater priority.\u201d</p><p>The report is available at rd.dk. Highlights are shown below:</p><p>In 2024, Realkredit Danmark\u2019s net profit was DKK?4,424 million (2023: DKK?4,394 million). The topline increased, driven by higher interest rate levels, although the increase was partly offset by normalised loan impairment charges. Income rose significantly driven by the higher interest rate levels. Fee income increased driven primarily by trading margins from higher refinancing activity. Expenses amounted to DKK?1,010 million in 2024 (2023: DKK?1,055 million). Credit quality remained strong with a low level of delinquencies and robust collateral. Loan impairment charges were at a normalised level and amounted to DKK?333 million in 2024 (2023: an income of DKK?114 million).After declining lending activity in early 2024, we experienced a slight recovery in the second half of the year. Relative to 2023, there was a decrease in total lending. Nominal residual mortgage debt at Realkredit Danmark fell by around DKK 12 billion to DKK?795 billion at end-2024. We are continuing our efforts to digitalise mortgage financing processes, support advisory differentiation and use intelligent data-driven processes to support a personal and proactive customer approach tailored to specific needs and lifecycle events.The green transition is an important focus area for both private homes and commercial properties. For private homes, we expanded our collaboration with consulting engineering company OBH, so that the customers can obtain advice on climate adaptation in addition to advice on energy improvements.

The water sector, which accounts for almost 2% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions, is answering the call with ambitious strategies to deploy advanced technology to cut the sector\u2019s carbon footprint.1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A recent survey of more than 100 utilities by water technology company Xylem (NYSE: XYL) showed that 75% of utilities have set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals that they plan to achieve by 2040 or earlier, with 48% having set a specific net-zero emissions target.2 As highlighted in Xylem's new paper, Net Zero: Utilities Setting the Pace on Decarbonization, these targets reflect growing momentum across the water sector in the fight against climate change.</p><p>Water and wastewater utilities are often the largest power users in cities and can generate powerful methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Leading utilities are deploying replicable approaches that any community can use to cut emissions from their water systems and make their communities more water secure. Xylem\u2019s research shows how these experiences can serve as a framework for achieving rapid and lasting emissions reductions across the sector:</p><p>&lt;ol&gt;Prioritize energy efficiency for quick wins: Pumping, treatment, and distribution processes consume large amounts of electricity. Energy-efficient technologies can deliver immediate decarbonization results across the sector. For example, Scottish Water has deployed high-efficiency smart pumping systems that cut energy consumption by 40% and reduce unplanned maintenance costs by 99%.Combine net zero and climate adaptation efforts: By uniting greenhouse gas reduction and resilience strategies, utilities can fast-track decarbonization and adaptation. In Santiago, Chile, Aguas Andinas is turning wastewater into renewable energy through anaerobic digestion. By converting organic waste into biogas, the utility generates energy onsite to cut emissions, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and enhance energy security for critical water treatment processes. These measures, combined with purchasing renewable energy and finding efficiencies, have enabled the utility to reduce GHG emissions by 25%.Manage emissions across all operational processes: Utilities are adopting an end-to-end approach, addressing emissions across all operational processes, from energy generation to wastewater treatment. After reaching net energy neutrality in 2023 with renewable sources such as solar and hydropower, Ruhrverband of Essen, Germany, is deploying advanced sensors to monitor and address nitrous oxide emissions and leveraging artificial intelligence to identify further emission reduction opportunities.&lt;/ol&gt;</p><p>The research highlights how water utilities are adopting cutting-edge solutions \u2013 from smart pumping systems to digital monitoring tools \u2013 to reduce emissions, optimize performance, and extend the life of critical assets. It shows that utilities have a wide variety of tools to help them reach net-zero targets faster and more efficiently.</p><p>\u201cBy deploying advanced technologies, we can make our assets work harder and smarter,\u201d said Nathan Wield, Wastewater Operations West Manager for Scottish Water. \u201cNot only does this improve efficiency, but it also prolongs the life of our equipment, reduces service disruptions, and improves our overall environmental impact.\u201d</p><p>Alexis de Kerchove, Senior Director, Client Sustainability, at Xylem, said, \u201cInnovative utilities are demonstrating that water sector emissions are a solvable problem \u2013 and that net zero can be a catalyst for optimization, delivering positive social impacts and cost savings. By scaling these approaches, the entire sector could reach net zero faster than previously imagined.\u201d</p><p>To read the Xylem Net Zero paper, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.xylem.com/en-us/campaigns/net-zero/\">https://www.xylem.com/en-us/campaigns/net-zero/</url>.</p><p>About Xylem</p><p>Xylem (XYL) is a Fortune 500 global water solutions company that empowers customers and communities to build a more water-secure world.

At the same time, we raise our full-year guidance to a profit after tax of DKK 11.00-11.75 billion. This means that we expect profit for 2024 to exceed profit for 2023, which was Nykredit's best year so far. For the fourth consecutive year, we are set to deliver our best full-year performance to date, which only goes to show that Nykredit is stronger than ever. The final full-year financial results will in part depend on the global economic outlook, which is impacted by a generally tense geopolitical landscape that continues to add some uncertainty about the economy and our operating conditions.Our good performance is chiefly driven by continued growth and increasing market shares across the board. Over the year, Nykredit Bank has grown its lending volumes to personal and business customers alike, and the Group has increased its mortgage lending to homeowners and business customers. Furthermore, Wealth Management's assets under management have increased. Our performance also reflects the sound financial health of our customers, leading to a reversal of impairment charges for the period. Moreover, we have managed to maintain a relatively steady cost/income ratio.During the period under review, financial market tailwinds had a positive impact on the Group's investment portfolio income, leading to a satisfactory return on equity. We benefited less than our competitors from the higher interest rate level, as mortgage lending accounts for a significantly larger part of Nykredit's business volumes than banking. At the same time, we have chosen to lower the cost of borrowing for our customers to reflect Danmarks Nationalbank's interest rate cuts during the year. Thanks to our good results, Nykredit and Totalkredit are well placed to support our customers and foster development and growth all over Denmark.In Nykredit Bank, we have reduced the interest rates on a number of loan products by 0.75 percentage points during the year. We see this as the right thing to do as a customer-owned bank. We therefore offer attractive interest rates on both deposits and loans, especially for home purchases, energy renovation and climate adaptation. In early 2024, we raised the KundeKroner discount on customers\u2019 administration margin payments on mortgage loans to 0.20% from 0.15%, which has made it even more attractive for our Totalkredit customers to finance their homes with us.

In his address to COP 29 delegates, Hon. Asterio Appi, Nauru\u2019s Minister for Climate Change and National Resilience, presented the innovative financing initiative as an opportunity for conscientious investors to acquire an additional citizenship while contributing to climate adaptation and sustainable development projects in the South Pacific.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Minister Appi highlighted the program\u2019s broader impact: \u201cNauru, like many South Pacific nations, plays an outsized role in protecting globally significant biodiversity. Our ecosystems support more rare, endangered, and threatened species than those anywhere else on Earth. Yet we stand on the frontlines of climate change, facing rising sea levels, intensifying storm surges, and accelerating biodiversity loss. The consequences of global warming are rendering Pacific Island states increasingly uninhabitable. By choosing Nauru\u2019s citizenship program, investors aren\u2019t merely securing their own future \u2014 they\u2019re investing in the future of our planet.\u201d</p><p>The UN has repeatedly stressed that access to finance, and in particular climate finance, is a critical enabler to help Small Island Developing States (SIDS) achieve their Sustainable Development Goals. As it points out, SIDS are disproportionately and increasingly affected by the impacts of climate change and urgently require access to external financial support to build resilience in the social, economic, and natural systems on which they, and the rest of the world, depend. However, the current climate and development finance architecture is exceedingly complex and ill-equipped to operate efficiently, fairly, and at the speed and scale needed to meet SIDS\u2019s needs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Secure global mobility and contribute to a sustainable future</emphasis></p><p>Speaking at the program\u2019s launch event in Baku, newly appointed Director of Compliance of the Nauru Economic and Climate Resilience Citizenship Program Office, Isa Seow, pointed out that as the world\u2019s smallest independent republic and third-smallest country, \u201cNauru is a testament to resilience and innovation, pioneering a unique approach to citizenship that combines economic growth with environmental stewardship.\u201d</p><p>Seow explained that the program offers a streamlined path to citizenship, with processing times of just three to four months. Investors can secure Nauruan citizenship through a contribution to the national Treasury Fund, starting at USD 105,000 for a single applicant. This investment unlocks benefits for international investors including visa-free access to 89 destinations, unrestricted dual citizenship, and the ability to extend citizenship to family members.</p><p>He underscored the program\u2019s commitment to integrity: \u201cWe\u2019ve implemented rigorous due diligence processes and robust governance structures to ensure that only individuals of the highest caliber participate in shaping Nauru\u2019s future. This program isn\u2019t just about acquiring another passport; it\u2019s about joining a community dedicated to pioneering solutions for global challenges.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sovereign equity instead of sovereign debt</emphasis></p><p>Nauru\u2019s government has mandated leading international investment migration advisory firm Henley &amp; Partners to design, set up, and run the Nauru Economic and Climate Resilience Citizenship Program. The firm\u2019s Government Advisory practice has assisted the governments of over 20 jurisdictions and countries across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania in designing, setting up, operating, and promoting investment-related residence and citizenship programs and has raised more than USD 15 billion in foreign direct investment.</p><p>His Excellency David Adeang, President of the Republic of Nauru, says, \u201cInvestment migration has emerged as a powerful mechanism for mitigating sustainability risks and enhancing climate resilience. Nauru\u2019s program sets a new standard in this realm, channeling investments directly into projects that safeguard the nation\u2019s future and contribute to global environmental preservation. Nauru\u2019s innovative approach offers a tangible example of how nations can leverage private investment to address pressing environmental challenges.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley &amp; Partners, says, \u201cWhat sets residence and citizenship by investment programs apart from debt-driven financing approaches is that they enhance the sovereign equity of the nations that host them. They do not require compromising or sacrificing one strategic objective to achieve another. Investment migration is a true win\u2013win, long-term, sustainable solution for all stakeholders, whether they are investors or nation states and their citizens.

The topline increased, driven by the higher interest rate levels, although the increase was offset by model-based loan impairment charges.</p><p>Expenses amounted to DKK 772 million (Q1-Q3 2023: DKK 766 million).</p><p>Credit quality remained solid, and loan impairment charges amounted to DKK 336 million in the first nine months of 2024 (Q1-Q3 2023: net reversal of DKK 18 million). Loan impairment charges were affected by a planned model change of DKK 100 million and a net increase in post-model adjustments of DKK 75 million, which related partly to the agriculture segment to counter potential CO2 taxation. At 30 September 2024, the total allowance account amounted to DKK 2,997 million (end-2023: DKK 2,738 million).</p><p>Mortgage lending at nominal value decreased DKK 6.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024.

This supports the housing market, as does the decline in mortgage bond yields in step with the prospect of central bank rate cuts. In September, we saw a comeback for the 3.5% 30-year fixed rate loan, but the 4% loan was, however, still the bench-mark loan. This is due to the price of the 4% bond being closer to par, which means that the price risk is lower for the customer.</p><p>Furthermore, momentum in real wages was strong due to high wage increases and low inflation. An analysis made in the summer also showed that the income requirement for buying a house for a typical family fell in 91 out of 98 municipalities in Denmark when taking the income development into account.</p><p>Looking at the most recent housing market indicators, we see that sales activity has recovered since the downturn at the beginning of the year, and we have close to \u2018normal\u2019 housing market activity, although it is far from the high levels witnessed during the pandemic and towards 2022.</p><p>House prices have seen an upward trend at a moderate pace in 2024. Also, prices of owner-occupied flats in Copenhagen are almost 3% higher than at the end of 2023, even though the permanent tax rebate was discontinued at the turn of the year.</p><p>In the market for commercial properties, the underlying cashflow derived from the properties remained healthy, reflecting a period with a high level of occupancy.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Group signed agreements for the acquisition of two companies (IDP Group in Spain and APP Group in Australia), strengthening its leadership in the B&amp;I division. The acquired companies generated a combined revenue of c. EUR 117 million in 2023.Additionally, in January 2025 Bureau Veritas announced that an agreement was signed to acquire Contec AQS, an Italy-based company that provides services in construction, infrastructure and Health, Safety &amp; Environment (HSE) domains for public authorities, infrastructure operators, and private manufacturing companies.

Businesses that do not meet stringent financial performance hurdles will be candidates for performance improvement or portfolio high grading.On the M&amp;A front, the Group has an opportunistic approach for these businesses. Specifically, in Consumer Product Services: the Group strengthened its positioning in luxury through the LBS Group acquisition in Italy (annualized revenue of c. EUR 9 million).

The remaining part (mainly Australia and Latin America) is being executed and is expected to close by the end of the first semester of 2025.</p><p>For more information, the press releases are available by clicking here.</p><p>\u203a A performance-led execution</p><p>As part of its LEAP | 28 strategic roadmap, Bureau Veritas is implementing two Group-wide performance streams to drive efficiency and productivity across its operations.</p><p>\u203a The first stream, focused on Operational Leverage, aims to improve the Group\u2019s gross margins through programs such as new commercial and pricing methodologies while modernizing and digitalizing the process delivery.\u203a The second stream is focused on the Scalability of functional costs, where the Group intends to keep those costs as low as possible, leveraging the company\u2019s scale and digital enablement.</p><p>The ambitions attached to these Operational Leverage and Function Scalability programs are a respective 100-basis-point and an 80-basis points improvement, with half of the gains reinvested to drive further growth and margin expansion.</p><p>Tremendous work was achieved in 2024 to complete a comprehensive process mapping exercise to identify opportunities for improvement across the organization. Basing on this assessment, the Group started the rollout of well-defined programs to enhance the operating models of select functions. They aim to define and structure the Group's data management, bringing greater visibility to the delivery workflows, and to capture scale benefits across various processes. The performance management initiatives have centered on increasing the granularity and visibility of key operational metrics. Additionally, Bureau Veritas has deployed pricing enhancement tools, which also contributed to the financial performance. As an illustration :</p><p>\u203a In the Marine &amp; Offshore activity, the Group implemented new tools to reduce contract leakage and improve pricing applications. This implementation helped optimize ad hoc service invoicing and boost divisional revenue and margins.

As a percentage of revenue, WCR decreased by 180 basis points to a record low of 4.7%, compared to 6.5% at the end of 2023.

This good performance was mainly fueled by market share gains among mid-size players in key geographical areas such as the Middle East and North America. Several laboratory contracts ramp ups and a strong momentum around non-trade activities (renewables, biofuels, Oil Condition Monitoring services) also played a favorable role in the growth.</p><p>The Metals &amp; Minerals segment (M&amp;M, 33% of divisional revenue) achieved mid-single-digit growth on an organic basis in 2024, in a year marked by significant commodities prices volatility and an evolving macroeconomic environment. In the second half of 2024, the historic high prices for gold and copper stimulated exploration drilling activities, and fueled Upstream business growth, particularly in Australia and the Middle East region. In 2024, Bureau Veritas experienced successful execution and ramp up of multiple onsite laboratory contracts, laying the foundation for a promising pipeline of opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Trade activities recorded high single-digit organic growth, primarily driven by base and battery metals demand in Asia.</p><p>The Agri-Food business (22% of divisional revenue) also delivered a mid-single organic growth in 2024.</p><p>\u203a The mid-to-high single-digit organic growth in the Agri sub-segment was driven by solid performance in both Upstream and Trade activities. Trade activities mainly benefited from the good corn and soy crops in the first part of the year in Latin America.\u203a Food services delivered mid-single-digit growth over the course of the year, with a strong performance in Australia and Southeast Asia, reaping the benefits of operational optimization plans. The disposal of the North American food testing activities to M\\xC3rieux NutriSciences was finalized before the end of 2024. Divestments in other regions, including Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America, are expected to be completed in the first half of 2025.</p><p>Government services (14% of divisional revenue) posted low single-digit organic growth in 2024. The first half of the year faced unfavorable comparables and expected contracts completion, while the second half saw a gradual recovery. The Middle East and African countries led the growth, driven by several contract ramp ups in both Single Window and Verification of Conformity services. This sub-segment starts 2025 with a robust pipeline of opportunities.</p><p>The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food &amp; Commodities business stood at 13.9%, down 99 basis points compared to last year. This was attributed to an unfavorable business mix effect (due to the soft performance of Metals &amp; Minerals) and a negative forex impact.</p><p>Sustainability achievements</p><p>In 2024, Bureau Veritas continued to expand its sustainability and Green Objects solutions to address the needs of the commodities markets.

It also benefited from inflation-related pricing in some currency impacted geographies.</p><p>By market, Power &amp; Utilities (13% of divisional revenue) remained a growth driver for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance. Growth was fueled by the Middle East and Asia offset by low profitability contracts exits in Brazil. In Europe, the stable growth in the nuclear power generation reflects the ramp up of Quality Assurance and Quality Control inspection projects in the United Kingdom and France, offsetting the completion of the French EPR (European pressurized reactor) Flamanville 3 project. The pipeline of new projects across many countries is on an upward trend, alongside the lifetime extension programs of many nuclear power plants (France, United States).</p><p>Within Power &amp; Utilities, Renewable Power Generation activities (solar, offshore &amp; onshore wind, hydrogen) sustained their growth momentum over the full year, benefiting from the ramp-up of new projects to increase new capacity. They achieved strong double-digit organic performance across most geographies. The United States led this growth, driven by the execution of a substantial number of solar projects. Meanwhile, China's robust Renewables spending, notably for wind projects, continued to fuel a sustained growth dynamic for the Group. Lastly, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions also provided growth opportunities.</p><p>In Oil &amp; Gas (31% of divisional revenue), strong double-digit organic revenue growth was achieved. Both Capex and Opex services saw substantial increases across most regions, as the Group capitalized on a favorable investment cycle, its recognized expertise, and global capabilities. The Middle East, Latin America, and Asia were the primary growth drivers, while the United States performed well thanks to LNG (liquefied natural gas) projects, and Europe benefited from solid Opex-related activity.</p><p>Industry Products Certification (17% of divisional revenue) services achieved double-digit organic growth in 2024, with strong performance across all regions. Europe sustained strong growth, driven by its solid brand reputation in machinery and advanced manufacturing services. North America benefited from its leading position in solutions for pressure vessels and welding. In Asia, double-digit growth was fueled by strong industrial momentum in the transport and logistics sector.</p><p>The Environmental Testing business (11% of divisional revenue) delivered mid-to-high single-digit organic growth, boosted by a robust baseline activity in Canada and a good momentum around the industrial hygiene business in the United States.</p><p>Industry\u2019s adjusted operating margin for the year increased by 17 basis points to 14.3%. Organically, it rose by 74 basis points benefiting from operational leverage and increased arbitrage on low profitability contracts.</p><p>Sustainability achievements</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Group was selected by TotalEnergies to provide project management, owner\u2019s engineering, quality control and quality assurance services for an onshore wind farm and solar project in Oman. The Group was also awarded a contract to deliver technical support services for construction and inspection of a 3500 MW solar farm in China. Besides, the Group signed three framework agreements with EDF, the French electricity producer, for regulatory inspection of several nuclear equipment manufacturers. In terms of its carbon and climate transition services, Bureau Veritas was also selected to provide carbon footprint assessment and emission monitoring services to support the sustainability efforts of an oil offshore project in Malaysia and a leading gas supplier in Europe.</p><p>BUILDINGS &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE</p><p>IN EUR MILLION20242023CHANGEORGANICSCOPECURRENCYRevenue1,828.91,759.0+4.0%+5.2%(0.2)%(1.0)%Adjusted Operating Profit234.7227.7+3.1% Adjusted Operating Margin12.8%12.9%(11)bps(18)bps+14bps(7)bps</p><p>The Buildings &amp; Infrastructure (B&amp;I) business recorded organic revenue growth of 5.2% in 2024 (including 3.5% growth in the fourth quarter), with growth in all main geographies.</p><p>During the period, the construction-related activities performed similarly to the building-in service activity. The growth was primarily led by the strategic assets (infrastructure and data centers) on which the Group is focusing.</p><p>The Americas region (27% of divisional revenue) achieved a mid-single-digit organic revenue increase. The US platform outperformed, capitalizing on its diversified portfolio of activities. Notably, the data center business maintained significant double-digit organic expansion globally, driven by growing demand for data storage, cloud computing and AI needs, as well as from pricing initiatives. Both regulatory-driven Opex services and Capex infrastructure projects delivered strong growth. The building transactional activities recovered with a noticeable improvement in the second half of the year, driven by commercial real estate and industrial property markets activation. In Latin America, robust growth in Brazil was partially offset by the Group's strategic shift, which involved the exit of public contracts and a refocus on infrastructure projects.</p><p>Business in Europe (51% of divisional revenue) was solid overall, up mid-single-digit organically. Most countries contributed to the growth, with Italy leading as the country increased its national infrastructure spending. France had a good year primarily led by its large Opex related activities, with service volume increases, productivity gains and favorable pricing. The energy regulatory environment and customers' commitment to sustainable development underpinned demand for energy efficiency programs (including energy performance diagnostics). Regarding the French Capex-related activities, the Group\u2019s favorable mix enabled it to outperform the construction market thanks to its exposure to infrastructure and public works (including the 2024 Paris Olympic Games).</p><p>The Asia-Pacific region (18% of divisional revenue) achieved a mid-single-digit organic revenue increase led by high growth in South and Southeast Asia and Australia. China had a negative impact, as weak public spending constrained growth in transport infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, the Group acquired the APP Group, a leading Australian Property and Infrastructure leader (EUR 87 million of annualized revenue). This transaction strengthens its position in the Australian market but also provides the Group with a robust and sustainable platform to support B&amp;I services growth in the wider Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Lastly, the Middle East &amp; Africa region (4% of divisional revenue), maintained its strong momentum throughout the year, delivering double-digit organic revenue growth. This performance was primarily driven by the Group's operations in Saudi Arabia, where it benefited from the development of numerous large-scale infrastructure projects.</p><p>Adjusted operating margin for the year slightly eroded by 11 basis points to 12.8% from 12.9% in the prior year. This reflected the impact of low activity in China which was not fully offset by the US performance.</p><p>Sustainability achievements</p><p>During the year, the Group continued to strengthen its Sustainability offering, ranging from climate change mitigation services like energy audits, green certifications and labels, decarbonization assessment and energy management solutions, as well as climate adaptation services. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Group was selected to assist the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) by providing independent, expert verification of sustainability claims for infrastructure projects seeking the \u201cBlue Dot Network\u201d label. This would help ensure the credibility and reliability of this global sustainable infrastructure label. In Japan and in China, the Group was awarded a contract to carry out a green building LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for a leading property developer.</p><p>CERTIFICATION</p><p>IN EUR MILLION20242023CHANGEORGANICSCOPECURRENCYRevenue527.3465.2+13.3%+15.0%+1.7%(3.4)%Adjusted Operating Profit103.488.2+17.3% Adjusted Operating Margin19.6%19.0%+66bps+114bps(14)bps(34)bps</p><p>Certification was among the strongest performing businesses within the Group\u2019s portfolio in full year 2024, with organic growth of 15.0%, (including organic revenue growth of 11.3% in the last quarter). This was led by increasing volumes and robust price escalations.</p><p>The Group's portfolio diversification accelerated, driving broad-based growth, and covering various schemes and all geographic regions. This was a result of successful business development programs and deployment of new services, including sustainability and corporate social responsibility solutions.</p><p>QHSE &amp; Specialized Schemes solutions (51% of divisional revenue) recorded double-digit growth in the year, helped by the recertification cycle occurring this year for several schemes across different industries. The Group also benefited from the ramp up of large public outsourcing contracts for food safety inspections in France and for food audits and training services in Spain.</p><p>Sustainability-related solutions &amp; Digital (Cyber) certification activities (28% of divisional revenue).</p><p>On the sustainability front, strong double-digit organic growth was achieved, as the Group responded to high demand for carbon footprint assessments and ESG related supply chain audits. Additionally, as customers develop their sustainability plans, they have increasing needs for verifications and assessments of their Greenhouse Gas emissions and of their supply chains. They also need help with their decarbonization plans in line with approved schemes like SBTi. Furthermore, many organizations are now working on product circularity and require lifecycle assessments to be completed on all their portfolio. In line with the incoming regulations, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), customers have opted for voluntary verification and advisory services. These services help them reduce their risks and prepare for the implementation of these new regulations.</p><p>On the cybersecurity front, certification and assurance services are benefiting from high customer demand for enterprise risk management solutions and auditing services, driving strong double-digit growth over the year.</p><p>Other solutions, including Training (21% of divisional revenue) posted low single-digit organic revenue growth in 2024 against challenging comparables.</p><p>The adjusted operating margin for the year increased by 66 basis points to 19.6%, compared to 19.0% in the prior year. Organically, it rose by 114 basis points as a result of sound operational leverage and a favorable business mix.</p><p>Sustainability achievements</p><p>In the fourth quarter, Bureau Veritas was awarded a contract with a French car equipment manufacturer to develop a methodology for environmental data analysis in 150 plants in several countries.</p><p>The Group was also selected for a rainforest alliance audit to verify the health and environmental conditions for c. 40 cocoa cooperatives. Similarly, the Group has been chosen by a supplier of a major restaurant chain to track its organization's carbon footprint (including Scope 3) for the next three years. This was made possible thanks to the solutions of the recently acquired Aligned Incentives company which provides transition services for product circularity.</p><p>In 2024, Bureau Veritas also further developed its pioneering sustainable finance portfolio of services. The Group is today the first and only company in the Testing, Inspection and Certification market to be recognized as an External Reviewer by the ESMA (European Securities &amp; Market Authorities) for the EU Green Bond standard.</p><p>CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICES</p><p>IN EUR MILLION20242023CHANGEORGANICSCOPECURRENCYRevenue797.0710.7+12.1%+8.1%+6.2%(2.2)%Adjusted Operating Profit174.3145.5+19.8% Adjusted Operating Margin21.9%20.5%+140bps+198bps(47)bps(11)bps</p><p>The Consumer Products Services division delivered 8.1% organic revenue growth over the full year 2024, including a strong organic performance of 10.2% in Q4, driven by some restocking and calendar effects linked to the Chinese New Year.</p><p>South and Southeast Asia showed a good dynamic in 2024, driven by Vietnam and Bangladesh, which benefitted from the China derisking strategy. The Americas benefited from the ongoing diversification strategy, with good growth in the Electrical and Electronics segment in South America (Brazil and Mexico).</p><p>The Softlines, Hardlines &amp; Toys segment (accounting for 48% of divisional revenue) delivered double-digit organic growth in 2024. In this mature market, this strong performance is due to i) an increase in demand and in Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), driven in the second half by the anticipation of US Tariffs on China, ii) market share gains. The growth was led by Bangladesh and India, leveraging US clients shift towards South Asian countries and from European demand.</p><p>Healthcare (including Beauty and Household) (8% of divisional revenue) posted solid double-digit organic growth for 2024 spearheaded by the US operations and leveraging global accounts. This growth was realized following a successful integration of the two companies acquired in the last two years.</p><p>Supply Chain &amp; Sustainability services (14% of divisional revenue) recorded very good double-digit organic growth. Social audits and Sustainability schemes are driving the growth, especially in Europe, the US and China, as some voluntary social and sustainability audits are regulated and become mandatory, and as companies protect their brand and reputation.</p><p>Technology (30% of divisional revenue) saw a low single-digit contraction in 2024, with a sequential improvement in the second half. The Electronics sub-segment was still affected by a global decrease in demand for wireless products and new mobility equipment (electrical vehicles and components). However, the electrical appliances segment delivered good performance, bolstered by enhanced consumer spending patterns.</p><p>In line with the LEAP I 28 strategy, the Group accelerated its M&amp;A program to:</p><p>\u203a Invest in the new stronghold of Consumer Technology Testing, with the three acquisitions - OneTech Corp., Kostec Co. in Korea and Hi Physix Laboratory in India - to bolster its presence in Electrical and Electronics consumer products testing in the key markets of South Korea and India, and\u203a Optimize value and impact in consumer product services, with the acquisition of LBS Group in Italy to strengthen its positioning in luxury and fashion, as well as its supply chain solutions.</p><p>Adjusted operating margin for the year increased by 140 basis points to 21.9% from 20.5% in the prior year. Organically it rose by 198 basis points thanks to good operational leverage, offset by a negative scope (47 bps) and limited forex effects.</p><p>Sustainability achievements</p><p>In 2024, transition services continued to grow, with the Group supporting customers' ESG transformation and monitoring the traceability of their supply chain. For example, the Group was awarded a contract with a major smartphone company in Asia to carry out product lifecycle analysis of batteries in a recycling context. Additionally, it was selected by a major e-commerce company to carry out social audits at several Asian sites to comply with the company's program requirements.</p><p>PRESENTATION</p><p>\u203a 2024 results will be presented on Tuesday, February 25, 2025, at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time)\u203a A video conference will be webcast live.

is based on a series of alternative performance indicators, as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group\u2019s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users, enabling them to better understand the Group\u2019s performance, especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing, inspection and certification (\u201cTIC\u201d) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as complementary to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.</p><p>GROWTH</p><p>Total revenue growth</p><p>The total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:</p><p>Organic growth,Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect),Impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).</p><p>Organic growth</p><p>The Group internally monitors and publishes \u201corganic\u201d revenue growth, which it considers to be more representative of the Group\u2019s operating performance in each of its business sectors.</p><p>The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like, also known as organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, which are outside of Bureau Veritas\u2019 control, as well as scope effects which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group\u2019s performance internally.</p><p>Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations \u2013 in the event of international sanctions, for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility, which can mask underlying trends.</p><p>The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.</p><p>Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth, presented at Group level and for each business, based on a constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:</p><p>Constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period,Constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.</p><p>Scope effect</p><p>To establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods, the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:</p><p>For acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year,For acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated,For disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group,For disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.</p><p>Currency effect</p><p>The currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.</p><p>ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN</p><p>Adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business, excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group\u2019s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators, presented at Group level and for each business, are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.</p><p>Adjusted operating profit</p><p>Adjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:</p><p>Amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions,Impairment of goodwill,Impairment and retirement of non-current assets,Restructuring costs,Gains and losses on the disposal of activities, including in particular:Fees and acquisition costs of activities, including, when applicable, external costs related to their integration within the Group,Contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses,Gains and losses on the disposal of activities.</p><p>When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year, the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.</p><p>Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may, in some cases, be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period, once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.</p><p>Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:</p><p>At constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period,At constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.</p><p>The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.</p><p>Adjusted operating margin</p><p>Adjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates, thereby, in the latter case, providing a view of the Group\u2019s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, which are outside of Bureau Veritas\u2019 control.</p><p>Service costs rebilled to clients, that were previously included under the \"Purchases and external charges\" line item, are now presented separately, with no impact on operating profit and net profit in the current and previous year.</p><p>ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE</p><p>The effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.</p><p>The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).</p><p>ADJUSTED NET PROFIT</p><p>Adjusted attributable net profit</p><p>Adjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.</p><p>Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates, thereby providing a view of the Group\u2019s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, which are outside of Bureau Veritas\u2019 control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.</p><p>Adjusted attributable net profit per share</p><p>Adjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period (excluding own shares held by the Group).</p><p>FREE CASH FLOW</p><p>Free cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow), adjusted for the following items:</p><p>Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets,Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets,Interest paid.</p><p>Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.</p><p>Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:</p><p>At constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period,At constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.</p><p>The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.</p><p>FINANCIAL DEBT</p><p>Gross debt</p><p>Gross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.</p><p>Net debt</p><p>Net debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.</p><p>Adjusted net debt</p><p>Adjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.</p><p>CONSOLIDATED EBITDA</p><p>Consolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and provisions, adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months.</p><p>_____________________1 Alternative performance indicators are presented, defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 2 of this press release.2 (Net cash generated from operating activities \u2013 lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.3 Proposed dividend, subject to Shareholders\u2019 Meeting approval on June 19, 2025.4 (Net cash generated from operating activities \u2013 lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.5 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated over a 12-month period from January to December 2024.

But the low-lying delta is under pressure from the rising water level in the Mediterranean Sea due to climate change, the subsequent erosion of the coastline and the subsidence of the delta.</p><p>\"The Mediterranean coast of Egypt is threatened by erosion because it no longer receives the necessary sediments from the Nile that would strengthen and protect the coast. The erosion is furthermore accelerated by the rising sea level caused by global warming. The rising sea level also increases the intrusion of saltwater into the ground water. Together with increasing risk of flooding during storms from the Mediterranean farmland can be seriously affected. This threatens the country's food security and hold serious socioeconomic and consequences for millions of people,\" Jan Dietrich explains.</p><h>Integrated Coastal Zone Management planning for the next 100 years</h><p>It is against this backdrop that NIRAS will undertake the development of a Climate Resilient Integrated Coastal Zone Management plan.</p><p>\"This plan enables the different Egyptian stakeholders to assess the economic risk they are facing during the next 100 years. It provides them with a series of conceptual and socio-economic optimized solutions, adapted to climate change. In addition, we provide capacity building and propose adjustments of laws, regulations and the institutional set-up that support the authorities to continue the ICZM process after we have left,\" says Jan Dietrich.</p><p>The concept of Climate Resilient Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was first introduced in 1992 during the Earth Summit of Rio de Janeiro. It represents a very comprehensive approach which - according to the EU definition - covers a full cycle of involvement of informed participation and cooperation of all stakeholders in a given coastal area in order to assess the societal goals and take actions to meet them.</p><p>&amp;lsquo;Integrated' in ICZM refers to the integration of objectives and of all relevant policy areas, sectors, and levels of administration.</p><p>The long-term goal of the ICZM are balanced environmental, economic, social, cultural and recreational objectives, all within the limits set by natural dynamics.</p><h>Predictive databases and flood alert systems</h><p>An important part of the project is the establishment of early warning system that will make it possible to react to disaster a lot sooner.</p><p>\"We will establish a GIS cloud-based platform, numerical hydrodynamic models and an early warning system to support stakeholders in managing the ICZM process and assisting the emergency preparedness. This increases flexibility and augments the manoeuvrability, and ultimately it gives the Egyptian authorities a better chance of helping people out of areas in the case of sudden disasters.

The program recognises climate adaptation and mitigation at the center to all efforts to upgrade the public health facilities across the world.</p><p>Speaking about the significance of this program globally, Dr. Maria Neira, Assistant Director-General a.i., Division of Healthier Populations, and Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, at the World Health Organization said, \u201cReliable electricity in health-care facilities is essential to save lives and to provide quality health care. And yet, one billion people around the world are still served by health-care facilities without reliable electricity or with no electricity access at all. Decentralized renewable energies represent a key opportunity to accelerate electrification of health-care facilities, including in remote areas. I congratulate the Government of India and our partners from Selco Foundation and Ikea Foundation for this critical program, which will have a transformative impact on strengthening the health system\u201d.</p><p>The first-of-a-kind initiative will bring solar energy solutions with efficient medical and electrical equipment to 25,000 healthcare facilities in 12 states by 2026. Across the 12 states under this program, there is a diversity in terms of topography, socio-economic vulnerabilities, disease burden and climate. This diversity across selected geographies will contribute to this programme serving as a showcase globally- innovating on approaches, models and processes relevant for similar contexts in other parts of the world.</p><p>Reflecting on India\u2019s leadership in the effort, Dr. Harish Hande, CEO of SELCO Foundation said, \u201cAffordable and equitable access to healthcare is a function of two aspects- one, resources required to deliver health care, and two, cost of accessing health care. Through this program, SELCO Foundation and IKEA Foundation, along with India\u2019s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and various State Health Missions, will showcase at scale how sustainable energy can be used to make health services affordable at the doorstep of the poor.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Energy for Health\u2019 initiative brings with it positive impacts across the spectrum of stakeholders- for last mile communities in their access to timely healthcare; for health facility staff in ensuring a conducive work environment to provide quality services; for health sector in reducing energy and equipment-related costs as well as avoiding wastage of vaccines and other critical resources; reinforcing climate resilience building and carbon mitigation efforts while ensuring positive health outcomes for all citizens.</p><p>Mr. Per Heggenes, CEO of IKEA Foundation said, \u201c\u2018At the IKEA Foundation, we strongly believe caring for the health of people and our planet must go hand-in-hand. This initiative will improve healthcare outcomes and reduce emissions, by providing reliable and renewable energy to thousands of clinics. Our hope is that the success of this programme can serve as a model for building effective and efficient health systems globally.\u2019</p><p>Supported by IKEA Foundation, through this initiative, SELCO Foundation along with Government of India will create systems and processes that demonstrate ownership, management, and regular maintenance of the energy systems and appliances. Together, through the 25,000 public health facilities, technical knowledge and capacity, as well as guidelines and policies that enable health staff at different levels to plan for public health infrastructure in a sustainable manner will be improved. The program will also improve the local technical network for solar energy, which could potentially also have indirect impacts on local economies and boost adoption of solar energy across other sectors as well.</p><p>The initiative aims to reach over 170 million people across the 12 states and improve working conditions for over 160,000 front line health staff at these health facilities. Across the 25,000 public health facilities, this will add ~100MW of solar energy capacity in the country, and mitigate over 3 million tonnes of CO2e emissions over a 20 year period. These will directly contribute to India\u2019s Net Zero targets, while also creating a paradigm shift on how health targets can be achieved for resource constrained communities across the world in an efficient manner.</p><p>About the partners:</p><p>SELCO Foundation:Established in 2010, SELCO Foundation\u2019s mission is to develop holistic solutions that use sustainable energy as a catalyst to address poverty alleviation alongside ensuring environmental sustainability. SELCO's interventions lead to the sustainable delivery of essential services such as healthcare, and enable improvements in livelihoods productivity and till date more than 7 million people have been impacted. The foundation does this by also developing enabling conditions, i.e the ecosystem for sustainable energy solutions to be locally developed, adopted, scaled and institutionalized through stakeholders including government agencies, financiers, local NGOs and enterprises.</p><p>For more information, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.selco\">www.selco</url> foundation.org, and follow them on Twitter (@SELCOFoundation) and LinkedIn.</p><p>IKEA Foundation:The IKEA Foundation is a strategic philanthropy that focuses its grant making efforts on tackling the two biggest threats to children\u2019s futures: poverty and climate change.

Olesen koordineret indhentning af ekspertviden og vurderinger af igangv\u00e6rende og planlagte klimatilpasningsforanstaltninger. Resultatet er nu udgivet i tidsskriftet European Journal of Agronomy. </p><p>\"Vi har ganske enkelt r\u00e5df\u00f8rt os med eksperter fra hele Europa - b\u00e5de dem bag skrivebordene, men i s\u00e6rdeleshed ogs\u00e5 dem med gummist\u00f8vler p\u00e5 og jord under neglene. Vi har spurgt dem, hvad de har oplevet af \u00e6ndringer i dyrkningsm\u00f8nster og management ved nogle af de vigtigste afgr\u00f8der i Europa. Vi har ogs\u00e5 bedt dem om at forholde sig til, hvorvidt de \u00e6ndringer, de oplever, relaterer sig til klimaforandringer,\" fort\u00e6ller J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Store regionale forskelle</emphasis></p><p>Fem afgr\u00f8der var udgangspunktet. Hvede, raps, majs, kartofler og vindruer er nemlig blandt Europas mest dyrkede og vigtigste afgr\u00f8der, derfor faldt valget naturligt p\u00e5 dem, da forskerne ville kortl\u00e6gge, hvilke \u00e6ndringer, der er at se p\u00e5 afgr\u00f8der, dyrkningsform og ikke mindst, hvor mange af \u00e6ndringerne, der kan tilskrives klimaforandringer. </p><p>\"Vi kan se, at der er tydelige regionale forskelle i b\u00e5de de observerede og planlagte tiltag for alle fem afgr\u00f8der. Og det er m\u00e5ske heller ikke s\u00e5 underligt, at vi ser de her markante regionale forskelle,\" siger J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen, der p\u00e5peger, at selvom Europa ud fra et globalt perspektiv ikke fylder s\u00e5 meget geografisk, s\u00e5 rammer klima\u00e6ndringerne alligevel p\u00e5 vidt forskellige m\u00e5der. </p><p>I Nordeuropa har man observeret \u00e6ndret timing i forhold til markarbejde, og der er blevet indf\u00f8rt nye afgr\u00f8der og sorter. If\u00f8lge J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen vil en af de v\u00e6sentligste forandringer i fremtiden blive en forl\u00e6nget v\u00e6ksts\u00e6son. </p><p>\"Temperaturen bliver jo ogs\u00e5 h\u00f8jere i Nordeuropa, og \u00e6ndringerne er is\u00e6r udtalte i vinterhalv\u00e5ret. Den bliver mildere og v\u00e5dere. Med h\u00f8jere temperatur udvides v\u00e6ksts\u00e6sonen b\u00e5de om for\u00e5ret og efter\u00e5ret,\" siger han, og p\u00e5peger, at Nordeuropa slipper billigt i forhold til de klimaforandringer, man kommer til at opleve l\u00e6ngere sydp\u00e5.</p><p>Central- og Sydeuropa er allerede i gang med at tilpasse sig til klimaforandringerne. Det er de, if\u00f8lge J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen ganske enkelt n\u00f8dt til, for her giver klimaforandringerne sig udtryk i ekstrem varme, t\u00f8rke og uregelm\u00e6ssig nedb\u00f8r.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fokus p\u00e5 vand i fremtidens landbrug</emphasis>\"Grundl\u00e6ggende kommer vi til at opleve mere t\u00f8rke og h\u00f8jere temperaturer i Syd- og Centraleuropa, og vi kan se, at man allerede nu er begyndt at lave tilpasninger i forhold til vand- og jordforvaltningen. Vi kan ogs\u00e5 se, at man er ved at indf\u00f8re nye sorter med bedre t\u00f8rketolerance, s\u00e5 de bedre kan klare sig. Der er allerede lavet tiltag og flere er planlagt, men vi m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re opm\u00e6rksomme p\u00e5, at det her bliver enormt sv\u00e6rt at tilpasse sig. Der vil i fremtiden v\u00e6re mere uregelm\u00e6ssig nedb\u00f8r i de her egne, og vi kan ikke forestille os afgr\u00f8der, der ikke har brug for vand. De fysiologiske betingelser for planter er jo bare s\u00e5dan, at planter skal bruge mere vand ved h\u00f8jere temperaturer, fordi fordampningstrykket jo ogs\u00e5 bliver h\u00f8jere,\" forklarer han.</p><p>Der er observeret \u00e6ndringer i dyrkningsformer og forskellige tilpasninger i alle de unders\u00f8gte regioner, men det er ikke alle, der kan tilskrives klimaforandringer. Generelt set finder man flest tilpasninger, der skyldes klima\u00e6ndringer i Middelhavsomr\u00e5det. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tiltag skal tilpasses regionale forhold</emphasis></p><p>If\u00f8lge forskerne er der allerede nu og endnu mere i fremtiden behov for mere avancerede tiltag til integreret plantebeskyttelse og varslingssystemer i hele Europa, men det er vigtigt at v\u00e6re bevidst omkring forskellene i risici og ekstremer i de forskellige regioner.  \u00c6ndrede tidspunkter og metoder for markdrift, g\u00f8dskning, plantebeskyttelse og nye metoder til at holde p\u00e5 jordens fugtighed forventes at blive fremtr\u00e6dende tilpasningsforanstaltninger over hele Europa. </p><p>\"Vi kan se, at det allerede nu er et fokus p\u00e5 klimatilpasning i mange egne af Europa, men jeg kan ikke undlade understrege vigtigheden af en forbedring af vandforvalningen, b\u00e5de n\u00e5r det g\u00e6lder dr\u00e6ning og vanding, men ogs\u00e5 med at holde p\u00e5 vandet i jorden og landskabet. Det kommer til at kr\u00e6ve \u00e6ndringer i landskabet, reviderede milj\u00f8regler og -foranstaltninger og eventuelt tilskudsordninger som led i tilpasningen i s\u00e6rdeleshed i Sydeuropa,\" siger J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen. </p><p>Studiet viser, at der is\u00e6r i Sydeuropa allerede er implementeret og planlagt tiltag, der skal v\u00e6re med til at sikre fremtidens f\u00f8devareproduktion. Men der skal mere til, for if\u00f8lge J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen er det ikke kun mangel p\u00e5 vand og h\u00f8je temperaturer, der vil skabe problemer for fremtidens landbrug i Europa. \"Ukrudt, plantesygdomme og svampeangreb kommer ogs\u00e5 til at give problemer, s\u00e5 det skal vi ogs\u00e5 arbejde med. Og her har vi jo den anden udfordring, at vi p\u00e5 samme tid skal udfase brugen af pesticider. Et andet problem kommer til at v\u00e6re insekter, som fremmes af h\u00f8jere temperaturer. Det kommer til at stille krav til vores dyrkningssystemer, og vi er n\u00f8dt til at finde nye m\u00e5der at indrette dem p\u00e5 en m\u00e5de, der kan begr\u00e6nse skadeeffekterne fra insekter,\" siger J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen. Der p\u00e5peger, at der ganske enkelt er brug for et landbrugspolitisk fokus p\u00e5 alle de udfordringer, europ\u00e6isk landbrug kommer til at st\u00e5 overfor, og at det ikke kan klares alene med en overordnet EU-politik, men at et regionalt fokus er n\u00f8dvendigt, s\u00e5 man kan tage hensyn til de markante forskelle i hvordan klimaforandringerne vil ramme de forskellige regioner i Europa. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yderligere information</emphasis></p><p>Samarbejdspartnere: Institut for Agro\u00f8kologi ved Aarhus Universitet, China Agricultural University, University of Florence, Czech Academy of Sciences, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), University of Leuven, Agroscope, Agroecology and Environment Division, University of Bern, Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation at State Research Institute Poland, Vytautus Magnus University, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Earth Science Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciene, University of Potsdam, Estonian Academy of Science, Natural Resources Institute Finland, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Universidad Polit\\xC3cnica de Madrid, Wageningen University, Mendel University in Brno, iCLIMATE - Interdisciplinary Centre for Climate Change at Aarhus University og Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen.</p><p>Finansiering: Unders\u00f8gelsen blev gennemf\u00f8rt som led i CropM-komponenten af FACCE MACSUR2-projektet.

IPCC Working Group III report published today highlights urgent need to turn climate promises into tangible action to keep 1.5C within reach.

We must therefore spare no effort in addressing the adaptation gap while focusing on developing creative models to attract climate finance to adaptation from both public and private sources.</p><p>The commitment made by developed countries at Glasgow to double adaptation finance is a welcome step in the right direction, but we need to see even more ambitious steps with regard to attracting private investments to adaptation bearing in mind that today less than 1% of private climate finance goes to adaptation while 99% is invested in mitigation action.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Madeleine Diouf Sarr</emphasis>, Chair of the Least Developed Country Group, Head of the Climate Change Division, Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, Senegal, said</p><p>\"Today's ministerial meeting was critical for raising the political ambition on adaptation finance this year.

The combination of SIDS inherent special circumstances such as our size, population, remoteness, geography, and particular vulnerability make us uniquely exposed to climate change especially when compared to others. SIDS are, however, still not being prioritized for climate finance, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. We are also not being given the promised efficient access to such finance through simplified processes. And beyond not being prioritized, SIDS are being barred for accessing climate finance. Nevertheless, today's gathering of progressive leaders at the Lahti Adaptation Finance Ministerial in Finland shows promising signs that change is coming. That leaders are listening to our calls, our priorities, and our challenges - and are ready to take action with us.</p><p>SIDS are committed to working with the Champions Group on Adaptation Finance and others to drive forward the needed changes on adaptation finance. As a first step, we, nevertheless, need a guarantee from the Group that all SIDS are eligible to access their bilateral adaptation finance through simplified access and approval processes, no later than COP 27. The longer we leave challenges like this one unfixed, the more people in the countries I represent will suffer. We need urgent action on the ground now and look forward to making it happen together.\"</p><p>H.E. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kitty van der Heijden</emphasis>, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, said</p><p>\"As one of the founding members of Champions Group on Adaptation Finance, the Netherlands stays firmly committed to work with all climate vulnerable countries to address the adaptation finance challenges raised by them and make real tangible progress by COP27.

PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. In addition, PMI ships versions of its IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the U.S., where these products have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of IQOS and its consumables as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities, and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of Dec. 31, 2020, IQOS is available for sale in 64 markets in key cities or nationwide, and PMI estimates that approximately 12.7 million adults around the world have already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.
