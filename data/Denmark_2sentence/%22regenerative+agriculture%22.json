Respondents work in large companies within retail, wholesale, consumer packaged goods, commodities and agriculture subsectors of the food and beverage industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">76% of respondents reported some level of confidence in their sustainability roadmaps and ability to achieve environmental goals by 2030, but action plans are missing critical components for success. Portfolio redesign, regenerative agriculture and plant-based initiatives were cited as the lowest three priorities for the next year, despite having greatest potential for radical transformation. Clear action plans are the second-most important success factor (38%), but they are lacking and 26% of respondents still view them as a challenge.</p><p>Other key findings included:</p><p>The supply chain remains the top challenge: 42% of respondents cite its complexities as the largest barrier to success.Financial investment remains a barrier, departmental budgets reflect that: Cited as the second largest barrier to success, allocating funds remains a struggle - the average percentage of annual budget allocated to reducing environmental impact is just 12.54 across departments.Chief Sustainability Officers need more inter-departmental buy-in: Company commitment and culture set by leadership were the largest drivers of sustainable practices across departments, but the two biggest barriers to success (supply chain and budget allocation) sit largely outside their control.Packaging is priority: Most respondents have tools and budget in place to make packaging more sustainable, and 62% cited it as a top priority for the next year \u2013 this is a clear starting point across brands, but critical levers for scaling and implementing these efforts are missing.Consumers are ready \u2013 the industry just needs to deliver: Even in the current economic climate, 100% of marketing respondents have seen changes in consumer behavior regarding sustainable purchasing habits.

The number of hectares enrolled grew 10X over the previous year and farmer participation increased 4X. Agreena is paying the largest incentives to farmers under a soil carbon scheme to-date at \u20ac32 to \u20ac36 per anticipated carbon certificate generated depending on region, an increase of up to 45% from last year. The company is a pioneer in creating nature-based soil carbon removals. The associated certificates will soon be available on the market for companies that want to participate in the transition of the world\u2019s farmers to practices that help address climate change, biodiversity loss and the future of food security.</p><p>While carbon sequestration in agriculture has been identified as one of the top solutions to scale climate action because of its accessibility and the immediate impact it can have, the primary hurdle to adoption is the high upfront costs for farmers. By leveraging the voluntary carbon market (VCM) to convert climate-friendly farming efforts into high-quality carbon certificates, Agreena is driving a new revenue stream to the farmer. Farmers are seeing the benefit too. Twenty percent of the year-on-year hectare growth in Agreena\u2019s portfolio came from member farmers adding more land to the program.</p><p>\u201cAgreena is introducing a new category of carbon certificates into the market and it will take time to build and scale, but farmers cannot wait - they need a reliable and liquid payment to help cover their transition efforts,\u201d said Simon Haldrup, CEO of Agreena. \u201cThat is why Agreena takes a calculated risk and pays farmers each harvest year. Still, carbon certificates are just one part of the solution and a mix of incentives is needed to rapidly transition the world\u2019s farmers to regenerative practices.\u201d</p><p>Farmers and the companies that rely on carbon certificates for their ESG and sustainability efforts are on different timelines. Sales of credits can take a year or longer to occur after the impact has been certified. Agreena\u2019s early payout option for farmers bridges the gap between the two. Farmers enrolled in Agreena\u2019s program get to decide how they\u2019d like to use the certificates that they generate, and one of those options is to be paid soon after the harvest year ends to help cover their upfront costs. The early payout is based on market prices at the time. Growth of the Voluntary Carbon Market and pricing for high-quality carbon certificates continue to grow, any upside when Agreena\u2019s certificates are sold is shared with the farmer.</p><p>Agreena\u2019s carbon certificates are the result of farmers taking measures to sequester additional carbon from the atmosphere within their soils and at the same time reduce their own emissions through practices like no till. The company has developed a highly credible programme that is in alignment with the latest IPCC science and the recognised principles of the VCM, and built relationships with agricultural partners and farmers across Europe.</p><p>More recently Agreena has developed its corporate unit that oversees certificate sales, and MRV and risk solutions. Agreena works with certificate buyers to tailor, structure and scale portfolios from across the company\u2019s inventory, modelled after assets already sold and traded in traditional financial markets.</p><p>\u201cOur first vintage of high quality carbon certificates originates from farmers in Central Europe and has just been made available for a limited quantity presale,\u201d said Frederik Aagaard, Agreena\u2019s Director of Carbon Markets. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be able to facilitate the participation of companies in helping finance this journey for farmers.\u201d</p><p>The deadline for enrolling in Agreena\u2019s 2023 programme is quickly approaching. Farmers have until June 30 to enter this year\u2019s harvest, and can calculate their earning potential and apply by completing this form on Agreena\u2019s website. More information about the programme and how it works can be found here.</p><p>Agreena anticipates that as the VCM continues to grow and evolve, the market will see continued developments related to certification and new standards in the space. Agreena\u2019s portfolio of GHG reduction and carbon removal certificates are accredited to the ISO 14064-2 standard and are currently undergoing Verra VCS certification.

A competitive biomethane market can play a key role in the transition to net zero.ii</p><p>To support the transition to clean heat in the UK, energy efficiency improvements will be made at AstraZeneca\u2019s Macclesfield campus, the largest medicines development and manufacturing site in the UK. This includes a major refit of the site\u2019s combined heat and power plant (CHP) which will save a further 16,000 tonnes CO2e per year, in addition to upgrading buildings and improving the footprint for the production and packing of medicines to enable further greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. These efficiency projects will support the long-term sustainable operations of the Macclesfield campus, which delivers more than 90 million packs of medicines to more than 130 countries.</p><p>The transition to 100% renewable energy is a key element of AstraZeneca\u2019s flagship Ambition Zero Carbon programme, which is focused on delivering deep decarbonisation by halving the company\u2019s entire value chain footprint (Scopes 1 to 3) by 2030 and becoming science-based net zero by 2045 at the latest. AstraZeneca is on track to reduce GHG emissions from its global operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 98% by 2026.</p><p>Juliette White, Vice President, Global Sustainability &amp; Safety, Health &amp; Environment, at AstraZeneca, said: \u201cToday\u2019s commitment of \\xA3100 million shows we are serious about decarbonising the discovery, development and manufacture of medicines and securing a sustainable future for our sites across the UK and globally. In leading from the front on the commercial adoption of clean heat, we are innovating to expand the usage of renewable energy, contributing to the circular economy and accelerating our progress towards net zero.\u201d</p><p>Philipp Lukas, CEO of Future Biogas, said: \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s ground-breaking investment in green gas affirms its status as a global leader in the transition to net zero. The opportunity to combine unsubsidised biomethane production with regenerative farming benefits local farms and supports the growing focus on soil health and sustainable food production. Future Biogas expects this model to be adopted by many other innovative organisations with strong net zero ambitions.\u201d</p><p>The site will utilise locally-grown crops as feedstock and support farms with sustainable land management practices, enabling the development of a circular agricultural economy. Bioenergy crops will be grown as part of diverse crop rotations and will follow regenerative agriculture practices, promoting nutrient cycling and improving soil health.</p><p>Renewable Gas Guarantee of Origin (RGGO) certificates will be transferred to AstraZeneca, to ensure there is no double counting of emissions savings.</p><p>The new plant will be fitted with bioenergy carbon capture and storage capability (BECCS) which has the potential to enable the carbon negative operation of the plant. AstraZeneca aims to sequester the carbon through the \u2018Northern Lights\u2019 project in Norway, a joint venture involving industry and supported by the Norwegian Government.</p><p>This latest commitment to renewable energy in the UK follows other innovative partnerships announced earlier this year. In the US, AstraZeneca is partnering with Vanguard Renewables to enable the delivery of biomethane to all its US sites by the end of 2026. The Company has also entered into an agreement with Statkraft, Europe\u2019s largest renewable energy producer, to increase the supply of renewable electricity in Sweden.</p><p>Notes</p><p>Biogas and biomethaneiii</p><p>Biogas is produced by the fermentation of organic matter in anaerobic digestion tanks. Biomethane is biogas from which the by-product carbon dioxide has been removed, giving the biomethane the same properties as natural gas, and enabling it to be injected into the national gas grid. In Future Biogas' plants the feedstocks will have a zero or negative carbon footprint meaning the biomethane is 100% renewable energy, allowing a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Energy crops grown for Future Biogas absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during their growth. Once harvested and stored, the energy crops are fed into anaerobic digestion tanks where bacteria break down the organic matter in the absence of oxygen, releasing biogas. The residue is an organic fertiliser (digestate) which in conjunction with changes to the farming rotation helps accelerate soil carbon capture.</p><p>Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)iv</p><p>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a carbon removal technique to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Biomass (organic material) is converted into heat, electricity, or liquid or gas fuels, and the carbon dioxide emissions from this bioenergy conversion are captured and stored in geological formations or embedded in long-lasting products. It does not utilise the injected CO2 for enhanced oil recovery.</p><p>About Future Biogas</p><p>Future Biogas is at the forefront of the anaerobic digestion (AD) industry. The company is a highly experienced developer and operator of AD plants across the UK, and able to provide full-service capabilities of development, construction, operations, ongoing compliance and asset management, both to owned projects and to those of third parties. Future Biogas plants convert a wide range of feedstocks into clean, renewable energy, through a process of anaerobic digestion, which produces biogas. Biogas can either be used to generate green electricity or upgraded into biomethane and injected into the UK\u2019s national gas network.</p><p>For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurebiogas.com\">https://www.futurebiogas.com</url>.*</p><p>About Northern Lights</p><p>Northern Lights is developing an open and flexible infrastructure to transport CO2 from industrial emitters by ship to a receiving terminal in western Norway for intermediate storage, before being transported by pipeline for permanent storage in a geological reservoir 2,600 metres under the seabed. Operations are scheduled to start in 2024. The facilities are under construction and will enable Northern Lights to offer a safe and reliable shipping and storage service to industrial emitters from across Europe.

(FBNSM ), the leading direct-to-farm ag tech platform and farmer network, today launched GRO Network\u00e2, which provides new technology and services that facilitate the scoring, sourcing, and pricing of Low-Carbon Grain from farm to fork, making environmental transparency in the grain industry a reality now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This press release features multimedia.

GRO Network also provides buying intelligence software that directly connects farmers with consumer packaged goods companies, animal feed providers, biofuel makers and the world's other major grain buyers.</p><p> POET, the world's largest producer of biofuels has joined GRO Network as a key customer in the market for verifiable Low-Carbon Grain.</p><p> \"Family farms have already invested the time, innovation and sweat-equity to develop the regenerative practices required to grow Low-Carbon Grain,\" said Amol Deshpande, CEO and Co-Founder of FBN. \"With GRO Network, the efforts of farmers as well as food and feed companies, biofuel makers, and ordinary consumers to reduce carbon emissions just got a huge boost.\"</p><p> Transparency in the agriculture supply chain starts with data direct from the field.</p><p>Farmers share information on their cultivation practices - including fertilizer applications, tillage, and cover cropping - with GRO Network, which is processed with artificial intelligence that leverage FBN's 240 million acre-events of real world farm data, validates and distills the practices into a single farm-level score. This single score - which is the only information shared between GRO Network and prospective buyers - informs the buyer to then source premium grain as well as build programs to meet unique sustainability goals, while protecting farmers' data privacy.</p><p> Importantly, verifiable Low-Carbon Grain will allow agricultural processors and food companies to meet their own significant emission goals. Policymakers will be able to evaluate a precise, farm-level carbon-intensity score to more accurately measure the GHG reduction of biofuels for low carbon fuel policies. GRO Network will help these companies embed the required carbon traceability into their supply chains, all within the current government policy framework.</p><p> \"At POET we know that agriculture is the key to combating climate change, and we want to support farmers who share our mission to be good stewards of the earth by using environmentally friendly practices,\" said POET Founder and CEO Jeff Broin. \"We are excited about the potential of the GRO Network to promote sustainable agriculture and utilize the resulting Low-Carbon Corn to produce even greener bioethanol and bioproducts.\"</p><p> GRO Network is focusing initially on carbon abatement, which, based on GRO Network pilots, can reduce grain emissions by up to 50%, while increasing farm revenues at the same time. It relies on proven, existing science and robust FBN analytics to measure the benefits of conservation activities on the farm, providing immediate, low-risk solutions to reduce the environmental impact of the agriculture supply chain.</p><p> \"Regenerative agriculture techniques have not only saved us money, they've made us money,\" said Todd Hanten, who farms 3,000 acres of corn, soybeans and spring wheat in South Dakota. \"We've always tried these practices side by side and can compare conventional tillage to no-till and strip till and we've realized the benefits through our data analytics. We're happy to find out that the practices we've adopted are saving us money and making us a better return.\"</p><p>FBN began development of GRO Network close to two years ago in order to allow fuel, food and feed companies to work alongside farmers to accelerate the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices that deliver the biggest impact. GRO Network incentivizes sustainable conservation and soil health practices by producers, ensuring a consistent supply of high quality, Low-Carbon Grain for buyers.</p><p> \"Ultimately, GRO Network aligns farmers, processors, brands, consumers and policy-makers in the fight against climate change,\" Deshpande said. \"We are excited to see family farm incomes improve as a direct result.\"</p><p> Learn more at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fbngro.com\">www.fbngro.com</url></p><p> About FBN:</p><p>Farmer's Business Network, Inc. is an independent ag tech platform and farmer-to-farmer network with a mission to power the prosperity of family farmers around the world, while working towards a sustainable future.
