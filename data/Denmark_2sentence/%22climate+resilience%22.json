This forward-thinking financial approach is designed to diversify the company\u2019s treasury away from traditional fiat currencies, which face increasing risks due to inflation and geopolitical uncertainty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In today\u2019s volatile economic climate, resilience is paramount. \u201cIn this era of significant monetary expansion, maintaining a strong balance sheet is more critical than ever,\u201d said Executive Chairman St\u00e5le Rodahl of Green Minerals. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s decentralized, non-inflationary properties make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat. By integrating a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, we are not only mitigating fiat risks but also reaffirming our commitment to financial innovation and the sustainable creation of long-term value. This approach is particularly well suited for a company with such a long project horizon as Green Minerals. With significant future capital expenditures planned for the production equipment, the program offers a robust hedge against currency debasement\u201d.</p><p>Green Minerals has set an ambitious target: to together with its partners finance up to USD 1.2 billion with programs designed to increase its Bitcoin Treasury exposure forming a cornerstone of the financing. This strategic goal is aligned with the first HEDSM to be launched by our \u201cPartnership for Responsible Production\u201d and underscores the Company\u2019s determination to leverage digital assets as a core component of its financial structure and future growth.</p><p>Furthermore, Green Minerals emphasizes that its core operational strategy remains steadfast\u2014the Bitcoin Treasury program is implemented to support the company\u2019s project plans. Green Minerals also sees that blockchain technology has an important role to play in mining to ensure supply chain transparency, mineral origin certification and operational efficiency. Green Minerals aims to adopt blockchain technology throughout the value chain to stay in the forefront of competition and any future regulatory requirements.</p><p>Green Minerals aims to optimize the implementation of its Bitcoin Treasury strategy in collaboration with renowned bitcoin expertise. To this end, Green Minerals will establish a transparent and secure framework for the acquisition, management, and reporting of Bitcoin holdings. To ensure accountability, a key performance indicator (KPI) \u2013 Bitcoin per share (BTC/share) \u2013 will be introduced. This new metric will provide shareholders with clear insights into the digital asset value attributable to each share.</p><p>Green Minerals is committed to full transparency in the rollout of this innovative strategy. The company will provide regular updates to the market on the progress and implementation of the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, ensuring that investors remain well informed about its development and performance. The Company aims to acquire its first bitcoins over the next few days.</p><p>This strategic move reinforces Green Minerals\u2019 position not only as a leader in sustainable mineral extraction but also as an innovator in financial and technological practices. The company invites all stakeholders to monitor the forthcoming updates as it paves the way towards broader blockchain adoption.</p><h>Disclosure regulation</h><p>This information is subject to the disclosure requirements in article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation and section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.</p><h>Contacts</h><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>              Investor Relations, Green Minerals AS, <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:ir@greenminerals.no\">ir@greenminerals.no</url></p>", "publisher": "Nordic IR - English", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 11, "title": "EU allocates EUR 380m for green transition projects", "published": "2024-10-21", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">October 21 (Renewables Now) - The European Commission said on Monday that it has granted over EUR 380 million (USD 412.2m) to support 133 new green transition projects in Europe.</p><p>The financing is being provided under the LIFE Programme, the EU's funding instrument for the environment and climate action.</p><p>The allocated sum represents over half of the EUR-574-million amount needed for the projects.

The transition from conventional, fossil fuel-based energy systems to cleaner and more sustainable alternatives is not just a proper option, it comes as a necessity for the future of our planet and a crucial tool against global warming and all climate-related issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Energy security and environmental sustainability have pivotal roles in the transition to cleaner energy systems and should be considered not only by governments but also on a more collective level on which humans put continuous and systematic efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Angela Wilkinson, Secretary General and CEO of the World Energy Council, discussed the topic with Renewables Now in light of today's launch event of the Road to Congress series in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The series marks the start of the road to the April 2024 26th World Energy Congress scheduled in Rotterdam next year. She emphasised the significance of bringing the entire energy ecosystem around the table and the role of humans in driving the energy transition process.</p><p>Q: Do you think the efforts towards greening energy supply in the last 20 years have been lacking a greater understanding of the complexity of the whole energy ecosystem? Or maybe it is normal for governments to learn from experience?</p><p>Humanity has faced the challenge of coexisting peacefully on a finite planet for centuries. 100 years ago, no-one imagined we would run out of planet. Today, there is growing awareness and scientific understanding of planetary boundaries. The ways in which energy is used, produced, and supplied is creating an existential risk - catastrophic and irreversible climate change.</p><p>Just as it was 20 years ago, the sheer scope and scale of the world energy system are not well understood. Managing a successful global energy transition is an unprecedented, systemic leadership challenge and collective management problem. We are not simply swapping out one set of supply-side technologies for another, we are turning over an entire system - supply and demand and all the many bits in between. And we are doubling its size to meet the growing demand from emerging and developing economies, as well as cutting down on wasteful practices. The prize is not decarbonisation per se but securing more climate resilient energy for a new model of human development and progress - one which enables harmony between people and planet, rather than growth at any cost.</p><p>As history reminds us, energy transitions are nothing new - the world has shifted from using biomass to extracting fossil fuels. The electricity revolution, which promised life at the push of a button, started over 100 years ago and is focusing attention on new ways to harnessing renewable sources of energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal - as well more modular, next generation nuclear power generation and the rapid emergence of a new global clean hydrogen-based fuels energy vector. Energy transition is not a destination but a continuous, deeply disruptive and societally transformative process which connects energy demand and supply interests and all the bits in between. As we change our ability to produce or harvest new sources and different forms of energy - heat, power, fuels - the underlying power structures in society also shift. There is widespread and common misunderstanding, among politicians and wider energy system stakeholders, that net zero is the destination and closing the global investment gap to accelerate the swap of old supply-side technologies for new, whilst everything else remains the same, will be able to get us there faster than ever.</p><p>Managing a successful global energy transition requires a massive reallocation of economic resources, new ways of planning and permitting development, and the rapid build-up of new energy and non-energy supply chains, including skills and capabilities. And none of this can be achieved all in one go or in the same way in all places or without social support and the involvement of energy consumers and diverse communities. Thankfully, more public, private and civic sector leaders and key decision makers are coming around to the understanding the \"whole system approach\" the World Energy has been promoting for decades. The best way to succeed is not by winning a good vs bad energy argument, but by involving more people and diverse communities in making faster, fairer and more far reaching energy transitions happen.</p><p>To move all of humanity into a clean and safe future, a variety of just and inclusive energy transition pathways are emerging in all regions. The increasing diversity of energy systems in the broadest sense - resources, technologies, people and geographies. This also means there is no \"one size fits all\" solution. The world is heading in the right direction - clean and safe, energy enabled societies - but starting points and capabilities are uneven. It is important to avoid premature technological prescriptions in policy and unfair to impose what works for one region on another. Climate resilient development which supports 10 billion better lives on a healthy planet is a massive juggling act which involves multiple stakeholders and careful attention to multiple objectives, co- benefits, trade-offs and synergies. We are grappling with the 'whole system' leadership and change making challenges by combining leadership dialogue, data transparency and new approaches to multi-scale, multi-sector and multi- stakeholder cooperation. Renewables will need other clean energy and sustainable material friends to get to scale in time.</p><p>Q: Societies are nowadays launching various initiatives to address climate change issues. On a governmental level, which are the most successful policies for securing more affordable energy and reducing carbon at the same time?</p><p>There is a lot of hot air being generated from the cacophony of leadership summits and commercial conferences. There is a lot of heat and friction, but not enough acceleration from a multitude of overlapping, intertwined and contradictory initiatives. We are progressive, practical and pragmatic in showcasing the diversity of solutions and actions underway and in supporting diverse regions and communities learning with and from each other about making faster, fairer and more far-reaching energy transition happen, with special attention to hard-to-abate and vulnerable communities. Successful energy policies, in short, are integrated, policies which deliver clean, inclusive and just energy outcomes!</p><p>Bold and courageous innovation is not all about technology and does not shy away from: (1) the societal transformation opportunity; (2) the materiality challenges in scaling renewable energy technologies; (3) the need for an open and level playing field; and (4) the need to allocate investment to climate resilience and repair. The \"plan\" is not to exceed 1.5 degrees C but we also need to better prepare all societies for overshoot.</p><p>Q: What is the human role in the energy transition process?</p><p>The new energy transition leadership is user-centric - integrated system and services - which challenges the conventional demand- or supply-centric thinking. The new shape of user-centric energy systems is distributed, modular, and multi-directional - a very different form than the capital intensive, centralised and dispatchable flow of existing systems. This also means that demand side management considerations - social norms, uses and user behaviours, land-use planning, etc - have come to the fore, as drivers, enablers and constraints in scaling renewable energy technologies. In addition to hard-to-abate sectors, there are hard-to-abate communities. The clean, justice and inclusive agenda extends transparency and performance tracking to new measures and metrics, with attention to affordability, community resilience, shared services and co-benefits, reskilling and access to jobs, etc.</p><p>Experience of recent crises (Covid-19, climate change impacts, security) has shown that energy systems resilience now extends to people and place-based communities and global energy and non- energy supply chains. Carbon reduction goals and roadmaps are translated into reality through a process of social engagement and learning, real world experimentation involving multiple industries and place-based communities and enabling women and workers, and the next generation of energy leaders to add their perspectives and so that they better understand their role and choices and can hold their leaders to account.</p><p>Energy transition cannot be accelerated by top-down strategic knowledge exchange, in the form of national top-down road-mapping and bottom-up road building which extends cooperation beyond energy supply and demand businesses and industries. It must also address the complex coordination challenge of mobilising bottom-up innovation and horizontal learning.</p><p>At the World Energy Council, our ambition is to increase the pace of transitions by addressing the critical human-centric blind-spots of social and climate change impact risks which are inherent in bottom-up actions to drive implementation faster, fairer and more far-reaching energy transitions.</p><p>For 100 years the World Energy Council has convened energy leaders from all walks of life and across the entire system to, in short, make better energy for everyone everywhere. Our World Energy Congress has been the primary platform for this engagement, bringing together governments, businesses, investors and civil society interests.</p><p>Our 26th Congress will be held in Rotterdam next year, and, is themed \"Redesigning Energy for People and Planet\".

Its\u00a0a\u00a0graphic illustration\u00a0of how green finance, climate action and SDG agendas are intertwining.\u00a0</p><p>Interplay between green and social goals</p><p>The\u00a017 SDGs are interdependent: for example, food production (SDG2) is an individual goal, but food production is connected\u00a0to life on land (SDG15), in the sea (SDG14), as well as water (SDG6) and climate action (SDG13). Similarly, climate mitigation and adaptation is presented as a stand-alone goal (SDG13), but it is also a crosscutting action.</p><p>Achieving the climate goal is reliant on approaching the other SDGs with a climate lens, especially\u00a0Clean Water &amp; Sanitation (SDG6), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7) Industry Innovation &amp; Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities (SDG11) and Life on Land (SDG15).</p><p>In turn, the level of climate action achieved will impact all the other SDGs and\u00a0if and how they will be achieved. Reducing exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events is a sub-goal of the overarching goal of no poverty (SDG1). Food security (SDG2) is expected\u00a0to worsen with climate change.\u00a0Health (SDG3) is another example where climate change is estimated to have severe\u00a0negative impact. Meeting the Goals will involve investment in climate resilience, as well as mitigation.</p><p>All SDGs are impacted by\u00a0climate action</p><p>The list goes on: all SDGs bear some relation to climate action since climate change is a global issue\u00a0that impacts all countries and sectors. Climate is a crosscutting theme relevant to\u00a0SDGs.</p><p>In the\u00a0words of the UN: \"Climate change presents the single biggest threat to development (...) Urgent action to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions is integral to the successful implementation of the SDGs.\"</p><p>SDGs that get the biggest boost from green bonds: 6, 7, 9, 11, 13\u00a0&amp; 15</p><p>All the goals are\u00a0underpinned\u00a0by a series of targets, some financial and some outcome based out to 2030. Our ongoing analysis of green bond investment led Climate Bonds to identify in our January\u00a0Seven Super Trends\u00a0the following six\u00a0out of the 17 SDGs where increased green investment and growth in green bond markets provides direct benefits, particularly in emerging economies.</p><p>-- Clean water and sanitation (SDG6) accounts for 11% of green bond issuance to date. An example is\u00a0Cape Town's Certified green bond, which financed clean water and sanitation assets (SDG6) that are both low carbon and climate resilient.\u00a0</p><p>-- Clean energy (SDG7) remains the largest share of the green bond market (40%), though the share has fallen as the market has diversified over the last years.\u00a0Nigeria's sovereign green bond\u00a0for example allocated the majority of proceeds to renewable energy expansion (SDG7).</p><p>--Sustainable industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9): Low carbon buildings are the second largest segment of the green bond market to date (24%), followed by low carbon transport (15%).</p><p>-- Sustainable cities and communities (SDG11): Many of the assets financed by green bonds are located in cities and they\u00a0address SDG11. Municipalities and city-linked entities, such as utilities and transport companies, are a significant issuer of green bonds.</p><p>-- Climate Action (SDG 13): The rapidly growing green finance sphere is already providing capital for assets that simultaneously contribute to climate action and many of the other SDGs. In the green bond market the vast majority of use of proceeds to date is allocated to climate mitigation and adaptation / resilience, with only a small share allocated to other green assets, such as parks.</p><p>-- Life on land (SDG15): A smaller share of green bonds (3%) is also financing sustainable forestry and agriculture, contributing to SDG15. Poland's sovereign green bond\u00a0included sustainable agriculture, afforestation and conservation and restoration of natural habitat.</p><p>Applying a climate risk lens to all thematic bonds</p><p>While many of the SDGs\u00a0have a social primary focus, a climate-resilient and mitigation lens needs to be applied in order for the social goals to be achieved. Several of the SDGs can be ticked off in an unsustainable manner (not supporting a low carbon future), by\u00a0hitting\u00a0social goals in the short term, but failing to deliver positive impact\u00a0in the medium- to long-term.</p><p>Climate risk disclosure is crucial</p><p>Disclosure of how climate adaptation is addressed in all social assets will enable investors to analyse the green credentials also of SDG-bonds and sustainability bonds. Disclosure allows investors to make informed decisions about investing in assets designed to remain operative in more extreme weather conditions.</p><p>Variable levels of low carbon disclosure</p><p>To date, there are\u00a0varying levels of disclosure on the climate performance of assets financed by SDG-bonds, ESG-bonds and sustainability bonds.</p><p>The\u00a0ESG-labelled covered bonds from M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank\u00a0with proceeds for cooperative housing lack disclosure on the energy efficiency performance of the buildings, which meant its climate profile could not be assessed. \u00a0</p><p>The sustainability bond from\u00a0Indonesia's Tropical Landscapes Finance Facility (TLFF)\u00a0finances sustainable agriculture, conservation of nature corridors for endangered species and restoration of degraded land. Despite the bond being labelled a sustainability bond and not a green bond, the disclosure allowed an analysis of the deal's climate profile.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Scaling investment to meet SDGs</p><p>Green bond investment can be increasingly\u00a0integrated into at least the\u00a0clean water (SDG6), clean energy (SDG7), sustainable industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9), sustainable cities and communities (SDG11), climate action (SDG13) and life on land (SDG15) Goals.

We must prepare today for the 1.5-degree world. The devastating global impacts we see today need not define the society of tomorrow. The escape plan is to double down on adaptation and capture its incredible economic dividends.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, our flagship initiative, the largest adaptation program in the world, has shown us that growth and building resilience are intrinsically linked. But we can do so much more \u2013 together.

Climate change amplifies food insecurity, migration, and conflict. In fragile states, environmental stress can become a security threat. Europe and the world must take this seriously. Investing in resilience is not only right \u2014 it is wise.\u201d He added that \u201cThis is why we need true global cooperation, based on shared interest and shared responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Reflecting on adaptation efforts in Africa and beyond, H.E.

Around the world, resilient infrastructure is the hot new investment class. Climate adaptation is a framework for protecting infrastructure, securing food systems and creating new business and job opportunities. And it is being aided by a thriving market in climate solutions.\u201d He added that \u201cThe continent\u2019s leading initiative in this area \u2013 the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP) \u2013 has already channelled more than $15bn to strengthen essential systems against climate shocks. These funds are helping to secure the adaptability and livelihoods of nearly 60 million vulnerable people in 40 countries.

Dr. Chiavari delivered an eye-opening keynote on the economic costs of climate change. He illustrated the dramatic growth of global GDP since the industrial revolution, juxtaposing this with the environmental toll of fossil fuel consumption and rising CO2 emissions. Chiavari highlighted the critical importance of the social cost of carbon in shaping effective policies.</p><p>Central to his message was the concept of the social cost of carbon, which quantifies the broader societal costs of emissions. \u201cCarbon taxation is not just an environmental necessity but also an economic one,\u201d he asserted. Dr. Chiavari explained how such measures could create the economic incentives needed to steer both corporations and individuals toward sustainable choices. \u201cWell, think again yourself,\u201d Chiavari added. \u201cTurning on the radiator, your benefit is the same as before\u2014having a warmer room. But now your cost is much higher than before.\u201d</p><p>Expanding on this point, Dr. Chiavari emphasised that carbon taxation is designed to target carbon emissions rather than energy consumption itself. \u201cCarbon taxation taxes carbon, it doesn\u2019t tax energy,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo it creates huge incentives for the private sector, for people, for you, for us, for me, to move from fossil fuels to alternative sources of energy. It\u2019s not just about reducing energy or output; it creates huge incentives to switch towards alternative energy sources.\u201d</p><p>Building on this foundation, the panel discussion delved deeper into the practicalities of aligning economic growth with climate resilience, moderated by Dr. Banu Demir Pakel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bridging Policy, Finance, and Action Through a Panel of Perspectives</emphasis>The panel discussion explored the complex interplay between economic growth and climate resilience. Each panellist brought distinct expertise to the conversation, offering fresh perspectives on how global systems can adapt to these twin imperatives.</p><p>Dr. Chiavari emphasised the global nature of addressing climate change, highlighting that emissions transcend borders and require a coordinated international response. He discussed the risks of carbon leakage, where stringent climate policies in one country could lead to emissions being displaced to regions with weaker regulations, ultimately undermining global progress. To mitigate this, Chiavari advocated for policies that foster international collaboration and innovation, ensuring that transitions to sustainable practices are both equitable and comprehensive.</p><p>Dr. Ranger highlighted the economic opportunities that can emerge from climate action, stating, \u201cThis is not just about costs, it\u2019s about opportunities.\u201d Articulating the potential to create jobs and stimulate economic growth while addressing climate risks, Dr. Ranger also stressed the importance of reshaping public narratives. She underscored that effective climate action can foster innovation and progress without imposing a significant financial burden. She also advocates for redirecting fossil fuel and other environmentally damaging subsidies, which globally amount to up to $7 trillion annually, towards green investments, such as renewable energy.</p><p>Leveraging his extensive experience in financial markets, Barrett emphasised the importance of aligning market incentives with sustainability goals. He shared a frank assessment of the sector\u2019s challenges in embracing sustainability, underscoring the profit-driven nature of financial institutions: \u201cThe financial market is driven by the need to make money\u2014whether that\u2019s for its shareholders or investors.\u201d Barrett highlighted the critical need for governments to create enforceable regulatory frameworks, noting that this alignment is essential to channel the sector\u2019s influence towards meaningful climate action.</p><p>On the topic of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks, Barrett expressed concern over their current implementation, noting, \u201cESG has become a tick-box exercise.\u201d He called for stronger policies that ensure accountability and deliver measurable impact, rather than simply meeting superficial compliance standards.</p><p>During a discussion on climate \u201cclubs\u201d, Barrett highlighted the risks of fragmented global efforts. He cautioned, \u201cFor these initiatives to succeed, they need to include all major players. Otherwise, the emissions reductions achieved in some regions could be offset by increased emissions elsewhere.\u201d This, he warned, could undermine the collective progress necessary to address climate challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What Practical Steps Should Governments, Businesses, and Individuals Take to Build a Sustainable Economic Future That Feels Attainable and Secure for Everyone?</emphasis></p><p>Separately, the moderator and panellists were interviewed to expand on this crucial question, providing diverse perspectives on the collaborative roles of governments, businesses, and individuals in addressing climate challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Role of Governments: Policies and Planning</emphasis>Dr. Demir Pakel emphasised the importance of education and awareness in addressing climate change, particularly the role of governments in driving change. \u201cThe government\u2019s role is to start with increasing awareness,\u201d she explained, stressing the need for early education about the consequences of climate change. She highlighted the need for policies that not only incentivise the private sector but also guide consumer behaviour, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s a complex network where governments hold the primary responsibility for planning and guiding action at every level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe private sector needs incentives to be able to take action because they will definitely look shorter-term compared to the government. Therefore, their behaviour needs to be changed, and the government has another role: implementing policies to change the behaviour of both the private sector and consumers,\u201d she added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Market Incentives and Carbon Taxation</emphasis>Dr. Chiavari reinforced the need for government-led interventions, particularly through carbon taxation, as a means to correct market failures. He explained that by incorporating the societal cost of emissions into energy prices, governments can encourage more responsible consumption and investment decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changing the Narrative: A Positive Transition</emphasis>Dr. Ranger reflected on the current challenges in climate action, echoing that a significant part of the problem lies in awareness. \u201cAt the moment, something is going wrong, and I think a lot of that is about the awareness side,\u201d she noted. \u201cGovernments play a role, but the government fundamentally does what the public will vote for. And a lack of awareness of the immediate benefits of a green energy transition\u2014for energy security and public health\u2014is a key problem at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Ranger criticised that the narrative surrounding climate change has failed in recent years by framing it as a costly and burdensome challenge. \u201cParticularly the narrative is this is going to cost a lot of money to deal with. I don\u2019t agree with that view and it is not supported by the evidence. You know, we have to make hard decisions, but what we know is that right now the way we are approaching this is making it harder\u2014specifically, a lack of certainty from government on its policies stalls investment and increases the costs. All the evidence shows that if we get the right policies in place and set a clear path for investors, a just transition is both the lowest cost and more beneficial pathway,\u201d she said.</p><p>Pointing to fossil fuel subsidies, she highlighted how their redirection could catalyse a positive transition. \u201cGlobally, we pump so much money into fossil fuel subsidies\u2014estimates range from five to seven trillion dollars a year. If you stopped that and put it into clean technologies, we would have solved the problem.\u201d</p><p>To address this, Ranger called for a shift in public discourse to emphasise the economic opportunities inherent in climate action. She stressed the role of academics and experts in reshaping the narrative, saying, \u201cWe need to make sure people understand this is a positive transition. Through good government policy, the impact on individuals will not be significant and would actually boost job growth and innovation.\u201d</p><p>Ranger concluded by urging governments to take the lead in changing this narrative, saying, \u201cWhat I\u2019d really like to see is governments getting behind this and saying, \u2018Look, this is what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to benefit you. Here is the pathway. This is what both investors and the public need.\u2019\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Role of Businesses and Individuals: Accountability and Innovation</emphasis>Barrett provided a candid perspective on the role of businesses and individuals in climate action. He highlighted the financial sector\u2019s profit-driven nature, cautioning that it would not lead sustainability efforts without clear regulatory frameworks. \u201cFinancial markets will not do it on their own. They need to be incentivised to act,\u201d he stated. \u201cOnce the financial sector is pointed in a direction and gets enthusiastic about a topic, it can accomplish incredible things, but it requires clear policy and incentives to get there.\u201d</p><p>Barrett also reflected on the role of individuals as voters and consumers, stressing that their choices can significantly influence policy and corporate behaviour. \u201cPolicy needs to be much better at educating the voter about what it wants and how it should expect that to come about,\u201d he remarked. By prioritising sustainable practices and holding policymakers accountable, individuals can drive systemic change.</p><p>While critical of superficial measures such as \u201ctick-box\u201d ESG frameworks, Barrett maintained an optimistic outlook on the potential of finance. \u201cFinance can be incredibly innovative,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt can move mountains and solve real problems, but it needs the right incentives and honest conversations about what\u2019s at stake.\u201d He called for a shift from short-term political cycles to forward-looking strategies, urging all stakeholders to embrace the long-term effort required to address the climate crisis effectively.</p><p>To watch the full session of WERD\u2019s \u201cMacroeconomics and Climate\u201d episode, including the keynote and panel discussion, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/MD5vaMjQdkc\">https://youtu.be/MD5vaMjQdkc</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About EBC Financial Group</emphasis>Founded in the esteemed financial district of London, EBC Financial Group (EBC) is renowned for its comprehensive suite of services that includes financial brokerage, asset management, and comprehensive investment solutions.

Terraware translates science-backed methods for managing and measuring forestry projects into simple, accessible data and digestible action steps for forestry organizations,\u201d said Yishan Wong, Founder and CEO of Terraformation. \u201cThis type of technology is a mission-critical component in the global effort to combat climate change through reforestation, and that is why we made a conscious decision to make it available to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Restoring a biodiverse forest involves a complex and time-consuming set of tasks: mapping planting areas, sourcing native seeds, managing nursery operations, tracking planting progress, adapting to changing conditions, and more. Through years of extensive research and real-world forestry project experience, Terraformation identified the need for advanced, user-friendly tools to support the entire reforestation process. What began as a tool for seed collection has evolved into a comprehensive forest management platform that can be leveraged by forestry teams as well as project investors and funders.</p><p>Terraware was developed and tested with key partners, and over 300 organizations in 60 countries have registered to use Terraware. Key software features include:</p><p>Project Management Tools for Forest Restoration Teams: Terraware streamlines project planning, monitoring, and reporting processes, reducing administrative burdens and freeing up resources to focus on fieldwork.Seamless Reporting for Donors and Investors: With tools like automated reporting templates and a funder portal, Terraware ensures that all stakeholders have access to accurate, up-to-date information on project status, fostering trust and transparency, and enabling better decision-making. (Available to Terraformation\u2019s Accelerator partners)Survival Monitoring for Seed Bank and Nursery Managers: By providing detailed tracking and monitoring of plants as they move from seed germination to seedlings and eventually plants in the field, Terraware helps foresters optimize every part of their project, identify problems earlier, reduce waste, and lower costs.Real-time Tracking for Field Technicians: Terraware\u2019s ability to track data from seed to forest maturity allows foresters to make informed decisions and adapt management practices in response to on-the-ground realities, leading to more resilient forests and higher project success rates.</p><p>\u201cThe insights we gain from Terraware are invaluable. It not only simplifies our project tracking but has also empowered our team to make informed decisions, ensuring our restoration projects remain on course to meet their goals.\u201d \u2014 Benson Tilya, Seed Bank Analyst and Conservation Manager, Saving Africa\u2019s Nature (SANA)</p><p>Terraware is currently in use by forestry and conservation organizations, including participants in Terraformation\u2019s Seed to Carbon Forest Accelerator, a biodiversity-focused, carbon-funded program that supports forestry teams with the skills, tools, and funding access to create investable projects.

These tools facilitate a reliable, real-time tracking of water management and improvements, ensuring that the generated water data is not only verifiable but also transparent and scalable. Nedamco Africa leverages this approach to creating water certificates that employ the Volumetric Water Benefits Accounting (VWBA) 2.0 methodology, which allows for a comprehensive and quantifiable assessment of water management projects. By adhering to rigorous standards Nedamco Africa can guarantee the created certificates reflect genuine improvements in water management, offering an asset in the global efforts to promote sustainable water usage and management.

And yet, one billion people around the world are still served by health-care facilities without reliable electricity or with no electricity access at all. Decentralized renewable energies represent a key opportunity to accelerate electrification of health-care facilities, including in remote areas. I congratulate the Government of India and our partners from Selco Foundation and Ikea Foundation for this critical program, which will have a transformative impact on strengthening the health system\u201d.</p><p>The first-of-a-kind initiative will bring solar energy solutions with efficient medical and electrical equipment to 25,000 healthcare facilities in 12 states by 2026. Across the 12 states under this program, there is a diversity in terms of topography, socio-economic vulnerabilities, disease burden and climate. This diversity across selected geographies will contribute to this programme serving as a showcase globally- innovating on approaches, models and processes relevant for similar contexts in other parts of the world.</p><p>Reflecting on India\u2019s leadership in the effort, Dr. Harish Hande, CEO of SELCO Foundation said, \u201cAffordable and equitable access to healthcare is a function of two aspects- one, resources required to deliver health care, and two, cost of accessing health care. Through this program, SELCO Foundation and IKEA Foundation, along with India\u2019s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and various State Health Missions, will showcase at scale how sustainable energy can be used to make health services affordable at the doorstep of the poor.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Energy for Health\u2019 initiative brings with it positive impacts across the spectrum of stakeholders- for last mile communities in their access to timely healthcare; for health facility staff in ensuring a conducive work environment to provide quality services; for health sector in reducing energy and equipment-related costs as well as avoiding wastage of vaccines and other critical resources; reinforcing climate resilience building and carbon mitigation efforts while ensuring positive health outcomes for all citizens.</p><p>Mr. Per Heggenes, CEO of IKEA Foundation said, \u201c\u2018At the IKEA Foundation, we strongly believe caring for the health of people and our planet must go hand-in-hand. This initiative will improve healthcare outcomes and reduce emissions, by providing reliable and renewable energy to thousands of clinics. Our hope is that the success of this programme can serve as a model for building effective and efficient health systems globally.\u2019</p><p>Supported by IKEA Foundation, through this initiative, SELCO Foundation along with Government of India will create systems and processes that demonstrate ownership, management, and regular maintenance of the energy systems and appliances. Together, through the 25,000 public health facilities, technical knowledge and capacity, as well as guidelines and policies that enable health staff at different levels to plan for public health infrastructure in a sustainable manner will be improved. The program will also improve the local technical network for solar energy, which could potentially also have indirect impacts on local economies and boost adoption of solar energy across other sectors as well.</p><p>The initiative aims to reach over 170 million people across the 12 states and improve working conditions for over 160,000 front line health staff at these health facilities. Across the 25,000 public health facilities, this will add ~100MW of solar energy capacity in the country, and mitigate over 3 million tonnes of CO2e emissions over a 20 year period.

As is characterized by a wide-spreading fibrous roots system allowing it to access surface water and its succulent stems and pads store large quantities of water per hectare. These can be obtained by factory processing and purified for domestic use as acknowledged by the United Nations Food Agriculture Organization. The impact on air pollution, soil remediation, and water provisioning would reach and improve many lives in the dry and arid areas we propose to set up the innovation.</p><p>ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Carbon Capture program as an addition to the Great Green Wall is now being implemented in more than 20 countries across Africa. To date, more than eight billion dollars have been mobilized and pledged for its support internationally.

Hence the degraded areas would be ploughed, thus allowing the planting of the Nopal Cactus as is the practice in Mexico. This is an inexpensive option to protect the environment, begin the rehabilitation of land and soil, and obtain these benefits more efficiently than by the difficult talk of planting trees initially. In fact, planting the Cactus ultimately allows trees to flourish more quickly. Cactus' period to maturity is much shorter and thus benefits the people by producing fruit, vegetables, flour, fertilizer, animal feed, biomass, biofuel, etc.</p><p>The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Program has already been proven with over 1,450 Hectares under management with the support of the Government of Mexico, which has endorsed the Paris Agreement adopted at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (\"COP\") to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNDCC\") and is taking action to mitigate its Green House Gas (\"GHG') emissions in accordance with the Land Use Protocol of the United Nations (LULUCF), by 2030.</p><p>ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture program to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which is made up of fifteen member countries located in the Western African region.

Users of its multimodal simulation offerings include some of the world's busiest transit systems and metros, such as Transport for London, Transport for New South Wales, the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Swedish Transport Administration Trafikverket, and the public transport system of S\u00e3o Paulo SPTrans.</p><p> INRO's products include Emme, a multimodal transportation planning system for urban, regional, and national transportation forecasting; Dynameq, a vehicle-based traffic simulation platform for city-wide traffic planning; and CityPhi, a mobility visualization solution providing data visualization and visual analytics of large-scale mobility and geospatial datasets.</p><p> Combining the capabilities of INRO's advanced traffic and vehicle simulation with Bentley's passenger and pedestrian simulation and civil design software, including CUBE, Streetlytics, LEGION, and OpenRoads, places Bentley in a very strong position to deliver comprehensive mobility digital twins of multimodal transportation systems at urban, metropolitan, regional, and national scale.</p><p> Advancing Mobility Digital Twins</p><p> Urban planners are seeking to understand the ongoing impacts-on transportation system performance, reliability, and accessibility-of the new opportunities and challenges of private and shared mobility, the propensity for cycling or walking, connected autonomous vehicles, and potential congestion charging. With respect to their traditionally circumscribed use of transportation modeling tools in isolation and only on occasion, multiple advantages are now attainable through mobility digital twins, which can be continuously updated with as-operated engineering conditions and with observed traffic data. Mobility digital twins bring these functions together so that infrastructure planning and simulations can be continuously valuable throughout engineering, construction, and operations.</p><p> The pandemic experience reinforces the resilience value of sustaining \"evergreen\" planning and engineering modeling and simulation to maintain fitness for purpose during unanticipated eventualities. With the priority now on \"building back better,\" it is increasingly recognized that the most economical way to augment infrastructure capacity, while accomplishing the needed energy transitions toward climate sustainability, is to optimize the utilization, configuration, and life extension of existing mobility assets, while adding integrated and appealing public transit options.</p><p> This requirement now sets the stage for mobility digital twins that need to be multimodal, need detailed dynamic traffic assignment and agent-based methods for veracity, and need to scale up to systemwide and regionwide-uniquely hallmarks of INRO. As the leader in infrastructure digital twins, Bentley's iTwin platform can now bring together-with the best-validated aggregate and individual vehicle and pedestrian simulation-3D/4D continuous surveying and reality modeling, civil engineering and project delivery, and asset and network performance. Ultimately, the opportunity for digital cities is to save their constituents time in their day, while at the same time improving congestion and climate resilience, and safety.</p><p> \"We are very pleased to welcome INRO to Bentley Systems,\" said Robert Mankowski, senior vice president, digital cities, Bentley Systems. \"Professor Michael Florian and his team led the research of advanced multimodal network modeling methods which helped establish state-of-the-art mobility simulation, and in this next generation his son Dan is leading its software future in our mobility digital twin advancement.

As part of an annual decision-making process, Takeda employees worldwide voted to add IntraHealth International, Jhpiego, Pathfinder International and the World Food Programme (WFP) as new partners for the Global CSR Program, which now supports 20 programs in 72 countries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Takeda's commitments to these new partners in FY2021 include:</p><p>  JPY 953 million to IntraHealth International to work with 12 private schools in Mali, Senegal and Niger to increase the number of qualified, trained nurses who can serve rural communities facing a critical shortage of health workers in these countries. Over the next five years, the project will help private schools partner with the public sector, achieve the appropriate accreditations, enhance competency-based curricula, create effective learning approaches and graduate students from underserved areas-all as part of the effort to ensure that everyone everywhere has access to healthcare. JPY 890 million to Jhpiego's iWIN project, to help accelerate progress in preventing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity by mending the fragmented maternal and child health ecosystem in India via a holistic, woman-centered approach. Over the next five years, the project will catalyze adoption of an Indian-owned model to continuously track and utilize ground-breaking information on the health of pregnant women to create a sustainable, next generation approach to coordinated, patient-centered care before, during and post pregnancy. JPY 1 billion to Pathfinder International to advance women's and girls' leadership in responding to the disproportionate impact of climate change and emergencies on women's health. Operating in South and Southeast Asia over four years, the project will position women and girls as change agents in places where gender inequalities and climate-related crises reduce their quality of health. The project will strengthen access to equitable health services, build community resilience to climate shocks and help women forge their own path to a healthier future. JPY 1.3 billion to the World Food Programme's Project Boreas, over the next five years. The project will enhance the capacity of the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot in Accra, Ghana, to more efficiently receive, store and transport temperature-sensitive health products in 17 countries in West Africa. The project will create a regional Logistics Knowledge Centre where supply chain professionals and national governments can receive training on best-in-class supply chain practices, ensuring that they are better equipped to face and manage health emergencies. \"We at IntraHealth are thrilled to be partnering with Takeda to address the shortage of highly trained nurses in rural communities in Mali, Senegal and Niger. This partnership will revolutionize health worker training at private nursing schools, improve health care in the communities that need it most and attract more brilliant young students to the profession,\" said Polly Dunford, president and CEO of IntraHealth International.</p><p> \"Jhpiego is humbled and excited to have won the confidence of Takeda's employees to implement the Integrated Women in Health Network (iWIN) project in Madhya Pradesh, India. It is incredibly inspiring to be motivated by a shared belief: that all women deserve access to the high-quality pregnancy care that saves lives. Together, we will build a mother-focused, scalable maternal and newborn health system by raising quality and continuity of care and leveraging predictive analytics and innovative financing,\" said Leslie Mancuso, president and CEO of Jhpiego.</p><p> \"Pathfinder is honored to work with Takeda to advance the leadership of women and girls. This project is a living example of Takeda's commitment to better health for people and a brighter future for the world. We will elevate women's leadership in South and Southeast Asia for improved health and climate resilience,\" said Lois Quam, president and CEO of Pathfinder International.</p><p> \"The World Food Programme is honored to have been chosen by Takeda's employees as part of their Global CSR Program for a project that is so timely and important. The COVID-19 pandemic served as an important reminder of the need for countries to be prepared for, and equipped to respond to, health emergencies. With Takeda's help, we aim to provide critical support in 17 countries across West Africa - safeguarding vulnerable communities and building capacity for the future,\" said Tim Hunter, director of Private Partnerships and Fundraising at WFP.</p><p> Since launching in 2016, Takeda's signature Global CSR Program has committed a total of 16.5 billion yen to 17 international and non-governmental organizations on 20 long-term projects that address more than 23 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Targets in 72 countries. Each project addresses strengthening health systems in unique ways and aligns with countries' national health needs. These four- to 10-year funding commitments reflect that sustainable impact takes time and there are no quick fixes to the complex and longstanding challenges that health systems face.</p><p> \"We are proud to partner with IntraHealth International, Jhpiego, Pathfinder International and the World Food Programme to increase the number of qualified health workers, transform supply chains, address the impact of climate change, conflict and emergencies on women's health, and leverage data and digital to transform maternal and newborn care,\" said Takako Ohyabu, Takeda chief global corporate affairs officer. \"All our new partnerships address endemic challenges health systems face today while empowering communities to be ready for the future.\"</p><p>Takeda's Global CSR Program partnerships have made notable progress since 2016:</p><p>  Reached more than 5.84 million direct beneficiaries; Trained more than 32,000 qualified health workers; Provided more than 570,000+ community members with targeted health education; Immunized millions of children against preventable diseases such as measles; and Our partners are on track to reach 18.4 million direct beneficiaries by 2027, providing lifesaving care for vulnerable women and newborns, preventing stunting, strengthening holistic support for refugees, and so much more.
