Under this deal, Globos Osiguranje has sponsored five EV ARC solar-powered EV charging stations that are now deployed at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, Serbia's busiest international travel hub, and will provide free public electric vehicle (EV) charging.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In order to facilitate this sponsored Driving on Sunshine initiative, Beam Global previously secured an agreement with Belgrade Airport, part of VINCI Airports, an operator of over 70 airports in 14 nations across the globe, to operate the network in prime locations at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport with further cooperation with VINCI Airports to be considered.</p><p>This milestone three-way partnership marks Beam Global\u2019s entry into an owner-operator business model, generating income through a long-term annuity stream with recurring payments. By retaining ownership of the EV ARC systems, Beam Global secures a steady, predictable revenue stream while delivering sustainable solutions. Globos Osiguranje is uniquely able to provide Driving on Sunshine sponsored EV charging for free to EV owners because EV ARC systems do not require utility electricity and do not generate costs for the energy dispensed. Providing the EV charging for free while monetizing the sponsorship significantly lowers administrative costs and risks. The amenity value delivered to site hosts enables Beam Global to receive highly favorable economic terms on the parking spaces in which the EV ARC systems are placed. This unique model means that sponsorship payments are not diluted by typical operating costs which might burden companies that do not have Beam Global\u2019s technology advantage.</p><p>\u201cI have been describing this sponsorship model for several years. The partnership with Globos Osiguranje at the Belgrade Airport is an exciting milestone for Beam Global as we continue to expand across Europe and it\u2019s very exciting in that it validates the Driving on Sunshine sponsorship model,\u201d said Desmond Wheatley, CEO of Beam Global. \u201cWe are delighted to be working with Vinci. Airports represent a tremendous opportunity for sustainable infrastructure solutions but they cannot afford to have their parking lots disrupted by construction and electrical work because they work 365 days a year. With this sponsorship model and our zero construction deployments, we are opening doors for similar engagements in major travel hubs throughout the world. We\u2019re committed to providing clean, reliable off-grid EV charging solutions that not only meet the growing demand for public charging infrastructure but also create a sustainable, recurring revenue stream for Beam with very favorable terms and no disruption for our airport or other partners.\u201d</p><p>Five solar-powered EV ARC units are now deployed for public EV charging at the Belgrade Airport. Each off-grid unit can charge multiple vehicles at once, making it a resilient and sustainable solution for the airport\u2019s high-traffic environment. The systems are positioned in P1, Prime, the closest car park to the terminal building.</p><p>\u201cWe are proud to be at the forefront of promoting sustainable energy solutions in Serbia through this sponsorship with Beam Global,\u201d said Sini\u0161a Pratljacic, CEO at Globos Osiguranje. \u201cBy sponsoring EV ARC products at one of Serbia\u2019s most frequented locations, we are taking an important step in our commitment to environmental responsibility and green innovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are proud to make Belgrade Airport the first airport in the world to offer free, standalone, 100% solar-powered EV charging\u201d said Chivoine Rem, Belgrade Airport CEO. We are proud to lead the way in innovations and sustainable business practices, with a strong focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, protecting biodiversity and sustainable waste management. Our commitment to minimizing our carbon footprint aligns with VINCI Airports\u2019 global policy, which aims for zero CO2 emissions by 2050. To optimize energy consumption and to reduce CO2 emissions, we employ a range of strategies \u2013 we are already producing the energy from our solar power plant for couple of years and besides previously installed chargers at Tesla parking we are offering our customers with solar-powered EV chargers. These initiatives make Belgrade Airport unique in Serbia. Filling their EVs with renewable energy while they are here is an excellent example of the benefits that we are working to create.

A consistent map of land cover for the entire world based on the most current satellite information, the 2020 Global Land Cover Map can be combined with other data layers for green infrastructure, sustainability projects, and other conservation efforts that require a holistic picture of both the human and natural footprint on the planet. Later this year, Esri and Impact Observatory will make this new land cover model available to support on-demand land cover classification, allowing the GIS community to create maps for project areas as often as every week.</p><p> \"This is a critical year for climate action,\" said Jack Dangermond, Esri founder and president. \"With the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) bringing international parties together to address a set of common goals, we are happy to do our part in making this map available to users that are working towards the health of our planet.\"</p><p> Users will also be able to manipulate the map in association with other GIS layers such as terrain, hydrology, and more, all available in ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, the foremost collection of geographic information from around the globe, including maps, apps, and data layers. Through the visualizations being released, planners worldwide will better understand the geography around them to make more informed decisions-enabling them to gain insight into locations with distinctive land cover, as well as human activity affecting them.</p><p> High-resolution, open, accurate, comparable, and timely land cover maps are critical for decision-makers in many industry sectors and developing nations. These maps improve understanding of important topics such as food security, land use planning, hydrology modeling, and resource management planning. In addition, national government resource agencies use land cover as a basis for understanding trends in natural capital, which helps define land planning priorities and is the basis of budget allocations.</p><p> Impact Observatory, contracted by Esri, developed a deep learning AI land classification model using a massive training dataset of billions of human-labeled image pixels, and applied this model to the Sentinel-2 2020 scene collection, processing over 400,000 Earth observations to produce the map. The unique machine learning approach used to create this global map will soon be available on demand, supporting land managers who need to monitor change in a specific area of interest, looking at annual change and seasonal differences in land cover.</p><p> \"Global efforts are urging world leaders to set and achieve ambitious conservation targets,\" said Steve Brumby, Impact Observatory co-founder and CEO. \"With support from the geospatial experts at Esri, and access to incredible compute resources at Microsoft, we were able to build in record time a land cover map that provides leaders in governments, NGOs, and across industries with a novel, timely view of the planet, and a new AI-powered capability for actionable, science-based insights on demand. In doing so, Impact Observatory hopes to contribute towards the global conservation effort.\"</p><p> Esri is releasing this valuable resource under a Creative Commons license to encourage broad adoption and ensure equitable access for planners creating a more sustainable planet.
