Investors appeared to consider the agreement positive for the energy companies, as shares of lignite plant operator RWE rose sharply after the announcement.</p><p>Almost one year after a government-appointed commission agreed in principle on phasing out coal in Germany, the government, mining states and coal plant operators have ironed out the coal exit's details. Economy minister Peter Altmaier said a \"breakthrough\" had been achieved in high-level talks in Angela Merkel's chancellery during the night and that the \"necessary but difficult decisions\" ultimately had been made in consensus. He added an agreement had also been found on compensation payments for lignite plant operators, arguing that Germany would \"end the age of coal-fired power production in a plannable and economically prudent manner.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Environment minister Svenja Schulze called the agreement \"a big step\" for climate protection and an important international signal. \"We are the world's first country to exit nuclear and coal in a binding way.\" She stressed that the exit will start immediately, and that a \"massive roll-out\" of renewables is necessary to make it a success.</p><p>But many analysts favouring ambitious emissions reductions and environmentalists were not impressed because they said the proposed pace of the exit was too slow. \"The government has driven the coal compromise into the ground. There is no steady emissions reduction between 2023 and 2030,\" said Felix Matthes, research coordinator for energy and climate policy at the Institute for Applied Ecology.</p><p>A graph showing the lignite plant shutdown schedule for Germany 2020-2038 is available here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/paragraph_text_image/public/paragraphs/images/lignite-exit-schedule-germany-001.png?itok=WDHUazGL\">https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/paragraph_text_image/public/paragraphs/images/lignite-exit-schedule-germany-001.png?itok=WDHUazGL</url></p><p>Source: BMWi 2020.</p><p>Dave Jones, analyst at British climate NGO Sandbag, said it was \"hard to paint this as good news,\" because decommissioning starts too slowly and finishes too late. With reference to an increase in RWE's share price following the agreement, Hanns Koenig from Aurora Energy Research said: \"Whatever one may think about today's German coal exit announcement, investors clearly think it's a good deal for RWE.\"</p><p>According to media reports, RWE will receive EUR 2.6 billion in compensation payments, while operators in eastern Germany will get EUR 1.75 billion.</p><p>The agreement makes Germany the largest economy on the globe with concrete plans to end the use of coal to produce electricity. A coal exit is more difficult for Germany in comparison to many other countries, because it is still heavily reliant on the fossil fuel, some of which is still mined domestically, and because it is phasing out nuclear power at the same time in its landmark energy transition (Energiewende) towards renewables.</p><p>The government said the agreement would honour the coal exit commission's compromise and pave the way for a decommissioning path that the electricity grid \"can cope with.\"\u00a0According to the agreement, the total lignite capacity will be reduced to 15 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2022, with eight plants operated by RWE in western Germany going offline by that year. In a second phase starting two years later in 2025 and ending in 2029, capacity will be cut to 8.8 GW. A total of eleven units are to be taken offline, three of which are transferred into security standby. Five of these eleven units are operated by RWE in the west and six by LEAG, a subsidiary of Czech investor EPH, in eastern Germany.\u00a0</p><p>During the last phase starting in the 2030s, the remaining eleven lignite units in the country are scheduled for decommissioning between 2034 and 2038, the year agreed by the coal exit commission as the very last for the fossil fuel in the country. But the agreement also says there will be an assessment in 2026 and 2029 to see whether the last phase of decommissioning in the 2030s can be brought forward by three years. In this case, the coal exit would be completed in 2035 instead of 2038.</p><p>The government said it will increase the expansion of renewable energy sources to reach the goal of a 65% share in power consumption by 2030 in order to compensate for the closure of coal power. It will also seek to expand combined heat and power systems and install \"two gas plant capacities\" to cushion \"the vanishing of large quantities of controllable energy,\" the government statement read.</p><p>Finance minister Olaf Scholz said the agreement would ensure that the phase-out's provisions will be implemented over the course of the next two decades \"even if the government at the time will be different from the one we have now.\" The government's plan is to finish the agreement's legislative procedure in the first half of 2020.</p><p>Regarding the opening of a new hard coal plant, Datteln 4, economy minister Altmaier said that operator Uniper had already obtained a permit for commissioning the plant and that the government gave it the green light due to the \"complex\" compensation payment scheme. He added that the coal exit commission's proposal to not let the plant go online had been formulated \"cautiously\" and it ultimately turned out that more CO2\u00a0could be saved if older plants were closed earlier instead.</p><p>GreenpeaceGermany head Martin Kaiser, who was a member of the coal commission, said the decision to open a new coal plant this year clearly showed that the government doesn't address the climate crisis. \"The first assessment will reveal that Germany can and must exit coal much quicker. This is the only way to stick to the Paris Climate Agreement.\"</p><p>An agreement was also found on conserving Hambach Forest, which RWE planned to clear to make room for a nearby lignite mine. The forest has became a symbolic battle ground for climate activists from Germany and beyond, and will now be spared. However, the neighbouring open cast mine Garzweiler is still going to be needed for supply security reasons, the government said. This means that several adjacent villages will be demolished as planned.</p><p>Given the possibility that power prices will rise in the wake of the coal plant shutdowns, energy-intensive companies that compete internationally will receive an \"appropriate subsidy\" by 2023, the government said. Altmaier said that additional government earnings generated with the new CO2\u00a0pricing scheme in the transport and buildings sectors would be used to lower Germany's renewable energy surcharge and thereby also the power price. With reference to concerns that the coal exit could compromise the country's power supply security, the economy minister stressed that Germany already today often imports power. However, its current \"excess production\" of electricity was likely to abate in the wake of the coal phase-out and a \"European power market\" would develop further. \"We're sure that a sufficient power supply can be guaranteed,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Industry lobby group BDI called the agreement \"unsatisfactory,\" arguing it would violate central aspects of the coal commission's compromise. BDI president Dieter Kempf said the commission \"for a reason\" had stressed that its proposals have to be implemented word by word for the phase-out to remain consistent. \"The agreement doesn't make any mention of compensation for higher grid fees, which would have benefitted all power customers.\" Apart from that, companies could expect higher costs in the European emissions trading system (ETS), which would damage Germany as a location for industrial production.</p><p>The agreement also confirmed the structural support payments for coal mining regions in the states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, and that workers in lignite plants and mines are going to receive so-called \"adjustment money\" until 2043, a provision that already exists for workers in the hard coal sector.

The open letter signatories say that is not enough as it would only cover 6% of more than 850 warehouse buildings Amazon has worldwide. By December 2018, the online retailer had rooftop solar installations totalling more than 70 MW at 43 fulfilment buildings.</p><p>Since 2014, Amazon has made a number of investments in solar and wind farms in the US. It recently said it has enabled 53 wind and solar projects worldwide, with a combined capacity of more than a gigawatt. Several large wind and solar farms in Virginia, Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio, were built by the end of 2017, but Amazon made no new project announcements in 2017 and 2018. It was only this April that it announced it would be purchasing the output of three new wind farms totalling over 229 MW in Ireland, Sweden and the US to support its still unclear sustainability targets. These will bring its renewable power output to 2.7 TWh annually, the company calculates.</p><p>Trading green for black?</p><p>The lack of much activity on the renewable energy front in the last two years prompted Amazon's climate-conscious employees to start banding together, while outside the company it became a subject of some damning reports.</p><p>In February, Greenpeace published the \"Clicking Clean Virginia - The Dirty Energy Powering Data Center Alley\" report, accusing Amazon of neglecting its clean energy commitments. The report focuses on the electricity demand of cloud computing companies grouped in a cluster called Data Center Alley in Virginia. According to Greenpeace, Amazon Web Services' (AWS) data centres in operation and under construction require close to 1.7 GW of power in the state. It is estimated that AWS' current renewable energy use is just 12%.</p><p>Virginia is primarily a regulated electricity market, which means customers have limited choice in what type of power they purchase and from whom. Greenpeace explains that the energy mix of commercial customers, including data centres, is that of their local utility. Dominion Energy, the primary provider for Data Center Alley, sources only 4% of its electricity from renewables and it has used the rise in electricity demand from data centres in Virginia to justify the construction of a USD-7-billion new fracked gas pipeline.</p><p>Since 2017, AWS has expanded its operations in Virginia by 59% without adding new renewable energy capacity, and in the process it has become the biggest driver of electricity demand growth in Data Center Alley, Greenpeace says. In addition, Virginia is chosen to be the home of Amazon's second headquarters in the US.</p><p>Sometime after the Greenpeace report, tech website Gizmodo revealed that Amazon has also been actively working to win over as clients the world's largest oil and gas companies since at least 2017. Gizmodo said it had viewed several documents detailing Amazon's pitches and strategies to offer oil, gas and coal businesses the best technology AWS can provide to optimise the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. The AWS' own website shows countless pages of case studies, blog posts and solutions, such as machine learning, big data tools, internet-of-things and automation, which can support the operations of companies in the fossil fuel sector. So it appears that AWS is selling its fossil fuel-powered cloud services to the fossil fuel industry to help it successfully dig out more fossil fuels, part of which will come back to power the ever-growing data centres.</p><p>Amazon's employees listed in their shareholder proposal several extreme weather events that directly impacted the company's operations and infrastructure and pointed out that \"Amazon is not a mere victim of climate change-its operations contribute significantly to the problem.\" They call on the firm to follow its leadership principle on \"Ownership\" to consider long-term climate risks.</p>", "publisher": "SeeNews Renewables", "instances": ["com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees have signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the company's board of directors urging them to prioritise climate action plans that would cover not only all of the company's businesses, but also the supply chain.

If fans purchase tickets for a show in the U.S. or Canada and can't attend, they'll have the option to resell them to other fans at the original price paid.

This applies to all shows except those in Colorado, Illinois, and New York where Face Value Exchange cannot be mandated.

It also featured ways to accelerate women's economic opportunity through gender-responsive procurement and called for more commitment makers to jumpstart change for women around the world by joining the Accelerator.</p><p> Women entrepreneurs have historically faced many obstacles including a lack of access to capital, fewer entrepreneurship networks compared with men, and policies that discourage female labor market participation.1 These barriers are compounded by unequal laws. A 2022 World Bank study found that nearly 2.4 billion women of working age still do not enjoy the same economic rights as men. Of the 190 economies examined in the study, 178 maintain legal barriers that prevent women's full economic participation, while women continue to face some form of job restriction in 86 countries. In 95 countries, women are not guaranteed equal pay for equal work and 76 countries have laws which limit women's rights to land ownership, a vital resource for poverty reduction.2</p><p> To address these structural and cultural barriers which women entrepreneurs face, the Women's Entrepreneurship Accelerator was launched during the UN General Assembly in 2019 in partnership with 6 UN agencies with the goal to create an enabling ecosystem for women entrepreneurs while maximizing their sustainable development impact.</p><p> Specific to the topic of the event, data reveals that women entrepreneurs are able to look at business investment beyond just financial returns and recognize that achieving financial returns and social returns are not mutually exclusive. For instance, according to the 2020 Global Entrepreneur Report by BNP Paribas, 54 percent of women entrepreneurs say that beyond income, reducing their carbon footprint is their top measure of success in investing, compared to just 41 percent of men.3</p><p> Opening the event, Deborah Gibbins, Chief Operating Officer of Mary Kay Inc., called for the dismantling of barriers women face and described how \"climate change is not gender neutral. Women and girls are paying the heaviest price. Their heightened vulnerability is a direct consequence of gender inequalities in the political, social, cultural, and economic fabric of the societies in which they live.\" Ms. Gibbins added that women are at the forefront of the climate response and have for generations \"been using innovative tactics in mitigating the impact of climate change. This is not new. What they now need is the recognition for their leadership and an ecosystem that works for them.\"</p><p> Noting how the Covid-19 pandemic has rolled back progress on gender equality, Vic Van Vuuren, Director Enterprises Management, International Labour Organization, outlined how \"women are already actors in the green economy as entrepreneurs, managers, farmers, workers in eco-tourism, waste management, and renewable energy. However, we need to acknowledge that the inroads we are making are not adequate. We need to mainstream gender and gender equality in all global policies, business policies and national policies.\"</p><p> Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Executive Director of the International Trade Centre, noted how \"micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those owned by women, face barriers when making their business practices more sustainable. We, at the International Trade Centre take a holistic approach to support women's entrepreneurship to ensure they contribute to a sustainable and green economy. Supporting women-owned businesses is not only good for the economy, it also accelerates our transition towards sustainability.\"</p><p> Calling for equal opportunities in the green economy for greater impact, Stephen Bereaux, Deputy to the Director of the International Telecommunication Union, underscored the nexus between women's entrepreneurship in the creation of innovative, just, and inclusive solutions to climate change and sustainability. \"If women are able to participate, sustainable practices and business models scale more quickly,\" outlined Mr. Bereaux.</p><p> Stressing the importance of an inclusive green recovery, Haoliang Xu, Assistant Secretary-General and Director of the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support at the United Nations Development Programme, spoke of how \"UNDP firmly believes we're probably facing the biggest challenge of our generation, and we have to build back better. We have to make it right for generations of women to come.\"</p><p> Sanda Ojiambo, Executive Director and CEO of the United Nations Global Compact, spoke of the power of the private sector in challenging orthodoxies and that \"for lasting solutions and climate justice to become a reality, women entrepreneurs must have a place at the table and be included throughout the value chain.\"</p><p> In terms of impactful solutions, Anita Bhatia, Assistant Secretary-General and Deputy Executive Director of UN Women, called for more gender-responsive procurement which \"sets a high standard for procurers of goods and services to say we want to purchase only or predominantly from women-owned businesses. This is good for women because it gives them a leg up and gives their businesses a leg up in the supply chain.\"</p><p> Underscoring the need for more action and more cross-sectoral partnerships, Aldijana \u00c5 i\u00c5\\xA1i\u00c4?, Chief of Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships and Engagement at UN Women, spoke of the interrelated actions needed to respond to and address the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and gender inequality. \"Tackling climate change is not only about protecting the planet, it is also about dismantling the barriers to progress. Women-owned and led micro, small and medium enterprises are increasingly recognized as key to providing climate solutions. We need to expedite the process and we need to invest more.\"</p><p> Moderating the event, Elizabeth Vazquez, President, CEO, and Co-Founder of WEConnect International, called out that \"women represent 51 percent of the world's population, own 33 percent of all private businesses, but earn only 1 percent of global spend on products and services by large corporations.\" If the Global Goals are to be achieved by 2030, Ms. Vazquez urged stakeholders \"to act with intention, with urgency, and in partnership with each other and to be much more proactive.\"</p><p> A recording of the event is available here.</p><p> About the Women's Entrepreneurship Accelerator</p><p> The Women's Entrepreneurship Accelerator (WEA) is a multi-stakeholder partnership on women's entrepreneurship established during UNGA 74. It convenes six UN agencies, International Labour Organization (ILO), International Trade Centre (ITC), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Global Compact (UNGC), UN Women and Mary Kay Inc. to empower 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2030.</p><p> The ultimate goal of the initiative is to maximize the development impact of women entrepreneurship in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by creating an enabling ecosystem for women entrepreneurs around the world.

On June 15-16, 2021, at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit, Gibbins spoke at the \"Women in Sustainability: Innovating in a Man's World\" main stage session advocating for women entrepreneurs as the role models needed by the economy and the society and emphasizing the critical mission of the Accelerator: \"Women entrepreneurship will play a key role in the successful pandemic recovery. This is why the mission of the Women's Entrepreneurship Accelerator is so timely. And, this is why women entrepreneurs need a framework of this magnitude,\" said Gibbins. The annual Summit convened virtually more than 25,000 leaders from business, government, the UN, and civil society, to take stock of the state of progress and to drive collective action towards alleviating climate crisis, global pandemic, economic disparities, and social inequalities.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) today releases its Low Carbon Transition Plan (LCTP), which provides a transparent and detailed view on how we plan to achieve our climate ambitions, measure success, and report on progress.</p><p> The plan brings forward PMI's ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality in its direct operations (scopes 1+2) by five years, to 2025, and to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire value chain (scopes 1+2+3) by 10 years, to 2040. In addition, it introduces a new goal for PMI's critical suppliers to adopt science-based targets (SBTs) in line with the SBTs that PMI has already committed to, aligned with the 1.5&amp;amp;deg;C pathway necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The importance of this new target is linked to the relevance attributed to supplier engagement, which is essential to support the achievement of PMI's CO2 reduction targets for scope 3 over time, allowing the company to maintain its leadership role in climate actions. The LCTP links these considerable ambitions to the company's purpose and even greater fundamental ambition of ridding the world of cigarettes, while further seeking a net-positive impact on society.</p><p> \"By presenting our low-carbon transformation strategy, we hope to encourage change and foster engagement with investors and other stakeholders who will be able to evaluate whether our company is appropriately adapting its business model for success in a net-zero carbon economy,\" said Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer. \"The LCTP showcases how our targets are underpinned by detailed operational measures and a solid business strategy, which are vital to translate ambition into action, achievement, and impact, and most important, the only way to safeguard the sustainability of our business and to help contribute to wider societal action.\"</p><p> Delivering on climate ambitions to create long-term value</p><p>PMI has adopted a three-step approach to achieving its emissions targets: 1) reducing consumption and optimizing efficiency to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 2) minimizing the use of fossil fuels and promoting the switch to renewable energy, and 3) compensating unavoidable emissions by prioritizing insetting projects (nature-based solutions) and purchasing high-quality carbon credits.</p><p> \"Strong action must be taken to reduce the risks of climate change and stop the destruction of nature. We believe that PMI must play its part in protecting vulnerable ecosystems and communities around the world by reducing our environmental impact across our value chain, and by defining and executing strategies and initiatives to achieve our long-term targets,\" said Massimo Andolina, SVP, Operations. \"Our business and sustainability strategies are advancing hand-in-hand with increasing momentum, and we are investing in innovative programs and taking a multidisciplinary approach to reducing the environmental impact of our products, operations, and value chain.\"</p><p> Investing in nature-based solutions: Portfolio of Climate Investments</p><p> Recognizing that with today's technologies, some emissions are unavoidable, PMI's approach to carbon pricing announced last year includes the introduction of two complementary internal carbon prices: a shadow price of USD 65 per ton of CO2 e and a carbon levy of USD 8 per ton of CO2 e. The shadow price helps in the prioritization of business cases for investment in activities aimed at structurally reducing carbon emissions, while the carbon levy helps size the investments required today to decrease GHG emissions through offsetting and insetting initiatives.</p><p> Guiding these initiatives, PMI has created its Portfolio of Climate Investments (PCI), which will provide transparency in the activities necessary to further the company's decarbonization efforts. The PCI's advisory committee is responsible for managing and allocating the budget for climate-investment solutions along three main lines of intervention: purchases of high-quality carbon credits to support short-term neutrality targets, investments in insetting projects within PMI's value chain to support long-term net-zero ambitions, and investments in innovative technologies that can help permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p> Social and Environmental Connectivity</p><p> Climate change impacts not only the environment but also people's livelihoods. PMI's efforts to combat climate change are not limited to working towards carbon neutrality in its operations and across its entire value chain. The company is also working to adapt to the impact of climate change and increase the resilience of its business and the communities where it operates. Recognizing that sustainability challenges do not exist in a vacuum but are often linked to one another and must be considered to craft appropriate solutions, PMI commissioned Article One to prepare a briefing paper, entitled: \"Climate Justice in Global Supply Chains: A Perspective for the Private Sector.\" The paper will discuss the connectivity between environmental and social issues, drawn from the impacts of climate change, as well as the ability to shape solutions that are mutually reinforcing.</p><p> Recognitions of PMI's climate action progress</p><p> In the S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings' ESG Evaluation report, PMI was recognized not only as a leader in the transition to carbon neutrality but an industry differentiator for its approach to carbon pricing. The company was also included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America for the first time last year, achieving the highest score of 100 in the climate strategy, environmental reporting, and environmental policy and management systems categories. In 2020, PMI was one of just 10 companies worldwide to receive the prestigious \"Triple A\" score for environmental sustainability leadership by CDP, and maintained its position on CDP's A List for Climate Change for the seventh year in a row. In addition, CDP placed PMI on its Supplier Engagement leaderboard for the fourth consecutive year.</p><p> To access PMI's LCTP Report, as well as additional information on PMI's approach to sustainability, please refer to the LCTP Report and PMI Sustainability. To review PMI's integrated performance, please refer to PMI's 2020 Integrated Report, which includes progress on the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. The report addresses some recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), while the remainder are covered by the company's reporting to CDP.</p><p>Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future</p><p>Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company, its shareholders, and other stakeholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. In addition, versions of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of IQOS and its consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities, and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products and oral nicotine products. As of September 30, 2021, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets in key cities or nationwide, and PMI estimates that approximately 14.9 million adults around the world have already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.
