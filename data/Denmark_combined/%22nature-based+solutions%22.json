The\u00a0leading\u00a0carbon\u00a0emitters could eliminate\u00a075% to 90%\u00a0of the gap between emissions under current policies and their individual 2050 2 degrees Celsius Paris targets using generally accepted technologies. For the remaining gap, remedies also already exist but require further advancement and scaling. The next step is to combine these technologies with strong policy frameworks to achieve carbon neutrality, while considering maturity levels and sector-relevance in a more resilient post-COVID world. With the global market of climate technologies expected to grow to USD 1 trillion-2 trillion per year by 2030, this approach can create new sectors, jobs, and financial opportunities for companies that could yield significant economic benefits. Further, private research and development for continued innovation such as enabling technology, implementing business models and establishing new market structures is critical for a successful energy transition, as noted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Innovation should play a central role in all businesses' strategy going forward.</p><p>However, the\u00a0refusal to pursue a carbon-neutral energy transition is in itself an economic\u00a0matter. The global GDP\u00a0in 2020 is\u00a0forecasted\u00a0to drop 2.4% due to COVID-19, and we\u00a0are currently living through the intense economic consequences of this downturn.\u00a0Aligning the global COVID-19 recovery strategy with decarbonisation targets in the energy sector\u00a0is not just an opportunity\u00a0for a green transition, but\u00a0an opportunity to grow our economies sustainably by approximately 3.5%. This increase would directly produce about 27 million jobs worldwide through 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>Furthermore, carbon pricing schemes can provide more significant and immediate change as they not only\u00a0work to\u00a0lower emissions, but also increase GDP and\u00a0create\u00a0areas for\u00a0business\u00a0growth. Specifically, carbon\u00a0pricing\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0can potentially\u00a0unlock\u00a0additional public revenues of estimated USD 2.8 trillion annually\u00a0by\u00a02030. This economic gain can be\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0further the long-term transition to an inclusive and\u00a0clean\u00a0energy economy, and\u00a0provide\u00a0the predictability needed for businesses to commit to\u00a0low-carbon alternatives.\u00a0There has already been some\u00a0development in this area. In 2018, governments\u00a0raised\u00a0approximately USD 44 billion in carbon pricing revenues, with more than half generated by carbon taxes. While these are welcomed steps, such efforts alone might not be enough as\u00a0some countries still lag on meeting\u00a0the targets set by the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Failure to address these climate issues have significant environmental, health and economic consequences. In fact, an uncurbed continued temperature rise could cause an estimated\u00a0global drop\u00a0in GDP of up to 30%.\u00a0</p><p>All these efforts should be supported by cohesive multilateral policy coordination, but such\u00a0initiatives in the past have not yielded results. A more effective short-term approach therefore would be for governments to individually step forward in partnership with the international and domestic business communities to create meaningful progress and pave the way for more effective international cooperation going forward. This is the only realistic path to accelerating emission reductions\u00a0as an immediate priority. In the long-term, strengthening of multilateral collaborations, intensified cooperation with businesses and the implementation of action-oriented policy that advance carbon neutrality, such as the ones proposed by B20 Saudi Arabia, will be a necessary step to further progress in fulfilling the Paris agenda and the SDGs.</p><p>There\u00a0has long been\u00a0a misconception that\u00a0a sustainable and inclusive approach to energy is at odds with economic interests.\u00a0But we are increasingly seeing data showing that\u00a0a green\u00a0transition can drive a more equal and inclusive society.

HCL has pledged US$15 million over five years till 2027 to bolster entrepreneurs focusing on water-related endeavors. The challenge will focus on the intersection of the quality and environmental impacts of water, with the key aspects including:</p><p>&lt;ol&gt;Preventing contamination of water at source- Source control aims to prevent or minimize the introduction of pollutants and contaminants at their source. Solutions may be aimed at contaminants from industry, agriculture, stormwater etc., and could include real-time monitoring and sensor networks, advanced filtration, and nature-based solutions.Monitoring and treating onsite industrial wastewater- Water is a core component in many industrial processes from manufacturing, cleaning and sanitation, mining, and cooling. Technological solutions offer a way to monitor water quality and reduce water contamination, minimize environmental impacts and move towards zero liquid discharge for industries.Optimising urban infrastructure public water and wastewater treatment systems- Water and wastewater treatment infrastructure upgrades are expensive and the costs are climbing. This area will target a broad range of technological solutions that can unlock value by improving efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring compliance.Offering water quality solutions for households- The convergence of environmental awareness, cost considerations, regulatory pressures, and health concerns is driving the increasing popularity of personal water quality solutions among individuals and households. Technological solutions may include portable water testing, point-of-use water purification, and apps for crowd-sourcing water quality data.&lt;/ol&gt;</p><p>While launching the challenge, Sundar Mahalingam, President of Strategy at HCL Corporation said, \"At HCL, we understand the power of innovation, and through our partnership with UpLink, we are empowering Aquapreneurs to scale their solutions and drive meaningful impact. The first two editions of the Aquapreneur Innovation Initiative have demonstrated remarkable success, with participating entrepreneurs showcasing solutions that address critical water challenges. The Aquapreneurs from the first challenge have raised $54.5 million grants and venture capital funding since joining the cohort. This validates the effectiveness of the initiative in nurturing and supporting innovative ideas that address critical water challenges. We are, therefore, thrilled to announce the third challenge, aiming to engage a broader network of Aquapreneur globally.\u201d</p><p>John Dutton, Head of UpLink, World Economic Forum, added, \u201cAt UpLink, we believe innovation and collaboration are key to overcoming the complex water challenges facing our planet.

Vi b\u00f8r som verdenssamfund s\u00e6tte et fuldt stop for de aktiviteter, der \u00f8del\u00e6gger den tilbagev\u00e6rende biodiversitet, frem for at gamble med en teoretisk id\\xC3 om, at et \u00f8delagt \u00f8kosystem et sted kan erstattes af et kunstigt vedligeholdt \u00f8kosystem et andet sted. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oprindelige folks rettigheder</emphasis></p><p>Vi f\u00f8lger desuden udviklingen indenfor beskyttelse af menneskerettigheder i aftaleteksten t\u00e6t. Oprindelige folk har gennem tusindvis af \u00e5r v\u00e6rnet om det land, de har boet p\u00e5 og levet af. Oprindelige folk beskytter i dag 80 % af den tilbagev\u00e6rende biodiversitet p\u00e5 kloden. Naar verdens nationer desperat prover at finde quick fixes p\u00e5 de biodiversitetsproblemer overproduktion og -forbrug har medf\u00f8rt, er det flere gange set, at oprindelige folk bliver fordrevet fra deres land, for at omdanne omr\u00e5det til beskyttede omr\u00e5der. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Udelukkelse af civilsamfundet</emphasis></p><p>Slutteligt ser vi tydeligt, at is\u00e6r unge mennesker er voldsomt underrepr\u00e6senterede p\u00e5 COP15. Vi ser ingen unge p\u00e5 talerstole eller til st\u00f8rre events. Global Youth Biodiversity Network (GYBN) er til stede og laver et meget st\u00e6rkt stykke arbejde for at videreformidle ungdommens krav og bekymringer. De bliver dog sj\u00e6ldent inviteret til at tale til st\u00f8rre events. En anden v\u00e6sentlig kritik, som ogs\u00e5 relaterer sig til udelukkelsen af civilsamfundets stemmer er, at hele pladsen foran konferencecenteret er afsp\u00e6rret med h\u00f8je metalhegn med pigge p\u00e5 toppen og st\u00e6rkt overv\u00e5get af politistyrker. Vi har f\u00e5et at vide, at den store m\u00e6ngde sikkerhed er &amp;lsquo;for vores skyld', da det sikrer, at ingen konferenceg\u00e6ngere bliver forstyrret af aktivister eller andre fra civilsamfundet. Men det betyder, at alle muligheder for protester t\u00e6t ved konferencen er elimineret. Det er et k\u00e6mpe problem, fordi det fjerner forhandlerne fra at se det civilsamfund, de b\u00f8r repr\u00e6sentere, i \u00f8jnene. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bevarelse af naturen</emphasis></p><p>Hvordan naturen skal beskyttes, genoprettes og forvaltes er en af de helt store knaster. Det kendte 30i30 m\u00e5l optager meget opm\u00e6rksomhed, b\u00e5de fordi der er uenighed om effekten af m\u00e5let, men ogs\u00e5 fordi landene er uenige om p\u00e5 hvilket niveau, om det er globalt eller nationalt, at landene skal levere de 30%. Ulig klima, er det ikke ligegyldigt hvilke 30% af al land- og havarelet p\u00e5 Jorden, der beskyttes, da nogle lande rummer langt flere og st\u00f8rre unikke naturomr\u00e5der for biodiversiteten end andre, hvilket g\u00f8r det mere vanskeligt at adressere. M\u00e5let h\u00e6nger ogs\u00e5 sammen med rettigheder til oprindelige folk, hvor mange frygter, at deres rettigheder udvandes og ikke indskrives i m\u00e5lene.

Projects that achieve this to sustain both nature and the livelihoods of the local community are invaluable to the transformation needed to thrive well beyond the climate crisis. Kudos to Amazon and The Nature Conservancy.\"</p><p>Amazon's initial investment in the Accelerator will support 3,000 farmers and restore approximately 20,000 hectares-a land mass approximately the size of the City of Seattle-within three years, removing up to 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through 2050.</p><p> The Nature Conservancy will work together with the World Agroforestry Centre and several local civil society organizations to implement the Accelerator by helping small farmers restore degraded cattle pastures to native forest and agroforestry. The agroforestry systems will provide farmers with a sustainable source of income through the sale of cocoa and other crops. The Accelerator will also experiment with innovative ways to support farmers and nurture markets for sustainable forest-based commodities, including with digital technologies, and will advance new methodologies and satellite-based technologies for quantifying and monitoring carbon removal.</p><p> \"Par\u00e1 is home to 9% percent of the world's tropical forest, but it's facing unprecedented rates of deforestation, losing 3,300 acres every day in the last year,\" said Jennifer Morris, CEO, The Nature Conservancy. \"Over the last 13 years, small farms in Par\u00e1-an area where slash-and-burn agriculture can seem like the only option-were responsible for an average of 40% of the state's deforestation. For 20 years, The Nature Conservancy has worked with small farmers, community leaders, government officials, and Indigenous peoples to identify and implement win-win solutions, like agroforestry, that help people and nature thrive. This new partnership with Amazon will allow us to provide the resources and technical assistance needed to advance this program and demonstrate that regenerative agroforestry and carbon markets are viable business models for communities in the Amazon.\"</p><p> \"We must join forces to achieve what may be the goal of the century: to develop our economies and safeguard people's income, while preserving and restoring the forest,\" said Helder Barbalho, Governor of Par\u00e1. \"The state of Par\u00e1 is ready to tackle this challenge, and our strategy is clearly laid out in our Amazonia Agora plan, which commits us to being carbon free by 2036, through the reduction of deforestation and by promoting forest restoration. Investments, such as Amazon's, in sustainable agroforestry and reforestation in Par\u00e1 are very welcome.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) today releases its Low Carbon Transition Plan (LCTP), which provides a transparent and detailed view on how we plan to achieve our climate ambitions, measure success, and report on progress.</p><p> The plan brings forward PMI's ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality in its direct operations (scopes 1+2) by five years, to 2025, and to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire value chain (scopes 1+2+3) by 10 years, to 2040. In addition, it introduces a new goal for PMI's critical suppliers to adopt science-based targets (SBTs) in line with the SBTs that PMI has already committed to, aligned with the 1.5&amp;amp;deg;C pathway necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The importance of this new target is linked to the relevance attributed to supplier engagement, which is essential to support the achievement of PMI's CO2 reduction targets for scope 3 over time, allowing the company to maintain its leadership role in climate actions.

The company is also working to adapt to the impact of climate change and increase the resilience of its business and the communities where it operates. Recognizing that sustainability challenges do not exist in a vacuum but are often linked to one another and must be considered to craft appropriate solutions, PMI commissioned Article One to prepare a briefing paper, entitled: \"Climate Justice in Global Supply Chains: A Perspective for the Private Sector.\" The paper will discuss the connectivity between environmental and social issues, drawn from the impacts of climate change, as well as the ability to shape solutions that are mutually reinforcing.</p><p> Recognitions of PMI's climate action progress</p><p> In the S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings' ESG Evaluation report, PMI was recognized not only as a leader in the transition to carbon neutrality but an industry differentiator for its approach to carbon pricing. The company was also included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America for the first time last year, achieving the highest score of 100 in the climate strategy, environmental reporting, and environmental policy and management systems categories. In 2020, PMI was one of just 10 companies worldwide to receive the prestigious \"Triple A\" score for environmental sustainability leadership by CDP, and maintained its position on CDP's A List for Climate Change for the seventh year in a row. In addition, CDP placed PMI on its Supplier Engagement leaderboard for the fourth consecutive year.</p><p> To access PMI's LCTP Report, as well as additional information on PMI's approach to sustainability, please refer to the LCTP Report and PMI Sustainability.

PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. In addition, versions of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of IQOS and its consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities, and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn products, nicotine-containing vapor products and oral nicotine products. As of September 30, 2021, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets in key cities or nationwide, and PMI estimates that approximately 14.9 million adults around the world have already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that an exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of September 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021, PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

The Conference is expected to convene over 70,000 participants, including heads of state, government officials, international industry leaders, private sector representatives, academics, experts, youth, and non-state actors.As mandated by the Paris Climate Agreement, COP28 UAE will deliver the first ever Global Stocktake \u2014 a comprehensive evaluation of progress against climate goals.The UAE will lead a process for all parties to agree upon a clear roadmap to accelerate progress through a pragmatic global energy transition and a \u201cleave no one behind\u201d approach to inclusive climate action.</p><p>UAE\u2019s Track Record of Climate Action:The UAE\u2019s selection as the host country for COP28 reinforces its long track record of ambitious action on climate change. The UAE supports this vision at home and globally.</p><p>The UAE was the first in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, commit to an economy-wide reduction in emission as well as to announce a Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative.In response to the challenge to all nations to accelerate progress at COP26 in Glasgow, the UAE was one of only two dozen countries to revise its climate targets, raising its 2030 reduction target from 23.5% to 31% by 2030.</p><p>At home:</p><p>The UAE is diversifying its own energy mix:It is the first to deploy peaceful nuclear power.It has established three of the largest and lowest-cost solar plants in the world and has set new records for the most-cost competitive solar and wind in the UAE and worldwide.It is the first country in the region to deploy industrial-scale carbon capture technology.It is a pioneer and driver of hydrogen energy.It is actively investing to lower the carbon impact of hydrocarbon fuels.</p><p>International Leadership:</p><p>To date, the UAE has invested $50billion in renewable energy in 70 countries and has pledged to invest over $50 billion in clean energy projects at home and abroad over the next decade.Since 2009, the UAE has hosted the Headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency.The UAE and the US launched the Partnership to Accelerate Transition to Clean Energy (PACE), a new clean energy framework in November 2022 to catalyze $100 billion in financing, investment, and other support to deploy 100GW of clean energy by 2035, especially in developing countries.</p><p>COP28 UAE Leadership Team:</p><p>Dr. Sultan Al JaberThe appointment of Dr. Sultan Al Jaber is a reflection of the UAE\u2019s commitment to driving forward a progressive and pragmatic global transition to clean energy.</p><p>Dr. Al Jaber, the first CEO to ever serve as COP President, leverages his decades-long experience in the energy sector, encompassing both renewable and traditional energies. In 2006, directed by the UAE leadership, he led the team who took Masdar from concept to reality, with the mandate to accelerate the adoption of renewables within the UAE, across the region and globally. To date, Masdar has made significant contributions to the UAE\u2019s renewable energy targets, playing a key role in expanding the country\u2019s portfolio with clean energy investments in over 40 countries around the world, including several vulnerable island states and African nations.</p><p>Under a new partnership with TAQA, Mubadala and ADNOC, Masdar is set to become one of the largest renewable energy investors in the world with an ambitious target of growing to at least 100GW of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030. In 2009, under the guidance of the leadership and the ongoing support of H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, he led Masdar\u2019s efforts in the UAE\u2019s successful bid to host the headquarters of the \"International Renewable Energy Agency\u201d (IRENA) in Masdar City, with a mission to promote clean technology and sustainable development globally.</p><p>In 2009, Dr. Al Jaber was also appointed by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to his Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC), which published its final report in 2010. The recommendations from this report formed the basis of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative launched in 2011.</p><p>In 2010, Dr. Al Jaber received an Honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from India\u2019s TERI University, the Delhi based university that specializes in the field of sustainable development. In 2012, Dr. Al Jaber received the UN Champions of the Earth award for his work on advancing clean energy technologies to mitigate the threats of climate change. He has served twice as climate envoy and has been an active participant in over ten Conference of Parties, including the milestone COP21 that took place in 2015 in Paris.</p><p>In his current role as Group CEO and Managing Director of ADNOC, he has overseen the national oil company\u2019s (NOCs) emergence as one of the world\u2019s most carbon-efficient oil and gas companies, building on a long-standing sustainability legacy that includes being one of the first NOCs to commit to zero gas flaring.

Projektet st\u00f8tter op om Aarhus' egne gr\u00f8nne strategier for forvaltning af vand, natur og klimatilpasning ved at unders\u00f8ge blandt andet:Hvordan man kan v\u00e6rdis\u00e6tte tiltag, som genopretter eller forvalter byens \u00f8kosystemer, s\u00e5 man kan opn\u00e5 et bedre grundlag for forvaltning og prioritering Hvordan man kan tr\u00e6kke byens natur ind i klassev\u00e6relserne, s\u00e5 skoleb\u00f8rn f\u00e5r gl\u00e6de af og v\u00e6rdier omkring natur og biodiversitet, og dermed bliver bedre forvaltere af en fremtidig, b\u00e6redygtig udvikling Eksperimenter som afd\u00e6kker hvordan forskellige former for forvaltning kan underst\u00f8tte anvendelsen af byens \u00f8kosystemer, f. eks. hvordan oversv\u00f8mmelser pga h\u00f8jt grundvandsniveau, skybrud og vandstandsstigninger kan afhj\u00e6lpes med forskellige tiltag som bygger p\u00e5 gr\u00f8nne omr\u00e5der og \u00f8kosystemtjenester Hvad andre byer g\u00f8r ift forvaltning af vand for at undg\u00e5 oversv\u00f8mmelser og forvaltning af gr\u00f8nne omr\u00e5der for samtidig at forbedre biodiversiteten.", "se p\u00e5 s\u00e5kaldte klimaveje, hvor forseglingen af jorden minimeres, og p\u00e5 hvordan befolkningen kan inddrages i biodiversitetsforvaltning gennem borgervidenskab (citizen science). I Velica Gorika vil de unders\u00f8ge, hvordan luftforurening, oversv\u00f8mmelser og varme\u00f8er kan afhj\u00e6lpes med \u00f8kosystembaserede l\u00f8sninger. Og i Kina vil de blandt andet se p\u00e5, hvordan luftforurening, varme\u00f8er og ekstremt h\u00f8j befolkningst\u00e6thed kan afhj\u00e6lpes med planl\u00e6gning, der bygger p\u00e5 forskellige gr\u00f8nne l\u00f8sninger som f. eks. 3-lands-projektet i Shanghai, der \u00f8ger arealer med gr\u00e6s, skov og v\u00e5domr\u00e5der i byen. FAKTA:REGREEN - Fostering nature-based solutions for equitable, green and healthy urban transitions in Europe and China er finansieret af en Horizon2020-bevilling p\u00e5 lige knap 5 mio &amp;euro; fordelt til 16 Europ\u00e6iske partnere. Hertil kommer 4 kinesiske partnere som er selvfinansierede.
