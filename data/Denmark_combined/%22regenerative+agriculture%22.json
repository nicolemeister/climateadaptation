Since then, Agreena has scaled its activities 10X, expanded its geographic footprint to cover farmland in 16 European countries, and partnered with farms to help them transition more than 600,000 hectares towards climate-positive, regenerative farming.</p><p>\u201cIn order for the world\u2019s farmers to transition to regenerative agriculture and create a scalable climate impact, the financial rails to support and pay them for it need to be built,\u201d said Simon Haldrup, Co-founder and CEO of Agreena. \u201cAgreena is building out technological and financial services infrastructure throughout the agriculture value chain as the industry increasingly becomes a focal point for decarbonisation efforts.\u201d</p><p>Momentum around regenerative farming is sweeping the globe, with corporates, governments and supply chains turning their focus to our agricultural soils for carbon removals in order to meet global net-zero targets. Through the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, farmers will play an increasingly essential role in tackling climate change, food insecurity, and other critical environmental issues. Agreena has developed a way to turn this impact into a new and additional revenue stream for farmers to help finance the transition by leveraging the carbon market.</p><p>Via the company\u2019s digital platform, farmers plan, track and validate improvements for their regenerative journey, in the process transitioning from emitting CO2 to drawing CO2 down and storing it within their soils. The improved soil health and biodiversity reduce the need for inputs while enhancing farmers\u2019 resilience to increasingly adverse climate conditions (such as drought or flooding), enhancing the overall operational performance of farms. On the other side of the equation, Agreena\u2019s certificates and downstream services support climate-focused companies already working to decarbonise, as well as companies in the food supply chain increasingly requiring field-level traceability of their agricultural commodities to comply with Scope 3 reporting requirements.</p><p>Scaling with Technology</p><p>The recent acquisition of remote sensing company Hummingbird Technologies has enabled Agreena to expand its offering beyond farmers to encompass agridata services for supply chain players, governments and other institutions. Prioritising a science-based and technology-first agenda, Agreena\u2019s platform now incorporates a world-leading, AI-based monitoring and verification solution that utilises satellite imagery, coupled with ground-truth data and machine learning to identify and report on-farm regenerative agriculture practices. Offering global monitoring, the company is on a mission to take the lead in supporting the road to net zero for the full value chain.</p><p>\u201cReal climate impact is only created at scale and Agreena is perfectly positioned to distribute their carbon farming capabilities across the globe to bring high-quality, verifiable and nature-based carbon credits to the market. Only with carbon removals, can net zero targets be met,\u201d said Alexander Joel-Carbonell, partner at HV Capital.</p><p>From Farmer to Fintech</p><p>Deeply rooted within the agricultural community, Agreena was originally founded with seed investment from Danish farmers and agricultural families. The company\u2019s next phase introduces a vertically integrated platform and marketplace. Working first with farmers in the field to monitor the carbon impact, the resulting certificates are constructed into scalable portfolios for corporates, tailored to their unique ESG strategy.</p><p>The company is taking a lead in providing the technological rails for the growing market with innovative financial solutions. Examples include using sustainable blockchain technology for enhanced traceability and transparency of carbon credits, and e-money and smart contracts to facilitate payment exchanges between climate-conscious corporates and farmers with immediate reconciliation at scale.</p><p>\u201cWe are on a journey to remove the economic barriers to adoption of regenerative agriculture for farmers and their entire ecosystem - carbon is just the beginning,\u201d concluded Haldrup.</p><p>About Agreena</p><p>Agreena unlocks the power of soil carbon removals and natural capital to finance the transition to regenerative agriculture. Working in close collaboration with partner farmers across 16 European markets and growing, AgreenaCarbon is the world\u2019s leading soil carbon platform. Combined with market leading satellite monitoring technologies, Agreena\u2019s solutions can support farmers, companies, and governments on the road to net zero.</p><p>About Agreena\u2019s Carbon Certification</p><p>Agreena\u2019s programme is accredited to the ISO 14064-2 standard, with a third-party verified methodology that is aligned to IPCC science.

The number of hectares enrolled grew 10X over the previous year and farmer participation increased 4X. Agreena is paying the largest incentives to farmers under a soil carbon scheme to-date at \u20ac32 to \u20ac36 per anticipated carbon certificate generated depending on region, an increase of up to 45% from last year. The company is a pioneer in creating nature-based soil carbon removals. The associated certificates will soon be available on the market for companies that want to participate in the transition of the world\u2019s farmers to practices that help address climate change, biodiversity loss and the future of food security.</p><p>While carbon sequestration in agriculture has been identified as one of the top solutions to scale climate action because of its accessibility and the immediate impact it can have, the primary hurdle to adoption is the high upfront costs for farmers. By leveraging the voluntary carbon market (VCM) to convert climate-friendly farming efforts into high-quality carbon certificates, Agreena is driving a new revenue stream to the farmer. Farmers are seeing the benefit too. Twenty percent of the year-on-year hectare growth in Agreena\u2019s portfolio came from member farmers adding more land to the program.</p><p>\u201cAgreena is introducing a new category of carbon certificates into the market and it will take time to build and scale, but farmers cannot wait - they need a reliable and liquid payment to help cover their transition efforts,\u201d said Simon Haldrup, CEO of Agreena. \u201cThat is why Agreena takes a calculated risk and pays farmers each harvest year. Still, carbon certificates are just one part of the solution and a mix of incentives is needed to rapidly transition the world\u2019s farmers to regenerative practices.\u201d</p><p>Farmers and the companies that rely on carbon certificates for their ESG and sustainability efforts are on different timelines. Sales of credits can take a year or longer to occur after the impact has been certified. Agreena\u2019s early payout option for farmers bridges the gap between the two. Farmers enrolled in Agreena\u2019s program get to decide how they\u2019d like to use the certificates that they generate, and one of those options is to be paid soon after the harvest year ends to help cover their upfront costs. The early payout is based on market prices at the time. Growth of the Voluntary Carbon Market and pricing for high-quality carbon certificates continue to grow, any upside when Agreena\u2019s certificates are sold is shared with the farmer.</p><p>Agreena\u2019s carbon certificates are the result of farmers taking measures to sequester additional carbon from the atmosphere within their soils and at the same time reduce their own emissions through practices like no till. The company has developed a highly credible programme that is in alignment with the latest IPCC science and the recognised principles of the VCM, and built relationships with agricultural partners and farmers across Europe.</p><p>More recently Agreena has developed its corporate unit that oversees certificate sales, and MRV and risk solutions. Agreena works with certificate buyers to tailor, structure and scale portfolios from across the company\u2019s inventory, modelled after assets already sold and traded in traditional financial markets.</p><p>\u201cOur first vintage of high quality carbon certificates originates from farmers in Central Europe and has just been made available for a limited quantity presale,\u201d said Frederik Aagaard, Agreena\u2019s Director of Carbon Markets. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be able to facilitate the participation of companies in helping finance this journey for farmers.\u201d</p><p>The deadline for enrolling in Agreena\u2019s 2023 programme is quickly approaching.

A competitive biomethane market can play a key role in the transition to net zero.ii</p><p>To support the transition to clean heat in the UK, energy efficiency improvements will be made at AstraZeneca\u2019s Macclesfield campus, the largest medicines development and manufacturing site in the UK. This includes a major refit of the site\u2019s combined heat and power plant (CHP) which will save a further 16,000 tonnes CO2e per year, in addition to upgrading buildings and improving the footprint for the production and packing of medicines to enable further greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. These efficiency projects will support the long-term sustainable operations of the Macclesfield campus, which delivers more than 90 million packs of medicines to more than 130 countries.</p><p>The transition to 100% renewable energy is a key element of AstraZeneca\u2019s flagship Ambition Zero Carbon programme, which is focused on delivering deep decarbonisation by halving the company\u2019s entire value chain footprint (Scopes 1 to 3) by 2030 and becoming science-based net zero by 2045 at the latest. AstraZeneca is on track to reduce GHG emissions from its global operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 98% by 2026.</p><p>Juliette White, Vice President, Global Sustainability &amp; Safety, Health &amp; Environment, at AstraZeneca, said: \u201cToday\u2019s commitment of \\xA3100 million shows we are serious about decarbonising the discovery, development and manufacture of medicines and securing a sustainable future for our sites across the UK and globally. In leading from the front on the commercial adoption of clean heat, we are innovating to expand the usage of renewable energy, contributing to the circular economy and accelerating our progress towards net zero.\u201d</p><p>Philipp Lukas, CEO of Future Biogas, said: \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s ground-breaking investment in green gas affirms its status as a global leader in the transition to net zero. The opportunity to combine unsubsidised biomethane production with regenerative farming benefits local farms and supports the growing focus on soil health and sustainable food production. Future Biogas expects this model to be adopted by many other innovative organisations with strong net zero ambitions.\u201d</p><p>The site will utilise locally-grown crops as feedstock and support farms with sustainable land management practices, enabling the development of a circular agricultural economy. Bioenergy crops will be grown as part of diverse crop rotations and will follow regenerative agriculture practices, promoting nutrient cycling and improving soil health.</p><p>Renewable Gas Guarantee of Origin (RGGO) certificates will be transferred to AstraZeneca, to ensure there is no double counting of emissions savings.</p><p>The new plant will be fitted with bioenergy carbon capture and storage capability (BECCS) which has the potential to enable the carbon negative operation of the plant. AstraZeneca aims to sequester the carbon through the \u2018Northern Lights\u2019 project in Norway, a joint venture involving industry and supported by the Norwegian Government.</p><p>This latest commitment to renewable energy in the UK follows other innovative partnerships announced earlier this year. In the US, AstraZeneca is partnering with Vanguard Renewables to enable the delivery of biomethane to all its US sites by the end of 2026. The Company has also entered into an agreement with Statkraft, Europe\u2019s largest renewable energy producer, to increase the supply of renewable electricity in Sweden.</p><p>Notes</p><p>Biogas and biomethaneiii</p><p>Biogas is produced by the fermentation of organic matter in anaerobic digestion tanks. Biomethane is biogas from which the by-product carbon dioxide has been removed, giving the biomethane the same properties as natural gas, and enabling it to be injected into the national gas grid. In Future Biogas' plants the feedstocks will have a zero or negative carbon footprint meaning the biomethane is 100% renewable energy, allowing a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Energy crops grown for Future Biogas absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during their growth. Once harvested and stored, the energy crops are fed into anaerobic digestion tanks where bacteria break down the organic matter in the absence of oxygen, releasing biogas. The residue is an organic fertiliser (digestate) which in conjunction with changes to the farming rotation helps accelerate soil carbon capture.</p><p>Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)iv</p><p>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a carbon removal technique to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Biomass (organic material) is converted into heat, electricity, or liquid or gas fuels, and the carbon dioxide emissions from this bioenergy conversion are captured and stored in geological formations or embedded in long-lasting products. It does not utilise the injected CO2 for enhanced oil recovery.</p><p>About Future Biogas</p><p>Future Biogas is at the forefront of the anaerobic digestion (AD) industry. The company is a highly experienced developer and operator of AD plants across the UK, and able to provide full-service capabilities of development, construction, operations, ongoing compliance and asset management, both to owned projects and to those of third parties. Future Biogas plants convert a wide range of feedstocks into clean, renewable energy, through a process of anaerobic digestion, which produces biogas. Biogas can either be used to generate green electricity or upgraded into biomethane and injected into the UK\u2019s national gas network.</p><p>For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurebiogas.com\">https://www.futurebiogas.com</url>.*</p><p>About Northern Lights</p><p>Northern Lights is developing an open and flexible infrastructure to transport CO2 from industrial emitters by ship to a receiving terminal in western Norway for intermediate storage, before being transported by pipeline for permanent storage in a geological reservoir 2,600 metres under the seabed. Operations are scheduled to start in 2024. The facilities are under construction and will enable Northern Lights to offer a safe and reliable shipping and storage service to industrial emitters from across Europe.

The company maintains an ongoing plant breeding program with more than 600 camelina germplasm lines and owns nine proprietary camelina varieties, which enables the sustainable introduction of camelina in different crop rotations without displacing any primary crops. \"We are excited by the significant synergies that exist between CCE, GCE and SusOils,\" said Yuri Herreras Yambanis, Director, CCE. \"Combining the knowledge and expertise of our organizations provides us the opportunity to further advance camelina research and production in ways that deliver profitable and sustainable advantages for both regenerative agriculture and the renewable fuels industry. Camelina is an essential part of the feedstock plan for GCE's integrated farm-to-fuels strategy. In early 2022, GCE will open a newly renovated renewable diesel biorefinery in Bakersfield, California, and supply ExxonMobil up to 220 million gallons annually of renewable diesel under a pair of long-term purchase agreements.
