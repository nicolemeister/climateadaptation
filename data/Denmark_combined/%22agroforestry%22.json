Creating ecological corridors between fragmented pockets of forests in the west of S\u00e3o Paulo state, this programme will build an important habitat for vulnerable and endangered species.India: A new 30-year AZ Forest partnership with Earthbanc and local implementation partners in the state of Meghalaya in north-east India will plant an estimated 64 million trees, focusing on a diverse mix of species. The project is expected to be the largest of the CBA\u2019s \u201cLiving Labs for Nature, People and Planet\u201d.

Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: \u201cThe twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are damaging the planet and harming human health. Through AZ Forest, we are working with local communities and ecological experts to deliver reforestation at scale, as well as support biodiversity and sustain livelihoods. We are taking a science-based approach, and AZ Forest will remove around 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over about 30 years. \u201dAZ Forest projects are co-designed with planting experts, local communities and governments to deliver natural forest restoration and agroforestry, with co-benefits such as the creation of new skills and jobs, the protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species and improved public health. 4 Projects will be audited and assessed by world-leading delivery partners and independent third-party experts, including the European Forest Institute (EFI). Marc Palah\u00ed, Chair, Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA), said: \u201cForests play a key role in fighting climate change, hosting biodiversity and powering a circular bioeconomy that prospers in harmony with nature. Forests and trees are the backbone for life on our planet and the basis for human health and wellbeing.

It is focused on accelerating companies across the world to halve emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions before 2050. The initiative is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match\u2014a leader in oral nicotine delivery\u2014creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match\u2019s General snus as modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs). As of June 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35.4% of PMI\u2019s total 2023 second-quarter net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.
