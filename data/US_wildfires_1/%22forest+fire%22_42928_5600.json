Philmont Scout Ranch is BSA Scouts' premier high adventure camp and the largest youth camp in the world, serving nearly one million participants since 1938. The Scout Ranch covers 214 square miles of vast wilderness with trails that climb from 6,500 feet to as high as 12,441 feet. During their trek, the crew from BSA Troop 209 hiked 70.5 miles over 12 days. The group of Scouts and their advisers carried everything they needed to survive during the trek on their backs while hiking from camp to camp. They participated in backcountry programs along the way, including historic homesteading, making railroad ties, forest fire education, western shooting, forest ecology, western lore and spar pole climbing. The trek included a conservation project where the Scouts learned and participated in the upkeep of Philmont's ecosystem. Along the trek, Scouts endured tough challenges, including backpacking in bear and mountain lion territory, steep climbs, and often-inclement weather. The pinnacle of this inspiring experience was a climb to the summit of Baldy Mountain, the highest peak in the Cimarron Range at an elevation of 12,441 feet. * Submit \u2018Your News' at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailyherald.com/share\">www.dailyherald.com/share</url>.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Back row, left to right: Daniel Narey, Mitch Picchiotti, Tom Narey, Michael Hansen, William Plizga, Jim Szczupaj Front row: Luke Litchfield, Evan Castro-Sarno, Tony Pluta, Philmont staffer, Nathan Szczupaj, John Glass, Jack Conneely Philmont Staff Courtesy of Philmont Staff Scouts from BSA Troop 209, Palatine, hiked through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains at Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico.

Some might also have hunting permits for which they waited in line for years and for which they have spent the rest of the year scouting good areas, laying plans and setting up game cameras.</p><p>He said people understand how difficult it is to manage disaster situations, when there's a wildfire and people's live and property are at risk. But \"everyone does own these lands,\" and it's frustrating for those who lose out because of preemptive closure, he said.</p><p>\"We may need more resources in this changing climates \u2014 both proactive resources and mitigation \u2014 and its actual ability to fight the fire and the fire response teams that are able to be out there.\"</p><p>Sebastopol artist Dennis Bolt said it's starting to feel like the mountains are just unsafe.</p><p>After growing up in Sonoma County, he's watched the region become plagued by fire over the past five years or so, and now finds his vacation spots have become fire zones, as well.</p><p>This week, he and his family watched the Caldor fire roar to life, starting about 2 miles from Leoni Meadows Camp and Retreat Center in Grizzly Flats, where they had gone for eight years to meet up with cousins and other relatives.</p><p>They have missed the past three summers because of other travel and COVID, but he and his wife promised the kids they would go next year, only to watch in horror as the path of the fire went right through the property.</p><p>\"Our youngest, who really wanted to go back this coming year, was kind of desolate about it,\" Bolt said.</p><p>Miraculously, much of the camp came through undamaged, but it won't be the same, he said.</p><p>\"It feels like wildfire was not a huge issue until five years ago, 10 years ago, and now every summer, it is an issue,\" Bolt said.</p><p>You can reach Staff Writer Mary Callahan at 707-521-5249 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com\">mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com</email> On Twitter @MaryCallahanB.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

But \"it's gotta be a bummer for people who rely on the use of public land because some people who live in those more remote areas financially depend on that protein,\" he said.</p><p>Devin O'Dea grew up in Novato and is California/Nevada Chapter Coordinator of the Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers.</p><p>Now a San Diego resident, he seemed less accepting of the closure of areas where no fire was currently burning.</p><p>He said the timing was just difficult, coinciding with big game hunting season and with fishing seasons that would normally draw lots of folks into the forests, many of whom would have set vacation time aside with friends and/or family. Some might also have hunting permits for which they waited in line for years and for which they have spent the rest of the year scouting good areas, laying plans and setting up game cameras.</p><p>He said people understand how difficult it is to manage disaster situations, when there's a wildfire and people's live and property are at risk. But \"everyone does own these lands,\" and it's frustrating for those who lose out because of preemptive closure, he said.</p><p>\"We may need more resources in this changing climates \u2014 both proactive resources and mitigation \u2014 and its actual ability to fight the fire and the fire response teams that are able to be out there.\"</p><p>Sebastopol artist Dennis Bolt said it's starting to feel like the mountains are just unsafe.</p><p>After growing up in Sonoma County, he's watched the region become plagued by fire over the past five years or so, and now finds his vacation spots have become fire zones, as well.</p><p>This week, he and his family watched the Caldor fire roar to life, starting about 2 miles from Leoni Meadows Camp and Retreat Center in Grizzly Flats, where they had gone for eight years to meet up with cousins and other relatives.</p><p>They have missed the past three summers because of other travel and COVID, but he and his wife promised the kids they would go next year, only to watch in horror as the path of the fire went right through the property.</p><p>\"Our youngest, who really wanted to go back this coming year, was kind of desolate about it,\" Bolt said.</p><p>Miraculously, much of the camp came through undamaged, but it won't be the same, he said.</p><p>\"It feels like wildfire was not a huge issue until five years ago, 10 years ago, and now every summer, it is an issue,\" Bolt said.</p><p>You can reach Staff Writer Mary Callahan at 707-521-5249 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com\">mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com</email> On Twitter @MaryCallahanB.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

The Summer of 2020 saw Colorado's worst wildfire season on record, with a staggering 13 named fires scorching the state. Additionally, the four largest wildfires in state history burned last summer, which moved the infamous 2002 \"Hayman Fire\" down to 5th on the list of largest recorded Wildfires in Colorado State history.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Cameron Peak Fire (208,663 acres) (2020)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>East Troublesome Fire (192,560 acres) (2020)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Mullen Fire (176,878 acres) (2020)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Pine Gulch Fire (139,007 acres) (2020)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Hayman Fire (137,760 acres) (2002)</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Colorado is no stranger to wildfires, but after a 2019 wildfire season where only one wildfire was recorded, (Decker Fire), the massive increase is a definite cause of concern for Colorado residents everywhere. Air quality across the state was predictably terrible, with smoke and ash littering the air, and turning blue skies into all sorts of nasty colors. With wildfire season around the corner, all Coloradans can hope for is a wetter summer, with plenty of rainstorms. But what can Coloradans do to help suppress the odds of these devastating fires?</p><p>Some of the ways that wildfires start are out of human-control. Wildfires can start as a result of lightning striking a tree, or in a lot of cases last summer, severe drought. Humans are very capable of starting these fires too, however. Humans have intentionally committed arson to start wildfires, or accidentally created by uncontained campfires. Humans can prevent the man-made fires by simply being responsible. Aspiring Firefighter, Chance Coupe states, \"You should look out for unattended fires, and report them if needed...Never throw lit cigarettes or anything similar out of your car or onto the ground, and additionally, always make sure your fire is 100% out before leaving it as sometimes they can relight even when put out.\" It's easy to maintain forests when you keep yourself responsible with fire.</p><p>Wildfires not only effect the wilderness and wildlife, but also the people who live in mountainous areas. Carol Saine, who lives in Florissant, Colorado, has her own responsibility to keep her home safe from flammable material. Saine states, \"You have to keep your property clear clear of pine needles and dead grass, and you have to keep trees away from your house.\" She adds that there are people who will help with mitigation projects to ensure that residents houses are as safe as they can be. Although Saine feels comfortable with the house she bought, she worries about areas close by due to the potential for extreme drought, just like Colorado saw in many areas in 2020.</p><p>Mother nature is inevitable, and forest fires will always be a concern when lightning strikes in a forest, or when extreme drought dries up the wilderness and sparks a forest fire, but humans have every capability in the world to be able to suppress the chances of sparking a forest fire. All it takes is one uncontained campfire, one cigarette butt, or one evil act to burn thousands of acres of forest, destroy many homes, and even potentially kill innocent residents.

All these villages in the north are surrounded by mountain and it's only April. What's going to be happening in June?\" <br/>Garcia heads a New Mexico group promoting traditional irrigation ditch systems first used by Native Americans and then by Spanish settlers to grow food. <br/>At an evacuation center in Pe?asco, 24 miles (38.6 km) northwest of Mora, locals blamed destruction from the fire on the U.S. Forest Service, which administers the areas where it began. <br/>Logger Ricardo Fresquez said the agency prevented locals from logging and thinning trees around their villages, as they did for generations, leaving forests congested and fire prone. <br/>\"Our resources are not being utilized and are going up in smoke,\" said Fresquez, whose family has lived in the Mora area for 185 years. <br/>In recent years the Forest Service has increasingly used thinning and controlled burns to mitigate wildfire danger and has begun to partner with local villages to thin forests. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Recent wildfire seasons in Canada (e.g., 2017, 2018, and 2021 in British Columbia and 2016, 2019, and 2022 in Alberta) have caused massive environmental, economic, and societal impacts and garnered worldwide attention (Jain et al., 2022). These detrimental effects of climate change differ regionally. For instance, the southern border of Canada\u2019s boreal forest has experienced less forest fire activity during the 20th century, in part due to increased precipitation and shifts in the composition and diversity of regional biomes associated with warmer temperatures (Boulanger et al., 2017; Natural Resources Canada, 2019). On the contrary, the annual amount of forest area burned in northwestern boreal regions has increased gradually since the second half of the 20th century (Hanes et al., 2019; Natural Resources Canada, 2019). Wildfire activity stems from a complex mixture of natural and anthropogenic factors: topography, vegetation, climate, land use, and suppression efforts all influence wildfire spatial and temporal patterns\u2014better known as fire regimes (Natural Resources Canada, 2019). The diversity of these factors to such a vast extent as Canada, coupled with the uncertainty of climate change impacts, creates challenging conditions for decision-makers to assess and prepare for disaster risks in fire-prone areas (Coogan et al., 2019; Erni et al., 2019; Tymstra et al., 2020).</p><p/><p>An increasing body of literature focuses on the vulnerability of Canadian communities to wildfire hazards and the potential for disaster (Erni et al., 2021; McGee &amp; Healey, 2022; McKnight &amp; Linnenluecke, 2016; Parisien et al., 2020; Tepley et al., 2022). However, studies focusing on, or incorporating, industrial activities addressing wildfire risk in Canada remain rare (see Johnston &amp; Flannigan, 2017; Khakzad, 2018, 2019; Khakzad et al., 2018 for important exceptions). In this research, we explore how conditions related to a firm\u2019s experience with wildfire, and the perceptions that managers have regarding wildfire, configure or combine toward a propensity to prepare for a disaster.</p><p>This is an important question because whether a hazard becomes a disaster is tightly connected to whether and how firms engage in preparation activities such as training, creating emergency plans, and reducing nearby fuel sources (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). Avoiding disasters is important as Canada is economically dependent on the extractive activities taking place in forested areas (Erdozain et al., 2019). The 2016 Horse River fire in the oil sands region of Alberta resulted in a 20% loss in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">gross domestic product</emphasis> for the oil industry the month of the fire due to the interruption of operations\u2014mostly as workers needed to evacuate\u2014illustrating the need for a better understanding of the vulnerability of extractive activities to wildfires in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2017). No oil and gas (infra)structures were lost during the 2016 Horse River fire as industries had implemented effective fuel reduction strategies around their facilities and were able to react appropriately as the situation evolved, even sending firefighting material and personnel to the town of Fort McMurray (Kovacs et al., 2019). Although the preparedness and response of the oil and gas industry during this fire might become a textbook case, it is the only one documented in Canada thus far and cannot be generalized to the whole country and other extractive activities. Several provinces have made it mandatory for industries to provide a wildfire management plan on a yearly basis, but the level of details of these plans, their precision, and their utility during an emergency are unknown. Disaster risk reduction (DRR)\u2014including preparedness\u2014is an arduous task.</p><p>In this paper, we define disaster preparedness as the attainment of the skills and capabilities necessary to mitigate damage to the business activities of a firm (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). On top of technical challenges to adequately evaluate risk indicators (Gaillard &amp; Mercer, 2013), decision-makers frequently take different stances on this topic. Some elect not to prepare, concentrating on short-term costs and more certain, immediate risks (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). Others pre-emptively design risk mitigation strategies to prepare for disaster-inducing wildfires (Ford et al., 2010; Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke et al., 2013; McKnight &amp; Linnenluecke, 2019; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Pearce et al., 2011). Understanding why decision-makers respond differently to similar disaster risks is a key component of this study.</p><p>How individual managers <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">perceive</emphasis> wildfire risk is a key factor in assessing differences in disaster preparation (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). We draw on the concept of psychological distance to organize and advance research in this field. Psychological distance refers to how individuals cognitively separate themselves from stimuli, particularly those that are not in the current and direct experience of their reality (Baltatescu, 2014; Liberman &amp; Trope, 2008). In the context of adaptation to wildfire, this separation occurs, for example, when decision-makers view wildfire risk as being a geographically, temporally, or socially distant phenomenon or being highly uncertain. Psychological distance can have a significant impact on whether disaster preparation occurs and depends largely on individuals\u2019 perceptions.</p><p>Our research explains how conditions related to prior wildfire experience and the perceptions that managers have regarding wildfire occurrence, climate change, and controllability influence disaster preparedness. We contrast these perceptions with expert assessments of wildfire risk to capture a gap between how managers and wildfire experts perceive these risks. We adopt a qualitative comparative analytical (QCA) approach well-suited to building configurational theory explaining how combinations of conditions configure to generate outcomes of interest (Fiss, 2007).</p><p>We advance theory on disaster preparedness by showing how combinations of these conditions configure toward a propensity to prepare for a disaster. This type of research is increasingly relevant given the critical role risk perception plays in influencing climate change adaptation (CCA). This is especially the case in the extractive sector where adaptation is not always a priority (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2022; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018; Tierney, 2002). While there is a scientific consensus that climate change is worsening fire activity in many parts of Canada and that industries need to better prepare for technological disasters triggered by wildfire hazards, it is unclear what and how factors might combine to facilitate disaster preparation.</p><p>This paper makes two contributions to the management literature on risk reduction and CCA. Critically, the paper attempts to empirically untangle <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">exposure</emphasis> to a climate stimulus such as wildfires from a firm\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">perception</emphasis> of their vulnerability to that same stimulus. Prior work has called for the use of more objective assessments of risk exposure in organizational research, as opposed to self-reported measures (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019). Exposure denotes the historical and projected levels of wildfire activity that overlap with extraction activities, whereas vulnerability also accounts for the degree to which a firm might be affected by a wildfire, as well as its level of wildfire disaster preparedness. In this paper we leverage state-of-the-art knowledge from the physical sciences on wildfire risk modeling (Johnston et al., 2020; Parisien et al., 2019). Through this effort, we contribute to bridging the gap between DRR and CCA research in both the physical and social sciences (Gaillard &amp; Mercer, 2013). We demonstrate an empirical and theoretical approach to accomplishing this integration that leverages concepts of psychological distance. Second, we respond to the need for more research on the role of the decision-maker in disaster preparedness (Arnell, 2010; Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke et al., 2013) in a time where concerns regarding technological disasters triggered by natural hazards, or NATECH, are gaining traction (Cruz &amp; Krausmann, 2008).</p><h>Conceptual Background</h><h>Disaster Preparation</h><p>Disaster preparedness is a necessary aspect of organizations\u2019 risk management strategies, particularly when organizations are situated in areas exposed to natural hazards (Josephson et al., 2017; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018; Xiao &amp; Peacock, 2014). Natural hazards often lead to cascading risks on supply chains, sales, and infrastructures (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018). By preparing for these events, companies can reduce systemic and unsystematic disaster risks by managing the impacts of ecological uncertainty (Tashman &amp; Rivera, 2016). Disaster preparation can take many forms including vulnerability assessments, disaster management plans, employee training, and insurance policies (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Sutton &amp; Tierney, 2006).</p><p>Disaster preparation requires decision-makers to make short-term investments that return uncertain, long-term benefits (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). To engage in disaster preparation, decision-makers must perceive the long-term threats associated with disasters as more damaging than the short-term costs of disaster preparation (Lujala et al., 2015; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018). Decision-makers often take very different responses to even common external shocks (Sump &amp; Yi, 2021), which complicates our understanding of decision-making around disaster preparation.</p><p>Prior literature has identified a central role that negative experiences with hazards play in a firm\u2019s propensity to prepare for disaster-causing hazards (Han &amp; Nigg, 2011; Lujala et al., 2015). Oetzel and Oh (2021) found that direct or indirect learning pathways associated with past hazards can explain up to 90% of a firm\u2019s propensity to prepare. This is particularly the case when hazards occurred in the recent past and/or caused significant damage (Golden, 1992; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Oh et al., 2021). However, decision-makers vary in how they interpret past experiences. If firms do not experience economic or other significant losses related to a disaster, be it local or global, decision-makers may perceive their business as sufficiently prepared and take no further action (Josephson et al., 2017). Firms may not perceive past or distant disasters to be representative of the future (McKnight &amp; Linnenluecke, 2019; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). Previous negative experiences can also lead to a sense of helplessness in the face of hazards that play against disaster preparedness (Martin et al., 2009; McGee et al., 2009). Rivera and Clement (2019) found an inverted U relationship between past experiences of natural adversity intensity and propensity to prepare for disasters. This means that decision-makers considering natural hazards might be fickle\u2014too little adversity and preparation may be perceived as unnecessary, whereas too much adversity and preparation may be perceived as hopeless. Gasbarro and Pinkse (2016) further explained that how managers understand physical climate impacts in terms of their awareness of hazards and their firm\u2019s vulnerability partially explains their adaptation behavior. In sum, the role of negative disaster experience in disaster preparation remains mixed (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018).</p><p>How managers perceive specific threats and their knowledge of hazards plays a significant role in disaster preparation decisions regardless of experience with past hazards (Liu &amp; Haimes, 1999; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Slovic, 1987). Heuristics and biases influence how decision-makers perceive threats and often explain varied responses to disaster experience (Kasdan, 2018; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021). Similarly, decision-makers vary in terms of their knowledge and are often unaware of their exposure to climate-mediated disasters (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016). Since climate is a generalization of long-term weather patterns\u2014usually computed over 30\u2009years\u2014understanding climate change requires the challenging capacity to abstract daily and seasonal weather from long-term climate trends (Br\u00fcgger &amp; Pidgeon, 2018; Moser, 2010; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018). Prior work has pointed to the need to seek out additional knowledge to respond effectively (Orsato et al., 2019). The interplay between perception and knowledge of hazards and disaster preparation is explored in more detail in the following section on psychological distance.</p><h>Understanding Disaster Preparation Through Psychological Distance</h><p>Psychological distance refers to how individuals\u2019 attentional behaviors can be cognitively separated from stimuli that are not in an individual\u2019s direct experience (Baltatescu, 2014). Psychological distance comprises the four dimensions of temporal distance, social distance, geographical distance, and uncertainty (Liberman &amp; Trope, 2008).</p><p>Spence et al. (2012) define temporal distance as the time separating an individual\u2019s present time and that of future events or consequences. Temporal distance involves future discounting and reflects the tendency to focus on current, involuntary, controllable, and frequent events rather than ones that occur more gradually, episodically, and/or in the distant future (Ansari et al., 2011; Finucane et al., 2000; Lujala et al., 2015; Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019). Prior research has studied how temporal distance can become distorted. For example, managers often find themselves adopting a short-term orientation owing to shareholder pressures, thus failing to make long-term investments toward uncertain futures as a result (Bansal &amp; DesJardine, 2014; Kim et al., 2019; Slawinski &amp; Bansal, 2015). Nyberg et al. (2020) show that these short-term pressures may themselves derive from industry, non-governmental organizations, and government actors that purposefully mobilize temporality to frame issues as more or less salient.</p><p>A second dimension is social distance which increases as individuals differ in terms of their social background such as along socioeconomic, racial, and national factors. It is frequently discussed how the effects of climate change are more pronounced in developing nations which are often very different from more developed countries (Wang et al., 2019). Events that are occurring to socially distant others may be perceived as being less salient or impactful in part because they seem to be problems for very different people (Spence et al., 2012). The third dimension, geographic distance, is the physical distance between an individual and an event of interest (Spence et al., 2012). In most instances, the closer the threat, the more psychologically close the decision-maker will feel (Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019). Decision-makers are more likely to perceive a threat as salient if it is happening closer to their physical location.</p><p>Finally, uncertainty reflects a decision-maker\u2019s confidence that an event will happen (Spence et al., 2012). Firms are required to make operational and investment decisions, and this is more difficult to do when future climate events are perceived to be highly uncertain (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke &amp; Griffiths, 2010, 2012). Uncertainty leads to a greater psychological distance from the threat of climate-mediated natural disasters. Prior research has found that the potential for indirect impacts from natural hazards can increase uncertainty (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016). A good example of an indirect impact is suffering reputational damage from suppliers or customers related to failed business continuity. These indirect impacts vary in their likelihood of occurrence and in their financial impacts, thereby increasing uncertainty. The four dimensions of psychological distance are interrelated and can reinforce one another. For example, temporally distant climate events are also often considered more uncertain (Spence et al., 2012).</p><p>Psychological distance informs the connection between wildfire experience and perception. For instance, Lujala et al. (2015) found that personal experience with hazards was the most influential factor in vulnerability perception, pointing to the positive effect of geographical closeness and a reduction in uncertainty. Respondents who have experienced disasters were 40% more likely to be concerned about future events than those who did not (Lujala et al., 2015). We assume that firms learn from wildfire experience (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021), and learning comes with an understanding of their exposure or psychological closeness (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke &amp; Griffiths, 2010; Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019; Weinhofer &amp; Busch, 2013). However, the relationship between psychological closeness and how decision-makers attend to stimuli is contingent. For example, firms that successfully navigate natural hazards may come to trust in their ability to mitigate a disaster and defer or avoid disaster preparation activities (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019). Similarly, some physically distant events can increase in personal relevance for decision-makers such as when sensationalistic depiction of hazards by the media triggers feelings of fear and anxiety (Matlock et al., 2017). Oetzel and Oh (2021) found that managers were more willing to learn from other firms in locations characterized by high-impact, low-frequency disasters even if those firms were located far away. In this way, the psychological distance of hazards is subject to continual updating.</p><h>Psychological Distance and Disaster Preparation</h><p>We build on this research by showing how psychological distance organizes theorizing regarding how and under what conditions past hazard experience will influence future disaster preparation. Psychological distance provides structure to how disaster preparation decisions are influenced because it helps to explain how and in what ways hazards appear more relevant to managers. This resembles prior research that found managers direct increasing attention toward hazards that occur more frequently (Ortiz-de-Mandojana &amp; Bansal, 2016) and toward hazards that are part of a common public discourse (Bednarek et al., 2022). In what follows, we unpack prior research on how psychological distance influences decision-maker awareness, knowledge, and perception of control as it relates to disaster preparedness decisions. The varying, and at times opposing relationships we highlight, drive our configural theoretical approach (Fiss, 2007).</p><p>A key precursor to action on disaster preparation is awareness of the threats or conditions predicating that action (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016). One such underlying condition is anthropogenic climate change which has been linked to increased natural hazards such as wildfires. However, climate change is not always top of mind for many organizational decision-makers (McDonald et al., 2015). This may be because understanding the impact of climate change requires managers to first develop an abstract understanding of climate change before applying that knowledge to a particular decision (Aven, 2013; Br\u00fcgger &amp; Pidgeon, 2018; Moser, 2010; Weichselgartner &amp; Pigeon, 2015). Managers who are comfortable doing so are more likely to accept climate change-mediated hazards as expected, thereby lowering uncertainty. In short, a belief in climate change provides an explanation for the more frequent occurrence of wildfires, thereby reducing uncertainty (Carlson et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2009).</p><p>In addition to awareness, perceptions of control can influence decision-makers responses to natural hazards (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke &amp; Griffiths, 2010, 2012). Control refers to whether the decision-maker feels a sense of hopelessness or confidence regarding their ability to navigate a natural hazard. This perception of control may be influenced by decision-makers\u2019 understanding of local natural hazards and be influenced by different dimensions of psychological distance (Galbreath, 2011). For example, the impact of perceptions of control works in reverse when managers experience repeated low-intensity natural hazards. In these cases, managers can underestimate and potentially ignore the threat of natural hazards, ignoring what they cannot control (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2014, 2022). Exacerbating this effect, climate scientists often express the long-term impacts of climate change that are less relevant for short business cycles of firm decision-makers (Ford et al., 2010; Lujala et al., 2015). Prior research has argued that firms wishing to maintain control during disaster situations may struggle to do so if they perceive the future of climate events to be psychologically distant (Linnenluecke &amp; Griffiths, 2010, 2012; Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019). Relatedly, some managers may deem that addressing wildfire hazards is outside of their locus of control, deferring instead to natural scientists or governments that they may argue have a greater capacity and responsibility in this regard. Such conflicting notions of perception around hopelessness and confidence regarding the controllability of wildfires make it an interesting condition to test the influence of certainty (dimension of psychological distance) on disaster preparation.</p><h>Assessing Wildfire Perception With Wildfire Exposure</h><p>A manager\u2019s perception of wildfire risk is necessarily an abstraction of actual wildfire exposure. The presence of wildfire exposure is the first element of vulnerability and the primary pre-condition for risk (Adger, 2006; Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Lee et al., 2015). While wildfire is a highly prevalent hazard in Canada, there remains a great deal of variability in wildfire exposure (Brandt et al., 2013). Prior organizational research often focuses on self-reported measures of wildfire exposure rather than expert assessments (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021; Pinkse &amp; Gasbarro, 2019). Expert assessments of risk are difficult to generate but hold the promise of permitting a more nuanced exploration of perception against the backdrop of more objective assessments of wildfire exposure.</p><p>Our research builds from this prior understanding of psychological distance in the context of disaster preparation. As the above demonstrates, the relationship between psychological distance and disaster preparedness is complex involving contingent factors. Thus, we adopt a QCA approach that is well-suited to build configurational theory. This type of theorizing explains how combinations of conditions configure together to generate an outcome of interest (Fiss, 2007). This approach offers new explanations regarding how managerial experience and perceptions related to prior wildfire experiences, climate change, and their controllability influence disaster preparedness.</p><h>Methodology</h><h>Data and Context</h><p>We focused our study on ore, oil, and gas extraction sites\u2014hereafter, extraction sites\u2014in Canada\u2019s forested areas. These organizations place substantial fixed assets, people, and operations in locations that are subject to fast-paced environmental pressures and the fastest-rising temperatures of any forested area in the world (Creed et al., 2019; Erdozain et al., 2019; Gauthier et al., 2015; IPCC, 2022; Kato et al., 2020; Musetta-Lambert et al., 2019). We excluded any facilities that were not at least in very advanced stages of exploration with significant operational investments. Extraction sites are dependent on large, fixed assets such as buildings and processing plants; they use a variety of chemicals that might be flammable or are stored within flammable facilities; they operate in remote natural locations; they rely on extensive and complex transportation and supply systems; and they must commit to intensive environmental permitting (International Council on Mining &amp; Metals, 2019; Khakzad, 2018; Pearce et al., 2011). Such investments present an incentive for companies to prepare for disasters and thus are suitable candidates for our study (Eggert, 2010).</p><p>We collected data for our analysis from multiple sources. Our primary data source was a survey that we administered (see Appendix). The survey was administered to site-level decision-makers at the in-person Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada conference in March 2020, over a period of 2\u2009days. This conference brings together over 1,000 exhibitors from the mineral exploration industry which thus offered an ideal event from which to recruit respondents. Two of the authors attended this conference and approached mining exhibits to identify appropriate respondents. Through conversation, the authors were able to identify respondents from operating mining sites or advanced-stage exploration sites in Canada possessing sufficient site-level understanding. Respondents took approximately 15\u2009min to complete the survey on paper. These surveys were collected and digitized. Administering surveys in person provided a high degree of confidence that the respondent and site were appropriate for the study. Table 1 describes the 20 mining sites in our study. The survey was supplemented with visits to the mining firm\u2019s website and expert analysis of the geographical region in which the mining site sits.</p><h>Table 1.</h><p>Description of Study Mining

Preparedness</h><p>Drawing on prior research (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2021), we generated survey questions to measure disaster preparedness. We measured disaster preparation via two items\u2014<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">established a disaster management program</emphasis> (Appendix: 12c) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">conducted at least one training event regarding natural disaster preparedness in the last year</emphasis> (Appendix: 12g). We used these two items because planning for disasters through both programs and training events are critical for protecting physical property, maintaining business operations, adapting to new threats, and ensuring the safety of employees (Castillo, 2005; Josephson et al., 2017; Xiao &amp; Peacock, 2014).</p><p>The four dimensions of psychological distance are captured in this study via conditions that deal with perception: belief in anthropogenic climate change, perception of regional increase in wildfires, controllability of wildfires, and experience with wildfires. We describe these below.</p><h>Belief in Anthropogenic Climate Change</h><p>We derived our survey question for this condition (Appendix: 14b) using a study by Wang et al. (2019). We focused on the statements related to whether the respondents believed that climate change was caused by human activity. This belief runs contrary to much of the narrative espoused historically by the extractive resource sector. Due to this, many decision-makers in this industry may feel socially distant from climate issues and thus climate-mediated natural hazards. We argue that belief in anthropogenic climate change reduces the uncertainty with which the respondent views the prevalence of climate-mediated natural hazards. Such a belief decreases psychological distance and increases the likelihood to prepare (Hoffmann et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019).</p><h>Perception of Regional Increase in Wildfires</h><p>This condition assesses a respondent\u2019s understanding of their geographic exposure to wildfires. We used the item <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">there is increasing prevalence of forest fires in the area surrounding our mining operation</emphasis> (Appendix: 14k). Respondents who rate this condition highly express a lower psychological distance to wildfire hazards. Regional increases in wildfire capture all four dimensions of psychological distance. This perception relates to each of temporal, social, and geographic closeness as the individual believes their physical location to be experiencing elevated wildfire hazard at that moment in time, impacting similar businesses and people. The perception of increasing wildfires denotes a decreased uncertainty among the decision-makers as to their occurrence.</p><h>Controllability of Wildfires</h><p>This condition refers to whether the decision-maker feels a sense of hopelessness or (over)confidence regarding the controllability of wildfires. A respondent\u2019s perception of the controllability of wildfires influences their propensity to prepare for disasters (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke &amp; Griffiths, 2010, 2012). We used <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">there is little that can be done about large wildfires disrupting mining operations</emphasis> (Appendix: 9a) to operationalize controllability. Controllability is influenced by the individuals\u2019 certainty regarding wildfires in their region.</p><h>Disaster Experience With Wildfires</h><p>In the survey, we used one question with four different items (Appendix: 11d, 11e, 11f, and 11g), derived from Oetzel and Oh (2021), to understand the extent of the firm\u2019s experience with disasters including the impacts of facilities, operation stoppage, supply chain disruption, and shipment disruption. Respondents who experienced significant direct impacts on their facilities likely feel less uncertain regarding the potential for natural hazards. They also likely have a decreased psychological distance due to the occurrence of relatively recent and proximate natural hazards.</p><h>Company Size</h><p>Corporate contexts within the firm also affect disaster preparation (Han &amp; Nigg, 2011). Company size, for example, is a key factor (Josephson et al., 2017). Firms with more employees have a greater ability to prepare for disasters and have been shown to do so (Quarantelli et al., 1979). Similarly, companies with more financial resources can more readily adopt adaptation and mitigation strategies (Josephson et al., 2017). Other corporate contexts that influence disaster preparation strategies include the industry sector, property ownership, firm age, location patterns, and sector differences (Han &amp; Nigg, 2011; Josephson et al., 2017). To assess company size, we gathered the number of employees and total assets from company reports.</p><h>Wildfire Exposure</h><p>Wildfire hazard is commonly understood as the product of fire probability and fire intensity, while exposed assets are any resources that have human or ecological value (Johnston et al., 2020; Thompson et al., 2011); in the context of this study, these assets might be processing and storage facilities, pipelines, roads, power lines, and worker camps (Khakzad, 2018; Khakzad et al., 2018). Spatial congruence between fire hazard and assets determines exposure. We created an atlas covering all 20 study sites with burn probability, fire intensity, fuel type and cover, and geographic and statistical information related to historical fire perimeters and area burned (see Figure 1 for an example). Burn probability and fire intensity data were obtained using the Burn-P3 stochastic wildfire simulation model (Parisien et al., 2019); fuel data were extracted from the Fire Behavior Prediction System whose fuel categories are based on a classification of Canadian forest cover at a 250\u2009m spatial resolution (Beaudoin et al., 2014; Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group, 1992). Historical fire data were extracted from the National Large Fire Database1; historical fire activity being a valuable indicator of local fire-proneness (McWethy et al., 2019). The atlas was created using QGIS 3.16.4-Hannover (QGIS, 2020). Experts were then asked whether, considering their expertise and the data in the atlas, they would assess the site as being at risk to wildfire within a 50-km radius of the main extraction site.</p><h>Figure 1.</h><p>Wildfire Atlas of Mining Sites (Example ID 1)</p><p>In summary, we have adopted measures or conditions that tap into the different dimensions of psychological distance. Dimensions of psychological distance are often interconnected meaning that conditions often reflect factors from multiple dimensions of psychological distance. Temporal distance is captured by the condition of regional increase in wildfire. Social and geographic distance is reflected in the conditions of regional increase in wildfires as well as past experience with wildfires. Finally, uncertainty is captured by the conditions related to belief in anthropogenic climate change, regional increase in wildfires, experience with wildfires, and controllability of wildfires.</p><h>Qualitative Comparative Analysis</h><p>We employed a QCA methodology to study how different combinations of conditions generate multiple pathways toward our dependent variable of interest, disaster preparedness. Whereas regression techniques disaggregate cases into distinct independent variables and assess how these variables compete to create an outcome (Fiss, 2007; Ganter &amp; Hecker, 2014), a configurational approach maintains that causation cannot be so readily disaggregated. QCA as a method is uniquely capable of addressing how complex and nonlinear relationships between measures lead to an outcome of interest (Delmas &amp; Pekovic, 2018; Ragin, 2006; Short et al., 2008). Outcomes are often the result of multiple causes that may work in concert or disagreement with one another (Delmas &amp; Pekovic, 2018; Greckhamer et al., 2008). QCA is a case-based, set-theoretic methodology that uses Boolean algebraic logic rather than regression algorithms (Fiss, 2011; Greckhamer et al., 2013). QCA is favored over multiple linear regression analysis when the goal is to understand how measures combine, instead of compete, toward an outcome (Delmas &amp; Pekovic, 2018; Fiss, 2011).</p><p>The foundation of the QCA methodology is identifying when a case, in our study a mining site, are members of the set of mining sites meeting a particular condition. For example, in our analysis, we assess whether mining sites are members of a set of mining sites that are large or have wildfire exposure. For each condition, the analytical approach is to assess whether it is necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome of interest, that membership in these \u201cexplanatory\u201d conditions is present. A condition is necessary if it is required for a particular outcome condition, such that the outcome is never present without the necessary condition (Schneider &amp; Wagemann, 2009). A condition is referred to as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sufficient</emphasis> when the outcome is present whenever that condition or conditions are present. Both necessary and sufficient conditional statements produce complex causal statements that test and identify combinations of conditions that result in outcomes of interest. Importantly, solutions that are sufficient for successful disaster preparedness are not always necessary which gives way to complex causal pathways.</p><h>Crisp-Set QCA</h><p>Case membership scores are assigned to sets that describe conditions. We employed a crisp-set QCA (csQCA) strategy to evaluate set memberships in a dichotomous or \u201ccrisp\u201d way, assigning cases as \u201cfully in\u201d (membership score of 1) or \u201cfully out\u201d (membership score of 0) of the sets (Greckhamer et al., 2013). We chose not to employ fuzzy-set QCA, another analytical approach, because our conditions of interest do not have easily defined underlying gradients (Greckhamer et al., 2013). Set membership was assigned or calibrated for each condition within each case (Fiss, 2011). Table 2 presents the crisp-set membership calibration for all the conditions.

devising a single quantitative exposure analysis method did not seem appropriate. Thus, we relied on expert elicitation to classify the exposure of extraction sites, either as exposed (1) or non-exposed (0); experts were wildfire research scientists from the Canadian Forest Service. Experts were shown surveys containing atlases covering all 20 sites (Figure 1) and were asked whether, considering their expertise and the data in the atlas, they would assess the site as being at risk to wildfire. For 13 of the 20 sites, the majority (80%) of experts agreed on exposure levels.</p><h>Analytical Approach and Truth Tables</h><p>Following the calibration of our outcome and explanatory conditions, we constructed two truth tables consisting of all 64 (26) possible configurations of our six explanatory conditions (Tables 4 and 5). Consistency demonstrates how well a perfect subset relation is approximated (Greckhamer et al., 2013). We adopted a high threshold consistency of 0.8. The objective of csQCA is to obtain a consistency of 1.00; however, consistencies that are close to this value are acceptable and to be expected with small-N studies (Ragin, 2006). By applying this 0.8 consistency threshold, we reduced the number of possible configurations to 20 unique configurations for both outcomes. This was reduced further to seven and six abstract configurations for the management plan and disaster training outcomes, respectively, using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm found in the fs/QCA software package (Fiss, 2011).</p><h>Table 4.</h><p>Truth Table for Manag_Plan Generated Using the fs/QCA Software.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"11\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\"

membership across multiple conditions were associated with disaster preparation in the form of disaster management programs and disaster preparedness training (Fiss, 2011). Boolean algorithms employed by the fs/QCA tool simplified the truth tables by connecting case memberships in a configuration of conditions to membership in the outcomes of interest (Fiss, 2011). As a result, a Boolean statement is generated, which details all configurations that are sufficient but not necessary for the outcome to occur. This enables us to define multiple, equifinal configurations of conditions that are related to disaster preparation (Fiss, 2011).</p><h>Results</h><p>Our data show that three-quarters (14 of the 20 firms) prepared disaster management plans however less than half (9 out of 20) engaged in disaster training. Table 3 describes the firms\u2019 set membership in each condition assessed in our study. Of the firms that engaged in both management plans and disaster training, six had a site manager who believed in anthropogenic climate change, five perceived a regional increase in wildfires, five were negatively impacted by past hazards, two perceived wildfires were controllable, four were large companies, and three were exposed to wildfires as assessed by experts. The average firm in our study was 25\u2009years old and 90% fully owned their operations; an equal number operated under domestic ownership (Table 1).</p><h>Sufficient Configurations for Disaster Preparation</h><p>Each column in Tables 6 and 7 represents a distinct configuration; a combination of conditions associated with possessing a disaster management plan or disaster training, respectively.

however, case 17 appears in configurations 1 and 2.</p><p>Core conditions are highlighted using larger solid dots or hollow circles and peripheral conditions are denoted by smaller dots and circles. Core and peripheral conditions are identified using counterfactual analysis. This is a valuable analysis because, as is common in this analysis, our data did not cover all possible configurations of conditions in a truth table. Configurations without empirical evidence are referred to as remainders and represent the \u201climited diversity\u201d in our data. Counterfactual analysis addresses this limited diversity by creating two solutions. The first solution, referred to as the parsimonious solution, simplifies the solution by making generous assumptions about remainders to remove unnecessary conditions and arrive at the most simplified solution possible (Misangyi &amp; Acharya, 2014). The intermediate solution employs researcher assumptions about whether, based on prior theory, a particular condition is expected to be associated with the outcome condition of interest (Fiss, 2011). For our analysis, we assumed that the presence of negative disaster experience, the perception that disasters are increasing regionally, and company size were each associated with increased disaster preparation. Core conditions are those present in both parsimonious and intermediate solutions, while peripherals are only present in the intermediate solution, meaning these conditions can only be excluded once the theoretical assumptions about remainders are relaxed (Fiss, 2011; see Ragin, 2000 for detailed reviews). Core conditions offer a stronger causal relationship to outcome conditions than that of peripheral conditions because they align with known relationships from past research that are specified in the intermediate solution.</p><p>Coverage and consistency scores are presented for the overall solution (bottom of the table) and each configuration (each column) within the analysis. Coverage measures how well the solution as a whole and each configuration individually describes the cases of disaster preparedness in our sample (Fiss, 2011). Consistency scores explain the extent to which the solution and configurations achieve higher instances of disaster preparation. The coverage and consistency scores for both the individual configurations and the overall solutions for both desired outcomes are above the acceptable threshold of 0.80 (Fiss, 2011). The disaster management program outcome has seven configurations associated with adoption and the disaster preparedness training outcome has six.</p><h>Groups of Configurations</h><p>When interpreting the results, we sought to understand how configurations of conditions (columns) grouped together resulted in decisions to adopt disaster management programs and/or training. The configurations in our solutions were cohered into five groups as indicated in Tables 6 and 7 and described below.</p><p>The first group we labeled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disaster Survivors (DS)</emphasis>. The three configurations (1, 11, and 12) in this group were anchored on possessing previous experience with wildfire disasters. The configurations differed, however, in terms of whether regional wildfires were increasing in their area and whether experts assessed their mines to be at risk. A second group of configurations, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disaster Believers (DB)</emphasis>, were associated with a belief that regional wildfires were increasing. Importantly, these configurations (2, 8, and 9) did not express confidence that the impacts of these wildfires could be controlled suggesting that these firms were highly concerned about the challenging threat of wildfires. For one of these configurations, this also included a belief that climate change was anthropogenic. The third group we labeled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Large and Exposed (LE)</emphasis> because these configurations (3 and 4) were characterized by larger firms that were seen by experts as being exposed to wildfire risk. A fourth group, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Large and Pessimistic (LP)</emphasis>, reflected configurations (5, 10, and 13) which consisted of large firms that argued controlling wildfires was a hopeless pursuit. The final group we labeled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Experienced and In Control (EC)</emphasis>, to denote how firms in these configurations (6 and 7) had experienced wildfire disasters but had asserted confidence that their impacts could be controlled or mitigated.</p><h>Condition Combinations</h><p>We also explored how different conditions alone or in combination substituted or complemented each other (rows) across these configurations.</p><p>We found that negative experience with wildfire was an important condition that was often associated with adopting natural hazard training and management plans. In the six configurations associated with Disaster Survivors and Experienced and In Control, this experience was present. However, it was not a necessary condition. In the configurations where negative experience was not present, it was most often the case that the manager perceived natural hazards as increasing in prevalence such as the case with Disaster Believers (four configurations). At times, this was coupled with a belief in anthropogenic climate change.</p><p>Interestingly, while the presence of control seemed important when implementing disaster management programs such as for configurations in the Experienced and In Control group (Configurations 4, 6, and 7\u2014Table 6), the absence of control (Configurations 1\u20133 and 6\u2014Table 7) was associated with adopting disaster training. In configurations 8 and 9, the lack of control was coupled with a sense that wildfire hazards were increasing in the region, whereas, in 13, the lack of control was coupled with experience with past hazards. Putting these two insights together highlights that addressing hazards can be a frustrating experience for managers of mining firms with a lack of control coupled with impending and increasing risks or risk perception.</p><p>When examining the configurations, we found that company size was often positively associated with the adoption of disaster management programs and training. This was the case in configurations 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Table 6 associated with disaster management plans and in configurations 8, 10, and 13 in Table 7 associated with disaster training.</p><p>We note poor alignment between managerial perceptions of exposure to wildfire and expert assessment of the same exposure. We note that almost half of respondents (9 of 20 in Table 4) disagreed with expert assessments of wildfire hazard either by expressing that it was there when experts disagreed or by underreporting it when it was indeed high. Perhaps more concerning still, of the six organizations without a disaster management plan, four were assessed by experts as being highly exposed to wildfire.</p><p>We note some configurations appeared common or similar across both outcome conditions. Configurations 1 and 11 are associated with firms that have experience with disasters but without concern that these disasters would increase. This lack of concern is corroborated in these configurations by the absence of expert assessments concerned about high wildfire exposure levels. Configurations 2 and 8, members of the Disaster Believers group, are firms that believe strongly that they are increasingly exposed to wildfires; a concern that is more abstract in nature as it is not corroborated by expert assessment. Configurations in the Large and Exposed group are larger firms that share an expert-verified risk of wildfire hazard. These firms may also share a concern that climate change is manmade and of concern. These firms are planning for very real wildfire risks. Configurations in the Large and Pessimistic group refer to large and well-resourced firms that, despite a lack of expert-assessed wildfire exposure, are engaging in disaster preparedness due to their large size and the capacity to engage in these activities.</p><h>Theory Development and Discussion</h><p>We studied how conditions related to prior wildfire experience and the perceptions that managers have regarding wildfire occurrence, climate change, and controllability influence disaster preparedness. Our results, while consistent with previous research on risk perception, offer new insights regarding the determinants of DRR in the extraction industry. We answer past calls for more work on the role of decision-makers in disaster preparation (Arnell, 2010; Borlu &amp; Glenna, 2021; Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke et al., 2013), by building configural explanations of causality that can provide more nuance to our understanding.</p><h>Wildfire Exposure</h><p>Our study is unique in that our assessment of managerial perceptions regarding wildfire exposure was corroborated\u2014or not\u2014by several wildfire risk experts. We found that managerial perceptions and expert assessments agreed only approximately half of the time. These perception errors were symmetric. Managers perceived exposure that experts assessed as not present while at other times perceived no exposure when experts argued for its presence. This is a critically important finding because prior research data have been largely constrained to data-capturing managerial perceptions, whereas, in this study, we also consider expert analysis. Studies considering exposure to wildfires might consider specifying if their assessment is based on perceptions from lay people or on potentially more objective risk analysis techniques utilizing experts.</p><p>In our approach, wildfire hazard exposure assessment involved evaluating a set of variables including historical wildfire activity, the presence and type of vegetal fuels, the probability of a location experiencing a fire on a yearly basis, and the expected median fireline intensity. The complexity induced by this number of factors can make exposure levels hard to quantitively evaluate without advanced data processing techniques calibrated to various wildfire environments. We thus argue that the recourse to an expert elicitation method, despite existing limitations and the unavoidable effects of an expert\u2019s own perception error (Morgan, 2014), offers a straightforward means to reduce reliance on lay perceptions of wildfire risk. We suggest that studies focusing on the determinants of DRR action in various environmental settings consider non-expert and expert assessment in parallel.</p><p>By measuring not just perception of exposure but also connecting respondents\u2019 survey responses with spatial and biophysical data that detailed actual wildfire exposure measures, we create an opportunity to assess and explore the gap between expert and layman risk assessment. This finding emphasizes the important role that psychological distance and perception can play on how decision-makers assign their limited attentional capacities in adaptation efforts (Millett &amp; Simon, 1947; Ocasio, 1997, 2011). Our methods reflect the reality that managers must convert complex wildfire hazard data and take discrete actions. Decision-makers assess a range of data and make a dichotomous decision on whether to act. We take our finding that experts disagreed with managers regarding the presence of wildfire hazards as support for the importance of perception and psychological distance in disaster preparation decisions (Br\u00fcgger &amp; Pidgeon, 2018).</p><h>Wildfire Perception</h><p>Prior research has found that direct negative experience with natural hazards increases attention and action (Oetzel &amp; Oh, 2018, 2021) and is often required to sufficiently elevate concern regarding the impacts of climate change (Lujala et al., 2015). Our findings reinforce this as evidenced by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disaster Survivors</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Experienced and In Control</emphasis> configurations of firms. However, our research also finds that other elements of perception including belief in anthropogenic climate change and a perception that wildfires are increasing were commonly present or even substituted for direct negative experience with a disaster as was the case for firms in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disaster Believers</emphasis> group of configurations. This finding is similar to that of Oetzel and Oh (2021) that found organizational experience alone is often not enough incentive to prepare. They found that experience encourages managers to learn from others, which then initiates preparation.</p><p>In our analysis, four conditions affected decision-makers\u2019 perceptions of their exposure to wildfire. These explanatory conditions included whether the respondent held a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">belief in anthropogenic climate change</emphasis>, had <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">perceptions of regional increase in wildfires</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">controllability of wildfires</emphasis> (discussed in the following subsection), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">experience with wildfires</emphasis>. We found that in most cases wildfire exposure was salient to the decision-maker. However, two of three other conditions needed to be present <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">before</emphasis> decision-makers acted on signals regarding past wildfire hazards and prepared for disasters.</p><p>We draw on the concept of psychological distance to explain this finding. First, prior experience with disasters reflects decreasing geographic, temporal, and social distance (Spence et al., 2012). Experiencing a disaster makes potential risks real. Decision-makers understand that wildfire risks are physically close and can happen at any time. The risks can no longer be discounted as being associated with different types of organizations or people. Second, the belief that climate change is anthropogenic reduces the perception of uncertainty as decision-makers can better explain the possibility of more frequent and intense wildfires. That climate change is anthropogenic provides a plausible causal mechanism for the prevalence of wildfire that could increase the propensity for action. Third, increasing regional wildfire occurrences reflect a decreasing geographical distance between the organization and the negative impact of wildfire. As wildfire hazards increasingly occur close to the decision-maker, they are both physically and psychologically closer to the risks. When managers feel sufficiently psychologically close to these events, they are more likely to focus time and effort on disaster preparation efforts.</p><p>Our research addresses prior calls to focus on the important role of climate change perception (Borlu &amp; Glenna, 2021), but it also suggests that more work on wildfire prevention and communication from the authorities could be done. Wildfires may indeed be seen as too rare and too stochastic for companies to prepare proactively beyond what might be imposed by federal or provincial regulation (McKnight &amp; Linnenluecke, 2019), yet current and future fire-proneness of Canadian forests indicates that reactive-only response to disaster might be a risky strategy.</p><h>Controllability</h><p>We found interesting the role played by the perception of control as it pertains to wildfires. For some firms, the combination of control and a prior negative disaster experience appeared to be associated with adopting disaster management programming. This suggests some firms might have been empowered by a combination of urgent experience and a comfort that, through action, the negative impacts of wildfires could be controlled. However, more prevalent appeared to be an association between a lack of perceived control and the adoption of disaster management training. In no disaster training, configuration was controllability a required condition. We infer that for many firms, engaging in disaster training played a critical role in compensating for this lack of control. This finding contrasts with prior research that has found that a sense of controllability led to a feeling of confidence and capacity to adapt (Baltatescu, 2014; Liberman &amp; Trope, 2008). Our findings better support the contrary perspective that firms engage in disaster preparation as a means of compensating for a lack of control (Gasbarro &amp; Pinkse, 2016; Linnenluecke &amp; Griffiths, 2010, 2012). This may be particularly relevant for managers of firms in the extractive industry as their mining sites are fixed in place for decades and cannot be readily moved to a less hazard-exposed location. This necessary long-term connection with the mining site may help managers at these firms to feel psychologically \u201ccloser\u201d to the wildfire risk due to more certainty that wildfire will, at some point, impact these sites over the life of a mine.</p><h>Company Size</h><p>Company size is often positively associated with adopting disaster management programs and training such as those firms in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Large and Exposed</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Large and Pessimistic</emphasis> group of configurations. This finding likely speaks to how larger companies have greater resources to invest in such preparation activities, which corroborates past research findings (Josephson et al., 2017; Quarantelli et al., 1979).</p><h>Limitations and Future Research</h><p>This research has limitations that should be considered. One key limitation is the absence of smoke variables within our exposure assessment. Incorporating smoke in our expert assessment is challenging. Smoke emissions are heavily dependent on local weather conditions during fires in surrounding areas, and smoke modeling remains notoriously complex (Sokolik et al., 2019). Moreover, despite smoke being an important element of wildfire exposure, and assuredly a safety concern to companies\u2019 personnel and operations (Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, 2015); existing data on evacuation show that more than 80% of evacuations that have happened in Canada were triggered by a direct threat from fire, not because of smoke. Regardless, incorporating smoke may prove a productive addition to a fulsome understanding of wildfire exposure. A second limitation of our study is the relatively small number of companies (20) under study. This study also focuses on a Canadian context which removes international regulatory concerns, further limiting the generalizability of the study. A third limitation is incorporating legal obligations regarding wildfire risk reduction and preparedness. It is possible that differences in provincial and territorial regulations explain some of our findings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no specific regulation or mandate exists at the federal level, besides general obligations to intervene during an emergency. Several provinces have regulations pertaining to wildfire and industrial activities that vary in content and scope by province but usually involve creating, submitting, and maintaining a wildfire <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">prevention</emphasis> and an emergency plan and the recommended application of FireSmart principles. The level of details of these plans, their level of implementation and their actuality, are unknown (private information) and likely vary by site and industry. Fourth, as companies develop mines from exploration and discovery through development and production, the number of employees tends to grow. Care should be taken in evaluating the impact of company size on disaster preparation as this condition might be conflated with the stage in a mine\u2019s life cycle.</p><p>Our findings suggest that future research building configurational theory would help to better understand disaster preparedness. Research should continue to explore how measures of exposure as assessed by hazard experts configure with other conditions found to influence disaster preparation. Our exposure variable measures only one hazard, wildfire, and trends call for multi-hazard assessments (McKnight &amp; Linnenluecke, 2019). Adding additional hazards such as flooding and extreme heat, for example, would be a productive next step. This will better capture exposure and its alignment with individuals\u2019 perceptions of their exposure and vulnerability.</p><h>Managerial Implications</h><p>Our focus on the natural resources extraction industry is important and timely as this sector will continue to face the effects of climate change (Gauthier et al., 2015; IPCC, 2022; Kato et al., 2020). For managers, understanding whether, when, and how to invest in disaster preparation activities is critically important. Prior research has identified gaps in managerial knowledge regarding climate change. Managers without this knowledge appear to struggle to connect climate change to concrete impacts on their business (Weinhofer &amp; Busch, 2013). Pinkse and Gasbarro (2019) found that firms are aware of informational resources that would help them to understand climate change (e.g., IPCC) but may not connect these resources to their mining context and daily practice. Our study reaffirms this gap and the need to help managers more clearly understand the implications of climate change on their businesses; furthermore, it underlines the paucity of research focusing on wildfire DRR in industries that many consider critical to Canada\u2019s economy. We find that many firms that were taking DRR actions were not those at most risk, and conversely, many firms that were exposed to wildfires did not have a disaster plan in place.</p><p>Assessing wildfire risk is a challenging and uncertain undertaking, and the specifics of wildfire risk reduction and preparedness resulting from such assessment will depend on the characteristics of the mining site. Managers may consider finding sources of verification and validation to \u201ccorrect\u201d difficulties in properly attending to the true risk of disaster for a particular site such as engaging a panel of wildfire experts to flesh out a more fulsome risk profile for their mining sites. Of course, many larger firms are more likely to engage in disaster preparation simply because they have the resources to do so, leveraging resources across multiple mine sites (Han &amp; Nigg, 2011; Josephson et al., 2017; Quarantelli et al., 1979). Findings from this research may help managers improve their knowledge, preparedness, and even feeling of empowerment to affect disaster preparedness.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Adger W.

He reviewed the progress of various Research and Development efforts by DIBER. The efforts of DIBER to generate energy from Pine Forest waste, are directed towards finding solutions for space heating and electricity generation in remote areas where grid supply is frequently interrupted due to adverse climatic conditions. Since pine forest waste causes thousands of forest fire incidents; utilization of pine forest waste towards energy generation is a win-win situation.</p><p>The Biodiesel prepared by DIBER, is matching IS 15607 standards. It has been rigorously tested, found suitable and recommended in Army vehicles and Gen Sets at a blend of 20% in Petro - diesel. Another mission mode activity of DIBER is to transfer advanced technologies for cultivation of native and exotic vegetables to farmers located in remote border villages of Uttarakhand. More than 4,000 farmers are registered with DIBER and are being benefited. The enhanced income and socio-economic status are understood to have long term effects on curtailing migration from borders.</p><p>Shri Ajay Bhatt highly appreciated the Hydroponics (soilless cultivation) and suggested to spread this technology in those areas where cultivable land is in scarcity. The herbal medicine produced by DIBER for treating leukoderma has already been used by nearly one lakh patients. He urged that this medicine should reach to the larger population for benefit of mankind.</p><p>The technology to grow Ophiocordyceps, an endangered high value medicinal mushroom, by tissue culture, has far-reaching implications in providing nutritional benefits to larger population and also in improving the economy.</p><p>The Raksha Rajya Mantri also inaugurated Container-based BSL-III facility at Haldwani. This is the first container-based BSL-III facility of Uttarakhand. Being a container-based facility, it can be easily deployed in hills, wherever there is a space crunch. The capacity of the facility is 96 samples per shift. This facility operates at negative pressure and therefore, offers higher protection to the frontline health workers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124924625</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64CH-3G21-JCBF-S50F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 24, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is one of the first high-profile labor standoffs to feature a dispute between workers and management over the issue, which is rippling across the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Really, what we're coming down to is saying that all writing has to have a writer, and that writer needs to be a human being,\" John August, part of the WGA bargaining committee and a former board member, said in an interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The union pushback is an effort to rein in the adoption of technology that is proliferating with few regulatory constraints, as attempts to regulate the wide-ranging field in the U.S. and Europe struggle to keep up with the pace of developments. If regulators don't act, workers' advocates fear, AI could pose threats to privacy, organizing and even entire jobs. </p><p>Much of the recent focus has been on advances in so-called generative AI, which offers tantalizing prospects of efficiency for employers but also the threat of upheaval for certain white-collar and creative industries, where unions have significant sway. The technology is based on machine learning models, through which it can produce something new, including lucid text, based on patterns drawn from a pool of existing information. </p><p>AI, algorithms and other automated tools are being used in everything from screening job applicants and evaluating employee performance to tracking workers' movements - even their keystrokes. Recent innovations in the technology, most notably ChatGPT, may have marked a tipping point in its spread to the workplace, with implications for a much broader set of workers.</p><p>\"With this latest iteration of AI, obviously, a whole lot of additional folks are starting to think it could impact them,\" said Beth Allen, a spokesperson for the Communications Workers of America. \"It's hard to think of an area of our membership that it might not end up touching down the road.\"</p><p>Organized labor has long fretted about the threat of technology displacing workers. Automation has been one of the major sticking points, for instance, in the ongoing contract negotiations between unionized dockworkers and West Coast port operators, an impasse that's gone on for nearly a year.</p><p>But newer tools fueled by AI have many on edge because of the threat they pose to industries previously considered secure from such forces - including some where unions had been making inroads in recent years.</p><p>Advances in generative AI could eventually expose \"the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation,\" economists at Goldman Sachs estimated last month, with two-thirds of all occupations affected in some fashion.</p><p>Office and administrative tasks, as well as legal work, would be most vulnerable to automation, with around 45 percent of work potentially exposed; arts and media could have more than a quarter of current work automated - close to the share for all industries overall, the report said.</p><p>\"There was an assumption in the past that if you were a professional your skills were always going to be needed,\" said Patricia Campos-Medina, executive director of Cornell University's Worker Institute. \"Now we're starting to see the same level of insecurity ... other workers have had to deal with since the Industrial Revolution.\"</p><p>In the WGA's case, the union is demanding that AI won't be used to write or rewrite material covered by the contract and that guild members' work won't be used to train AI. The industry has balked at those terms, as well as other planks of WGA's proposal.</p><p>\"Writers find themselves in the middle of a forest fire where our compensation has been driven down, our working conditions are being driven down, and writing as a career is under attack,\" August said. \"AI feels like an asteroid that's headed towards us. You can't put one over the other; you have to deal with both.\"</p><p>The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers did not return a request to comment Thursday afternoon.</p><p>In another example of the conflict, the actors union SAG-AFTRA, which is scheduled to start its own negotiations with TV and movie studios next month, has drawn a line against allowing AI developers to use digital voice simulations or likenesses without negotiation.</p><p>\"We think AI, and generative AI in particular, is probably one of the most consequential new technological developments we've ever seen for our members, and we want to be on top of it,\" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's national executive director and chief negotiator.</p><p>The union pushback is a concerted effort to constrain the adoption of technology that is proliferating with few regulatory constraints, as attempts to regulate the wide-ranging field in the U.S. and Europe struggle to keep up with the pace of developments.</p><p>The issue is thorny across the board - it spans\u00a0ethics, intellectual property rights, computer science and classroom education - leaving the dizzying task of dealing with the fast-developing technology to regulators and lawmakers whose operative speed is nowhere near as fast.</p><p>There's a bevy of proposals circulating in Congress, but little consensus as of yet.</p><p>\"Surveillance technology and artificial intelligence are becoming more pervasive by the day and right now, there are no guardrails in place to prevent employers from misusing and abusing them. That needs to change,\" Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), who has introduced a bill to restrict use of AI and other surveillance tools in the workplace, said in a statement to POLITICO.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought to fill that void, announcing plans to look into how companies are using AI and other automated tools on their employees. On Thursday, the White House pledged to formulate draft guidelines regarding federal agencies' use of AI, building upon its \"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights\" released last year.</p><p>However, regulatory efforts to date have been rather scattershot - due in part to the complexity of the issue and the overlapping agencies tasked with policing the workplace, let alone society writ large.</p><p>For instance, National Labor Relations Board General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo in October set her sights on uses of electronic monitoring that may interfere with employees' rights to organize and discuss work conditions.</p><p>Abruzzo told POLITICO that employers' use of algorithmic tools on workers risks \"significantly impairing or negating their ability to engage with one another,\" and that the NLRB is investigating several cases involving potential unlawful conduct.</p><p>Meanwhile, a cavalcade of federal agencies, including the Justice Department and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, issued a warning in April against using AI to discriminate or otherwise violate civil rights laws - such as by algorithmically screening out certain racial groups or older job applicants.</p><p>However, officials made clear they were relying on existing authority to do so, rather than creating AI-specific policies.</p><p>\"Even with the rapid developments of technology ... our statutes that we enforce still apply. There's no sort of carve out or anything for use of AI in the workplace,\" said Eunice Ikene, an attorney adviser to EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows.</p><p>There's broad, bipartisan interest in tackling AI at the EEOC, according to Ikene and Victoria Lipnic, a former GOP commissioner. But specific rules on the technology appear years away, particularly as President Joe Biden's appointees remain unable to act without buy-in from Republicans.</p><p>Absent commissioners' formal authorization, the EEOC, which is tasked with enforcing workplace anti-discrimination laws, can issue interpretive guidance and other memos on the subject - though the effect of such moves is limited and susceptible to legal challenges.</p><p>Another option could be to harness the government's influence by tweaking the federal guidelines on the hiring process, in conjunction with other agencies, Lipnic said.</p><p>In the meantime, while Washington tries to get its arms around the issue, fissures between workers and management are likely to proliferate as AI technology proliferates and evolves.</p><p>\"Should government officials be looking at it? Absolutely,\" August said. \"Things are just moving so quickly that we have to be addressing this now in our contract.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-00091105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67YW-2PM1-F118-924R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1427\"/><timeReceived>1:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 8, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523150 INVESTMENT BANKING AND SECURITIES INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523940 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp;

According to news reporting originating from the School of Transportation and Logistics by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Finding the shortest path of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a typical NP-hard problem and one of the basic optimization problems. TSP in three-dimensional space (3D-TSP) is an extension of TSP.\"</p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China.<br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from School of Transportation and Logistics: \"It plays an important role in the fields of 3D path planning and UAV inspection, such as forest fire patrol path planning. Many existing studies have focused on the expected length of the shortest path of TSP in 2D space. The expected length of the shortest path in 3D space has not yet been studied. To fill this gap, this research focuses on developing models to estimate the expected length of the shortest path of 3D-TSP. First, different experimental scenarios are designed by combining different service areas and the number of demand points. Under each scenario, the specified number of demand points is randomly generated, and an improved genetic algorithm and Gurobi are used to find the shortest path. A total of 500 experiments are performed for each scenario, and the average length of the shortest path is calculated. The models to estimate the expected length of the shortest path are proposed.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Model parameters are estimated and k-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate the goodness of fit. Results show that all the models fit the data well and the best model is selected. The developed models can be used to estimate the expected length of the shortest path of 3D-TSP and provide important references for many applications.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Expected Length of the Shortest Path of the Traveling Salesman Problem in 3D Space. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Advanced Transportation</emphasis>, 2022,2022.

It's the third in a four-part Grist series[1] examining how climate change is destabilizing the global insurance market. It is published in partnership with the Economic Hardship Reporting Project[2]. </p><p><br/>It wasn't the first summer Justin Guay went outside and choked on smoke. Or the second. But by the time wildfire season seemed to last year-round, he decided to move his family away from California and back to Utah, where he'd grown up. <br/>In 2020, Guay bought a house in Wasatch County near the jagged mountains, where he thought the worst climate impacts would be warmer winters with higher snow lines. An avid skier, Guay thought that was bad enough. But this spring, a letter arrived from his homeowners insurance company, brokered through Progressive. 'They were dropping us because they would no longer be providing insurance \u2014 period,' he recalled. <br/>As they scrambled to find new coverage, Guay and his wife were shocked when their first inquiry was rejected. 'They said, 'We no longer provide insurance to homes in your area.'' Other companies at least provided quotes, though they all offered rates at least double his previous policy. Returning to his home state, he hadn't considered fires as a risk. They were never a major issue while he was growing up. Shortly after he moved back, however, 5,000 people[3] were evacuated from a neighboring town during a large burn. <br/>As climate risks upend the insurance market, homeowners like Guay are being caught off guard. Losing his coverage really highlighted 'the limitations of your individual ability to cope or deal with these impacts,' said Guay. It's a nationwide problem he's now turning to at work as the director of global climate strategy for the Sunrise Project, a climate justice nonprofit. <br/>Climate change is now the main driver[4] of the increase in fire weather in the western United States. As conditions get warmer and drier, blazes are burning over larger areas and scorching places once thought of as low-risk. This summer, around 100 people died[5] as flames tore through Maui in one of the deadliest wildfires in American history, leaving behind $3.2 billion[6] in property damage. Across the Western United States, existing dangers are getting worse: Four of the five[7] largest wildfires in California's history have occurred since 2020. Meanwhile, close to a quarter[8] of the Americans now at risk of catastrophic wildfires live in the eastern half of the country, in places that may not be prepared to respond. <br/>All this damage has racked up quite the bill. Nationally, wildfires caused more than $22.5 billion[9] of losses in 2017, a record surpassed in 2018 when blazes burned through $29 billion, while 2020 and 2021 took third and fourth place in the echelon of damage. Those are just direct costs; a 2020 study[10] found the indirect costs of 2018's wildfires alone \u2014 things like health care costs and disruption to the broader economy \u2014 cost almost $150 billion. <br/>Compounding all this is the boom in people moving to fire-prone places. Between 1990 and 2010, more than 25 million people[11] relocated to areas known as the wildland-urban interface, where human development abuts wilderness. As inflation spikes the costs of rebuilding, those decisions are increasingly expensive: In the last five years, wildfires cost the United States $68.4 billion.[12] <br/>These losses are contributing to the destabilization of the homeowners insurance market. The insurance industry argues that attempts to control pricing \u2014 like California's regulation that required[13] insurers to set their rates based on damages over the past 20 years, rather than looking ahead at future hazards \u2014 have backfired. Many companies have chosen to stop selling new policies in California, while others have dropped existing policies, causing an additional 50,000 people[14] in the state to lose their coverage just this summer. <br/>Yet as Guay found, simply relocating wasn't a solution. Insurance, the financial mechanism that has underpinned the global economy[15] for the last 400 years, is no longer guaranteeing most people's largest asset. 'There's nowhere to run,' Guay said. <br/>*** <br/>In California, many residents find themselves on the leading edge of this crisis. Rural areas were the first to be affected. But now, even people in suburban areas and across a broad spectrum of society \u2014 including politicians themselves \u2014 are seeing their coverage vanish. <br/>The problem itself is pretty simple: Nearly a quarter[16] of Californians now live in areas at risk of catastrophic fire. Knowing what to do about it is a much thornier question. <br/>After several close calls with nearby fires, Beth Pratt decided to refinance the mortgage on her home in Midpines, outside of Yosemite National Park, and spent $100,000 \u2014 all the equity in her home and all her savings \u2014 to reduce her risk. She installed a metal roof and built a water storage tank with a fire hose hookup. She completely sided her house in metal, replaced her decking and railings, and cleared brush. Most of these measures went far beyond the basic tree trimming that Allstate requested during her last home inspection. She will now be paying off her mortgage till she is 80. Despite her efforts, she got a letter this July canceling her policy. <br/>In 2018, Governor Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium[17] on homeowner policy cancellations for one year in ZIP codes near wildfires, a condition which applied to Pratt's community after a fire in July 2022. Pratt's cancellation arrived this summer almost exactly when that grace period ended, right in the middle of wildfire season. Last year, the state's insurance commissioner required insurers[18] to give discounts for the kind of steps Pratt took, but rather than adjusting her rates, Allstate chose to drop her coverage. (Allstate made a quiet decision[19] last fall to stop writing new policies in California. State Farm followed suit this spring.) 'I feel like I did everything right. But it didn't matter,' she said. <br/>Pratt's mortgage requires her to have homeowners insurance, putting her at risk of eventually defaulting. She tried to find another private insurer to no avail. Eventually, she turned to the California FAIR Plan[20], a state-backed policy that covers people who have been denied private coverage at least three times. Its budget comes from levies on insurance companies operating in the state, but these coffers are shrinking: The FAIR Plan itself announced that it was seeking permission from the state's Department of Insurance to hike premiums by nearly 50 percent[21]. <br/>Most of Pratt's neighbors in Midpines have also lost their insurance. Some may still qualify for private policies, but can no longer afford them. 'What you're talking about in an area like mine is not rich people or second homes, but working-class people, people who have lived here their whole lives, losing the ability to insure their properties,' she said. <br/>Nationwide, approximately one in three houses[11] is located in the wildland-urban interface. But even documenting the hazards has been contentious: The Oregon Department of Forestry tried to issue a map in 2022 showing 80,000 homes[22] were at risk. But homeowners worried this would decrease their property values and raise their insurance rates protested until the state rescinded it. Or take the 2018 Camp Fire, which began when a spark from an electric transmission line owned by the utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric blew into a firestorm[23] near the town of Paradise. In its aftermath, insurance companies sued PG&amp;E, reclaiming around $11 billion [24]\u2014 or about 85 percent of their claims. The utility later declared[25] bankruptcy. <br/>There's a long history of insurers going after the entities that caused expensive claims, a process known as subrogation. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, for example, won $18 million[26] in 2001 from Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to cover the medical treatment of smokers. Advocates suggest insurers could take a similar approach to the fossil fuel industry, whose product has helped worsen wildfires[27]. Rather than individuals, or even insurers, said Peter Bosshard, the coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign, 'it should be the polluters who pay.' <br/>Multnomah County, Oregon, took its first step in this direction in June, suing[28] several multinational oil companies for the heat dome that smothered the region in June 2021, killing at least 69 people in the county, which includes Portland. (The death toll across the Pacific Northwest was much higher: at least 250 in the U.S.[29] and another 400 in Canada.) In addition to $50 million in damages, the county is also seeking $50 billion for research and to implement 'weatherproofing' to help handle future extreme heat. <br/>'What we're staring at now is a situation where everything is going to get more expensive,' said David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute. Homeowners aren't the only ones finding they're priced out of the insurance they need. Utility companies, for example, are also struggling to find[30] wildfire liability coverage to protect them from lawsuits like the ones PG&amp;E faced. That makes upgrading utility infrastructure even more important \u2014 but that ultimately costs consumers money, too. PG&amp;E is currently improving its transmission network and asked California regulators for a $3.2 billion rate increase[31] this year, or an average bill increase of around $450 a year. Perversely, utilities themselves primarily profit by making these kinds of capital expenditures, so 'every utility in the West is doing this to some degree,' Pomerantz said. <br/>*** <br/>As this system breaks down, everyone's feeling the pressure to guess the future correctly. In most states, the industry standard has been for insurers to use catastrophe models to estimate wildfire or other disaster risk in a region over time, then use those predictions to make decisions about their overall risk, like how much reinsurance to purchase as a backstop. <br/>Technological advances have made it possible to predict hazards not only in your part of town, but also for the exact parcel of land you call home. 'We're entering a new era where you can get at the root cause of mitigating risk, as opposed to just transferring that risk,' said Attila Toth, co-founder and CEO of start-up ZestyAI[32], which uses artificial intelligence to assess properties. The eight-year-old startup has collected satellite data, building permits, and two decades of historical losses to train its AI, developing a model called Z-FIRE. The company claims it can now spit out a wildfire risk score for all properties in the Lower 48, based on specific information about your home, such as what type of roof it has or what vegetation is nearby. ZestyAI's wildfire model has gained regulatory approval in seven states[33], including as part of a rate filing by the California Department of Insurance. Among the many high-profile companies now using ZestyAI's model is Amica Insurance. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which destroyed 3,000 homes[34] and killed nine people in Santa Rosa, California, Amica realized that it had mistakenly underpriced high-risk properties, leaving it on the hook for major losses in several counties. The company now uses Z-FIRE, a move Amica says[35] 'leverage[s] the power of AI to  <br/>generate a clear picture of not only how likely it is that a home might be exposed to a wildfire, but also the probability of its damage.' The system has also allowed Amica to 'offer coverage for homes that may have previously been declined.' Farmers Insurance says thanks to Z-FIRE's fine-tuned analyses, it expects to add 30,000 new policies[36] in California. <br/>Helping both insurers and homeowners get a better sense of their actual risk is long overdue, says Roy Wright, a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Association's insurance administration. He now leads the Insurance Institute for Business &amp; Home Safety,[37] a nonprofit organization that tries to 'translate science into action' for insurance companies and homeowners. It conducts research to provide information on how to prevent damage[38] during disasters. 'We show people what actions make a difference,' Wright explained. The institute has spent decades testing construction design, like intentionally setting siding and roofing materials on fire in the lab to see what helps prevent embers from catching. He is lobbying regulators to add the institute's construction standards to states' building codes. <br/>Wright's organization is now collaborating with ZestyAI to improve its models' accuracy and to better understand new hazards. But some are leery of these kinds of proprietary datasets, saying that nontransparent pricing decisions may increase discrimination[39]. Unless regulators step in, Madison Condon, a corporate and environmental law professor at Boston University, predicts an obvious consequence will be 'huge differentiations in the cost of insurance that could have demographic effects.' <br/>California currently has some of the most transparent policies, requiring companies to publicly disclose when they won't renew a policy and to provide homeowners their risk assessments and an opportunity to appeal them. Washington state, in contrast, does none of the above[40]. But the Golden State is also facing some of the highest losses: Insured claims have outpaced premiums in the state since 2016[41] by more than $4 billion. Insurers, like banks, have to have a certain amount of money on hand, so to sell more policies, they have to increase their capital. Many private companies turn to reinsurers for this, paying them a fee for their financing. But now that risks have increased, reinsurance prices have too: In July, reinsurers increased the cost of U.S. property reinsurance by as much as 50 percent[42]. Unlike most other states, California's insurance commissioner prohibits insurers from passing on these reinsurance costs to the consumer. The goal of measures like this, according to Harvey Rosenfield, an advocate who founded the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog, was to make insurance available and affordable. During the last insurance crisis in the 1980s, the industry claimed that higher losses and a spike in lawsuits[43] were responsible for rising premiums, which Rosenfield alleges led to discriminatory practices in minority neighborhoods, an issue researchers have identified[44] nationwide. To address these issues, Rosenfield wrote California's Proposition 103[45], which passed in 1988. It aimed to rein in costs and increase transparency in  <br/>the country's largest market, establishing a review process for rate increases and electing a state insurance commissioner. <br/>The insurance industry argues[46] Proposition 103 keeps the market from reflecting true risk and forces companies to offer insurance at artificially low rates. Since 2009, California has seen a 335 percent[47] jump in buildings destroyed by wildfires, along with a 270 percent increase in associated costs. But Rosenfield notes homeowners insurance companies in California earned an average annual return on net worth of 8.8 percent[48] over the last 20 years, compared to 6.2 percent nationally. <br/>Consumer Watchdog says what's needed to address the lack of affordable insurance is to enforce existing laws. For example, it says its advocacy challenging consumer rate increases has saved homeowners $2.2 billion[49] since 2002. Long-term, the organization thinks the government should be helping homeowners afford to fortify their property, as well as instituting policies that require companies to sell insurance to all owners who meet certain mitigation measures. <br/>In early September, the president of Consumer Watchdog's advocacy group, Jamie Court, happened to be on the same morning flight to Sacramento as an insurance lobbyist, Michael Gunning. When Gunning began bragging about his efforts to push through a multi-billion-dollar bailout for the industry through California's state legislature at the end of its session, Court started recording their conversation. 'We are trying to jam a bill in the last three weeks,' Gunning can be heard[50] saying. <br/>The bill, which would have absolved companies of responsibility for covering fire claims under the state's FAIR plan, failed to pass[51]. But several weeks later, California's insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, announced[52] he would expedite changes to allow companies to use catastrophe modeling and artificial intelligence to take into account projected impacts of climate change in their pricing. He also signaled he would 'explore' allowing companies to pass on reinsurance costs. In exchange, insurers will be required to write at least 85 percent of their market share in 'distressed areas,' although those have not yet been identified. Governor Newsom supported the changes, immediately issuing an executive order[53] authorizing the Commissioner's 'emergency regulatory action' to bolster the faltering industry. <br/>Consumer Watchdog says these changes could increase premiums by as much as 50 percent overnight. 'Insurers are leveraging a real climate crisis with a false crisis of affordability in order to line their pockets,' said Carmen Balber, executive director at Consumer Watchdog. 'If trends continue, and insurers are allowed to continue making those choices on their own, we could be seeing a much more serious crisis for homeowners.' <br/>When these cascading effects hit, it's going to cost those who can least afford it the most. While insurance is ultimately about managing risk for a single business or person, the escalating nature of the climate crisis can only be addressed by action society-wide. Homeowners insurance is increasingly at the crux of this mismatch: Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions in someone's life, and it's a long-term investment. But even if you can get \u2014 and afford to pay \u2014 for insurance when you buy a house, companies reevaluate their policies and premiums every year. 'It's not like we need more information,' Condon said. 'We need better ways to think about how to adapt in the face of uncertainty.' <br/>As the stakes rise, the house seems to always win. 'I looked up the revenues of some of these big insurance companies,' Pratt says. Their profits might be declining \u2014 after making 32 cents on the dollar in 2023, Allstate's credit dropped[54] for a second time[55] in 2023, to BBB+, a middling rung on S&amp;P's rating scale \u2014 but it's still 'a lot more than I make,' she said. She paid into a policy with Allstate for 32 years, but never made a claim. 'What's fair about that?' she asked. <br/>Last winter, Pratt's property was without power for a week, and she stayed warm hauling wood for her stove in a sled over record snowfall. Last summer, she was sweating in an extreme heat wave[56], watching a woodpecker gasp for breath at her bird bath. She watched, helpless, as a fire burned 127 homes[57] nearby. <br/>'We are learning to adapt to what it's going to take to live in this time of climate extremes,' Pratt said, noting that while she ultimately found a California FAIR plan, it doubled her cost. 'Rethinking the insurance industry \u2014 in this new regime of climate disruption \u2014 is going to be needed.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://grist.org/economics/as-climate-risks-mount-the-insurance-safety-net-is-collapsing/\">https://grist.org/economics/as-climate-risks-mount-the-insurance-safety-net-is-collapsing/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://economichardship.org\">http://economichardship.org</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/swaner-ecocenter-presentation-looks-at-life-after-parleys-canyon-wildfire/\">https://www.parkrecord.com/entertainment/swaner-ecocenter-presentation-looks-at-life-after-parleys-canyon-wildfire/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20found%20enhanced,in%20the%20western%20United%20States\">https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20found%20enhanced,in%20the%20western%20United%20States</url>.

To further mark this week, each day we will be highlighting a different aspect of fire prevention.</p><p>The first national recognition of a Fire Prevention Day came in 1911 on the 40th anniversary of \"The Great Chicago Fire\". That fire occurred October 9, 1871. At least 250 people died, 100,000 were left homeless, more than 17,000 structures and 2000 acres burned in only 27 hours! Popular legend has it that the fire was started by a lantern kicked over by \"Mrs. O'Leary's cow\". Less known to history is \"The Great Peshtigo Fire\" (the most devastating forest fire in American history) raging that same week in neighboring Wisconsin. That fire would burn 2,400 square miles (1.2 million acres!), killing more than 1,100 people, completely destroying the town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin and 15 other towns.</p><p>That week in October would long be remembered for its tragic losses in life and property. In 1925 President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed the first National Fire Prevention Week. 93 years later, our country has grown tremendously and great efforts have been made to protect and preserve life and property, but thousands still die in fires every year in the United States.</p><p>According to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), U.S. fire departments responded to 1.3 million fires in 2019. These fires resulted in roughly 3,700 civilian fire fatalities, 16,600 civilian injuries and $14.8 billion in damages. On average, 7 people per day die in U.S. home fires.

Department of Natural Resources, or SCDNR.</p><p>Based on one of those indicators, the U.S. Drought Monitor, the drought level is moderate in 52% of the Palmetto State and severe in 10%.</p><p>The committee tries to avoid two-level increases in drought designation unless there is an overwhelming consensus among the indicators.</p><p>Elliot Wickham, SCDNR water resources climatologist, said that the areas in the Palmetto State that are in moderate and severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, have been dealing with dry conditions since May.</p><p>Sixty-day precipitation deficits and above normal temperatures in June caused intense soil moisture deficits to develop in those locations, he explained.</p><p>In addition, Wickham said, evaporation rates also have been elevated, which means more frequent rain and higher rainfall totals are needed \"just to keep up with the water lost to evaporation.\"</p><p>According to the SCDNR release, the primary drought impacts that have been reported recently are to agriculture.</p><p>Forest fire conditions also are a concern.</p><p>\"Rainfall totals have been sporadic,\" said Kayla Stroman, agriculture program specialist with the Farm Service Agency Office. \"Corn and tobacco crops are suffering. Hay production is low, and many producers are already feeding their winter hay and selling cows. Ponds and creeks are much lower than they were a few weeks ago.\"</p><p>Because of worsening drought conditions, wildfires in South Carolina have increased, based on S.C. Forestry Commission statistics.</p><p>In June, the Forestry Commission responded to 196 wildfires that burned more than 1,150 acres. Compared to the 10-year average, there was an increase of more than 170% in the number of fires and an increase of more than 230% in the amount of acres burned for June.</p><p>\"These conditions increase the risk of damaging wildfires that can threaten the public, homes and developed areas,\" said Darryl Jones, forest protection chief for the Forestry Commission. \"And it makes it more challenging and increases safety concerns for firefighters on the ground.\"</p><p>The Drought Response Committee will reconvene in two weeks to review drought indicators and impacts, according to the SCDNR release.</p><p>The National Weather Service in Columbia's forecast for Aiken as of Friday afternoon was calling for a 30% chance of precipitation Saturday and Saturday night.</p><p>The chance of precipitation was 50% for Sunday and 30% for Sunday night.</p><p>Also as of Friday afternoon, Monday's chance of precipitation was 40% for the July 4 holiday. The chance Monday evening was 30%.</p><p>A hazardous weather outlook statement issued by the National Weather Service in Columbia early Friday morning warned that there could be isolated severe storms Sunday afternoon and evening. The primary threat identified was damaging wind gusts.</p><p>It rained in Aiken on Friday, and the National Weather Service in Columbia issued an afternoon flood advisory.</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Aiken Standard (Aiken, S.C.)

Between 1998 and 2017 alone, 146 clinical trials of new Alzheimer's drugs failed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So when Randall Bateman showed up outside a restaurant in Bar Harbor, Maine, one evening in the fall of 2022 during an industry confab and announced to a couple of tables full of his colleagues drinking on the patio that he had something important to share with them, no one was prepared for what came next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bateman, a neurologist and Alzheimer's researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, told them he had just received a phone call from his contact at the drug company running the trials of lecanemab, an experimental drug designed to facilitate the removal of the toxic plaques in the brain associated with the disease. The results, set for public release the following morning, were in: In a study of 1,800 Alzheimer's patients over 18 months, the treatment had reduced the rate of cognitive decline by close to 30 percent.</p><p>There was a stunned silence and some skeptical questions. Then the table erupted in applause.</p><p>\"It's all anybody talked about for the rest of the meeting,\" says Bateman. \"The agenda was blown. Nobody was paying attention to what we should have been doing. It's reenergized, recharged, everything.\"</p><p>The trial results Bateman reported was just the first in a flurry of positive developments. A few months later, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, now marketed as Leqembi. In July, Eli Lilly reported that a second drug, donanemab, had an even greater effect on slowing the progress of the disease, in a study of more than 1,700 Alzheimer's patients. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fda?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">FDA</url> is expected to approve it soon. As with Leqembi, many expect that Medicare will eventually agree to pay for it\u2014marking the first time new treatments have become available for the terminal neurodegenerative disease in 20 years.</p><p>To be sure, these drugs are not cures. They offer little relief for patients already in the late stages of Alzheimer's dementia, for whom the effects of the new drugs are modest. They can slow the decline, giving those in whom the disease is moderately advanced an extra year of cognitive lucidity. For those patients and their families that's certainly significant, but nowhere close to a reversal.</p><p>The big potential benefit, say Alzheimer's experts, lies in using these drugs, or others soon to come, in conjunction with a second recent development in the field: diagnostic blood tests that can identify the presence of Alzheimer's-associated proteins. With more many blood tests currently undergoing clinical trials, scientists believe that in a few years clinicians may be able to use them to make quick, early diagnoses cheaply, even before patients show any outward symptoms of dementia. That suggests a new strategy against the disease: GPs could screen otherwise healthy people for early-stage Alzheimer's and treat them with drugs that slow the progress of the disease before major damage has occurred. The hope is that eventually, Alzheimer's will no longer be a terminal disease but a chronic one that can be managed with drugs and perhaps be staved off indefinitely.</p><p>There is no guarantee, however, that the drugs and tests now being developedwill fulfill this promise. Some scientists, skeptical of the influence of Big Pharma, believe the field is moving too quickly, particularly in starting clinical trials on patients who have no symptoms of dementia. And even with the best drugs and tests, many hurdles would still remain before early detection and prevention could become a standard of care\u2014not least the U.S. health care system's abysmal track record in preventing chronic, slow-developing diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, that are already eminently manageable in theory.</p><p>Still, many Alzheimer's researchers are calling the new developments, which break a 20-year logjam in Alzheimer's research, a \"game changer.\" That is hopeful news for the 13 million Americans who are expected to have the disease by 2050 (up from 11 million today), and millions of their loved ones.</p><h>Plaques and Tangles</h><p>When Randall Bateman was still a medical student back in 1990s, researchers and the clinicians who treated patients were basically flying blind. The only way to know for sure if a patient or research subject suffering from dementia had Alzheimer's Disease, and not another kind of dementia, was to wait for them to die and then examine a slice of their brain tissue under a microscope.</p><p>Diagnosis, in other words, was confirmed using the same crude methods available to Alois Alzheimer, the German psychiatrist and pathologist who first discovered the disease in 1906: by the observation of cognitive decline, followed by postmortem visual identification of the presence of dark clumps of what were then known as \"senile plaques,\" along with stringy protein molecules, \"neurofibrillary tangles,\" that clogged up the spaces between the neurons. (Alzheimer also noted massive cerebral shrinkage, caused by the death of brain cells, another hallmark of the disease).</p><p>Although there had been some significant advances since Alzheimer's time, up until the early 2000s, the medical field's understanding of the disease was still relatively basic. In the 1980s, scientists determined that the plaques were cellular garbage, consisting of clumps of a protein called amyloid beta, or a-beta, a naturally occurring byproduct of normal brain activity (the function of which is not well understood). In healthy individuals a-beta is regularly cleared from the brain along with other metabolic waste, particularly during sleep. The tangles are made of \"tau,\" knots of insoluble protein filaments normally involved in maintaining the structural stability of the microscopic tubules that allow the transportation of materials throughout cells.</p><p>In the years that followed, the cause of Alzheimer's disease was hotly debated, with much of the field split between two competing camps, engaged in what was in many ways still a speculative argument they did not yet have the tools to resolve. The \"Baptists\" believed it was the accumulation of the beta amyloid plagues that kicked off the deadly cascade that led to everything else. The \"Taoists\" suspected that tau was to blame. Scientists on both sides usually had a personal stake\u2014they chose their area of research based on which hypothesis they believed.</p><p>By the late 1990s, what would become known as the \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" was beginning to become the field's dominant paradigm, thanks to the discovery of families carrying rare mutations that caused them to develop the symptoms of full-blown Alzheimer's disease far earlier than usual. With new genetic tools of the time, scientists showed that most of the individuals in these families who developed early-onset Alzheimer's carried mutations that could be directly linked to the buildup of the amyloid-beta plaques. That evidence helped catalyze an explosion in drug trials, virtually all of which targeted the removal of the plaques from the brain. Until recently, all of the amyloid-beta drugs failed.</p><p>The recent success of lecanemab has given Baptists fresh ammunition. They argue that the finding that showed that removing amyloid-beta slowed the disease progression is a \"proof of principal\" that the amyloid plaques are what drive it. But even amyloid diehards admit that the old labels no longer fit. The disease seems to be far more complex than anything contained in the old theories of Baptists or Taoists. Even if amyloid-beta is the \"kindling that lights the fire,\" once that fire starts the brain heads toward a systemic collapse that involves far more than the buildup of plaque. Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) at Keck School of Medicine of USC and a leading expert on clinical trial design, makes no apology for his faith in the a-beta-cascade hypothesis\u2014indeed, he claims his faith never wavered.</p><p>Still, he attributes the field's long string of failures to an early misunderstanding of the progression of what was then a relatively new disease, and the technologies available prior to the early 2000s. \"Amyloid could only be seen at autopsy, so we would develop drugs that worked in a test tube or a mouse and test them in humans and they wouldn't work, and we wouldn't know why,\" says Aisen. \"It interferes with a rational drug development plan when you can't see what you're doing.\"</p><p>That began to change in in 2004, with the debut of Positron emission tomography, or PET, an imaging technique that allowed clinicians to peer inside the brains of living patients. For the first time, they could get images of amyloid and, soon after, tau in the brains of living Alzheimer's proteins.</p><p>The impact was immediate and profound. Suddenly scientists could scan the brains of the patients through drug trials and visually track the impact of drugs over time. They could clearly see, for instance, that some treatments seemed to have no effect, while others, such as certain types of antibodies that directly attacked the plaques, were clearly helping to remove plaques from the brain. For the first time they could adjust the doses up and down, rather than just guessing.</p><p>PET imaging also allowed scientists to address another powerful confounding factor: the inclusion of a significant number of individuals in Alzheimer's trials who had been misdiagnosed. We now know that the problem was so widespread that it alone could have torpedoed many of the early amyloid-beta trials.</p><p>The evidence comes from a massive, multi-site, multi-year study published in 2019, in which 946 dementia experts administered PET scans to more than 11,000 Medicare recipients who had already been diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. They found, remarkably, that 35.6 percent, or about a third of patients, had either been incorrectly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or actually had Alzheimer's but had been misdiagnosed with another condition, such as frontotemporal dementia, which in its observable clinical manifestations often appears identical to those seen in people with Alzheimer's.</p><p>Aisen characterizes the slowdown in the progression of the disease seen in the lecanemab trial as \"really big.\" He attributes the outcome directly to the ability of researchers to evaluate experimental drugs effectively using imaging and make adjustments to dosing in real time.</p><p>\"Being able to see what we were doing is what is leading to success,\" he says. \"It's now clear\u2014for the first time, really, with lecanemab\u2014that we can slow the disease down. People should be taking this drug.\"</p><p>Perhaps most important for future research, he says, the advent of brain imaging and other technological innovations have allowed researchers to precisely track how the brain changes as the disease develops. This has forced the field to confront an unpleasant truth: Even if earlier drugs had been effective, they were likely administered way too late to significantly alter the course of the disease. They were, in other words, destined to fail. This, he argues, also explains why lecanemab can slow the progression of those in the initial trials but is powerless to halt it.</p><p>The evidence comes from the results of a two-decade-long \"observational\" longitudinal study Aisen has helped coordinate called the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which has fundamentally changed our understanding of the disease. Researchers used imaging, genetics and cognitive, clinical and functional tests, as well as other tools, to painstakingly track and document changes in the brains of more than 2,500 people as the disease progressed. The goal was to \"deeply characterize\" and \"map out the disease from start to finish.\"</p><p>When Aisen started, Alzheimer's disease was thought to begin with the onset of observable cognitive and functional decline and, after progressing for seven years or so, result in death. But the onset of early dementia, we now know, is in fact just the final phase in a far longer progression that takes place over roughly 25 years. It begins with the accumulation of amyloid-beta at least 18 years before any behavioral changes are detectable to most future patients or their loved ones.</p><p>This realization came as a rude awakening for clinicians on the front lines of the epidemic who have worked closely with patients and their loved ones for decades. Administering drugs that target amyloid in patients who already have noticeable memory impairment is akin to treating someone suffering from congestive heart failure with statins in the hopes of lowering their cholesterol, says Rudolph Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard University. Or, as Eric Reiman, a neuroscientist at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, puts it, treating a tumor in a patient whose cancer is already metastatic.</p><p>\"Hitting amyloid in a patient that already has Alzheimer's disease isn't going to make them better,\" says Tanzi, a pioneer in the field who, in the 1980s, was among the first to identify the genes associated with the disease. \"We don't diagnose Alzheimer's disease until the brain is already deteriorated to the point of dysfunction in the form of memory impairment. Even in what we've traditionally considered the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, where the symptoms are just beginning, the brain is already full of amyloid and there's already enough inflammation in the brain and synapse loss to start leading to cognitive dysfunction.\"</p><h>Quick Progress</h><p>One reason Alzheimer's specialists are so excited about the recent developments is that the field had been stagnating for two decades. Drug companies spent $600 billion on developing Alzheimer's treatments that failed. The National Institutes of Health handed out billions of dollars for research that yielded no significant benefit to patients. The early failures damaged the reputation of medical research establishments and the pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>The FDA made things worse when, in 2021, it overruled an outside panel of experts to approve aducanumab (brand name: Aduhelm), a drug that attacks amyloid plaque and was shown to have a modest benefit for patients. Some researchers suggested that the FDA approved the drug simply to keep big pharmaceutical companies from giving up and walking away from Alzheimer's research altogether. Biogen initially suggested the drug would come with a price tag of roughly $56,000 a year, a bill many considered outrageous. In the wake of the decision, three of the FDA advisers on the overruled panel resigned, lawmakers in Washington launched congressional investigations and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the government agency that oversees Medicare, declined to pay for the drug.</p><p>For this reason, many people, including some scientists, are deeply skeptical of any good news coming from the FDA and Big Pharma. \"There's a huge financial incentive involved here, because the FDA approval of these drugs means billions of dollars in profits for the pharmaceutical companies,\" says Karl Herrup, a professor of neurobiology and an investigator in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine He suggested the FDA's approval was suspect. \"I think that's driving them.\"</p><p>Herrup, author of a book titled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Not to Study a Disease: The Story of Alzheimer's</emphasis>, suggests it was the \"vested position\" of many of the field's most well-known scientific figures that handcuffed progress for so long. These researchers have \"spent so much time and energy and reputation pushing the concept of amyloid as a driver of Alzheimer's that it's really hard to admit that it doesn't work. My feeling is that the focus on a-beta has totally distorted even our definition of the disease. We've been chasing rainbows because of that.\"</p><p>This time, at least, Herrup's view seems to be in the minority. The FDA advisory board unanimously endorsed the approval of Leqembi. This and other new drugs in the pipeline, some scientists argue, herald the beginning of new era driven by the development of increasingly powerful diagnostic tools that facilitated a more sophisticated understanding of how the disease unfolds.</p><p>Learning lessons from the aducanumab fiasco, Biogen and its Tokyo-based partner Eisai, the makers of both aducanumab and the new drug lecanemab, made sure their trial design, and the outcomes that would indicate success, were less ambiguous, easier to understand and more likely to satisfy the scientific community. After the drug won approval, the firms announced plans to price it at $26,500\u2014higher than the $8,900 to $21,500 the independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) estimates it's worth, but close enough that CMS is expected to cover it for as many as a million patients\u2014about 90 percent of the market. ICER estimates the cost per patient would come to $82,500 per year.</p><p>Despite the drug's limitations, the lecanemab trials that led to its recent FDA approval, many scientists argue, is still an important first step: now that the field has its first drug that has been proven effective in removing amyloid, it has a real shot at earlier intervention. To Aisen, in fact, the limited effect the drugs had in late stage patients is, in fact, remarkable. In the 25-year arc of Alzheimer's disease, Aisen says, the participants in the lecanemab trial roughly fell in years 13 to 20. By then, the plaques have created irreversible damage. They have killed neurons and catalyzed a spiral of negative effects, including the development of tau tangles and the accumulation of other proteins in the brain. Vascular changes have also occurred, choking off the healthy delivery of nutrients and essential signaling agents. The brain is inflamed. Microglia\u2014immune cells in the brain\u2014have begun to target areas that are in crisis, the same way they would target areas of the brain that have become infected, by moving in and beginning to gobble them up in a misguided effort to arrest the spread of dysfunction to the rest of the vital organ. Amid this raging neurological forest fire, the fact that the new drugs hold at bay the rapid cognitive and functional decline seen in other patients for 12 months is, to Aisen, a testament to its strength.</p><p>In the hopes of further arresting this systemic collapse, Aisen is co-leading the AHEAD trial, which is in the midst of recruiting \"presymptomatic\" patients to participate in a four-year study of lecanemab. The new cohort will consist entirely of people who are, for the most part, cognitively and functionally asymptomatic but have abnormal levels of amyloid in their brains. The idea is to capture people in years one through 10 of the progression. A later phase of the trial, he says, will target a cohort who is \"even closer to year one.\"</p><p>At the same time, the TRAILBLAZER study, co-led by Banner Institute's Reiman, is taking a similar approach, but using donanemab, the new drug from Eli Lilly that is expected soon to win FDA approval, to target those in earlier stages of the disease.</p><p>Both studies will also use imaging tests that are now capable of detecting and measuring tau tangles, along with blood tests that will do the same, to see if they can arrest that part of the disease. Even at this early stage of the disease, however, Aisen and Reiman both say the new drugs alone will likely still not be sufficient to halt the progress of the disease. For that, Aisen believes it will be necessary to add anti-tau drugs that go after tangles, too. To that end, Aisen and his collaborators are setting up another trial that will also use experimental anti-tau drugs to remove any tangles that accumulate.</p><p>It will take five years before AHEAD yields results, estimates Aisen, and 10 years before we have a real handle on how to prevent the disease. Reiman is slightly more optimistic but agrees many more steps are needed.</p><p>Still, both see a bright future ahead.</p><p>\"Lecanemab is a real landmark. Having a fully approved drug [that] slows the disease is significant. But we've got to move on and increase the benefit,\" Aisen says. \"I'm very optimistic. We're just going to build on this success. Things will get better and better until the entire population is routinely screened for risk and the risk is fixed before the disease starts.\"</p><p>Not everybody shares their optimism. Some worry that the field is moving too fast. Madhav Thambisetty, a senior investigator in the NIH's Intramural Research on Aging and a practicing neurologist who treats dementia patients at the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer's treatment center, says he has urged caution when referring interested patients in the early stages of the disease for trials.</p><p>He calls the clinical benefits \"small to modest,\" and \"marginal at best,\" but said they are \"very exciting\" for researchers because it's the first time the field has drugs that can precisely target one of the pathological features of the disease.</p><p>\"The clinical meaningfulness of these results remains to be established, but the fact that they do have a clinical benefit that's statistically significant [is] very clear,\" he says.</p><p>Still, he worries the results have led to a \"lack of balance in the way the narratives have built around the new treatments.\" Much of what has been reported about the new class of drugs, he says, has centered on the debates in the field over whether the clinical effects seen on patient cognition and function are meaningful to clinicians and caregivers. Of more concern for his patients, he says, are the potential side effects and \"adverse events\" associated with the drugs, which he believes have been largely overshadowed by the hype.</p><p>He notes that the anti-amyloid drugs as a class have received a black box warning from the FDA, the highest level of warning for drugs, one reserved for those that are associated with the risk of serious harm and even death. The warnings come in response to swelling in the brain and microbleeds sometimes associated with the medication. Much of the commentary, he says, has noted that these symptoms are mostly mild, can be detected on MRI scans and managed acutely. But this assessment is based on incomplete information, he says. The impact these side effects had on cognition in the months that follow treatment, he says, has not been publicly reported. Because of this \"lack of transparency,\" there is no way to know whether the brain bleeds and swelling seen in patients eventually accelerates the cognitive and functional decline that the drug claims to slow.</p><p>\"To me, a measure of the effect at 18 months, which is the end of the trial, [is] avery basic metric of assessing risk with these drugs that really has not been reported out,\" he says. \"Brain bleeding and brain hemorrhages [are] not benign. So, unless I see evidence that they're not related to adverse clinical outcomes in the months that follow the initial reports, my worry is that they are. I don't think we've learned enough from these trials to move on to the next phase, which is potentially testing these in asymptomatic individuals for as long as four years, which is longer than in earlier phases.\"</p><p>Some of those involved in the new trials have downplayed the concerns. Reiman, in fact, believes these side effects might be less of an issue for those in an earlier phase of the disease. In the late stages, he says, \"you're having to pull amyloid plaque out of the brain, but also off of blood vessels, which is the main reason for the side effects,\" such as bleeding and swelling, he says. In the brains of those who are at earlier stages of the disease, the plaques \"haven't been there as long. So, they're less adherent, and you may have fewer side effects as well.\"</p><h>Building on Momentum</h><p>In 2020, Reiman told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> he was \"agnostic\" on whether amyloid played the key role in the development of the disease, which the Baptists have long argued. Now he says the success of the amyloid drugs suggests they may be right. The recent developments are \"a big deal\" and suggests \"that we're on the right track.\"</p><p>Like Aisen, he hopes eventually to conduct preventative trials on cognitively unimpaired individuals at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, in whom even the most sensitive biomarker tests cannot detect plaques. In the long run, he notes, \"amyloid should not be the only target by any stretch of the imagination.\" But he says the \"the implications for prevention are extraordinary.\"</p><p>\"There's no guarantee that the prevention therapies are going to work,\" he says. \"But gosh, now we have the chance to find out, and it's been a long time coming. My hope is we begin to see more successful developments. And we'll do everything we can to find out which prevention therapies might work sooner later.\"</p><p>For his part, Bateman can only recall with wonder how much\u2014and how quickly\u2014things have changed. Bateman, who invented the first blood tests to be used clinically and is one of the field's leading authorities on biomarkers, recalls the mood several years ago at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, one of the field's largest.</p><p>\"That meeting was more like a funeral,\" he recalls. \"The latest amyloid trials were failing. Nothing was working. People were hopeless. People were so just saddened. All this hope had been placed on being able to try to make a difference, and trial after trial after trial were showing absolutely nothing. It was just zeros across the board.\"</p><p>The Association's last meeting, in Amsterdam in July, was \"celebratory,\" he says. The bars were packed and some clinicians were even high-fiving in the hallways. \"People were so excited by the future and what's possible and what can be done and everything else,\" he says. \"It's super, super exciting. It just doesn't compare with anything else. It's an incredible time. There's just no good analogy for it.\"</p><p>Many of those working to find a cure for the disease (though certainly not all) describe these recent events as \"game changers,\" the most compelling evidence to date that the moribund field is finally on the right track.</p><p>\"For all of history, people have been afflicted by senility and dementia, and for thousands of years, you couldn't do anything about it,\" says Bateman. \"Even in recent history, you could only diagnose people after they died. Now a single blood sample can with 95 percent accuracy identify Alzheimer's. And in just six to 18 months, we can remove plaques from the brain that have built up over 20 years. We can for the first time change the course of how fast the disease progresses. To me, it's just absolutely incredible. It's really profound.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2291593/fe-alzheimers-01-banner.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FE Alzheimers 01 BANNER</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Jose Carlos Cerdeno Martinez/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Woman looking at old photo.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1832957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69CB-CPN1-DY68-1001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4461\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2023 Newsweek Inc.

The Willow Fire was 19% contained with just under 4.5 square miles burned. </p><p>Firefighters took advantage of the weather to continue improving lines, Los Padres National Forest said. The improved conditions were expected to continue for another day. The fire is a threat to about 125 homes and other buildings including the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. Seven firefighting monks have been clearing brush and running a sprinkler system dubbed \"Dharma rain,\" which helps keep moisture around the buildings, said Sozan Miglioli, president of San Francisco Zen Center, which operates the monastery. In the Sierra Nevada, a wildfire in the Whitney Portal area was calm overnight after growing to nearly 500 acres and clouds and increased humidity helped to slow the fire's growth, the Inyo National Forest said. Whitney Portal is a major starting point for hikers climbing Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States. In the south, another fire erupted yesterday near the Pala Casino north of San Diego. It covered a few hundred acres and prompted some evacuation warnings that were later lifted. Authorities said the blaze was spreading dangerously, but it had slowed by nightfall and hadn't caused any building damage. -- Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636G-3PK1-JBSK-R3TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"245\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 24, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Criminal Law &amp; Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Suppression of Evidence</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0MyQzM3MzJEODM3NDVENzk3RDYxMzU5MDgxQTA0OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEE0ODNERjMyMTJGNDhCMEE1ODYxRDkzRTA2NjkwREQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099LO</classCode><className>BUDDHISTS &amp; BUDDHISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX544</classCode><className>SAN DIEGO, CA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX513</classCode><className>SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Fire danger is currently high, and firefighters are working to suppress over 100 large fires across the western United States. Fire officials ask forest visitors to use the utmost caution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It takes very little to start a damaging wildfire. The smallest unintentional spark can lead to a large fire when fuels are as dry as they are now.\" said Jeremy Kiesling, Acting Forest Fire Management Officer. \"The number of human-caused fires are notably down this year on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. We thank everyone for recreating responsibly and ask them to continue to do so.\"</p><p>Due the numerous large fires and closures in parts of Northern California, the Forest is seeing an increase in visitation. It is extremely important that all visitors take great care in being good stewards of the land and not only follow Leave No Trace principles (<url normalizedValue=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgviIBhBkEiwA10D2j9f2Qzk-3tF-jt4EWbl9CruWnSoWVRZ1HcjcbvcVskFarGkMIUy9sxoC7MQQAvD_BwE\">https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgviIBhBkEiwA10D2j9f2Qzk-3tF-jt4EWbl9CruWnSoWVRZ1HcjcbvcVskFarGkMIUy9sxoC7MQQAvD_BwE</url>), but also stay informed on any closures orders and fire restrictions that are in place before you travel to public lands.</p><p>Currently, the Carson Ranger District has closures in place near Markleeville, California, due to the Tamarack Fire. This includes closures of the Crystal Springs and Markleeville Campgrounds, as well as the Centerville Flat and Wolf Creek Dispersed Campgrounds. The Mountain City-Ruby Mountains-Jarbidge Ranger District also closed the road into Lamoille Canyon near Elko, Nevada, to motorized traffic to repair the road after numerous debris flows. For more details on closures, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/htnf/alerts-notices\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/htnf/alerts-notices</url>.</p><p>The Bridgeport and Carson Ranger Districts are currently under Stage II Fire Restrictions. No campfires are allowed on these District lands in both California and Nevada. The remaining Forest units, including the Austin-Tonopah, Ely, Mountain-City-Ruby Mountains-Jarbidge, and Santa Rosa Ranger Districts and Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, are under Stage I Fire Restrictions. For more information regarding fire restrictions, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/HTNFFireRestrictions\">https://bit.ly/HTNFFireRestrictions</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/FireRestrictionsFAQs\">https://bit.ly/FireRestrictionsFAQs</url> for answers to frequently asked questions.</p><p>When planning an outdoor adventure on the Forest, recreationists should be aware that wildfire and/or smoke, even from fires hundreds of miles away, could affect their trip. It is important to \"Know Before You Go\" and check the following resources in advance:</p><p>* Weather forecast from the National Weather Service or a favorite phone app to assess heat levels and the risk of thunderstorms, both of which increase fire risk.</p><p>* InciWeb (<url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/</url>) for information on all currently burning major fires.</p><p>* Air Quality Index (AQI) at AirNow.gov. The AQI's color-coded system provides air quality for cities and zip codes around the country. In addition, the AirNow.gov smoke advisories page offers air quality reporting at temporary stations near known fire locations.</p><p>* State fire websites (CalFire/nevadafireinfo.org) for all things fire related in the state.</p><p>* Local Ranger District office (<url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/HTNFForestOffices\">https://bit.ly/HTNFForestOffices</url>) will have the most up-to-date information for the area.</p><p>Visitors are also urged to heed the following recommendations, especially during forest fire season:</p><p>* Pay extra attention to those items that can cause a spark, such as dragging chains on a trailer or power tools. Any spark has the potential to ignite a wildfire.</p><p>* Do not drive over dry grass and brush that could be ignited by hot exhaust systems.</p><p>* In Stage 1 Fire Restrictions campfires are only allowed in developed recreation sites. NO campfires are allowed in Stage II Fire Restrictions. When campfires area allowed keep them small and completely extinguish them before leaving camp. The best method is to douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again, making sure that all ashes are cold to the touch. It is illegal to have unattended campfires.</p><p>* Be aware that recreational shooting could cause a fire, so don't shoot on hot, dry days. Always shoot into a non-flammable backstop. Be sure it is clear of flammable debris on all sides, and always have water, a fire extinguisher, and shovel ready in case a fire starts.</p><p>\"The public is the first line of defense in preventing wildfires,\" stressed Kiesling. \"Fire staff on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest thank you for recreating responsibly and using extra precaution to prevent wildfires.\" For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR3899786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63F1-WYW1-JDKC-R458-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><timeReceived>6:40 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd.

However, because of on-going parliamentary session in India, I am addressing you through a recorded video message.</p><p>2. India has been steadily progressing ahead along the mantra emphasized upon by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, and Jai Anusandhan, to establish its footprint in the research and innovation landscape at global level. This has paved the way for resounding success. India has now scaled up to 40th position as per Global Innovation Index (GII) 2022 as compared to 81st position in 2015. India is placed among the top 3 countries in terms of number of scientific publications as per NSF database; in context of number of PhDs, magnitude of higher education system; as well as with respect to the number of technology start-ups and number of unicorns.</p><p>3. During the last seven years, Indias expenditure of RandD has almost doubled. In this year budget, we have allocated about Rupees 16,360 Crores (~US$ 2.20 billion) for the Ministry of Science and Technology. This apart, Govt. of India has recently embarked upon the creation of a National Research Foundation (NRF) with substantial funding to promote translational and interdisciplinary research in addition to basic RandD activities.</p><p>4. In India, currently research is conducted in silos - in government departments and laboratories, central and state educational institutes - with no uniformity in infrastructure. We propose NRF to seed, grow and promote research and development (RandD) and foster a culture of research and innovation throughout Indian universities, colleges, research institutes etc. The NRF is to ensure that scientific research is funded equitably and greater private participation is forthcoming. For this NRF will have to nudge companies to invest in RandD. We are planning a unique Public Private Partnership (PPP) entity for which a,36,000 Cr of the research funding is to come from private sector, mostly industry whereas Government will put a,14,000 Cr for the same, to ensure greater participation of industry. NRF has also been given a task of creating a policy framework and working on regulatory processes. Several disciplines have to work together to develop evidence -informed, context-relevant, resource-optimising, culturally-compatible and equity-promoting solutions</p><p>5. Besides the NRF, t here have been a substantial number of other initiatives that we have undertaken to encourage our researchers working in basic and applied research addressing the various Sustainable Development Goals. Thus, with ever increasing horizon of research activities it is pertinent not only to address scientific research but also to work from end-to-end worksheets to embrace the challenge. This includes comprehending research challenges, raising the technology readiness level (TRL), provide business readiness level (BRL) for newly developed technology products. This can only be achieved through applications of new and emerging technologies.</p><p>6. The underlying foundation to boost up seminal RandD activities includes the creation of state-of-the-art infrastructure facilities across the nation. Govt. of India have launched innovative schemes like SATHI (Sophisticated Analytical and Technical Help Institute) and SUPREME (Support for Up-gradation Preventive Repair and Maintenance of Equipment) that ensures set-up of major analytical instrumentation and advanced manufacturing facility that can be readily accessible to researchers across academia, start-ups, manufacturing units, industries and RandD Labs besides ensuring a mechanism for minimizing downtime and optimal utilization of these facilities by facilitating the scope for repair/ upgradation/ maintenance and retrofitting.</p><p>7. For ensuring transparent access, optimal utilization and geographical spread, a dedicated National Portal, I-STEM, has been launched that is the gateway for researchers to locate the specific facility(ies) pertaining to their research needs.</p><p>Let me give you examples of developments in some specific sectors:</p><p>Biotechnology Sector</p><p>8. India has launched several seminal programs with diverse portfolio from development of vaccines, Gene therapy, National Biopharma Mission, infectious diseases to lifestyle diseases, etc. that has played pivotal role in establishing a strong ecosystem for Life Sciences RandD in the country. India has adopted multifaceted approach in the development of innovative technologies, better varieties of agricultural crops, animal, and dairy products as well as marine resources. Various programs are aligned with UNSDG-2030 such as Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Affordable and Clean Energy, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and Climate Action for Good Health and Well-being of every age group of Indian population. Formulation of four COVID-19 vaccines (i.e., ZyCoV-D, CORBEVAXTM, GEMCOVAC-19 and iNCOVACC) are shining examples of Indias achievements in this field.</p><p>9. India has galvanized the processes to provide economically viable sustainable technologies for alleviating under-nutrition, obesity and related pathologies, micronutrient deficiencies and foods for targeted populations that are both shelf-stable and sensorily acceptable. For making Healthcare Affordable, it has developed technologies for Generic, Repurposed and new molecule-based drugs through high-quality, cost-competitive intermediates and APIs, and Genomics, signifying Indias tag-line - \"Pharmacy of the World\" which was also evident during peak COVID time.</p><p>Digital World</p><p>10. Indias National Supercomputing Mission has created high performance computing facilities in different institutions across India. The launch of the National Mission on Inter Disciplinary Cyber Physical Systems (NM-ICPS) has strongly aided technology development in diverse cyber physical fields like Robotics, IoT through setting up of Technology Innovation Hubs (TIH) at 25 different academic set ups across the country, each focusing on specific domain of cyber-physical system, like Modern Digital Technologies, Robotics, Machine learning etc. The integration of advanced digital technologies and data analytics has helped improve decision-making processes, enhance productivity, and drive innovation in diverse industries.</p><p>11. Recently, a National Quantum Mission has been launched that aims to scale up scientific and industrial RandD, for accelerating Quantum Technology-led economic growth and leverage India into a leading nation supporting sustainable development. Developing quantum technologies, exploring quantum communication, cryptography, and quantum algorithms are our research priorities.</p><p>Clean Technologies</p><p>12. India's energy generation depends on fossil fuel (59.8 per cent), with coal contributing to about 51 per cent. Even though renewable energy has grown to an impressive 38.5 per cent, there is still a pressing need to further decarbonise the energy sector. To address these challenges, India has launched a dedicated mission mode technology development program on Clean Energy, to have technology-led solutions for energy and environment challenges including m aterials for energy conservation and storage platform.</p><p>13. In this direction, the world has also witnessed rise of several technology-based start-ups. To inculcate the start-up ecosystem, India has established a Clean Energy International Incubation Centre (CEIIC) under Mission Innovation program. Numerous innovative clean energy solutions have been developed by start-ups established through this incubation centre. India is co-leading a Mission for undertaking and demonstration of high performance bio-refinery systems with a target of reducing of fossil-based fuels, chemicals and materials with bio-based alternatives by 2030.</p><p>14. With a steadfast commitment to environmental and climate issues, India has launched two Missions to address the future energy needs and environmental concerns namely, a) Green Hydrogen Mission: Production, Utilization, Storage and Conversion, and b) Carbon Capture, Conversion, Storage and Utilization.</p><p>15. As we move towards a more sustainable future, , we have been adopting cleaner technologies aiming for greener process methodologies in the leather industry; and eco-friendly chemicals, processes and waste management technologies for effective implementation for leather and other industry, and also materials encompassing metals, alloys, composites, ceramics etc. and also sustainable metal processing and extractions techniques for reducing carbon footprints during material extraction and manufacturing.</p><p>Blue Economy</p><p>16. By harnessing the potential of the Blue Economy, we can ensure the well-being of our oceans while driving economic development in a sustainable and responsible manner. It promotes the development of economic activities that maintain a balance between the economics, environmental, and social objectives and ensure long-term sustainability of the ocean ecosystem. The Blue Economy approach is firmly rooted to the SDG 14 (Life Below Water) which aims to Conserve and sustainable use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</p><p>17. It is pertinent to enhance our scientific knowledge through collaborative research and innovation for sustainably utilizing the potential of Blue Economy, majorly from enhanced ocean observations and services, marine spatial planning, especially for the BRICS Member States that are ocean-based economies. This assumes even more significance as oceans and marine ecosystems are major repositories of carbon and serves as natural barriers against coastal erosion, storm surges, cyclonic calamities, and sea level rise, and contribute towards climate change adaptation or SDG 13 on climate action.</p><p>18. India has disclosed its vision for the coming decade, listing the ten most important dimensions of its growth till 2030 and Blue Economy is envisioned as the sixth dimension to protect and conserve ocean resources for promoting sustainable development. The process of unveiling the Blue Economic Policy is underway and it is estimated that ocean-based industries would generate employment to nearly 40 million people.</p><p>19. Moving ahead with the Blue Economy Initiative, Deep Ocean Mission is being implemented, which includes development of ocean and climate change advisory services to address climate resilience, exploration and conservation of deep-sea biodiversity, development of technologies for sustainable harnessing of ocean resources and capacity building.</p><p>20. The near real time weather, climate and ocean forecast, and mitigation advisory services provided by India is vital in addressing science of climate change and developing climate services including achieving food and economic security and promoting sustainable agricultural practices in the country. India also offers early warning information for severe weather phenomena and other hazardous events like Tsunami, extreme waves, cyclones, storm surges and flash floods, forest fire monitoring and identification of hotspots .</p><p>Research Incubation and Translation</p><p>21. The confluence of technologies and productive partnership would revitalize the innovation dynamics and usher in a mechanism of collaborative circular economy. To boost the entire value chain of innovations a national programme titled NIDHI (National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations) has been launched. To ignite young minds to innovate, Prime Minister Narendra Modis vision has been the cornerstone behind establishment of Atal Tinkering Labs to foster an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship that have grown from zero to 10,000 across 700 districts in last six years.</p><p>22. Technology Development Board (TDB) facilitates investment, scale up innovations for promoting Indian Industries for indigenous technology development addressing nationally relevant product development and commercialization by way of setting up best in class manufacturing infrastructure in the country. The Board has been playing a pivotal role in supporting startups, innovators, and entrepreneurs to convert their innovations into market-ready products.</p><p>23. India has nurtured innovation and entrepreneurship by establishing a Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), to facilitate the development of several affordable biotech products and technologies. This has paved the way for a phenomenal number of more than 3500 start-ups in the last few years. These schemes have laid the foundation for strengthening the RandD capabilities of start-ups/ companies thereby, providing the desired impetus for pulling the translational ideas right from generating Proof of Concept to validation, scaling-up, demonstration and pre-commercialization of products and technologies.</p><p>Gender Equality</p><p>24. Towards achieving gender equality in Science, India have initiated various women centric programs for promoting career opportunities for women scientists through diverse interventions. Special focus has been attached to encourage and reinvigorate women researchers in STEM and Industrial RandD who have gone out of system for various reasons. Through sustained efforts, we have been successful in doubling the number of women researchers in last 10 years.</p><p>25. These are some of the major highlights of Indias STI priorities and policies updates. India is fully committed in contributing and cooperating in any form for betterment of our society and planet earth.</p><p>Strengthening BRICS STI Cooperation</p><p>Excellencies, moving ahead with contemporary challenges, BRICS should continue to hold global significance for being the most populated marketplace, driven by the knowledge, creativity and innovation economy. BRICS Member States could collaborate to identify and explore regional scientific-research challenges through joint SandT solutions suited to local economies.</p><p>India would support BRICS efforts in developing innovative and inclusive solutions including digital and technological tools to deepen science and technology cooperation in the areas like Health, Agriculture, Water, Marine Sciences, Renewable Energy, Biotechnology, Advanced Digital Technologies and Environment etc. to promote sustainable development and facilitate affordable and equitable access to global public goods for all.</p><p>India looks forward to working closely to enhance the BRICS collaboration in the field of Science, Technology and Innovation.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126064595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68W3-S4B1-JCBF-S4HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3130\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 5, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fire sparked by lightning Tuesday is burning on private and Bureau of Land Management property in the hills above the 3100 block of Wards Creek Road, the Oregon Department of Forestry said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wednesday, three 20-person crews were assigned to the fire, as well as numerous engines, tree fallers, a water tender, a bulldozer and two Type 2 helicopters. An air tanker dropped two loads of fire retardant on the east flank, bolstering perimeter lines. Meanwhile, tree fallers were able to remove roughly 50% of the hazardous trees on the fire, greatly reducing the risk to firefighters on the incident. That work will continue Thursday, ODF said.</p><p>Temperatures rose to approximately 99 degrees in the area Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\"We did have a firefighter suffering from a heat-related illness out on the line,\" ODF Spokeswoman Natalie Weber said Wednesday.</p><p>With the help of the Jackson County Sheriff's Office and Brim Aviation, the firefighter was transported by air to the bottom of the road and taken to Three Rivers Medical Center in Grants Pass by Jackson County Fire District 1 personnel. Wednesday night, the firefighter was reported to be in stable condition, ODF said.</p><p>Hydration and breaks are a priority on the fire line, and as temperatures continue to trend upward, the safety of firefighters remains a top priority, ODF said.</p><p>While fighting fires, firefighters aren't covered by Oregon's new laws that went into effect this year to help protect workers from excessive heat and smoke.</p><p>Three new 20-person hand crews were assigned to work the Wards Creek Fire overnight, along with engines, a water tender and other personnel. Goals include closing the fire line, with firefighters taking advantage of cooler overnight conditions to continue progress, ODF said.</p><p>No structures were threatened as of Wednesday, ODF said.</p><p>On the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, firefighters continued searching for new fires and attacking confirmed starts Wednesday.</p><p>On the High Cascades Ranger District, firefighters contained the Meadow, Maude, Ethel, Outn and Bunchgrass fires and will continue work to contain two additional fires.</p><p>While hiking out of the Sugar Fire, Crew 62 spotted new smoke in the area and was hiking in to attack it. The fires are scattered across a very broad area ranging from near Crater Lake National Park south to near Fish Lake, officials said.</p><p>Wednesday helicopter operations included extracting firefighters from remote fires that have been successfully contained, and returning them to staging for rapid reassignment to new fires, officials said.</p><p>Tuesday night, an aerial detection flight was completed over areas affected by Tuesday's lightning on the Siskiyou Mountain Ranger District, the Gold Beach Ranger District and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness Area. Significant rain accompanied the lightning, which gave firefighters a little extra time to locate and attack any new fires. However, the rain didn't eliminate the threat of new fires. Sometimes a week or more may go by between the ignition and detection of holdover lightning fires, officials said.</p><p>ODF's Southwest Oregon Detection Center in Central Point is fully staffed and workers are searching for signs of fire and smoke via a system of mountain-top cameras, ODF reported.</p><p>The Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest continued to help with the Clover Fire on the Fremont-Winema National Forest and the Alex Fire on the Klamath National Forest.</p><p>Fire danger is rated as extreme on Forest Service and ODF-protected land in Southern Oregon.</p><p>\"Despite the rain received in some areas, fuels will dry out quickly with the heat and wind,\" the Forest Service said in a press release.</p><p>Reach Mail Tribune reporter Vickie Aldous at 541-776-4486 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:valdous@rosebudmedia.com\">valdous@rosebudmedia.com</email> Follow her on Twitter @VickieAldous.</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Mail Tribune (Medford, Ore.)

Here's our digest for the week of May 17-23.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shelter in place impact on carbon dioxide emissions</p><p>Daily carbon dioxide emissions have dropped by 17% globally as a result of shelter in place policies, found a study published on May 19 in \"Nature Climate Change.\"</p><p>\"The drop in global emissions we estimate this year will surprise some people in being 'only' 4-7% because shelter-in-place rules are temporary and staggered across different countries,\" earth system science professor Rob Jackson told Stanford News. \"But it will still be the biggest emissions drop since World War II, though for undesirable and unsustainable reasons. More surprisingly, U.S. emissions declined one third for part of April, a shocking drop driven by reduced mobility, manufacturing and electricity demand.\"</p><p>The findings suggest that the changes in emissions may be temporary because they are not caused by structural changes to the economic, transportation or energy systems. According to the article, the length of shelter-in-place policies may have wide range impacts on the 2020 annual carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>If shelter-in-place policies are lifted by mid-June, low estimates indicate a 4% decrease in annual emissions. If confinement remains the global standard until the end of 2020, researchers expect a high estimate of 7% decreased annual emissions.</p><p>AI predicts forest fires amid fire season</p><p>Deep-learning models and artificial intelligence can help scientists predict forest fires as many western states head into fire season, a study published on May 8 in \"Remote Sensing of Environment\" reports.</p><p>\"One of our big breakthroughs was to look at a newer set of satellites that are using much longer wavelengths, which allows the observations to be sensitive to water much deeper into the forest canopy and be directly representative of the fuel moisture content,\" earth system science assistant professor Alexandra Konings told Stanford News.</p><p>The new model uses a recurrent neural network: AI that can recognize patterns within large amounts of data. Researchers trained their deep-learning model using data from the National Fuel Moisture Database. The model can estimate live fuel moisture levels, a well known quality that influences wildfire risk, and create an interactive map that fire agencies use to fight fires.</p><p>\"Creating these maps was the first step in understanding how this new fuel moisture data might affect fire risk and predictions,\" Konings told Stanford News. \"Now we're trying to really pin down the best ways to use it for improved fire prediction.\"</p><p>AI estimates poverty levels and development changes</p><p>Satellite imagery and artificial intelligence can help researchers estimate poverty levels and changes in infrastructure development over time in African villages, a study published on May 22 in \"Nature Communications\" reports.</p><p>Government agencies and organizations can use the information to deliver services and necessities to aid people.</p><p>\"Amazingly, there hasn't really been any good way to understand how poverty is changing at a local level in Africa,\" earth system science professor David Lobell told Stanford News. \"Censuses aren't frequent enough, and door-to-door surveys rarely return to the same people.

Prescribed burns have escaped there in the past, and the forest sits close to where some of New Mexico's most massive wildfires occurred. </p><p><br/>One of those, the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire was caused by the National Forest Service in 2022. Due to new safety rules around prescribed burns, the federal agency says they have more clear guidelines, and insist they don't want a repeat of the past. <br/>Not everyone has as much faith in them. <br/>Under the Santa Fe Mountains Landscape Resiliency Project[1], the U.S. Forest Service would burn 38,000 acres, thin 18,000 acres and conduct riparian restoration in 680 acres over the next 10 years. Maintenance burning would keep going every five to 10 years. <br/>As communities struggle to recover from 2022 fire season, Gov says to prepare for this year[2] <br/>Matthew Hurteau is a fire ecologist and University of New Mexico professor with expertise on the Santa Fe watershed. He said this project is necessary to keep the Santa Fe National Forest healthy and prevent out-of-control wildfires, especially amid climate change. <br/>'The atmosphere is getting warmer and drier, and so it basically acts as a giant sponge sucking water out of the ecosystem,' he said. 'And the less water you have stored in the ecosystem, the more flammable that becomes.' <br/>Other environmental advocates don't feel the same. <br/>Sarah Hyden lives on the edge of Santa Fe National Forest and has helped lead[3] a coalition of environmental advocacy groups and scientists in objecting to the project. She has also organized meetings so the Forest Service can hear public concerns about their plans, many of which revolve around potential dangers that could emerge. <br/>She said the project's excessive burning and thinning measures could have catastrophic consequences, both for the environment and the health of the people living near the forest. <br/>'Fire isn't a bad thing. It's a natural part of forest ecology,' she said. 'But when you get so much and you burn out communities and people's homes and disrupt their lives and their acequias, it's really damaging.' <br/>Hyden said she's worried about the potential of this large federal forest service project leading to escaped burns. That's how the U.S. Forest Service started the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon that grew out of control and burned more than 341,000 acres. <br/>'They don't seem to be learning from the past, and they don't seem to be willing to,' Hyden said. <br/> New burn rules <br/><br/>The Forest Service started releasing plans about the project around 2019, before the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, which temporarily put it on pause. Upon resuming last year, Hyden said the federal agency isn't learning from their errors. <br/>Jacob Key, U.S. Forest Service fireshed coordinator, said the federal government has taken steps to learn from the mistake and wants to prevent another record setting fire in New Mexico. <br/>The Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire caused a halt[4] on all U.S. Forest Service prescribed burns around the country for 90 days. Then, the Forest Service released a review of its burn practices and revised some of the standards[5]. <br/>Key said some of the significant changes require burn authorizations to be approved within a 24-hour period, monitoring fires more regularly and having contingency resources closer to project areas to handle fires getting out of control. <br/>The burn plans for the Santa Fe National Forest project would have to take those new requirements into account. Each burn project would get its own plan. It's unclear how many more prescribed burns are necessary under the plan, Key said. <br/>'There's a big understanding that we need to do more, and these are the steps that we're trying to take to do more,' he said. <br/>Hyden said the Forest Service still needs more personnel, equipment and funding to get things done correctly. She's concerned about their lack of capacity[6] to change, even under the new requirements. <br/>'There's nothing genuine that has been significantly improved, just a new set of procedures,' she said. 'And that's not like that's nothing, but it's not nearly enough.' <br/> A warming globe <br/><br/>Hurteau said one of the reasons the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire got so bad was because there's a history of the U.S. Forest Service not allowing prescribed burns[7] that can lead mitigation efforts that prevent larger fires from getting out of control. <br/>'I think it's absolutely delusional to think we can live in a world in the southwest without wildfire,' Hurteau said. <br/>Unlike the opinion from local residents like Hyden, Hurteau said not enacting this project amid climate change will lead to more disastrous wildfires. He said the project actually doesn't go far enough and should include more thinning and burning to treat the forest. <br/>'I think that most people don't understand how much more risk we're going to face in these landscapes with additional warming in the atmosphere,' Hurteau said. 'And we're committed to it. It's happening. Even if we shut off fossil fuel combustion globally tomorrow, we're going to continue to warm.' <br/>Northern NM watershed group receives multi-million dollar federal grant for wildfire prevention[8] <br/>Extreme weather conditions were major factors[9] in the intensity of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. The U.S. Forest Service lit the prescribed burns that led to the fires[10] combining in high winds and low humidities. <br/>In the last five decades, wildfire season in western states has increased by over two months in length, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture[11]. <br/>There have been multiple opportunities for the public to object to the Santa Fe project, though the objection periods have since closed. The most recent objection period ended in January. Dozens have already questioned how this will make the forest healthier. <br/>Lisa Markovchick is the southwestern ecologist and conservation advocate at WildEarth Guardians. She joined Hyden to submit an in-depth objection to the project. <br/>Markovchick said the Forest Service needs to consider more alternative methods, including those that'll help the environment maintain moisture, hold carbon and provide shade. Markovchick said to have cooler, wetter environments, there are 'more ways to do that than just yanking out trees.' <br/>She said another issue with this plan is that it's conditions-based, which means specific treatment plans and areas won't be determined until the Forest Service knows the current on-the-ground conditions. <br/>Markovchick and Hyden requested an extra research step in their objection \u2014 an environmental impact statement. Others asked for this, too, including the Santa Fe County Commission. <br/>An impact statement would show the consequences the project would have that significantly affect the human environment \u2014 which Forest Service officials have said the plan doesn't have. <br/>Key said it's unlikely an environmental impact statement will be done. He said officials at the various federal agency branches agree that the Forest Service analyzed everything correctly. <br/>The regional Forest Service office is reviewing concerns until April 10 and could change project details later based on the findings. Key said the Forest Service hopes to get the OK in May to get the project going. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/subscribe\">https://sourcenm.com/subscribe</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=55088\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=55088</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/2023/03/30/as-communities-struggle-to-recover-from-2022-fire-season-gov-says-to-prepare-for-this-year/\">https://sourcenm.com/2023/03/30/as-communities-struggle-to-recover-from-2022-fire-season-gov-says-to-prepare-for-this-year/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theforestadvocate.org\">https://www.theforestadvocate.org</url>/ [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/2022/09/02/as-forest-service-wraps-up-90-day-pause-on-burns-nm-scientist-fears-what-comes-next/\">https://sourcenm.com/2022/09/02/as-forest-service-wraps-up-90-day-pause-on-burns-nm-scientist-fears-what-comes-next/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/2022/09/09/learning-from-nm-mistakes-forest-service-to-better-heed-drought-factor-before-burns/\">https://sourcenm.com/2022/09/09/learning-from-nm-mistakes-forest-service-to-better-heed-drought-factor-before-burns/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-firefighters-brace-another-year-staffing-woes-wildfires-intens-rcna25105\">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-firefighters-brace-another-year-staffing-woes-wildfires-intens-rcna25105</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/#:~:text=In%201935%2C%20the%20Forest%20Service,eliminate%20fire%20from%20the%20landscape\">https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/#:~:text=In%201935%2C%20the%20Forest%20Service,eliminate%20fire%20from%20the%20landscape</url>.

Regarding UPR, Human Rights Watch participated in consultations with other Russian and international NGOs but is not aware of and has not been part of any consultations involving Russian authorities and independent civil society organizations. In 2022, Russian authorities de-registered Human Rights Watch's Russia office, which effectively amounts to a ban on operations in the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This statement focuses on addressing in Russia issues pertaining to the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and attacks on environmental human rights defenders, the rights of older people, the rights of migrant workers and discrimination based on race or ethnicity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On request of the Environmental Crisis Group, which is a Russian initiative to support environmental defenders, but could not attend this session, the section on environmental defenders incorporates information from their UPR submission and recommendations.</p><p>Human Rights Watch's submission on Russia for this UPR fourth cycle also covers several other issues-- pertaining to rights to freedom expression, assembly, and association, as well as the situation for human rights defenders in general--that were addressed by other members of this panel.</p><p>ISSUE 1: - RIGHT TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS</p><p>During the previous UPR cycle, 25 countries made recommendations to the Russian Federation on human rights defenders in general. These included recommendations to ensure the unrestricted work of civil society and review the current restrictive legal framework, especially the laws on foreign agents, undesirable organizations and extremism in line with its international obligations to ensure that civil society organizations, can exercise their activities without fear of stigmatization or punishment by law; to guarantee the rights to freedom of assembly and association and exercise of the right to freedom of expression, including online, without fear of reprisal; and to ensure effective investigations into all reports of attacks on, or threats against, human rights defenders.</p><p>Ecuador made recommendations to Russia on the right to a healthy environment, specifically to \"sign and ratify the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity in order to guarantee the right to health and to a healthy environment\", while Indonesia recommended to \"step up its efforts to develop social and environmental impact assessments on the enjoyment of human rights prior to issuing licenses for mining and exploitation of natural resources\".[1]</p><p>Russia remains one of the world's top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and is contributing to the climate crisis. The Climate Action Tracker rates Russia's climate targets, policies and finance as \"critically insufficient\" to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.[2]</p><p>Unprecedented forest fires in Siberia and Russia's Far East in 2021 resulted in a loss of over 17 million hectares of forests and trapped several cities in heavy smoke.[3] In 2022, nearly 4 million hectares of forests burned, over half in these regions.[4] A large portion of Russia's forests were explicitly excluded from fire-fighting measures.[5]</p><p>Lack of transparency and inadequacy of environmental impact assessments sparked sustained mass protests in 2018 and 2019 against the construction or expansion of landfills, waste incineration plants, and waste processing plants that protesters believed would be dangerous and could be harmful for their health.[6] In response the government opened administrative and criminal cases against numerous activists accusing them of violation of peaceful assembly rules, resisting police and assaulting private security guards.</p><p>Human rights watchdogs in Russia continue to report physical attacks, harassment, intimidation, and prosecution of grassroots environmental activists and groups. According to the Environmental Crisis Group, during the last three years at least 52 environmental defenders were attacked and injured in varying degrees of severity.[7] The group's submission demonstrates how such attacks continue to go unpunished.[8]</p><p>Environmental defenders are also targeted by authorities using Russia's \"foreign agents\" and \"undesirable organizations\" laws. For example, between April and July 2023, Russian authorities blacklisted five environmental groups including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), [9] thus banning their operations in Russia and potentially putting many Russian environmental defenders at risk, since participation in the activities of an undesirable organization is a criminal offence, punishable by up to four years in prison.[10]</p><p>States should recommend the Russian government to:</p><p>1. Ensure that environmental defenders, including grassroot activists, can in practice exercise their rights to free expression and peaceful assemblies, without fear of reprisal;</p><p>2. Follow through on recommendations from previous UPRs including to sign and accede to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity;</p><p>3. Stop all types of pressure on environmental human rights defenders from the state actors and protect defenders from such pressure by non-state actors (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>4. Investigate all cases of attacks and threats to environmental human rights defenders and bring the perpetrators to justice (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>5. Investigate all violations of environmental law, which are associated with attacks on environmental human rights defenders (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>6. Ensure safe and free work of environmental human rights defenders, including allowing and promoting freedom to seek, receive, and impart information on environmental issues (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>ISSUE 2: RIGHTS OF OLDER PEOPLE</p><p>Bulgaria recommended that the Russian government strengthen the protection of the rights of older people and other vulnerable groups and Uzbekistan recommended that it continue to take measures to defend the rights of older people and people with disabilities.</p><p>The Russian government stated that a systematic program was being developed to improve the quality of life of older persons and to increase life expectancy.[11]</p><p>Human Rights Watch notes that with its aging population growing, Russia has taken positive steps toward reforming services for older people. In 2013, Russia passed a law to ensure that older people have access to a broader range of home services, which can include personal support assistance such as delivery of groceries, payment of bills, food preparation, personal hygiene, or medical services, emergency services, or mental health services. A law that entered into force in 2015 states that services should be tailored to an individual's needs with the goal of enabling older people \"to remain in a familiar and positive living environment.\"</p><p>However, research conducted by Human Rights Watch on the rights of older people in Russia in 2020-2021 found that the Russian government is not providing adequate resources for home-based services for older people, denying some of them the ability to live independent and dignified lives.[12]</p><p>Human Rights Watch's interviews with 20 older people in Pskov and Sverdlovsk regions, as well as with experts and advocates in various parts of Russia, suggest that despite reform efforts, services often do not go far enough to meet the needs of older people to allow them to live at home with dignity.</p><p>Under the law, financing and delivery of home-based services is the responsibility of regional governments. Experts and advocates said at the time that funds were often insufficient to cover the real need for home services, rendering the 2013 law ineffective. Social workers, whose jobs include delivering home-based services to older people, often have heavy caseloads that do not allow them to provide comprehensive services, even if provided for by regional or federal norms. In most cases Human Rights Watch examined in 2020-2021, social workers were unable to carry out services beyond delivery of food and medicine.</p><p>The law also requires older people or their legal representative to request services, meaning that unless older people get adequate information about entitlements, they may not be able to get the support that is available.</p><p>Therefore, states should recommend that the Russian government:</p><p>1. Ensure that all older people receive the support they need to live at home, if that is their choice, with dignity and autonomy;</p><p>2. Ensure that regional governments have sufficient funds to provide adequate support services on a long-term basis and improve and standardize training of social workers and other service providers where needed;</p><p>3. Require service providers to do more outreach to older people to inform them about available services to ensure that those most in need of support can get them;</p><p>4. Federal and regional governments should improve and expand the types and availability of social services provided to older people and take measures necessary to ensure that sufficient numbers of social workers are available to provide support services for as much time as required.</p><p>ISSUE 3 - NON-DISCRIMINATION AND RIGHTS OF MIGRANT WORKERS</p><p>Six states made recommendations to the Russian Federation on migrant rights during the previous UPR cycle, focusing on ratification of the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Honduras) and enhancing the integration of migrants (Vietnam).[13]</p><p>Seventeen states made recommendations pertaining to combatting racial or ethnic discrimination, xenophobia, racial profiling by police; addressing hate speech by officials and the dissemination of negative stereotypes and prejudices by media; and ensuring the protection of minorities and vulnerable groups. [14]</p><p>The Russian Federation claimed that the law already forbids public servants, without exception, from racial profiling and other discrimination on the basis of race. [15]</p><p>However, high-level government officials and politicians and mainstream, state-affiliated and other media continue to routinely engage in anti-migrant and xenophobic actions and rhetoric.[16]</p><p>Racial profiling by law enforcement of migrants of non-Slavic appearance in public spaces and during special operations remains prevalent. Russian police continue to round up and detain en masse migrant workers and non-Slavic Russian nationals whom they apparently presumed by their appearance to be migrants and subject them to prolonged detentions, sometimes in inhumane conditions.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic, the economic downturn, and then the full-scale invasion of Ukraine supercharged these tendencies. Journalists reported that Russian authorities also actively lured and recruited migrant workers to fight in its armed forces[17] and to work on the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia.[18] The reports include allegations of coercion and harassment should migrant workers refuse Russian authorities[19] and threats of criminal prosecution by countries of origin if they fight in Russia's armed forces.[20]</p><p>States should recommend the Russian government to:</p><p>1. Ensure in practice that racial discrimination and racial profiling of migrants, in particular by law enforcement officials, is not tolerated and is prosecuted;</p><p>2. Ensure in practice that use of racist and hate speech against migrants by officials and politicians, and the dissemination of negative stereotypes and prejudices by media outlets is not tolerated;</p><p>3. Sign and accede to Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Russia, A/HRC/39/13 (June 2018), paras 147.103 and 147.125</p><p>[2] Climate Action Tracker: Russia, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/russian-federation/\">https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/russian-federation/</url></p><p>[3] Yulia Davydova, \"Record breaking fires in Siberia\", Greenpeace, August 18, 2021, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/49171/russia-record-breaking-fires-siberia/\">https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/49171/russia-record-breaking-fires-siberia/</url></p><p>[4] 'Compiled report on forest fires (thermal anomalies) on all territories, based on satellite monitoring data as of September 28, 2022' Federal Budget Institution \"Avialesohrana\" of the Federal Forestry Agency, <url normalizedValue=\"https://public.aviales.ru/main_pages/openform1.shtml?2022-09-28\">https://public.aviales.ru/main_pages/openform1.shtml?2022-09-28</url></p><p>[5] The Order of the Russian Ministry of Nature no.313 dated July 8, 2014, explicitly permitted not to fight fires in so-called \"control zones\" if there was no immediate threat to urban settlements and if cost of firefighting exceeded estimated damages from forest fires.</p><p>As a result, estimated 45 percent of all forest territories in Russia fell within these \"control zones\" and that is where 90 percent of all forest fires burned.

But no one lives there, so I wasn't bothered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I heard that it's happening on some remote island, but it's so far away.</p><p>But now, suddenly, it's hitting too close to home.</p><p>This is exactly how many of us have reacted to climate change over the years, until suddenly we start seeing and feeling the impacts ourselves.</p><p>Global warming and rising temperatures have no boundaries. In 2021, extreme weather events occurred globally in almost every month of the year. These images are a visual archive, bearing witness to the impacts and the struggles faced by millions of people in 2021. From snowstorms to flash floods, these extreme weather events demonstrate how no one is safe and no economy is secure in a climate emergency.</p><p>It is now Code Red for humanity. Climate change can no longer be ignored or denied. We are now at a crucial point in history. Our survival as a species largely depends on what we do starting today. Individual actions matter. But collectively, we can achieve more especially if governments address the climate crisis by decarbonising their economies and transitioning to cleaner renewable energy.</p><p>Now more than ever, we must raise our voices and hold governments and fossil fuel companies accountable. Will you join us?</p><p>Polar vortex</p><p>Record-breaking cold wave and heavy snowfall in the Spanish capital Madrid which has not experienced such a phenomenon since 1917. A month later, Texas in the USA was hit by a powerful polar vortex with record-setting low temperatures that cut state power lines and water systems, leaving millions in the cold.</p><p>Cyclone in Africa</p><p>Cyclone Eloise, the third cyclone to hit the Mozambican coast since 2019, affected more than 250,000 people, displacing at least 18,000 and destroying schools, roads, and other vital infrastructure. It led to at least 27 deaths and damages in Madagascar, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa.</p><p>Sandstorm in China</p><p>This year Beijing, China was hit with its worst sandstorm in a decade, with the city shrouded in a yellow haze mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels. To protect people from breathing this poisonous air, governments must take immediate action to phase out fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas and bring back blue skies.</p><p>Flooding in Australia</p><p>Torrential rains and flash floods swept across New South Wales, Australia. These floods that have inundated properties, closed schools and left many isolated and cut off from essential services like hospitals are made worse by the continued dependence on coal, oil and gas.</p><p>Forest fire in the Mediterranean region</p><p>Turkey experienced its worst fires in at least a decade. Thousands of people battled almost 100 separate blazes in cities and villages on the country's Mediterranean and Aegean coasts. The flames have been fueled by scorching summer temperatures and conditions that experts said have been worsened by climate change. Similar news was reported from Greece, Lebanon, Morocco and Israel.</p><p>Flash floods in Europe</p><p>More than 100 people died from the severe floods that devastated parts of Europe. Places in Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and France were severely impacted.</p><p>Flash floods in Asia</p><p>Flash floods continued to spread havoc across Asia. We saw dramatic visuals from China where people were stuck in flooded subway trains. Flash floods were also recorded in Japan, Indonesia and India displacing millions.</p><p>Fire Monitoring in the Amazon</p><p>Aerial view of recently deforested areas for the expansion of livestock, in Porto Velho, Rondonia state. Every year, GreenpeaceBrazil flies over the Amazon to monitor deforestation build up and forest fires. From September 12-14, flights were made over points with Deter (Real-Time Deforestation Detection System) and Prodes (BrazilianAmazon Satellite Monitoring Project) fire warnings, besides heat spots alerted by Inpe (National Institute for Space Research), in Amazonas, Rondonia, Mato Grosso and Para states.</p><p>Forest Fires in Argentina</p><p>Forest fires burned 30,000 hectares in Patagonia, Argentina. High temperatures were due to climate change. Strong winds promoted the rapid spread of the fires- this is a pattern seen in different parts of the world.</p><p>Wildfires and Worsening Drought in California</p><p>Once again, wildfires gripped California, USA, a state that has also been facing drought and life-threatening heatwave. Smoke from the wildfires in the west has been visible and lowering air quality across the entire country, even as far east as New York City.</p><p>More than 11.2 million people in California are at an elevated risk of wildfires. By 2050, California is projected to see more than 140 days a year with high wildfire potential.</p><p>Russian forest fire</p><p>Early this year, fires spread across eastern Russia, with Siberia's Yakutia region hit hardest. The fires hitting Siberia are so extreme that they've sent smoke streaming to the North Pole.</p><p>Russia has experienced abnormally dry and hot weather conditions which caused fires to spread at an alarming rate. GreenpeaceRussia staff joined forces with volunteer firefighters, local authorities and residents to contain the fires.</p><p>Tornado in the United States</p><p>Whether it's sea-level rise due to flooding or warmer ocean temperatures leading to stronger winds and rains or tornadoes, the scientific connections between climate change and extreme weather events are clear.</p><p>At least 88 people were killed by the tornado outbreak that destroyed a nursing home in Arkansas, as well wreaking havoc in other parts of Tennessee, Illinois, and Missouri.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124910954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64B1-98W1-JCBF-S339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 16, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The demos I found more interesting were:</p><p>1) Computer Vision applied to warehouses (see image below), in which Private MEC is the infrastructure that enables a Computer Vision application to run and inspect automatically the content of boxes that arrive at a facility. Verizon tested the application at its own warehouse, where it receives client trade-ins of smart gadgets, and analyzes the content of sent boxes, to determine the products that need repair and those that are ready to be sold and can be put into the inventory immediately.</p><p>2) Managed Private MEC in 30 stadiums of the National Football League (NFL) to deliver an immersive experience to fans (see image below) and also to enable other solutions in stadiums, such as the \"5G Edge Cashierless Checkout.\" for stores inside stadiums, using Computer Vision and Machine Learning to make the purchasing and payment process fully automated, in a concept similar to Amazon Go.</p><p>Telefonica has been working with clients in Spain to deliver private networks with MEC capabilities. To do this, Telefonica has implemented edge virtual data centers in Spanish cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, and Seville. It has commercial cases in Ports (Barcelona and Bilbao), Manufacturing, Hospitality, and Banking. In other countries, such as Brazil, Germany, and the UK, Telefonica is doing Proof of Concepts (PoCs). Data Center and Edge Computing became one of the pillars of its \"Open Gateway\" strategy, a platform with open APIs to drive ecosystem collaboration.</p><p>During MWC, Telefonica presented innovative use cases of MEC, such as the Metaverse (in partnership with Microsoft) and Holographic Telepresence (in collaboration with Evercoast, Intel, and AWS).</p><p>Telefonica has virtualized its stand in the Metaverse, using Digital Twin technology, allowing anyone remotely to access the stand, visit the demos and meet with experts via video calls.</p><p>In the Holographic Telepresence demonstration, the person is recreated in 3D in a virtual environment, and can both the avatar of the person and the scenario are adaptable, all using the 5G MEC installation developed in Telefonica`s stand.</p><p>Vodafone presented interesting IoT use cases related to Sustainability, such as IoT Connected Agriculture, IoT Forest Fire Detection, and Water Monitoring.</p><p>Frost &amp; Sullivan estimates the sustainability industry to have 5 billion IoT-connected devices as of December 2021 (16.6% of the total IoT devices). And this number should grow significantly in the following years with the expansion of funding for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) projects.</p><p>Regarding 5G MEC, in which Vodafone is a relevant market participant in Europe, it presented a couple of use cases for Manufacturing.</p><p>The first one was \"5G Networking Slicing\" to control surveillance robots remotely, in real-time, in partnership with Ericsson. One interesting detail is that it did not require a VR glass or hand device to interact; there were sensors to capture the hand movement to operate the robot, with a screen that virtualized the environment and the hands of the operator in 3D.</p><p>e second one was a Digital Twin for Industry 4.0, which in this opportunity, leveraged the traditional VR equipment to immerse the person into the industrial environment to perform functions in the machines and processes.</p><p>Orange Business had several demonstrations in areas such as Sports, Manufacturing, and the Metaverse.</p><p>In Sports, Orange presented a couple of use cases leveraging 5G MEC. The first was developed in partnership Touch2See and allows people that are blind and visually impaired to improve their experience in stadiums, beyond audio description, to know in real-time where the action is taking place in the field and the movements of players and the ball. The second is immersive running, a solution that detects the body movements and virtualizes the running interface to allow an interactive and immersive experience with 360 image and sound.</p><p>In manufacturing, the main case was \"5G XR Digital Twin Robot Control\". The user can wear a Microsoft or Meta VR device and control a digital twin of a Xiaomi CyberDog robot in the industrial environment, to monitor machinery and remote sites, where there can be a danger for humans or impractical.</p><p>Orange has also demonstrated a Metaverse application, in partnership with Huawei and Virtual Voyagers, to create an avatar of the person in real-time to allow interaction in a virtual environment.</p><p>Regarding the South Korean CSPs, SK Telecom, and KT, the Metaverse was the proven solution with different applications.</p><p>SK Telecom has one of the most popular Metaverse platforms globally, ifland, which had 12.8 million cumulative users by Q3 2022. After the success in Korea, the platform was introduced in 49 other countries.</p><p>During MWC, SK Telecom created different Metaverse experiences, including its VR flight simulator, one of the most disputed attractions in the event.</p><p>KT Corp showed a couple of Metaverse applications: Genieverse and MetaLounge. The Genieverse is an AI Home Twin, with floor plan analysis, detection, and 3D space modeling. The MetaLounge is a virtual spaces solutions designed for the enterprise segment, such as universities, Governments, etc., allowing interaction in virtualized environments such as a classroom or tribune.</p><p>Ericsson and Huawei had huge stands in MWC with demos on 5G enterprise solutions.</p><p>Ericsson presented a 5G-enabled Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) with no specific routes to follow as it did in the past. It can work in a virtual perimeter defined, being smarter to perform actions in warehouses and factories. In addition, it presented a Digital Twin demo using traditional webcams in the ceiling to virtualize the body of persons present in the stand and the used smart device, transposing to a virtual environment in real-time.</p><p>Huawei presented its 5GtoB approach, involving CSPs and system integrators, to provide end-to-end solutions (network, operation, services, and apps), stating it is an opportunity for Telcos to grow revenue. In addition, Huawei presented private network architectures that enable 5G MEC use cases, currently more concentrated in manufacturing, but covering different verticals.</p><p>In summary, MWC showed a significant evolution of the CSPs to offer more comprehensive solutions for the enterprise segment and have a more relevant role in business transformation and ecosystem development. While current edge computing developments are more concentrated on manufacturing and industrial environments (such as mining, oil &amp; gas, etc.), it is anticipated that 5G MEC will also encourage the growth of consumer applications like 5G gaming, the Metaverse, stadium immersive experiences, and many others. The Digital Twin, now available in advanced manufacturing, is likely to be more present in our lives, being our home, car, and even ourselves digitalized to be \"transported\" to digital environments, interact, and do transactions.

HII Awarded $197 Million Contract To Support Joint Force Readiness - 19/1/2024</p><p>MCLEAN, Va., (Jan. 19, 2024) \u2014 HII (NYSE: HII) announced today that its Mission Technologies division was awarded a $197 million recompete task order contract to conduct research and development for the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE), which blends live and virtual training into a single synthetic environment that enables joint force readiness.</p><p>Administered by the Joint Staff J7, Deputy Director of Joint Training, HII will develop, maintain, support and provide joint training in a synthetic environment across combatant commands, military service branches, federal agencies, academia, industry and multi-national partners. The JTSE is designed to evolve with changing operational needs, providing accessible exercises that mirror the complexity of real-world scenarios.</p><p>\"As the battlespace becomes more complex, so does the need for warfighters who are fully equipped to handle any challenge,\" said Glenn Goodman, president of Mission Technologies' LVC Solutions business group. \"We are committed to the development and delivery of a truly integrated, high-fidelity training capability that supports the future fight.\"</p><p>HII was awarded this task order under the Department of Defense Information (DoD) Analysis Center's (IAC) multiple-award contract (MAC) vehicle. IAC MAC task orders are awarded by the U.S. Air Force's 774th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron to develop and create new knowledge for the enhancement of the Defense Technical Information Center repository and the research and development and science and technology community.</p><p>The task order has a five-year term. Most of the work will be performed in Suffolk, Virginia.</p><p>HII's support to the joint staff is an extension of work performed under two previous contracts awarded in August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. HII is the largest provider of secure, realistic networked LVC training environment to the DoD.

Flexrotor is a small tactical unmanned aerial system designed for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions at sea and over land.</p><p>\"We are looking forward to welcoming Aerovel into the Airbus family. This strategic acquisition aligns with our vision to expand our UAS offering and respond to a growing customer demand worldwide for additional mission capabilities such as manned-unmanned teaming. Aerovel's expertise in autonomous flight technology will undoubtedly complement our UAS development with the VSR700, as well as the work that we have been doing to develop interoperability,\" said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.</p><p>\"Joining forces with Airbus will allow us to scale innovation, accelerate our mission to advance unmanned aviation, and maintain our unwavering support for the US military and its allies. We are proud to become part of an organisation with a rich legacy of aerospace excellence and we look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to define the future of autonomous systems. It will also be a great tribute to our Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Tad McGeer, who has spent the last 30 years committed to delivering innovative unmanned products,\" said Ali Dian, CEO of Aerovel.</p><p>The Flexrotor, a modern Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aircraft with a maximum launch weight of 25 kg, has been designed for ISTAR missions for more than 12-14 hours in a typical operational configuration. It can integrate different types of payloads including an electro-optical system and advanced sensors to suit customers' unique mission needs. With the ability to autonomously launch and recover from either land or sea requiring only a 12 by 12 ft. area for launch and recovery, the Flexrotor is ideal for expeditionary missions requiring minimal footprint. Through the support of the US Department of Defense (DoD), and contracted deployment in a variety of maritime security exercises, the Flexrotor is a mission-proven, force multiplier for operations in harsh, high-threat, GPS-denied environments. The Flexrotor can also be used for parapublic missions such as forest fire surveillance (providing firefighters with critical images day or night) and ice navigation (helping guide naval vessels through ice in the Arctic ocean).</p><p>Aerovel, based in Bingen, Washington, will remain a US-owned company and continue collaboration with the US DoD under Airbus' Special Security Agreement (SSA).</p><p>The acquisition has been approved by the relevant bodies of both companies. It remains subject to regulatory approvals, as well as other customary conditions.

This study empirically examines these issues using data from the most recent US defence budget, revenue statistics from military contractors, and financial information from US military bases in Japan. The results of the study suggest that the construction of overseas bases only harms the American economy if they are acquired through military occupation.

Revenues increased substantially in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East. Outstanding orders and a surge in new contracts suggest that global arms revenues could rise significantly in the next few years.</p><p>Demand for weapons grows but production lags behind</p><p>Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and geopolitical tensions around the world fuelled a strong increase in demand for weapons and military equipment in 2022. However, despite receiving new orders, many US and European arms companies could not significantly ramp up production capacity because of labour shortages, soaring costs and supply chain disruptions that were exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. In addition, countries placed new orders late in the year and the time lag between orders and production meant that the surge in demand was not reflected in these companies' 2022 revenues.</p><p>'Many arms companies faced obstacles in adjusting to production for high-intensity warfare,' said Dr Lucie B\u00e9raud-Sudreau, Director of SIPRI's Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. 'However, new contracts were signed, notably for ammunition, which could be expected to translate into higher revenue in 2023 and beyond.'</p><p>In contrast to the major US and European suppliers, companies in Asia and Oceania and the Middle East saw their arms revenues grow significantly in 2022, demonstrating their ability to respond to increased demand within a shorter time frame. This was especially true in countries where companies maintain responsive 'ever-warm' manufacturing capabilities, such as Israel and South Korea, and those where companies tend to rely on short supply chains.</p><p>Arms revenues fall in USA due to production challenges</p><p>The arms revenues of the 42 US companies in the Top 100 fell by 7.9 per cent to $302 billion in 2022. They accounted for 51 per cent of the total arms revenue of the Top 100. Of the 42 US companies, 32 recorded a fall in year-on-year arms revenue, most commonly citing ongoing supply chain issues and labour shortages stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>'We are beginning to see an influx of new orders linked to the war in Ukraine and some major US companies, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies, received new orders as a result,' said Nan Tian, SIPRI Senior Researcher. 'However, because of these companies' existing order backlogs and difficulties in ramping up production capacity, the revenue from these orders will probably only be reflected in company accounts in two to three years' time.'</p><p>Asia outperforms Europe on back of military modernization drives</p><p>The arms revenues of the 22 companies from Asia and Oceania listed in the ranking rose by 3.1 per cent to reach $134 billion in 2022. This was the second consecutive year where Top 100 arms revenues for Asia and Oceania were higher than those for Europe.</p><p>'Domestic demand and reliance on local suppliers shielded Asian arms companies from supply chain disruptions in 2022,' said Xiao Liang, a researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. 'Companies in China, India, Japan and Taiwan all benefited from sustained government investment in military modernization.'</p><p>The combined arms revenues of the four South Korean companies in the Top 100 fell by 0.9 per cent, primarily due to an 8.5 per cent drop recorded by the country's biggest arms producer, Hanwha Aerospace. Two South Korean companies reported revenue growth, most notably LIG Nex1. South Korean companies are likely to see increased revenues in coming years due to a surge in booked orders after signing major arms deals with Poland and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Modest revenue growth in Europe as Ukraine-linked demand starts to filter through</p><p>The arms revenues of the 26 companies in the Top 100 based in Europe rose by 0.9 per cent to reach $121 billion in 2022.</p><p>'The war in Ukraine created demand for materiel suited to a war of attrition, like ammunition and armoured vehicles. Many European producers of these items saw their revenues grow,' said Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. 'They included companies based in Germany, Norway and Poland. For instance, Poland's PGZ increased its arms revenue by 14 per cent, benefiting from the accelerated military modernization programme the country is pursuing.'</p><p>Trans-European companies Airbus and KNDS were among the main sources of arms revenue growth in Europe, largely due to deliveries against long-standing orders.</p><p>Turkish companies drive significant increase in Middle Eastern arms revenue</p><p>The Middle East saw the largest percentage rise in arms revenue of any region in 2022, as all seven Middle East-based companies in the Top 100 recorded substantial growth. Their combined arms revenues of $17.9 billion marked an 11 per cent year-on-year increase. The four Turkish companies' total arms revenues reached $5.5 billion\u201422 per cent more than in 2021. The aggregate arms revenues of the three Israeli companies in the ranking reached $12.4 billion in 2022, a 6.5 per cent increase compared with 2021.</p><p>'Middle Eastern companies that specialize in less technologically sophisticated products were able to scale up production faster in response to surging demand,' said Dr Diego Lopes da Silva, SIPRI Senior Researcher. 'A case in point is T\u00fcrkiye's Baykar, producer of the Bayraktar TB-2 drone. Baykar entered the Top 100 for the first time after its arms revenue rose by 94 per cent, the fastest growth rate of any company in the ranking.'</p><p>Other notable developments</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    In 2022 China accounted for the second largest share of combined Top 100 arms revenues by country, at 18 per cent.

We have delivered 18% organic revenue growth, 140 basis points of underlying operating margin(1) expansion and 82% underlying operating cash conversion(1), boosted by the receipt of licence fee income. Beyond the strong financial performance in the half, we have also made excellent operational and strategic progress, delivering on existing contract milestones and entering into some significant long-term partnerships, such as our wide-ranging Strategic Cooperation Agreement with Saab, which includes the development of an advanced corvette design and an agreement with HII to collaborate in naval and nuclear opportunities in the UK, US and Australia.</p><p>Equally critical, given that our people are paramount to our success, is the progress we have made in enhancing and strengthening our corporate culture. We were delighted with the increased levels of engagement and satisfaction we saw reflected in our recent Group wide employee survey and were proud to have been named in  The Engineer's  'Top Ten Employers 2023' list in October  .  We enter the second half of the year with a strong order book and continue to be excited by the positive underlying trends and expanding opportunity set for the Group, which make us more confident than ever in the prospects for the business across the short, medium and long term.</p><p>HY24 results</p><p>We delivered strong financial results for the first six months of the financial year. Group revenue of \u00a32,177 million was slightly up on the prior year. Organic revenue growth of 18%, including double-digit growth in three of our four sectors, more than offset the impact of disposals. Underlying operating margin(1) of 7.1% (HY23: 5.7%) and underlying free cash flow(1) of \u00a367 million were both ahead of expectations, albeit largely due to earlier than expected licence receipts on the Polish MIECZNIK frigate programme. While the licences are one-off in nature, they demonstrate further progress on a key naval programme and, more broadly, the attractiveness to international markets of the modular Arrowhead 140 frigate design and our flexible acquisition model.</p><p>In April 2023, the Board stated its intention to reinstate a dividend in FY24, underpinned by our strengthened balance sheet and cash outlook. The Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.7 pence per share payable on 19 January 2024.</p><p>Increasing momentum and reducing risk</p><p>The global threat environment and geopolitical situation remains unstable, meaning that the services and products we provide across our diverse international footprint have never been more important, as reflected by the good operating and financial momentum across the Group. Our contract backlog of \u00a39.6 billion was \u00a30.3 billion lower than a year ago due to the impact of disposals. However, contract backlog increased slightly in H1 compared to the end of March, despite the trading of long-term contracts, reflecting multiple new contract awards and agreements that will help drive future growth.</p><p>We play a critical role in support of the UK's nuclear deterrent, which lies at the heart of the nation's defence. We have now completed the highly complex, multi-year life-extension (LIFEX) programme on the first Vanguard Class submarine, HMS Vanguard, representing a major reduction in fixed price contract risk. In July, we signed an initial contract with the MOD for the second Vanguard boat, HMS Victorious, enabling deep maintenance of the complex submarine to begin at our Devonport dockyard. We expect the full cost recovery agreement to be replaced with a contract covering the entire programme on similar terms in the coming months.</p><p>The Vanguard Class submarines will begin to transition to the UK's next generation nuclear deterrent submarine, the Dreadnought Class, in the early 2030s. Babcock is playing an important role in the Dreadnought programme, specifically in support of the design and future support solutions. In the period, we also won a contract to deliver weapons handling launch systems (WHLS) and specialist equipment for these future submarines.</p><p>In October 2023, we also signed a five-year contract with the MOD to provide input in the detailed design for the new Ship Submersible Nuclear AUKUS (SSN-A) submarine, which will replace the Astute Class in the UK Royal Navy and is planned to be the design on which the Australian Navy builds its future fleet. Ensuring that future support is properly considered at the design stage is expected to result in increased availability throughout the life of the submarine.</p><p>The Major Infrastructure Programme (MIP), to modernise submarine infrastructure across Devonport, ramped up further during the period, driving strong revenue growth. In November 2023, we signed a four-year \u00a3750 million contract to secure the capability required to support and sustain the UK's submarines for decades to come. The upgraded dockyard facilities will support all current and future UK submarine classes as the fleet progresses through a multi-year class transition, including commencement of deep maintenance of the Astute Class in the next few years. In the period, the first Astute boat to undergo in-dock maintenance at Devonport arrived for surveying works ahead of its programme of work.</p><p>In Poland, we finalised the design licence agreement with the PGZ-MIECZNIK consortium, which allows for the build of three frigates for the Polish Navy. First steel-cut for MIECZNIK ship one was held at the PGZ shipyard in Gdynia in August. We also signed a framework agreement as the next step to a potential joint venture which could see Babcock support MIECZNIK through the complete design and build programme. The agreement further strengthens our strategic partnership with the Polish Armaments Group PGZ SA, one of the largest defence groups in Europe, supporting ambitions for wider international naval and defence opportunities.</p><p>Multiple new international contracts are driving growth in the Land sector. Ramp up of the Australian Defence High Frequency Communication System (DHFC) programme almost doubled our Australian Land revenues compared to HY23. In France, we were awarded a second Land contract to provide in-service support to airfield support equipment throughout France's national and international military bases for seven years. In July, we were awarded an initial 12-month contract from the MOD to support UK-gifted platforms to Ukraine, covering the provision of operational support to armoured vehicles, training of Ukrainian personnel and management of vital equipment, supply chains and spares. After the period end, we opened an office in-country where a dedicated team will focus on supporting Ukraine and our industry partners.</p><p>Positioning for the longer-term growth - the right capabilities in a supportive market</p><p>Our long-term growth strategy is to leverage our technical capability to grow our defence business, both internationally and in the UK. We have made excellent progress in the period, establishing a number of strategic relationships that position the Group for longer-term opportunities.</p><p>In Marine, we signed a wide-ranging strategic cooperation agreement with Saab, including the development of an advanced naval corvette design. The joint development will benefit from Babcock's expertise in platform design and integration, to create a new class- leading capability, and Saab's expertise in naval combat management systems and composite structures.</p><p>In Nuclear, discussions continue with the UK Submarine Delivery Agency (SDA) and the Royal Navy with the intention to finalise a long- term strategic partnership to ensure the stable, safe, effective and efficient delivery of deep and base maintenance of submarines. We expect to replace current commercial arrangements, currently under the Future Maritime Support Programme (FMSP), by March 2025.</p><p>In recognition of increasing long-term capacity requirements in the Nuclear sector, we launched the Babcock Skills Academy at Devonport to enhance our growing workforce's capabilities. Focusing on submarine support and critical nuclear expertise, the Skills Academy's training facilities enable learning of the complex requirements to perform submarine deep maintenance. More than 2,000 people are expected to pass through the Academy in its first three years and a further 10,000 over the following five years.</p><p>We have entered into a strategic agreement with US-based HII to collaborate on naval and civil nuclear decommissioning and construction opportunities in the UK and US. Under a memorandum of understanding both companies will apply their complementary capabilities to existing nuclear decommissioning contracts for US ships and UK submarines, as well as explore opportunities for cooperation in civil nuclear, including power plant and component design, fabrication and construction in North America and the UK.</p><p>We have already built on the HII agreement above, with a further agreement to combine forces in Australia to develop the optimal models for submarine capability to support the long-term ambitions of the AUKUS programme, including infrastructure, sustainment and the necessary skills development to support the future programme.</p><p>The Land sector is leading the strategy to strengthen our data capabilities in defence with a new data platform aimed at transforming, capturing, integrating, modelling and building data-driven solutions across all areas of our defence business. For example, in our Land DSG support contract, we are combining this smart data approach with our deep engineering expertise to improve fleet availability and real time identification of any issues throughout the asset lifecycle.</p><p>In Aviation, Babcock France announced an MOU with light jet company AERALIS to explore the operation of a flexible aircraft 'as a service' in support of March's UK France Joint Leaders Declaration on Anglo-French interoperability of future air systems.</p><p>Underpinned by enhanced execution and risk reduction</p><p>We made further progress in the period improving operational delivery, which was underpinned by a strengthened corporate culture. In October, our second Group-wide people survey since we began our turnaround saw increased levels of engagement and satisfaction. Following the first survey in 2022 we have been developing and implementing action plans to transform the employee experience, including the launch of a framework to standardise role categorisation and open development pathways and career opportunities across the Group.</p><p>There is still much to do, but I believe we are creating a more integrated, unified and aligned workforce with common purpose and common processes that will support significant value creation in the future.</p><p>We continue to see improved operational delivery across existing contracts, for example the 10-year DSG contract to support the British Army land vehicles fleet, where an overhaul of operations over the last few years has further improved contract delivery and operating margin. Following formal notification by our UK MOD customer of its intention to exercise up to five option years, we continue to negotiate contract terms that will contribute to better outcomes for all stakeholders.</p><p>There was no material change in the period in the impact of onerous contracts, which will diminish over the coming years as they trade out. We continue to focus on replacing them with higher quality orders through our enhanced bidding and programme risk management processes, as highlighted by the new initial submarine deep maintenance support contract for the second Vanguard Class nuclear submarine.</p><p>We continue to meet production milestones on the Type 31 programme with the first in class ship, HMS Venturer, progressing through construction and assembly, and the keel laid on ship two, HMS Active, in September. The dispute resolution process (DRP) relating to the Type 31 contract has been paused following customer discussions. Both parties are currently working towards a collaborative solution.</p><p>During the period we were pleased to announce the appointment to the Board of Sir Kevin Smith CBE as a Non-Executive Director. In addition, Paul Armstrong was appointed CEO of our Marine business and Harry Holt was appointed CEO of our Nuclear business.</p><p>Capital allocation - dividend reinstated</p><p>In our FY23 results, we set out a refreshed capital allocation framework underpinned by a commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, with a target leverage of 1.0x to 2.0x net debt to EBITDA. The framework is aligned with our strategy to maximise value for our shareholders while balancing near-term performance and long-term growth objectives.</p><p>As part of our capital allocation strategy, in April 2023, the Board stated its intention to reinstate a dividend in FY24, with the return to the dividend payers' list an important milestone in the turnaround of Babcock. As such, the Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.7pence per share, with the interim dividend expected to be around one third of the full year dividend.</p><p>The Group's aim is to deliver long-term dividend growth via a progressive dividend. The level at which the dividend has been reinstated also reflects a desire for there to be ongoing strengthening of the balance sheet and for prioritisation to be given to investment for organic growth in the business.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>With over 90% of FY24 forecast revenue under contract at the end of September, we enter the second half of the year with good momentum. The Board's expectations for another year of organic revenue growth, further underlying operating margin expansion and positive cash flow generation are unchanged, and we continue to build momentum to achieve the medium term guidance set out within our FY23 results.</p><p>David Lockwood OBE Chief Executive</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.babcockinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Babcock-HY24-results-statement-14.11.23.pdf\">https://www.babcockinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Babcock-HY24-results-statement-14.11.23.pdf</url></p><p>BAE Systems (LSE: BA)</p><p>About BAE Systems</p><p>At BAE Systems, our advanced defence technology protects people and national security, and keeps critical information and infrastructure secure.

(the Company) presents this half-year update in relation to the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group).</p><p>The update covers some of the highlights of the first half of 2021 including details of the Group's performance, response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other major developments across the Group.</p><p>Performance update</p><p>Revenue for the ongoing Group continued the strong trajectory with which we exited 2020, growing by 13% in the first half of 2021. EBITDA before one-offs grew by 23%, reflecting our strengthened management teams' sharp focus on delivering value.</p><p>Operating cash generation was good and in line with the growth in business performance. Cash generation and the proceeds from the sale of our Mission Systems and Aero Connectivity businesses has enabled us to significantly reduce the Group's debt in the first half of the year.</p><p>COVID-19</p><p>The Group's businesses have proven resilient to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant proportion of the Group's revenue comprises relatively protected defence and government-based revenue where the impact of COVID-19 has been minimal, if any. For those businesses that do have exposure to areas that have been impacted by COVID-19, such as commercial aerospace, there has been some drop in demand and knock-on effects, but this has generally been limited and towards the end of the reporting period there were encouraging signs of improvement in these areas.</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have monitored employee health and safety, introduced social distancing at our sites as well as other health protection measures, in each case in accordance with government guidelines and local requirements. We have also regularly monitored customer demand and supplier availability. These actions have helped ensure that we have not suffered any major disruption across our operations.</p><p>Business highlights</p><p>CAES</p><p>CAES (formerly Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions), a leading provider of Radio Frequency (RF) technologies and related mission critical electronic solutions, together with SWISSto12, the leading provider of 3D printed technology in the defence sector, launched a strategic alliance on 6 April 2021 to enable CAES to bring additive manufacturing and 3D printing technology to US customers. The alliance granted CAES exclusive license to SWISSto12's patents and product designs for the US market. CAES and SWISSto12 will work together with US customers on new designs to meet the high performance requirements of future missions.</p><p>Cobham SATCOM</p><p>Cobham SATCOM, the market-leading provider of radio and satellite communications solutions to the maritime industry, announced on 15 June 2021 the launch of its new SAILOR XTRTM antenna platform. The SAILOR 1000 XTR Ku is the first of a new generation of software-controlled antenna systems designed for quick deployment, operational reliability, simplicity, and best-in-class RF performance.</p><p>Developed and designed by Cobham SATCOM, SAILOR XTRTM integrates the best of the SAILOR VSAT technology into a new platform with cutting-edge software and electronic capabilities that prepare it to operate in future satellite constellations in various orbits. The one-metre antenna has a new simplified and robust pedestal for better antenna performance and easier and simpler conversion between Ku- and Ka-bands.</p><p>Aviation Services</p><p>Cobham Aviation Services Australia welcomed a new Bombardier Q400 twin turboprop aircraft to its fleet in April 2021 and, in May 2021, its latest Embraer E190 jet joined the family.</p><p>The E190 provides increased passenger comfort with more space and a wider aisle. It also offers substantially better operational uplift performance, particularly in hot weather at regional ports such as in the Pilbara in the north of Western Australia, as well as being able to fly further distances compared to aircraft of a similar size. This reduces the need for additional fuel uplift in remote locations and also cuts CO2 emissions by up to 15 per cent per trip.</p><p>Corporate transactions</p><p>Offer for Ultra Electronics Holdings plc</p><p>On 25 June 2021 the Group confirmed that it was considering a possible combination with Ultra Electronics Holdings plc (Ultra). At that time, there was no certainty that any combination would result or that an offer would be made for Ultra.</p><p>Although not covered by the period to which this half-year update relates, on 16 August Cobham Ultra Acquisitions Limited, a newly-incorporated company which is an indirect subsidiary of Cobham Group Holdings Limited (the indirect parent company of the Company), announced a recommended all cash offer for Ultra (the Acquisition). Completion of the Acquisition is subject to various shareholder, regulatory and other approvals and the Acquisition is expected to become effective in Q1 2022.</p><p>Business disposals</p><p>The Group completed the disposal of its Aero Connectivity business to Transdigm Group Inc. in two tranches, on 6 January 2021 and 12 February 2021, following the signing of sale and purchase agreement in relation to that business on 24 November 2020.</p><p>The Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton) on 31 January 2021 for the sale of its Mission Systems business for a base consideration of $2,830,000,000 (subject to customary adjustments). Completion of the transaction occurred on 1 June 2021.</p><p>On 7 June 2021, the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Naxicap Opportunities XV FPCI and Naxicap Investment Opportunities II S.L.P. FPS (Naxicap) for the sale of its Slip Rings business to Naxicap subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and for base cash consideration of approximately \u20ac186,000,000 (subject to customary adjustments).

First quarter revenues came in towards the bottom end of our previous guidance range, while organic revenue growth was slightly below the bottom end of our guidance range.</p><p>Net income was $103 million, or 2.8% of sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $282 million, or 6.8% of sales, in the prior year quarter. EBIT was $139 million or 3.7% of sales. Net income and EBIT in the quarter included the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets of $104 million, restructuring costs of $33 million, gain on disposition of $29 million, a merger related indemnification charge of $10 million, and transaction, separation, and integration costs of $2 million. Excluding these items, Adjusted EBIT margin was 7.0% in the first quarter, a reduction of 100 bps as compared to the prior year quarter.</p><p>Diluted earnings per share was $0.43 and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.75 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share were adversely impacted by investments and higher costs, a slower than anticipated ramp of our cost optimization efforts, unfavorable currency fluctuations, and higher than expected tax expense, partially offset by lower interest expense and share count.</p><p>On a trailing twelve months basis, the company delivered a book to bill of 1.06x.</p><p>During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $266 million.</p><p>Financial Information by Segment</p><p>GBS segment revenue was $1,758 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, down 6.8% compared to the prior year period and up 2.8% on an organic basis. The GBS performance was driven by strong growth in the Analytics &amp; Engineering business, where revenue increased 15.7% on an organic basis. GBS segment profit was $210 million and segment profit margin was 11.9%, down 250 bps compared to prior year, due to investments and higher costs and the costs related to the exit of our business in Russia. GBS bookings for the quarter were $1.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.98x, and 1.17x on a trailing twelve months basis.</p><p>GIS segment revenue was $1,949 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, down 13.5% compared to the prior year period, and down 7.2% on an organic basis. GIS segment organic revenue performance improved slightly, due to a lower level of declines in Security and Modern Workplace revenues, which declined by 0.3% and 16.1% on an organic basis, respectively.

Net earnings in the third quarter of 2023 were $1.7 billion, or $6.73 per share, compared to $1.8 billion, or $6.71 per share, in the third quarter of 2022. Cash from operations was $2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2022.</p><p>\"Our third quarter results were at or above our expectations across the board, generating $2.5 billion of free cash flow, with nearly 100% returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\" said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Jim Taiclet. \"Our backlog remains robust at $156 billion as both domestic and international orders were strong. Moreover, our 21st Century Security strategy is resulting in new business successes, including the award of the transformational AIR6500 integrated air and missile defense program by the Australian Defence Force, which will serve as a blueprint for future joint all-domain operations worldwide.</p><p>Looking ahead, we'll continue to pursue our strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrence through collaboration with our customers and tech and aerospace industry partners, and expanding our international business and operations. This strategy is designed to drive growth in our traditional platforms and systems, augmented with digital service revenues over time, which in turn will support our dynamic capital allocation process

Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the company's contracts. Increases in profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.</p><p>The company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 19% and 24% of total segment operating profit in the quarters ended September 24, 2023 and September 25, 2022.</p><p>Aeronautics</p><p>View News Release Full Screen</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"11\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_18\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col11\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>(in millions)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col4\"><p>Quarters Ended</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\" nameend=\"col10\" namest=\"col8\"><p>Nine Months Ended</p></entry><entry colname=\"col11\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>Sept. 24,</p><p>2023</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>Sept. 25,</p><p>2022</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>Sept. 24,</p><p>2023</p></entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"><p>Sept. 25,</p><p>2022</p></entry><entry colname=\"col11\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Net sales</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>$ 6,717</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>$ 7,089</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>$ 19,861</p></entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"><p>$ 19,352</p></entry><entry colname=\"col11\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Operating profit</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>671</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>759</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>2,064</p></entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"><p>2,051</p></entry><entry colname=\"col11\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Operating margin</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>10.0 %</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"><p>10.7 %</p></entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"><p>10.4 %</p></entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"><p>10.6 %</p></entry><entry colname=\"col11\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col11\" namest=\"col1\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Aeronautics' net sales in the third quarter of 2023 decreased $372 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2022.

The operational milestones, both in France and internationally, have all been met. Among the most striking illustrations, we are proud to have launched the Suffren, the first next-generation SSN, and to have cut the first metal sheet for the defence and intervention frigate (FDI), a digital frigate intended for the French Navy. Internationally, we have delivered the Khanderi to the Indian Navy but also signed the design contract for the Australian Future Submarine program. We are benefiting from a dynamic market situation and, despite increasingly fierce competition, we won bids for more than twenty ships in five new countries. We also play a pivotal role in European alliances and have set up Naviris, a joint company with Fincantieri, our long-standing Italian partner. Our operational and financial performance enables us to guarantee our ability to finance the future long-term growth of the company.\"</p><p>Frank Le Rebeller, Senior Executive Vice President Finance, Legal, Purchasing and Real Estate, added: \"Order intake in 2019 reached record levels. The results for the 2019 reporting period (produced according to IFRS standards and in particular the IFRS 15 standard since 2018), for the fifth consecutive year, show progress in sales, which stand at 3.7 billion euros, along with an improvement of operating profitability, which has shown a steady increase since 2015 and this year reached 7.6%. Consolidated net income (group share) amounts to nearly 190 million euros, thus raising our equity to 1.2 billion euros. These results are slightly over than our targets. They reflect a solid financial situation, more particularly characterised by levels of profitability in line with our targets and a robust level of equity that has been reconstituted over the past four years. We continued our overall investment efforts, which increased to nearly 480 million euros, in particular in innovation, R&amp;D and digitisation. Our development is creating significant need for recruitment and in 2019 we welcomed 1,500 new colleagues.\"</p><p>Order intake: 5.3 billion euros (+44% vs 2018), including 3 billion internationally, raising the order book to 15 billion euros</p><p>The order intake over the 2019 reporting period amounts to 5.3 billion euros, boosting the order book which now stands at 15 billion euros. Orders recorded in France and overseas for the 2019 reporting period benefited all sectors. In France, in new construction, the main notifications concerned the sixth nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSN) for the Barracuda program. The main contract awarded for new constructions internationally is the program for twelve minehunters and their toolboxes for the Belgian and Dutch navies. Finally, regarding services, several multi-year availability contracts were notified, notably the routine maintenance contract for the ballistic-missile submarines (SSBN) for 2020-2025, as well as the maintenance contract for the Egyptian Navy.</p><p>For the year 2019, the book-to-bill ratio (order intake divided by sales), which measures the order book's renewal rate, stands at 1.4, and at 1.2 for the past three years.</p><p>Activity: increased sales</p><p>The consolidated sales amount to 3,712 million euros. Its 3% increase over 2018 was driven by the major national programs, mainly the Barracuda program, the multimission frigates program and the defence and intervention frigates program. The Australian program also contributed to Naval Group sales. Finally, services represented a key component, with a 41% share. For France, they include in-service support for first rank surface ships and nuclear submarines of the French Navy. Internationally, they include the periodic docking for maintenance of the Malaysian submarines, as well as the adaptation and modernisation of the  Bouchard  corvette for the Argentinian Navy, delivered two months ahead of schedule.</p><p>Profitability: significant growth of EBITA and operating profit</p><p>EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation) totalled 282 million euros. Its progress compared to 2018 drives an increase in operating profitability, which has risen from 7.4% in 2018 to 7.6% in 2019, placing Naval Group as the leader of the naval defence sector in Europe.</p><p>This progression shows the operational improvement of all naval programs and the effectiveness of the improvement plans undertaken for over five years.</p><p>Group net income is 188.2 million euros, up by almost 10 million euros compared to 2018. This result increases the group's consolidated equity to 1.2 billion euros.</p><p>Strong prospects for 2020</p><p>In 2019, Naval Group hired more than 1,500 new staff, taking the group's total workforce to more than 15,000, presenting an increase of nearly 10% compared to 2018 levels. This trend will continue thanks in particular to numerous initiatives such as the opening of the arrangement designer school on the Cherbourg site and the Naval Industries Campus, which has been launched last November by the French Minister for Education.</p><p>Naval Group is also accelerating its investments, worth nearly 480 million euros, specifically targeting open and collaborative innovation, the development of international activities and trade relations, as well as industrial and IT equipment.</p><p>Lastly, thanks to its increased capacity to invest, Naval Group will pursue the internationalisation of its activity. This deployment will more specifically be driven by Naviris, its joint-venture with Fincantieri, which will allow a joint response to some calls for tender and sharing of R&amp;D activities for surface ships.</p><p>The prospects for 2020 are robust, with expected sales growth of about 5% and a rise in consolidated net income (group share) of about 10%.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.naval-group.com/en/news/naval-group-achieves-a-record-level-of-orders-in-2019/\">https://www.naval-group.com/en/news/naval-group-achieves-a-record-level-of-orders-in-2019/</url></p><p>Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN)</p><p>About Raytheon</p><p>Raytheon Company is a technology and innovation leader specializing in defense, civil government and cybersecurity solutions.

When we provide our expectation for adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS from continuing operations and expected cash flow from operations) is not available without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of items for exclusion from the GAAP measure (such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures and other structural changes). We are unable to address the probable significance of this information, the variability of which may have a significant impact on future GAAP results. See \"Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p>Portfolio Realignment</p><p>On track to surpass all merger-related goals, the company plans to strengthen its market position and generate additional revenue and technology synergies by realigning its business units.

This was driven by continued revenue growth coupled with early transformation benefits, notably commercial optimisation and cost efficiencies across the Group. Civil Aerospace's operating margin was 12.4% versus (3.4)% in the prior period due to higher aftermarket profitability and increased large spare engine sales, coupled with cost efficiencies and our commercial optimisation actions. The 13.6% Defence operating margin reflected strong revenue growth and cost efficiencies. Power Systems' margin of 7.0% was lower than the prior period but we expect better performance in the second half of the year because of pricing actions, cost efficiencies and seasonally higher volumes. Losses increased in New Markets as expected due to planned growth activities.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Stronger cash flow: Free cash flow from continuing operations of \u00a3356m compared to an outflow of \u00a3(68)m in the prior period. Underlying operating profit improved from \u00a3125m to \u00a3673m in the period. A long-term service agreement (LTSA) balance change of \u00a3727m (2022 H1: \u00a3433m) reflected large EFH (engine flying hour) growth to 83% of 2019 levels and our commercial optimisation actions, notably increased pricing and the anticipated collection of overdue debts that had previously been provided against. A portion of our LTSA receipts are payable to our RRSPs (risk and revenue sharing partners), which reduces the amount of cash retained. Of the total LTSA balance growth of \u00a3727m, c.\u00a30.5bn benefited our cash flows in the period. Working capital was an outflow of \u00a3(576)m in the first half of the year (2022 H1: \u00a3(269)m), mainly driven by a \u00a3(0.6)bn outflow from higher inventories as a result of supply chain challenges and to satisfy volume growth in the second half of 2023. Net debt improved to \u00a32.8bn (2022 FY \u00a33.3bn).

Capital. The acquisition will increase the scale, breadth and capability of Serco's North American defence business and will give Serco a strong platform from which to address all major segments of the US defence services market. The acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and will be funded through existing debt facilities; it is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals.</p><p>Financial details</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    In calendar year 2021 WBB is expected to generate revenue of around $230m (\u00a3168m), EBITDA of $29m (\u00a321m) and UTP of $28m (\u00a320m), before exceptional transaction and integration costs.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    We expect WBB to be immediately accretive to earnings following completion and to enhance Underlying EPS by around 10% in 2022, the first full year of ownership.

Including the effect of this transaction, as well as the acquisition of Facilities First Australia and the share purchases announced in December, we expect our leverage to be around 1.6x at H1 2021, and decrease thereafter.

It will approximately double Serco's revenues across both the US Army and Air Force/Space Force, giving us ~$100m businesses in each. It will give us immediate access to markets that are difficult to enter organically including Air Force programme offices, the Missile Defense Agency, Space and Missile Defense Command, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, security agencies and others.     </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>      Capability  : WBB brings significant new areas of capability to Serco's global defence business, including Advanced Data Analytics, Organisation Design, Cyber, AI &amp; Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Wargaming, Modelling, and technologies related to geo-location. Among its 1,000 employees, 80% of whom have security clearances, it has around 200 \"Subject Matter Experts\" many of whom are former senior US military officers who are recognised experts in their fields. We believe we can offer these services to our existing customers in US defence and elsewhere.     </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Commenting on the acquisition, Rupert Soames, Serco Group Chief Executive, said: \"Growing the scale, reach and capability of Serco in the largest defence market in the world is one of our strategic objectives, and the acquisition of WBB significantly advances that strategy. Following the acquisition of the Naval Systems Business Unit of Alion in 2019, which increased the size of our US Navy business by 70%, WBB takes our North American defence revenues to around $1.1bn and gives us credible positions in other parts of the market including Air Force, Space Force, Army, the Missile Defense Agency and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. It creates a powerful platform for future growth and brings us impressive new capabilities in areas such as Advanced Data Analytics, AI &amp; Machine Learning and Precision Navigation and Timing, along with a team of renowned Subject Matter Experts covering a wide range of disciplines that can be deployed across our business. I greatly look forward to welcoming the WBB management team led by their CEO Robert Olsen along with 1,000 skilled WBB people to Serco and working with them and other colleagues as we build a strong global defence business.</p><p>The acquisition will be immediately accretive to our margins and to our earnings per share, and the recent strong cash performance allows us to execute this acquisition within our existing debt facilities whilst staying well within our target leverage ratio.\"</p><p>Notes</p><p>Historic financial data: In 2019, the last full year of audited accounts, revenue of WBB was $114m, EBITDA $9m, UTP $9m and gross assets were $170m. There were two acquisitions made in the final quarter of 2019, with the income statement including a contribution only for the period of ownership. In 2020, revenue was $212m, EBITDA $29m and UTP $28m.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.serco.com/media-and-news/2021/acquisition-of-leading-us-defence-business\">https://www.serco.com/media-and-news/2021/acquisition-of-leading-us-defence-business</url></p><p>3/8/2023</p><p>Serco Group plc half year results 2023</p><p>Partnering with governments to deliver positive impact drives growth in first half.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_39\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Six months ended 30 June</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>2023</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>2022</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>Change at reported currency</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>Change at constant currency</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Revenue(1)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>\u00a32,472m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>\u00a32,178m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>13%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>11%</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Underlying operating profit(2)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>\u00a3148m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>\u00a3130m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>14%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><p>9%</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Reported operating profit(2)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>\u00a3188m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>\u00a3123m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>52%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Underlying earnings per share (EPS), diluted(3)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>9.40p</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>7.71p</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>22%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Reported EPS (i.e. after exceptional items), diluted</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>12.96p</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>7.41p</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>75%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Dividend per share (recommended)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>1.14p</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>0.94p</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>21%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Free cash flow(4)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>\u00a398m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>\u00a396m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>3%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Adjusted net debt(5)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>\u00a3216m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>\u00a3164m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>32%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Reported net debt(6)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>\u00a3654m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>\u00a3596m</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>10%</p></entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Highlights</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Revenue: grew by 13% to \u00a32.5bn, organic revenue growth of 6%   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Underlying operating profit: increased by 14% to \u00a3148m, a margin of 6.0%   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Underlying earnings per share: increased by 22% to 9.40p   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Free cash flow: strong at \u00a398m, underlying operating profit cash conversion of 92%   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Adjusted net debt: better than previous guidance at \u00a3216m; covenant leverage of 0.9x EBITDA   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Order intake: at \u00a32.1bn.

Airplanes third quarter revenue increased to $7.9 billion driven by higher 787 deliveries (Table 4). Operating margin of (8.6) percent also reflects lower 737 deliveries as well as abnormal costs and period expenses, including research and development.</p><p>On the 737 program, during the quarter a supplier non-conformance was identified on the aft pressure bulkhead section of certain 737 airplanes. This is not an immediate safety of flight issue and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely. Near-term deliveries and production will be impacted as the program performs necessary inspections and rework, and the company now expects to deliver 375-400 airplanes this year. On production, suppliers are continuing with planned rate increases, and the company expects to complete the final assembly transition to 38 per month by year-end, with plans to increase to 50 per month in the 2025/2026 timeframe. The estimated cost associated with performing the rework is immaterial and included in third quarter results.</p><p>The 787 program is now transitioning production to five per month and plans to increase to 10 per month in the 2025/2026 timeframe. The program still expects to deliver 70-80 airplanes this year.</p><p>During the quarter, Commercial Airplanes booked 398 net orders, including 150 737 MAX 10 airplanes for Ryanair, 50 787 airplanes for United Airlines, and 39 787 airplanes for Saudi Arabian Airlines.

Aircraft Corporation</p><p>The Public Joint Stock Company United Aircraft Corporation (PJSC UAC) was established pursuant to a Russian President's Decree dated February 20th, 2006 (its former name, before 2015,was OJSC UAC).</p><p>The priority activity areas of PJSC UAC and its member companies are: development, production, sales, operational support, warranty and servicing, modernization, repair, and disposal of civil and military aircraft.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uacrussia.ru/en/corporation/\">https://www.uacrussia.ru/en/corporation/</url></p><p>History</p><p>PJSC UAC was established in accordance with RF Presidential Decree No. 140 dated February 20, 2006 \"On Joint-Stock Company United Aircraft Corporation\" for the protection and development of the scientific and industrial potential of the Russian aircraft industry, the security and defense of the state, and the concentration of intellectual, industrial, and financial resources to implement long-term aviation programs.</p><p>At present, UAC encompasses about 30 enterprises and is one of the largest players on the global aviation market. Companies within the structure of the Corporation hold rights to such world-famous brands as \"Sukhoi,\" \"MiG,\" \"IL,\" \"Tu,\" \"Yak,\" \"Beriev,\" as well as the new SSJ 100 and MS-21 brands.</p><p>Priority activity areas of the Corporation are the design, production, testing, operation, warranty and service maintenance of aircraft for civil and military purposes. UAC companies work in the spheres of the modernization, repair and disposal of aircraft, as well as the training and qualification-upgrading of flight crews.</p><p>To date, the largest share in the production structure consists of military products both for the RF Ministry of Defense and foreign customers. From 2013 onwards, the bulk of military-equipment deliveries are bound for the domestic market.</p><p>In 2013, nine aircraft repair plants of the RF Ministry of Defense were transferred to UAC. As a result, in 2014, the serviceability of the RF Air Force fleet increased from 40% to 65%.</p><p>UAC seeks to increase the proportion of civil aviation in its sales structure, primarily by ramping-up SSJ100 serial production and launching the production of its prospective MS-21aircraft family. A significant backlog of orders for both these products ensures uninterrupted utilization of UAC's production capacities in the mid-term.</p><p>The Corporation's assets are located in various regions of Russia, and there are joint ventures with foreign partners operating in India and Italy. In total, UAC's enterprises employ more than 98,000 people.</p><p>According to UAC's long-term development strategy through 2025, it is planned to quadruple revenue to RUB 900 bln, reaching a sales-profitability level in terms of net profit of no less than 10%.</p><p>UAC's priorities include the top-quality, timely execution of contracts under State Defense Order, development of effective, full-scope international cooperation with foreign aviation companies, as well as formation of technology advancements for the promotion of domestic products on the world market.</p><p>In April 2015, the Company changed its full name to Public Joint-Stock Company \"United Aircraft Corporation\" (PJSC UAC).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uacrussia.ru/en/corporation/history/\">https://www.uacrussia.ru/en/corporation/history/</url></p><p>Consolidated Financial Statements 31 December 2016</p><p>3 April 2017</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uacrussia.ru/upload/iblock/e72/e72b4c35b8e6c3ac6f39c84343d0feb7.pdf\">https://www.uacrussia.ru/upload/iblock/e72/e72b4c35b8e6c3ac6f39c84343d0feb7.pdf</url></p><p>Uralvagonzavod</p><p>Joint-Stock Company Uralvagonzavod Scientific Industrial Corporation named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky</p><p>JSC Uralvagonzavod Scientific Industrial Corporation is an integrated structure uniting industrial enterprises, research institutes and design bureaus. These are well-known developers and manufacturers of artillery, armored vehicles, rolling stock, light rail vehicles, road construction and other equipment. The corporation has powerful technical and intellectual potential.</p><p>The integrated structure is headed by Uralvagonzavod (Nizhny Tagil). For many years, the company has been a leader in domestic freight railway engineering. Known in the world as a manufacturer of armored vehicles.</p><p>The birthday of Uralvagonzavod is considered October 11, 1936, when the first freight gondola cars rolled off its assembly line. Today, one of the largest research and production complexes in Russia includes metallurgical, car assembly, mechanical assembly, mechanical repair, tool and other industries that allow for a closed production cycle. Four design bureaus, including the head one in the freight car building industry, and two institutes enable the corporation to master modern technologies, successfully develop and introduce new models of vehicles and special equipment into serial production.</p><p>In the ongoing full-scale reconstruction of production, the corporation cooperates with leading domestic and world companies. For these purposes, from one and a half to two billion rubles of own and borrowed funds are invested annually. Dynamically developing, the Uralvagonzavod achieved stability, which also allows it to successfully follow the planned course in times of crisis.</p><p>The general partners of Uralvagonzavod are the largest domestic transportation companies, as well as the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and OJSC Rosobornexport.</p><p>According to the American edition of Defense News, the Uralvagonzavod is one of the hundred largest military-industrial complexes in the world.</p><p>Every year, one or two new models of freight rolling stock are put on the conveyor. Among the latest developments of the corporation is a new generation gondola car model 12-196-01 with an axle load of 25 t / s per axle.</p><p>The mission of the company is to improve the quality of life of factory workers. To achieve this, working conditions are actively improving in all structural divisions, and the social sphere is developing - palaces of culture, water and ice sports, a stadium, medical facilities, and recreation facilities.</p><p>At the Uralvagonzavod, a number of socially significant programs are being implemented, covering all aspects of workers' lives. These are the prevention and treatment of diseases, rehabilitation and recreation, including for children, the development of physical education and sports, leisure activities, support for veterans and youth.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://uralvagonzavod.ru/company\">http://uralvagonzavod.ru/company</url></p><p>History</p><p>Largest in the world</p><p>The unique research and production complex of Russia, the largest in the world in terms of production volumes and technological areas, UVZ has always been at the forefront of Russian industry. \"The first in the world, unique, unique ...\" - these words for decades determined the biography of the enterprise.</p><p>The construction of the Uralvagonzavod began in 1931 in the system of the Ural-Kuzbass military-industrial center.</p><p>On October 11, 1936, the first heavy-duty wagons rolled off the assembly line. This day is considered the birthday of the company. In the prewar period alone, the Uralvagonzavod manufactured 35,400 platforms, open wagons (gondolas), and covered wagons. This is twice as much as that of all USSR car building enterprises during the years of the first and second five-year plans.</p><p>In August 1941, by decision of the State Defense Committee, the Ural Tank Plant No. 183 named after Uralvagonzavod and 12 evacuated enterprises was established Comintern. In just 2 months, production was rebuilt to produce military products. Almost every third tank that took part in the hostilities came off the assembly line of the Ural Tank Plant. In total, during the years of the war, 25 thousand combat vehicles were assembled in the UTZ areas. This is more than at all German factories (23 thousand tanks) combined.</p><p>For the contribution to the victory, the team of UTZ No. 183 named after The Comintern was awarded the orders of the Red Banner of Labor (1942), the Red Banner (1943), and World War 1 degree (1945). In 1944, the tank design bureau was awarded the Order of Lenin.</p><p>With the T-34 tank, the domestic tank design school actually began which developed and gained strength within the walls of the Uralvagonzavod. Post-war tanks from T-44 to T-62 preserved the fighting traditions of the \"thirty-four\". Fire, armor, maneuver are embodied in the most massive tank of our time, the T-72, which forms the basis of ground forces in many countries of the world. For its creation and organization of production, Uralvagonzavod was awarded the Orders of Lenin (1970) and the October Revolution (1976).</p><p>The new generation of Russian tanks - the T-90S rocket-cannon tank with reactive armor and an optoelectronic fire suppression system in terms of the combination of combat and technical characteristics, not only does not concede to the best tanks of other countries, but surpasses them in many respects.</p><p>The continuation of the design ideas of the tank builders was the technical support equipment for engineering weapons, which are used not only for the military, but also for peaceful purposes: they help in eliminating the consequences of accidents, catastrophes, earthquakes.</p><p>About 100 thousand units of armored vehicles were produced by UVZ, starting in 1941, and this is an unconditional world record in tank building.</p><p>Today, UVZ is a diversified engineering association that produces about 200 types of products.</p><p>The company also developed in the 1990s. the most modern models of highly efficient road-building and municipal vehicles were introduced into serial production.</p><p>In accordance with the objectives of the priority national project \"Agrarian and Industrial Complex\", UVZ specialists developed and put into mass production the universal cultivating tractor RTM-160. Despite his young age, he already has awards from prestigious exhibitions, and most importantly - he has established himself in the fields of the country.</p><p>UVZ is the largest Russian developer and manufacturer of various types of freight cars, gondola cars, freight carts, and tank containers. They are his calling card. Since 1979, the company switched to the production of all-metal gondola cars. In total, about a million cars for various purposes rolled off the assembly line.</p><p>Cistern construction began with the cryogenic production of the association (created in 1954). UVZ made a significant contribution to the design and manufacture of systems and equipment for launching artificial Earth satellites (starting with the launch of the first on October 4, 1957), and manned orbiting ships, the reusable space system Energia-Buran, and also participated in the international program Marine start\".</p><p>Powerful intellectual and technological potential helps to carry out large-scale projects. A strong scientific school was formed at UVZ, represented by the Ural Design Bureau of Carriage Engineering, the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Engineering, the Ural Scientific and Technological Complex, the Center for Research and Testing of Materials, and other experimental design departments of the all-Russian level.</p><p>UVZ is an enterprise with a high production culture based on established technological and intellectual traditions.</p><p>Today, Uralvagonzavod heads an integrated structure uniting about 40 industrial enterprises, research institutes and design bureaus in five federal districts of Russia and abroad.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://uralvagonzavod.ru/company/history/\">http://uralvagonzavod.ru/company/history/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ACQIST-41593</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACQIST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B70-CYK1-DYYM-R0B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475918</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"42182\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Acquisdata Inc.

He emphasized that they are continuing to burn as expected.</p><p>Fire management</p><p>The Sturgill Fire, in the North Minam Drainage, is burning through mixed conifer forests. This naturally occurring blaze, started by lightning on Monday, Aug. 22, around noon, covered around 4,815 acres as of midday Sept. 1.</p><p>The Nebo Fire, 21 miles southeast of Enterprise near Mount Nebo, is estimated to have started on Aug. 25 from lightning strikes earlier in the week. With a size estimated as 3,086 acres on Sept. 1, the fire has reached the Upper Lick Creek Drainage and is burning in subalpine fir and grass.</p><p>Burks noted that both the Nebo and Sturgill fires are \"doing a lot of good in terms of cleaning up fuels.\"</p><p>According to the national forest's leadership team, they are closely monitoring the conditions of the Nebo Fire, and firefighters are preparing containment features on nearby road and trail systems to protect adjacent structures, including Big Sheep Camp, Lick Creek Guard Station and Indian Crossing Campground.</p><p>Total containment of both fires is expected to occur in late October.</p><p>\"Keeping them in the wilderness is the main objective at this point,\" Burks said.</p><p>Burks understands the concern that arises when it comes to wildfires, but there's a public education component to acknowledge as well. Putting out every forest fire would lead to an unhealthy ecosystem, he said.</p><p>\"These are fire-adaptive ecosystems, and if we suppress every fire, we're just going to have bigger and worse fires,\" he said. \"We're just kicking the can down the road.\"</p><p>Burks explained that a healthy forest contains mature, tall trees without much ground fuel \u2014 lower layer growth such as roots, downed trees, branches, logs and undergrowth. This healthy condition would normally be a result of yearly fires that keep forests \"actively clean.\"</p><p>Due to continued suppression efforts, Burks said, small trees and undergrowth have gotten out of control, making it hard to see through the forest and providing ample fuel for fires. This is where naturally occurring wildfires \u2014 like the Sturgill and Nebo fires \u2014 can come in handy. By allowing these blazes to burn, \"fire breaks\" are created that can help mitigate future fires.</p><p>\"You'll see some intense burning out of these two fires, but afterward you have this area that is more free and open from all that fuel,\" he said.</p><p>Firefighters are working to maintain adjacent private property and inholdings within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest \u2014 including Red's Horse Ranch and Minam River Lodge. The expected fire increase has prompted several trail closures until further notice.</p><p>Fire suppression</p><p>The Double Creek Fire, Burks noted, is a different story. He called the blaze an \"active fire suppression incident\" and noted that full suppression efforts are underway, including air tankers, helicopters, rappel crews and firefighters.</p><p>This fire was first detected on Aug. 30 along Hat Point Road near Grizzly Ridge. The 1,500-acre blaze, which was also likely sparked by lightning, carries more concern because of its proximity to residences.</p><p>As of Thursday, Sept. 1, the fire was at zero percent containment. Almost 130 personnel are working to protect private property and resources threatened by the fire.</p><p>\"It is growing and it'll probably grow today,\" Burkes noted during a Sept. 1 interview. \"But we're working with our partners to put that one out.\"</p><p>Shannon Golden is a reporter for The Observer.

Regarding UPR, Human Rights Watch participated in consultations with other Russian and international NGOs but is not aware of and has not been part of any consultations involving Russian authorities and independent civil society organizations. In 2022, Russian authorities de-registered Human Rights Watch's Russia office, which effectively amounts to a ban on operations in the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This statement focuses on addressing in Russia issues pertaining to the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and attacks on environmental human rights defenders, the rights of older people, the rights of migrant workers and discrimination based on race or ethnicity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On request of the Environmental Crisis Group, which is a Russian initiative to support environmental defenders, but could not attend this session, the section on environmental defenders incorporates information from their UPR submission and recommendations.</p><p>Human Rights Watch's submission on Russia for this UPR fourth cycle also covers several other issues-- pertaining to rights to freedom expression, assembly, and association, as well as the situation for human rights defenders in generalthat were addressed by other members of this panel.</p><p>ISSUE 1: - RIGHT TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS</p><p>During the previous UPR cycle, 25 countries made recommendations to the Russian Federation on human rights defenders in general. These included recommendations to ensure the unrestricted work of civil society and review the current restrictive legal framework, especially the laws on foreign agents, undesirable organizations and extremism in line with its international obligations to ensure that civil society organizations, can exercise their activities without fear of stigmatization or punishment by law; to guarantee the rights to freedom of assembly and association and exercise of the right to freedom of expression, including online, without fear of reprisal; and to ensure effective investigations into all reports of attacks on, or threats against, human rights defenders.</p><p>Ecuador made recommendations to Russia on the right to a healthy environment, specifically to \"sign and ratify the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity in order to guarantee the right to health and to a healthy environment\", while Indonesia recommended to \"step up its efforts to develop social and environmental impact assessments on the enjoyment of human rights prior to issuing licenses for mining and exploitation of natural resources\".[1]</p><p>Russia remains one of the world's top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and is contributing to the climate crisis. The Climate Action Tracker rates Russia's climate targets, policies and finance as \"critically insufficient\" to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.[2]</p><p>Unprecedented forest fires in Siberia and Russia's Far East in 2021 resulted in a loss of over 17 million hectares of forests and trapped several cities in heavy smoke.[3] In 2022, nearly 4 million hectares of forests burned, over half in these regions.[4] A large portion of Russia's forests were explicitly excluded from fire-fighting measures.[5]</p><p>Lack of transparency and inadequacy of environmental impact assessments sparked sustained mass protests in 2018 and 2019 against the construction or expansion of landfills, waste incineration plants, and waste processing plants that protesters believed would be dangerous and could be harmful for their health.[6] In response the government opened administrative and criminal cases against numerous activists accusing them of violation of peaceful assembly rules, resisting police and assaulting private security guards.</p><p>Human rights watchdogs in Russia continue to report physical attacks, harassment, intimidation, and prosecution of grassroots environmental activists and groups. According to the Environmental Crisis Group, during the last three years at least 52 environmental defenders were attacked and injured in varying degrees of severity.[7] The group's submission demonstrates how such attacks continue to go unpunished.[8]</p><p>Environmental defenders are also targeted by authorities using Russia's \"foreign agents\" and \"undesirable organizations\" laws. For example, between April and July 2023, Russian authorities blacklisted five environmental groups including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), [9] thus banning their operations in Russia and potentially putting many Russian environmental defenders at risk, since participation in the activities of an undesirable organization is a criminal offence, punishable by up to four years in prison.[10]</p><p>States should recommend the Russian government to:</p><p>Ensure that environmental defenders, including grassroot activists, can in practice exercise their rights to free expression and peaceful assemblies, without fear of reprisal;</p><p>Follow through on recommendations from previous UPRs including to sign and accede to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity;</p><p>Stop all types of pressure on environmental human rights defenders from the state actors and protect defenders from such pressure by non-state actors (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>Investigate all cases of attacks and threats to environmental human rights defenders and bring the perpetrators to justice (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>Investigate all violations of environmental law, which are associated with attacks on environmental human rights defenders (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>Ensure safe and free work of environmental human rights defenders, including allowing and promoting freedom to seek, receive, and impart information on environmental issues (Recommendation by the Environmental Crisis Group)</p><p>ISSUE 2: RIGHTS OF OLDER PEOPLE</p><p>Bulgaria recommended that the Russian government strengthen the protection of the rights of older people and other vulnerable groups and Uzbekistan recommended that it continue to take measures to defend the rights of older people and people with disabilities.</p><p>The Russian government stated that a systematic program was being developed to improve the quality of life of older persons and to increase life expectancy.[11]</p><p>Human Rights Watch notes that with its aging population growing, Russia has taken positive steps toward reforming services for older people. In 2013, Russia passed a law to ensure that older people have access to a broader range of home services, which can include personal support assistance such as delivery of groceries, payment of bills, food preparation, personal hygiene, or medical services, emergency services, or mental health services. A law that entered into force in 2015 states that services should be tailored to an individual's needs with the goal of enabling older people \"to remain in a familiar and positive living environment.\"</p><p>However, research conducted by Human Rights Watch on the rights of older people in Russia in 2020-2021 found that the Russian government is not providing adequate resources for home-based services for older people, denying some of them the ability to live independent and dignified lives.[12]</p><p>Human Rights Watch's interviews with 20 older people in Pskov and Sverdlovsk regions, as well as with experts and advocates in various parts of Russia, suggest that despite reform efforts, services often do not go far enough to meet the needs of older people to allow them to live at home with dignity.</p><p>Under the law, financing and delivery of home-based services is the responsibility of regional governments. Experts and advocates said at the time that funds were often insufficient to cover the real need for home services, rendering the 2013 law ineffective. Social workers, whose jobs include delivering home-based services to older people, often have heavy caseloads that do not allow them to provide comprehensive services, even if provided for by regional or federal norms. In most cases Human Rights Watch examined in 2020-2021, social workers were unable to carry out services beyond delivery of food and medicine.</p><p>The law also requires older people or their legal representative to request services, meaning that unless older people get adequate information about entitlements, they may not be able to get the support that is available.</p><p>Therefore, states should recommend that the Russian government:</p><p>Ensure that all older people receive the support they need to live at home, if that is their choice, with dignity and autonomy;</p><p>Ensure that regional governments have sufficient funds to provide adequate support services on a long-term basis and improve and standardize training of social workers and other service providers where needed;</p><p>Require service providers to do more outreach to older people to inform them about available services to ensure that those most in need of support can get them;</p><p>Federal and regional governments should improve and expand the types and availability of social services provided to older people and take measures necessary to ensure that sufficient numbers of social workers are available to provide support services for as much time as required.</p><p>ISSUE 3 NON-DISCRIMINATION AND RIGHTS OF MIGRANT WORKERS</p><p>Six states made recommendations to the Russian Federation on migrant rights during the previous UPR cycle, focusing on ratification of the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Honduras) and enhancing the integration of migrants (Vietnam).[13]</p><p>Seventeen states made recommendations pertaining to combatting racial or ethnic discrimination, xenophobia, racial profiling by police; addressing hate speech by officials and the dissemination of negative stereotypes and prejudices by media; and ensuring the protection of minorities and vulnerable groups. [14]</p><p>The Russian Federation claimed that the law already forbids public servants, without exception, from racial profiling and other discrimination on the basis of race. [15]</p><p>However, high-level government officials and politicians and mainstream, state-affiliated and other media continue to routinely engage in anti-migrant and xenophobic actions and rhetoric.[16]</p><p>Racial profiling by law enforcement of migrants of non-Slavic appearance in public spaces and during special operations remains prevalent. Russian police continue to round up and detain en masse migrant workers and non-Slavic Russian nationals whom they apparently presumed by their appearance to be migrants and subject them to prolonged detentions, sometimes in inhumane conditions.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic, the economic downturn, and then the full-scale invasion of Ukraine supercharged these tendencies. Journalists reported that Russian authorities also actively lured and recruited migrant workers to fight in its armed forces[17] and to work on the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia.[18] The reports include allegations of coercion and harassment should migrant workers refuse Russian authorities[19] and threats of criminal prosecution by countries of origin if they fight in Russia's armed forces.[20]</p><p>States should recommend the Russian government to:</p><p>Ensure in practice that racial discrimination and racial profiling of migrants, in particular by law enforcement officials, is not tolerated and is prosecuted;</p><p>Ensure in practice that use of racist and hate speech against migrants by officials and politicians, and the dissemination of negative stereotypes and prejudices by media outlets is not tolerated;</p><p>Sign and accede to Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</p><p>[1] United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Russia, A/HRC/39/13 (June 2018), paras 147.103 and 147.125</p><p>[2] Climate Action Tracker: Russia, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/russian-federation/\">https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/russian-federation/</url></p><p>[3] Yulia Davydova, \"Record breaking fires in Siberia\", Greenpeace, August 18, 2021, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/49171/russia-record-breaking-fires-siberia/\">https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/49171/russia-record-breaking-fires-siberia/</url></p><p>[4] 'Compiled report on forest fires (thermal anomalies) on all territories, based on satellite monitoring data as of September 28, 2022' Federal Budget Institution \"Avialesohrana\" of the Federal Forestry Agency, <url normalizedValue=\"https://public.aviales.ru/main_pages/openform1.shtml?2022-09-28\">https://public.aviales.ru/main_pages/openform1.shtml?2022-09-28</url></p><p>[5] The Order of the Russian Ministry of Nature no.313 dated July 8, 2014, explicitly permitted not to fight fires in so-called \"control zones\" if there was no immediate threat to urban settlements and if cost of firefighting exceeded estimated damages from forest fires.</p><p>As a result, estimated 45 percent of all forest territories in Russia fell within these \"control zones\" and that is where 90 percent of all forest fires burned.

In the process, they made clear just how little they understand the climate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As it stands, there are 45 out-of-control wildfires in Canada\u2014primarily in Nova Scotia, central Quebec, and Northern Alberta. The smoke from those fires is drifting southward, bathing New York and Washington, D.C. in health-threatening smog.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scientists have been warning for years that climate change\u2014not just hotter temperatures, but droughts and more extreme winters\u2014would lead to more intense forest fires. Now that their predictions are coming true, people are grasping for other explanations.</p><p>The fire season has already <url normalizedValue=\"https://natural-resources.canada.ca/climate-change/impacts-adaptations/climate-change-impacts-forests/forest-change-indicators/fire-weather/17776\">lengthened</url>  in some parts of Canada, and government scientists say it will extend by more than a month in large swaths of the country before the end of the century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2021/07/05_Chapter-2-V6.pdf\">anticipates</url>  that wildfires are going to become more intense in the years to come. The panel's sixth assessment report, from 2022, specifically warned that urban dwellers should anticipate 'reduced air quality because of wildfire.'</p><p>The World Meteorological Association's most recent forecast for global temperatures anticipates that the world is set to heat by <url normalizedValue=\"https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=11629\">1.8 degrees Celsius</url>  over preindustrial levels in the coming years. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, envisioned that global greenhouse gas emissions would need to plateau by this year, and decline precipitously by 2030, if the world was to limit warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>But there's a fierce, and large, contingent of deniers of anthropogenic climate change, and a little thing like mass wildfires isn't going to stop them. The main line from the Canadian right is that the burns are the work of criminals and firebugs, and that governments are simply 'blaming the fires on 'climate change' and on the 'climate crisis,'' as Toronto Sun columnist Joe Warmington <url normalizedValue=\"https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-cops-suspect-arson-caused-wildfire-in-at-least-one-part-of-quebec\">wrote</url>  Wednesday. Others, like former NHL player-turned-conspiracy theorist Theo Fleury, have taken the idea a step further, alleging that progressives are weaponizing the fires to force ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TheoFleury14/status/1660107042366058498\">climate lockdowns</url> ' on the masses. Taking that idea even further, right-wing politician Maxime Bernier accused ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MaximeBernier/status/1666079050584973312\">green terrorism</url> ' for starting the fires.</p><p>All this misinformation misses the forest for the (burning) trees.</p><p>Right-wing media outlets have seized on reports that police are investigating arson as a possible cause for these fires. As Warmington wrote in the Sun, 'It's too early to say [whether] the early fires in Quebec were started on purpose or as a result of climate change.'</p><p>The reality, of course, is not an either/or proposition.</p><p>Given that about half of Canada is forested\u2014totaling some 894 million acres\u2014wildfires are a regular occurrence. As of the end of May, Canada was experiencing about 1,800 wildfires across the country: only about 15 percent higher than a normal year.</p><p>There is a litany of causes for these fires, lightning strikes and human negligence being the chief drivers. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-02/Canada_Report_2022_Final.pdf\">half of 2022's forest fires were set by humans</url> , deliberately or accidentally. (They reported 45 fires that were prescribed burns.)</p><p>Yet the 2022 fires were manageable, as the country saw relatively cool temperatures and\u2014in some places\u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/saisons/charts_e.html?season=mam&amp;year=2022&amp;type=p\">heavier-than-normal</url>  rainfall in the spring. When wildfires occurred in some regions of the country that summer, other provinces were able to dispatch resources to help.</p><p>What's different this year is the scale and intensity of the fires. In a normal year, about 230,000 hectares of forest in Canada would have burned by the end of May. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/06/01/canada-wildfires-this-year-have-burned-more-than-2-7-million-hectares_6028775_114.html\">This year</url> , nearly 2.8 million hectares burned. And it's only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-the-wildfires-in-canada-start-cause-nova-scotia-quebec/\">getting worse</url> . The fact that the fires are affecting multiple parts of the country at once means resources are stretched thin.</p><p>This didn't come as a surprise to anyone paying attention. Modeling done by Environment and Climate Change Canada, a government department, predicts the whole country is in for a summer nearly <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.gc.ca/saisons/prob_e.html\">twice as hot</url>  as normal with lower precipitation. Wildfire forecasts, meanwhile, predicted that most of the country would face <url normalizedValue=\"https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/maps/forecasts?type=fsa&amp;month=06\">considerably more severe</url>  conditions than an average year. Those forecasts, unfortunately, seem to be dead on.</p><p>It is certainly true that police in Alberta, Quebec, and Nova Scotia are investigating arson as a possible instigator for some fires. Police in Alberta have laid charges against a man who deliberately <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/9673400/arson-alberta-wildfires-intentionally-set-church/\">set a number of fires</url> , some of which sparked wildfires; those fires, however, were extinguished in early May. Police in Quebec are investigating arson, too, but officials believe <url normalizedValue=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/record-number-of-early-season-wildfires-burning-in-quebec\">lightning strikes</url>  caused the fires in the province's more remote regions. Police in Nova Scotia, meanwhile, have been investigating a series of arsons\u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/pictou-county-fire-arson-rcmp-1.6863542\">mostly burning garbage</url> \u2014but say they are unconnected to the wildfires.</p><p>The idea that wildfires could be blamed on arsonists\u2014or wayward <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/8046556/couple-charged-gender-reveal-wildfire-california/\">gender reveal parties</url> \u2014also cropped up during California's brutal 2021 wildfire season, as well as during <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/world/wildfires-climate-change-arson-explainer-intl/index.html\">blazes in Greece and Algeria</url> . But arson simply fails to explain the increasing intensity of these fires.</p><p>Arson isn't enough of an excuse for some denialists. Some, such as the New York Post 's Miranda Devine, have argued that Canada's climate policies actually caused the fires. The infernos can't be explained by climate change, she argued; rather ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2023/06/07/smoky-new-york-isnt-climate-change-its-bad-forest-management/\">it's bad forest management</url> .' Cherry-picking a few data points, she alleged that 'green ideology and chronic government underfunding mean that the forests currently ablaze have not been managed properly for years.'</p><p>Devine, for example, cited <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590061719300456\">a 2020 paper</url>  in the Progress in Disaster Science journal, correctly noting that researchers warned that insufficient resources were being put towards wildfire preparedness. But Devine declined to cite the portions of the report that specifically lauded Quebec's wildfire management policies, or the section that underscored how 'wildfire impacts are likely to intensify as Canada's climate continues to warm at twice the global warming rate.'</p><p>What's more, following that report and a disastrous 2021 wildfire season, the Canadian government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2022/05/the-government-of-canada-is-committed-to-supporting-canadians-through-the-2022-wildfire-season.html\">budgeted</url>  more than half a billion additional dollars towards wildfire preparedness and forestry management.</p><p>On Fox News, anchor Jesse Waters contended that connections to climate change were fruitless because it wasn't the first time wildfires had raged through Canada's east. Pointing to New England's 'dark day,' when thick smoke blotted out the sun in 1780: 'Can't blame that on climate change, everybody was riding on horses,' Waters argued. (In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/jrnl/2007/nrs_2007_mcmurry_001.pdf\">researchers have found</url> , those exceptional wildfires were probably caused by a combination of drought, fire as a weapon of war, and clear-cutting practices.)</p><p>Waters did correctly note that Canada is experiencing fewer wildfires than years past. That is thanks, in large part, to better fire prevention. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/canada-wildfire-data-change-1.6854186?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar\">Data analyzed by CBC</url> , however, shows that even with fewer fires, more land is being burned. And the trend seems to be intensifying. (There is an argument that Canada has prioritized fire prevention and suppression at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-canadas-massive-wildfires-are-the-result-of-decades-of-bad-decisions/\">expense of clearing dried brush</url> , but that is a matter of some debate.)</p><p>None of these explanations can explain the sheer scope of these blazes. Nova Scotia's wildfires, burning since late May, are now the most intense ever recorded in the province\u2014and they are still <url normalizedValue=\"https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20230608001\">out of control</url> . Quebec's season is, similarly, already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-wildfire-smoke-canada-updates-june-7/\">the worst on record</url> \u2014between 2013 and 2022, about 173,000 acres of forest burned in Quebec. More than 1 million acres of Quebec forest have burned this year alone.</p><p>In other corners of the internet, the attempts to shift blame from climate change have grown even more ridiculous. In 2021, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene caught flack for a Facebook post from a few years earlier, wherein she claimed that 'lasers or blue beams of light' were responsible for raging wildfires in California. She singled out Rothchild Inc., a favorite target of QAnon and anti-Semites, as a possible culprit.</p><p>Not deterred by the ridicule Greene got for her absurd theory, popular far-right conspiracy theorist Stew Peters <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realstewpeters/status/1665867860961378304\">tweeted</url>  to his hundreds of thousands of followers that wildfires erupting in different parts of the country was 'statistically impossible to happen by accident.' Instead, he argued, '[c]learly our governments are targeting us with Directed Energy Weapons.'</p><p>Multiple fires starting within hours or days of each other, of course, is not impossible but the norm. Quebec is used to seeing <url normalizedValue=\"https://sopfeu.qc.ca/en/\">hundreds of fires</url>  start across its expansive territory during the final weeks of May.</p><p>Directed energy weapons\u2014essentially concentrated beams of microwave energy\u2014have thus far only been good for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105868\">shooting down drones in a lab setting</url> . The U.S. Department of Defense is probably a few years away from being able to strap such a weapon to a plan to reign fire down on rural Canada.</p><p>Other viral misinformation has honed in on some more believable theories. One TikTok, viewed nearly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@businesscord56/video/7240978374665981211\">8 million times</url> , shows a helicopter raining sparks down across a dense forest. 'That's how your fire started,' the TikTok text claims. Similar videos have popped up on <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DavidWolfe/status/1666749753579941888\">Twitter</url> .</p><p>In fact, the video shows efforts to get the already-raging fires under control. The process, called <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605\">backburning</url> , attempts to get ahead of the wildfire\u2014creating a barrier at which the fire, hopefully, stops. Fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and, increasingly, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/03/wildfires-drones-controlled-prescribed-burns\">drones</url>  are all deployed to try to do controlled burns to stop the fire from advancing. Officials in Alberta have confirmed that they are using backburning to try and halt the spread of the blazes.</p><p>When commenters pointed out the obvious explanation for the video, the original TikTok poster followed up with a second video showing a drone operating a flamethrower. 'For those saying its backfire,' they wrote. 'You sure bout that?' That video, however, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3_eEO0Cvwg\">was shot in 2021</url>  and has nothing to do with the wildfires.</p><p>That TikTok account, like many advancing some of the most outlandish theories, normally posts conspiratorial and anti-vaccine content. (Peters, for example, produced an entire documentary claiming that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/radio-host-stew-peters-watch-the-water-film-ridiculously-claims-covid-19-is-snake-venom/\">the COVID-19 vaccines contained snake venom</url> .)</p><p>Conspiracy theories tend to feed off each other. In recent years, many believers in COVID-19 conspiracy theories have alleged that governments are lying about the nature of climate change to facilitate the imposition of ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bugeyedandshameless.com/p/the-climate-lockdown-hoedown\">climate lockdowns</url> ,' as former NHL player Fleury wrote on Twitter. 'That's next up on the agenda.'</p><p>Many who ascribe to this idea point to proposals for '15-minute cities' as evidence that governments have a scheme to turn cities into open air prisons.</p><p>Fox News host Jeanine Pirro has fed into this idea, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jeanine-pirro-calls-it-insanity-wear-mask-protect-yourself-wildfire-smoke\">telling viewers on Wednesday</url>  that 'Democrats are pumping up climate hysteria and bringing back, you guessed it, mask insanity.'</p><p>As it stands, carbon dioxide emissions continue growing. It is likely that the world will not just fail to meet that 1.5 degrees Celsius target, but that it will <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/press/dash-for-gas-a-serious-threat-to-the-paris-agreements-warming-limit/\">blast past 2 degrees Celsius</url> \u2014recognized as a tipping point past which destruction to earth's environment may be irreversible.</p><p>So long as the debate continues to obsess over baseless guesswork and absurd alternate explanations, while ignoring the actual climate science, the West will continue blowing past its climate targets. And the fires will keep getting worse.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/08/air-quality-canada-wildfire-smog-fire/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXFP-FOPO133089168626315650225876100092</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOPO-133089</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DS-8VN1-JCMN-Y1FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1978\"/><timeReceived>10:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Forest Protection Bureau is encouraging anyone seeking a fire permit in New Hampshire to use the state's online fire permit system in order to maintain social distancing that has been recommended by the Center for Disease Control as a way of reducing the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>At the same time that individuals are seeking to renew and obtain fire permits this spring, it has become necessary for fire departments to institute measures to protect personnel and citizens from the spread of COVID-19 even while continuing to provide critical services in their respective communities. Agencies are following the CDC guidelines regarding social distancing and adjusting customer access to fire department facilities, which may temporarily impact local permit issuing procedures.</p><p>The Forest Protection Bureau is actively working with forest fire wardens and fire departments throughout the state to both maintain situational awareness and to implement emergency measures that address the spread of COVID-19. This public health emergency has had a significant impact on the workload of local fire departments and emergency responders. Obtaining a fire permit online is an option available for individuals in many communities.</p><p>In New Hampshire, fire permits are required for all outside burning when the ground is not covered with snow. These permits are either issued locally by the appointed forest fire wardens or are available online in many communities. Currently there are 165 communities enrolled in the state's online fire permit system.</p><p>Online burning permits are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://nhdflweb.sovsportsnet.net/\">https://nhdflweb.sovsportsnet.net/</url>. At this website, permit applicants can view the list of enrolled communities; they may also check town or fire department websites to determine if their community is participating and follow the provided link.</p><p>Users whose communities are enrolled establish a user profile on the website. A tutorial provides an overview of the laws and rules associated with each category of permit.

The Jan. 29 episode averaged an impressive 10.1 million viewers. <br/>Even without the benefit of the NFL lead-in,  Fire Country  has been a solid hit for CBS. The show has averaged 8 million viewers per episode since it premiered in October 2022.

Forest Protection Bureau is encouraging anyone seeking a fire permit in New Hampshire to use the state's online fire permit system in order to maintain social distancing that has been recommended by the Center for Disease Control as a way of reducing the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>At the same time that individuals are seeking to renew and obtain fire permits this spring, it has become necessary for fire departments to institute measures to protect personnel and citizens from the spread of COVID-19 even while continuing to provide critical services in their respective communities. Agencies are following the CDC guidelines regarding social distancing and adjusting customer access to fire department facilities, which may temporarily impact local permit issuing procedures.</p><p>The Forest Protection Bureau is actively working with forest fire wardens and fire departments throughout the state to both maintain situational awareness and to implement emergency measures that address the spread of COVID-19. This public health emergency has had a significant impact on the workload of local fire departments and emergency responders. Obtaining a fire permit online is an option available for individuals in many communities.</p><p>In New Hampshire, fire permits are required for all outside burning when the ground is not covered with snow. These permits are either issued locally by the appointed forest fire wardens or are available online in many communities. Currently there are 165 communities enrolled in the state's online fire permit system.</p><p>Online burning permits are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://nhdflweb.sovsportsnet.net/\">https://nhdflweb.sovsportsnet.net/</url>. At this website, permit applicants can view the list of enrolled communities; they may also check town or fire department websites to determine if their community is participating and follow the provided link.</p><p>Users whose communities are enrolled establish a user profile on the website. A tutorial provides an overview of the laws and rules associated with each category of permit. Depending upon the community's pre-determined menu, Category I, II and III permits may be available as well as seasonal Category I and II permits. Each level of permitting is outlined in the system as well as the specifications for fire size, minimum setback from structures and other legal requirements.</p><p>The system provides notification to the forest fire warden, fire departments and fire dispatch centers of a permit location, category and duration. There is a nominal convenience fee assessed for the fire permit when obtained through the online system.</p><p>\"Fire permitting has long been an excellent public safety and fire prevention tool,\" stated Steven Sherman, chief of the Forest Protection Bureau with the Division of Forests and Lands. \"We encourage permit applicants to utilize the online system, especially during this national emergency, to ensure compliance with the fire permit law while helping to protect the health and safety of the public and our first responders.\"</p><p>Part of the N.H. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, the Division of Forests and Lands protects and promotes the value provided by trees, forests and natural communities.

Open burning creates the risk of an escaped fire and puts pressure on emergency personnel. Given that Vermont is currently experiencing community-wide spread of COVID-19, there is a need to minimize any additional pressure on emergency personnel both in terms of response and unnecessary potential contact with people who may have COVID-19.</p><p>To date, very few wildland fires have been reported in Vermont this year. However, April and May are historically the most active months for wildland fires in the state, and most of these fires occur as a result of escaped debris burns. Looking ahead, temperatures are predicted to be above average and precipitation below normal through mid-April. Given these forecasted conditions, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation's Wildland Fire Program anticipates that this spring has the potential to be an active wildland fire season.</p><p>Postponing open burning until conditions improve will eliminate the need for emergency personnel to respond to an unnecessary event. In cases where written permission for an open burn and a site visit are required through a \"Permit to Kindle Fire,\" both the permittee and Town Forest Fire Warden are put at an increased risk of exposure to the virus. Vermont's Town Forest Fire Wardens have the statutory authority to stop issuing burn permits and many fire wardens throughout the state have taken this precautionary step. Please check in with your local Fire Warden and be considerate and patient when assessing the need to conduct any open burning. The Vermont Wildland Fire Program appreciates the public's support in fire prevention and reducing the need for unnecessary emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123600328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YK5-H9R1-JCBF-S115-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"315\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>VERMONT AGENCY OF NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N924120MM</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; RECREATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GS161</classCode><className>VERMONT, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The company also announced additional test flights for Q3 and Q4 2022.</p><p>Sceye's HAPS launched on June 14 at 6:55 AM MDT from the company's hangar at the Roswell International Airport.</p><p>\"Today's test flight holds extraordinary potential for stratospheric discovery,\" said Sceye founder and CEO, Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen.</p><p>\"By maintaining position in the stratosphere for extended periods of time, we can begin realizing the promises of the stratosphere for life on Earth. Universal internet access, methane monitoring, and wildfire detection are all at our fingertips.\"</p><p>Today's launch objectives were to:</p><p>+ Test durability and performance of renewable power systems in the stratosphere</p><p>+ Demonstrate the ability to stay over an area of operation</p><p>+ Maintain a constant float altitude in the stratosphere</p><p>Sceye's HAPS design, in the form of an enhanced balloon, can lift a variety of payloads for connectivity, earth observation, and scientific research. Its hull fabric can manage the extreme environment of the stratosphere, and optimizes strength, helium retention, and thermal management. High-performance batteries and solar panels close the power loop: enough power storage to last until sunrise, and efficient solar cells to collect energy during the day.</p><p>\"We are thrilled to see years of research and development culminating in this milestone moment,\" said David Kim, Sceye's Chief Technology Officer. \"It is the very best application of material science pushing the boundaries of near space.\"</p><p>Chief of Mission Operations, Stephanie Luongo, said, \"This launch is the second of six in our test program this year intended to verify payload and automated flight while ensuring safe operations. We're excited to learn more from upcoming flight tests planned for late summer and fall.\"</p><p>In October 2021, Sceye was the first to connect a Massive MIMO antenna with 3D beamforming from the stratosphere directly to smartphones on the ground over a 140 km distance - a world record in Open RAN. In March 2022, Sceye successfully validated its automated flight software which increases the reliability of its HAPS during its most critical phases of flight - launch and ascent.</p><p>Sceye has partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), New Mexico Economic Development Department, and New Mexico Environment Department on a five-year study to monitor air quality in the State of New Mexico. Sceye's HAPS will track methane emissions with a sub 1-m resolution, allowing them to determine pollution levels as well as pinpoint individual emitters.</p><p>Sceye is a material science company founded in 2014 to unleash the possibilities in the stratosphere by uplifting and connecting all people, and protecting our planet.

While the haze seemed to be lifting by late Monday, enough even to unveil the sun, by Tuesday morning that red blazing ball in the sky said the smoke was all but cleared. The city smelled like a bonfire again on Wednesday. </p><p><br/>Wildfires are burning across Canada, in particular out west, in Quebec and northern Ontario, devastating the communities closest to them and sending windborne smoke to far-off places. Eastern Ontario is being walloped, along with Quebec's north shore and small pockets across the country. <br/>When Julian Aherne saw Environment Canada's air quality warning come through for Peterborough on Sunday, the Trent University associate professor quickly shut his doors and windows. He uses data and modelling to study the impacts of air pollution and other contaminants on natural environments. In other words, he knows exactly what it means when pollution levels jump from well under 20 micrograms per cubic metre of air on any given day, to reading over 150 micrograms \u2014 as they did that night in Peterborough[2]. A couple days later, those figures soared over 180 micrograms per cubic metre locally, and twice that near Ottawa and around Kingston[3], which sat at 455 micrograms per cubic metre of air on Wednesday, June 7. <br/>Photographs of the red-hued sun are sweeping across social media as wildfire smoke descends on southern Ontario. <br/>How dangerous is wildfire smoke? <br/>That high concentration of particulate matter becomes a concern when it's made up of particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less: 'So, small enough to get into your lungs,' Aherne explains. That's where we get the measure of PM2.5 \u2014 particulate matter 2.5 \u2014 as is often cited as a component of air quality warnings, along with ozone and nitrogen dioxide. In high concentrations, like we've been seeing, many, many more of these tiny particles are able to make their way into our lungs. <br/>A concentration of 22 micrograms per cubic metre of air of these tiny particles is about equivalent to smoking one cigarette a day, Aherne says. For the average person, this isn't too significant, but when you consider how that higher concentration of particulate matter might affect children, the elderly and people with existing conditions, it becomes more of a concern. <br/>We also don't know what exactly is in the particulate matter that makes its way deep into our lungs, as it changes depending on the source. 'We only look at the mass and volume. Here's how much is in this volume of air, but that said, with the burning of forest fires, there's trace elements, there's black carbon,' Aherne says. 'We could be receiving lead or mercury from the atmosphere. We don't know the mix.' <br/>But a major component of wildfire smoke is, of course, carbon: burnt wood. <br/>The makeup of particulate matter in wildfire smoke can shift depending on the forest that burns and what those trees have absorbed from the atmosphere. 'If the site was never burnt, it's got a legacy store of woody material to burn. If it's burned frequently, it's relatively clean,' Aherne says. 'If you think of a forest as a large receptacle that's stored up over decades, you've got a richer pool that's going to be reemitted.' <br/>More than 50 forest fires were burning in Ontario on Wednesday, June 7, with well over 100 burning in Quebec. <br/>How did wildfire smoke get to southern Ontario? <br/>Mitch Meredith, a severe weather meteorologist with Environment Canada, was swamped with calls when we spoke this week. The unusual weather \u2014 that is, rampant wildfires in early June that sent billowing smoke into southern Ontario \u2014 was ringing alarms with people across the region. <br/>'This year, as you know, we've already gotten into a drier period and had a melt of the snowpack early, so that allowed the forest to dry out earlier,' Meredith says. 'Then what happened was a few fires got going in Alberta and then kind of shifted to Nova Scotia and now, for the bulk of it, we're seeing the most number of forest fires right now in Quebec, in central Canada, and a few in northeastern Ontario.' <br/>As of Wednesday, there were more than 50 fires burning in Ontario[4], of varying sizes. <br/>A family practises frisbee at Trent University, while others \u2014 especially the young, elderly and people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 avoided strenuous outdoor activities in the smoky air. <br/>Along with the early start to fires, Meredith says, another unusual thing happened. Winds from the south are more common this time of year in southern Ontario, but this week, wind is coming from the north and northeast, bringing down plumes of smoke from wildfires near and far. <br/>'Dryness, then fires, then the wind pattern \u2014 it means widespread smoke started drifting across southern Ontario yesterday and got a bit thicker,' he says. <br/>Petawawa, Ont., was also hard hit, with air quality reaching the categorically hazardous level of 300 micrograms per cubic metre of air. But most of the wildfire smoke appears to have settled in the south, blanketing southeastern Ontario and the Greater Toronto Horseshoe with air quality warnings; cancelling outdoor recess at schools in York Region and Hamilton, among others; and shutting down outdoor sports across Mississauga. <br/>This, despite the nearest fire being hundreds of kilometres away. <br/>Even as smoke began clearing across Peterborough, the bonfire scent lingered. <br/>'If you have a fire the heat rises up quite quickly,' Meredith says. 'So what happens further downstream is it settles. You can get an inversion, so it helps bring the pollutants near the surface and sometimes winds help to push the pollutants together in a process called convergence.' <br/><br/><br/> We're investigating Ontario's environmental cuts The Narwhal's Ontario bureau is telling stories you won't find anywhere else.

Keep up with the latest scoops by signing up for a weekly dose of our independent journalism.  <br/>That can cause heavy concentrations of particulate matter to settle over the ground hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the site of the fire. And depending on conditions there, warmer air aloft can trap cold air and smoke near the surface, aggravating the situation even further. <br/>'It's tricky with air pollution, it's not just one thing. Unfortunately for Peterborough, a few things happened at the same time and a few things built up there from the forest fire smoke,' Meredith says. 'We're trying to stay on top of it but weather patterns, fires and heat, it's all changing. A month ago, we didn't know this would occur.' <br/>Wildfires underscore inequity in air quality <br/>Air quality degraded by wildfire smoke is uncommon in populated southern Ontario. It's worrying, given the population size, but the severity hardly compares to the impact of wildfires on smaller, more northern communities across the country \u2014 especially closest to the fires. There, the impacts of poor air quality are combined with evacuations or the threat of evacuations, and such threats are a regular occurence. <br/>Across Canada, about 200 Indigenous communities face a high risk of wildfires, according to Public Safety Canada[5]. <br/>The sun, coated in smoke, hangs over Adam Scott Collegiate Vocational Institute in Peterborough, Ont. <br/>Aherne, with Trent, notes that it isn't always known how deeply air quality impacts some smaller northerly communities because it isn't tracked as closely. <br/>'There are many places between us that just don't have an air quality monitoring station,' Aherne says. While a number of citizen science networks fill in some of the gaps left between government-funded monitoring, small and northern communities are still often left out. 'The air quality network of Ontario, it's great, I speak highly of that network, but that said, of course, it's put in place to protect the public health, so the greatest density of network stations is where the greatest density of people is.' <br/>The art of fire: reviving the Indigenous craft of cultural burning[6]'The art of fire: reviving the Indigenous craft of cultural burning' \u2014 The Narwhal[7] <br/>In Ontario, provincial air quality monitoring stations[8] reach as far north as Thunder Bay \u2014 roughly halfway up the province. About 24,000 people[9], 90 per cent of whom are First Nations, live above that line. <br/>It's also worth noting that the air quality readings facing southern Ontario this week are closer to an average day in some cities around the world. And in terms of southern Ontario on an average day, Aherne says, 'Air quality is very good in Peterborough.' When his team is working on an air quality study, they head to Toronto where emissions from traffic offer a bit more to sample. <br/>In the country's biggest city, air degraded by exhaust and rubber tires also affects people unequally[10]. Racialized and lower income people are more likely to be located near highways, and so more likely to develop pollution-related conditions such as asthma \u2014 subsequently putting them at higher risk when wildfire smoke permeates the air. <br/>Smoky spring skies may or may not be the new normal for southern Ontario, but they emphasize the value of clean air. <br/>With so many factors at play, it's hard to say whether these days of comparatively poor air are the new norm for southeastern Ontario \u2014 neither Aherne or Meredith want to say. But the oppressive smoke from wildfires, which are coming earlier and more frequently[11], along with the focus on respiratory health driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted the value of our clean air: we aren't accustomed to being able to taste and smell what we breathe. <br/>'Air quality has a huge impact on life, much of that driven by particulate matter and what comes from forest fires is that concentration of particulate matter,' Aherne says. 'What it does show us is that air quality is important to consider, we need to work harder at improving our air quality to reduce emissions from vehicles, and such, and realize that there are things we can't control, like wildfires.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/author/elaine-anselmi/\">https://thenarwhal.ca/author/elaine-anselmi/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airqualityontario.com/history/pollutant.php?stationid=59006&amp;pol_code=124&amp;start_day=5&amp;start_month=6&amp;start_year=2023&amp;showType=chart&amp;station_id=52023&amp;submitter=Refresh+Page\">http://www.airqualityontario.com/history/pollutant.php?stationid=59006&amp;pol_code=124&amp;start_day=5&amp;start_month=6&amp;start_year=2023&amp;showType=chart&amp;station_id=52023&amp;submitter=Refresh+Page</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.airqualityontario.com/history/pollutant.php?stationid=52023&amp;pol_code=124&amp;start_day=5&amp;start_month=6&amp;start_year=2023&amp;showType=chart&amp;station_id=59006&amp;submitter=Refresh+Page\">http://www.airqualityontario.com/history/pollutant.php?stationid=52023&amp;pol_code=124&amp;start_day=5&amp;start_month=6&amp;start_year=2023&amp;showType=chart&amp;station_id=59006&amp;submitter=Refresh+Page</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,and%204%20are%20under%20control\">https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,and%204%20are%20under%20control</url>.

Historically, four widely spaced holes were drilled in the immediate area by Abitibi Resources Ltd. (\"Abitibi\") in 1987 (Figure 3, 4). Assessment report drill logs for the Abitibi holes describe variably serpentinized and magnetic dunitic +/- pyroxenitic rocks with occurrences of trace amounts of native copper and brucite throughout their entire drilled lengths (Quebec Government report GM 47268). Notable results include hole 87-6 which returned greater than 0.22% nickel and 120 ppm cobalt over the last 20 metres of the 106.7 metre long BQ diameter hole.</p><p>As previously announced, the Company completed a series of holes this winter along an east-west fence approximately 100 metres north of the historical Abitibi hole 87-06 (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fquebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fquebec-nickel-drills-over-250m-of-serpentinized-ultramafic-rock-at-ducros-sill-target-provides-corporate-update%2F&amp;esheet=53450961&amp;newsitemid=20230712632421&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=April+19%2C2023+news+release&amp;index=3&amp;md5=7e8608db1027a146e1038d427b1d5d8f\">April 19,2023 news release</url> ). The fence of holes was designed to cut across the entire 600-metre-wide magnetic high feature (Figure 2, 3). In addition to drilling this fence of holes, the Company also completed a hole approximately one kilometer north of the drill fence to test the continuity of the Ducros Sill magnetic high anomaly, hole QDG-23-506, at the very end of the winter exploration program (Figure 2, 3). All four holes completed at Ducros Sill by the Company this winter intersected long core lengths of serpentinized ultramafic rocks, including dunite, peridotite and pyroxenite units (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fquebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F04%2Fquebec-nickel-drills-over-250m-of-serpentinized-ultramafic-rock-at-ducros-sill-target-provides-corporate-update%2F&amp;esheet=53450961&amp;newsitemid=20230712632421&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=April+19%2C+2023+News+Release&amp;index=4&amp;md5=329b6c428940736468974d270dc6d6d3\">April 19, 2023 News Release</url> for additional information).</p><p>Current Drilling Results</p><p>Hole QDG-23-503 was collared on the west side of the targeted magnetic high and was drilled eastward at a dip of -45\u00b0, towards the centre of the ultramafic intrusion (Figure 2). The hole encountered a package of intercalated mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks, including gabbro, pyroxenite, peridotite and dunite, from 23.00 to 308.00 metres downhole depth before cutting a 142-metre-long interval of serpentinized dunite, believed to be the same unit encountered in Abitibi hole 87-6. The hole was terminated in this lower dunite unit until the planned end of hole of 450 metres depth. Assay results returned 0.19% Ni + 111 ppm Co over the last 217 metres of the hole (233.00-450.00 m depth) including a higher-grade subinterval of 118.30 metres @ 0.21% Ni + 117 ppm Co (308.20-426.50 m depth).</p><p>Hole QDG-23-505 was collared approximately 210 metres east of QDG-23-503 and drilled towards the east at a -45\u00b0 dip to the planned end of hole depth of 402 metres (Figure 2, 3). The hole collared in variably serpentinized dunite at 21.00 metres hole depth and remained in the altered ultramafic unit until 314.00 metres, a 293-metre-long intersection, where it encountered metasedimentary footwall rocks.</p><p>Assay results for this hole returned a 293-metre-long intersection of 0.19% Ni + 106 ppm Co (21.00- 314.00 m) including a higher-grade subinterval of 0.21% Ni + 114 ppm Co over 152 metres (79.50-231.50 m).</p><p>Hole QDG-23-504 was collared approximately 210 metres east of QDG-23-505 and was also drilled towards the east at a -45\u00b0 dip to a depth of 243 metres (Figure 2, 3). This hole collared in variably serpentinized dunite until 117.00 metres downhole, after which it entered the package of metasedimentary footwall rocks.</p><p>Assay results from this hole returned 109.50 metres @ 0.16% Ni + 90 ppm Co (21.00-130.50 m) including a higher-grade subinterval of 0.20% Ni + 105 ppm Co over 29 metres near surface (21.00-50.00 m hole depth).</p><p>A drill section summarizing the results from these three holes can be found as Figure 2. A summary of the assay results is found in Table 1.</p><p>Hole QDG-23-506 was collared approximately one kilometer north of the three-hole fence noted above to test the interpreted strike extension of the Ducros Sill ultramafic intrusion. This interpretation is based on the continuity of the airborne magnetic high feature identified by the 2022 VTEM(TM) survey as well as the lone historical hole completed by Abitibi in the immediate area (hole 87-1, Figure 3). After passing through overburden, hole QDG-23-506 collared in variably serpentinized dunite at 30.00 metres hole depth and finished in the same dunite unit at 366.00 metres. The hole was terminated earlier than planned due to the onset of spring breakup. Assays are pending for this hole, but the results are expected to be in line with those returned from QDG-23-503 through QDG-23-505.</p><p>Given these results, this part of the Ducros Sill where hole QDG-23-506 was completed is now referred to as \"Ducros Sill North\" whereas the area which includes the recently completed three-hole drill fence is referred to as \"Ducros Sill South\" as shown in Figures 3 and 4.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hole ID</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">From (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">To (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Length (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Ni (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Co (ppm)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">QDG-23-503</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">233.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">450.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">217.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.19</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">111</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">including</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">308.20</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">426.50</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">118.30</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.21</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">117</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">QDG-23-504</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">21.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">130.50</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">109.50</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.16</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">90</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">including</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">21.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">50.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">29.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.20</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">105</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">QDG-23-505</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">21.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">314.00</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">293.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.19</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">106</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">including</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">79.50</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">231.50</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">152.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.21</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">114</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">QDG-23-506</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col2\">Assays pending</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Table 1. Summary of assay results for holes QDG-23-503 through QDG-23-505. Reported results are sample length weighted.</p><p>Extents of the Ducros Sill Intrusion</p><p>The digital Qu\u00e9bec government geology for QNI's Ducros Project claims, as sourced from the SIGEOM database, combined with these recent results indicates the Ducros Sill ultramafic intrusion now spans two kilometres north of QNI's most recent drilling, as confirmed by hole QDG-23-506, to approximately five kilometers to the south-southeast (Figure 1, 4). There is no evidence of this magnetic high feature being exposed at surface or drilled beyond the recent work conducted by QNI and Abitibi Resources Ltd. in 1987. Should this seven-kilometer-long magnetic anomaly be the geophysical expression of the Ducros Sill intrusion, as is currently hypothesized, its overall dimensions would rival the size of other high-profile large tonnage nickel-cobalt projects currently being advanced in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt.</p><p>Fortin Sill Zone Work Update</p><p>During the first part of the year, exploration drilling focused exclusively on testing targets that require winter conditions to access, such as at the Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex and Ducros Gabbro targets (Figure 1). The Company intends to resume exploration at the Fortin Sill Zone, where local ground conditions allow for year-round access, once the forest fire-related work restrictions are lifted. Drilling at the Fortin Sill Zone this summer and fall will follow up on some of the exceptional results returned in 2022, including from hole QDG-22-29, which drilled an 11.80 metre interval containing 1.44% Ni, 1.49% Cu, 461 ppm Co and 2.79 g/t Pt-Pd-Au that includes a higher-grade subinterval assaying 1.85% Ni, 1.65% Cu (3.50% Ni + Cu), 576 ppm Co and 3.27 g/t Pt-Pd-Au over 8.43 metres (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fquebecnickel.com%2F2022%2F08%2Fquebec-nickel-corp-intersects-1-85-ni-1-65-cu-and-3-27-g-t-pt-pd-au-over-8-43-metres-in-step-out-drilling-at-the-fortin-sill-zone-ducros-project-abitibi-quebec%2F&amp;esheet=53450961&amp;newsitemid=20230712632421&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=August+30%2C+2022&amp;index=5&amp;md5=53a134cff298ed2edfc487c5bd0900d5\">August 30, 2022</url> News Release for reference).</p><p>Core Processing &amp; QAQC</p><p>Qu\u00e9bec Nickel has implemented a quality assurance and quality control (\"QAQC\") program for its drilling programs to ensure best practices for logging, sampling and analysis of its drill core as well as for the collection and analyses of rock samples. This includes the regular insertion of geochemical blanks, sample duplicates and multiple Ni-Cu-PGE-Au certified reference material standards (CRMs) into the sample stream.</p><p>Drill core is collected by Ducros Project personnel daily from the drill rigs and transported in secured core boxes to QNI's core logging facilities in Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon. Logging is completed on laptops and data are captured using fit-for-purpose computer software.</p><p>Core destined for geochemical analyses is identified and labeled by core logging geologists and is then sawed in half by a diamond blade. One half of the NQ-diameter core sample is placed in a labeled and secured sample bag. The remaining half of the core sample is returned to its core box for archiving. All core samples are transported from QNI's logging facilities to AGAT Laboratories' and/or SGS Canada's sample preparation facilities in Val-d'Or in secured and numbered rice bags by Project personnel.</p><p>AGAT Laboratories and SGS operate under a Quality Management System that complies with the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard. Analysis for precious metals (gold, platinum, and palladium) is completed by Fire Assay with an ICP-OES finish while analyses for nickel, copper and 41 other elements are performed using AGAT's and SGS's 4 Acid Digest - Metals Packages, with an ICP-OES finish.</p><p>QUALIFIED PERSON</p><p>Gary DeSchutter, M.Sc., P.Geo., Vice-President of Exploration for Qu\u00e9bec Nickel Corp., and a Qualified Person (\"QP\") as defined under National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"), has reviewed, and approved the scientific and technical content of this press release.</p><p>ABOUT QUEBEC NICKEL CORP.</p><p>Qu\u00e9bec Nickel Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on acquiring, exploring, and developing critical metals (Ni-Cu-Co-PGE) projects in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.

For instance, steel is coated with flame retardants to provide thermal insulations in case of fire. Flame retardants are also used in forest fire in order to reduce the speed of fire spread.</p><p>Market Dynamics and Trends:</p><p>Flame retardants market has been witnessing rapid growth in sales due to the growing industrialization and rising number of newly constructed commercial buildings. Flame retardants, when added to materials increases its durability and makes it fire-proof. For instance, in the aircraft manufacturing industries, flame retardants are used in panels, carpet and flooring to minimize the risk of fire. Furthermore, the high productivity and low cost are some of the factors leading to the growth of flame retardants market.</p><p>On the contrary, the health risks associated with flame retardants such as endocrine disruption, reproductive toxicity, cancer, etc. hinders the market growth. However, the producers of flame retardants have responded to these concerns, and are developing more environmentally compatible products, mainly non-halogenated alternatives.</p><p>Also, the sudden growth in demand for flame retardants in industries manufacturing aircrafts, vehicles, electronic appliance, buildings and many more to avoid fire and for other applications, will be the key factor providing opportunities for the flame retardant market growth.</p><p>\u00a0Geographical Analysis:</p><p>North-America has been dominant in the consumption of flame retardants compared to other regions due to the increasing fire safety regulations. According to the report, North America itself has around 8 million buildings which require fire safety measures.</p><p>Furthermore, the expansion of industries and the construction of innumerable commercial buildings with proper fire safety measures is another reason favouring the growth of flame retardant market. However, the region of Asia Pacific will witness greater consumption of flame retardants due to the rapid rise in population and migration of people from rural to urban areas making it densely populated.</p><p>Market Dynamics</p><p>Drivers</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Rising Demand for Flame Retardants from the Building and Construction SectorGrowing Demand of Fire Retardants from the Electrical &amp;

I'll tell ya. They got higher prices and lower real wages. Inflation began to rise to the fastest level in 40 years the month after Democrats passed the $2 trillion bill. Inflation was 1.7 percent in February of 2021 - the month before passage of this boondoggle.</p><p>\"The economy shrank 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2022, 4.4 percentage points lower than where the Congressional Budget Office said it should be prior to passage of this boondoggle. The labor force participation rate is still below pre-COVID levels. The deficit in 2021 was $517 billion higher than the Congressional Budget Office said it would have been before passage of this boondoggle.

My name is Riva Duncan and I am currently the Vice President of the Grassroots Wildland Firefighters advocacy non-profit. On December 31, 2020, I retired from the US Forest Service after 31 years with the agency. My position upon retirement was Fire Chief for the Umpqua National Forest and Roseburg and Coos Bay BLM Districts in Southwest Oregon. Over the course of my career, I worked in five Forest Service regions on seven national forests in Pennsylvania, Florida, Utah, California, North Carolina, and Oregon. I was an official supervisor and directly involved in hiring from 1998 until my retirement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of you know by now that the Forest Service and the four land management agencies under the Department of Interior are struggling to recruit and retain wildland firefighters. Over the last few years, this has become a critical issue that affects most communities in the US. Wildfires are not just a California problem, nor are they a Western problem. This past spring numerous areas in Wisconsin, New Jersey, and others in the East experienced serious wildfires that threatened homes, businesses, infrastructure, and the health of citizens. Federal wildland firefighters are being called upon to leave their families earlier and earlier to fight destructive fires.</p><p>While I could go on and on about numerous issues facing our workforce, I'm here today to discuss hiring and the proposed bill \"Direct Hire to Fight Fires.\"</p><p>The entire hiring system needs to be critically reviewed and modernized for the next 50 years of recruiting, hiring, retaining and promoting federal wildland firefighters. The protracted and convoluted federal hiring process typically affects entry-level people the most who are trying to get their first job as a federal wildland firefighter. However, there are other systemic issues associated with federal hiring which negatively affect long term career employees who are denied promotions and detail assignments who, out of frustration, stop trying to obtain different positions within the Forest Service and DOI or end up resigning their federal jobs.</p><p>Hiring became considerably more difficult and cumbersome with the centralization of Human Resources in the FS, creating the Albuquerque Service Center (ASC), and the Bureau of Land Management, creating the National Operations Center. In our opinion, critical effort needs to be made to take an objective look at these decisions and consider whether decentralizing HR in the FS and DOI makes the most sense moving forward.</p><p>This is not to disparage the employees working in HR for these agencies. They are also struggling to keep up with the workload which is telling in the amount of turn-over at both ASC and the NOC.</p><p>Codifying Direct Hire Authority would certainly provide shorter hiring timelines for critical wildland fire positions. Anything that helps expedite current hiring processes is a step in the right direction. As data shows, DHA reduces the amount of time from authorization to employee entry on duty. This bill, if it becomes law, would continue to streamline the federal hiring process as it gives greater flexibility and timeliness to hire more wildland firefighters in rural and hard to recruit areas.</p><p>The bill also states it will address and eliminate redundancies in the Federal hiring process for wildland firefighters and support personnel, streamline the process for hiring wildland firefighters and support personnel who were employed by the agencies in prior years, and reduce barriers for wildland firefighters transferring between agencies. These are extremely important points that will reduce hiring timelines.</p><p>One stark example of hiring redundancy is the FS does not recognize the DOI agencies' employee background checks, and the DOI does not recognize the Forest Service's. This unnecessary barrier leads to significant delays in hiring firefighters between agencies/departments, and is often the last piece of red-tape in the way of onboarding wildland firefighters.</p><p>In the FS and DOI, employees must still attach a specific Standard Form 50 Notification of Personnel Action to their resume that proves they are \"current\" federal employees. In the FS, if they attach the wrong SF 50, their application is discarded and they are \"disqualified\" as they cannot \"prove\" they are a current federal employee, which I believe ASC can verify in less than a couple minutes. Conversely, in the National Park Service, if an employee attaches the wrong SF 50, they are notified to provide the correct form and their package goes on to be evaluated against the other factors.</p><p>These are just a couple of examples of where different processes in the different land management agencies affect applicant pools of qualified wildland firefighters and support personnel.</p><p>We would ask Congressman Issa and the rest of the committee to include a provision in the bill to waive age requirements for veterans, and others, as did the Land Management Workforce Flexibility Law, PL 114-47. Currently there is an age limit for permanent employees into the special retirement system for federal wildland firefighters and law enforcement officers which makes hiring veterans over the age of 37 extremely difficult. As the agencies stand up more \"veterans\" fire crews, it's important we honor their service in this way.</p><p>On behalf of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, thank you for allowing me to be here today. I look forward to answering the committee members' questions.</p><p>#End of Opening Statement#</p><p>Other Hiring Observations and Challenges</p><p>Positive Education Requirements in the 401 Series</p><p>Many of the wildland fire support positions, namely fire ecologists, fire planners, and fuels specialists are in the 401 General Biology series. This series is \"professional\" and so has positive education requirements. Across the FS, numerous wildland fire employees in this series have been disqualified from lateral reassignments, temporary promotions, and permanent promotions into the same series by HR because they \"do not meet\" the positive education requirements. Again, they are already in this series, and yet somehow don't meet those requirements when seeking other 401 positions. Some employees are just too overloaded or too frustrated to appeal these decisions, and many who seek to appeal often don't find out about this oversight until it's too late.</p><p>Antiquated Payment Processing System (tied to HR)</p><p>The FS's pay system, housed at the National Finance Center in New Orleans, and is directly tied to the HR system, is also seriously antiquated and in need of reform. We recently discovered that only one personnel action can be processed at the same time. Many temporary firefighters, those in the Not To Exceed (NTE) 1039 hours category, are being onboarded and requiring three distinct personnel actions: 1. actually being put into hire/pay status, 2. provided the pay supplement authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and 3. Being placed into government housing and having their \"rent\" deducted from their paycheck. These temporary employees do not see their first paycheck for two to four weeks, their supplement isn't included until their second or third paycheck, and often their rent isn't deducted for several more pay periods (it is not unusual for a temporary to get a large \"backpay\" deduction towards the end of their employment period). We also have examples of other significant issues with the BIL supplement for a few hundred wildland firefighters and support personnel due to this ineffective and inefficient system.</p><p>Other Observations Regarding Centralized HR (FS)</p><p>Centralization of the Forest Service's HR at the Albuquerque Service Center (ASC) has been a monumental failure. Yet the agency fails to acknowledge this and seriously look at decentralization. There are few HR specialists left who actually worked at unit and/or remember what that was like. Those who haven't, struggle to understand the work of all employees, not just wildland firefighters. Employees at the field units (including the regional offices and Washington Office) are just a \"number\" or a \"name.\" During the early days of the transition to ASC, while I was Deputy Forest Fire Chief on the Klamath National Forest in CA, I sent one of the dispatchers to ASC to give presentations on what the wildland firefighter workforce was and what they did. This was eye-opening for the HR specialists. However, the turnover rate is so high that if someone were to do that again, they'd have to go nearly every month in order to reach the constantly new group of HR employees. The FS publishes a monthly report of disciplinary actions across the agency and it is staggering to see how many employees at ASC are receiving disciplinary action, some of them for violating personnel practices. These extreme examples of job dissatisfaction and poor performance/behavior have a ripple effect down to the units. Decentralization would allow HR employees to serve directly with the employees with whom they work every day. They would know them as people and not just as names on a list or a voice over the phone. We are convinced this would solve a multitude of HR issues. But the highest level of managers within the FS seem reluctant to admit that while centralization seemed like a good idea it has been a massive failure since it started over 15 years ago. We would like to see an outside, objective group take a critical look at ASC and make recommendations on what it would take to fix the most glaring of issues affecting efficiency and efficacy.</p><p>Grassroots Wildland Firefighters Advocacy Group Background</p><p>The Grassroots Wildland Firefighters were formed in 2019 by active and retired federal wildland firefighters. The intent of the group is to address the issues surrounding the everyday world of the wildland firefighter, including: pay and classification, comprehensive health and well-being, and OWCP claims.</p><p>The Grassroots Wildland Firefighters are focused on bringing our diverse group of voices to bear on leadership in the land management agencies and our elected officials, at the local, state and federal level. Our mission is to advocate for proper classification, pay, benefits and comprehensive well being.</p><p>We acknowledge these are complex and multifaceted issues spanning several government agencies. Our overarching goal is to create a better quality of life for those who sacrifice so much of themselves to protect life, communities, and natural resources.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II10/20230523/115955/HHRG-118-II10-Wstate-DuncanR-20230523.pdf\">http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II10/20230523/115955/HHRG-118-II10-Wstate-DuncanR-20230523.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC523320L4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689H-2M21-JCCP-04GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 23, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, you must take special care in employing minor workers, as both federal and state laws impose special rules on hiring employees under 18. Mississippi employers who hire minors must comply with both the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the state's child labor laws, which place restrictions on the hiring and employment of minors, prohibit minors from working in certain occupations, restrict the hours minors may work, and impose additional duties on employers. This Insight provides employers with answers to the seven most commonly asked questions to guide you through the process. </p><p><br/>1. Who Are Considered 'Minors' in Mississippi? <br/>Mississippi's child labor laws apply broadly to any individual under the age of 18. Generally, children under the age of 14 are prohibited from being employed in 'any gainful occupation.' However, there are certain exceptions based on the type of work performed and the status of the minor. Mississippi enforces different rules for different age groups: <br/> 14 and 15 years of age; and 16 and 17 years of age. <br/>It is important to note that both age groups are not allowed to work in an establishment which serves or sells alcohol for consumption. <br/>2. What Types of Work Can Minors Perform? <br/>Both the FLSA and Mississippi law prohibit minor employees from being employed in occupations that are considered dangerous and detrimental to their health, safety, and well-being. The FLSA strictly prohibits the employment of minors in non-agricultural work falling within any of the Department of Labor's list of hazardous occupations for minors under 16 and between 16 and 18 years old. Additionally, in Mississippi, minors cannot be employed in occupations involving any of the following: <br/> Mining, logging, sawmill work Forest fire prevention work Packing or processing meat and poultry Wrecking or demolition operations Any work with power-driven machinery Roofing or excavation operations Work with balers and compactors Driving and working as outside helpers on motor vehicles <br/>3. How Are Work Hours Restricted? <br/>The maximum number of work hours is regulated for all minors and differs when school is in session and when it's not. <br/>When school is in session, all minors: <br/> Cannot work during school hours; Cannot work more than 18 hours per week. <br/>When school is not in session: <br/> Minors aged 14 and 15: Cannot work more than 8 hours per day; and Cannot work more than 40 hours per week if employed elsewhere. Minors aged 16 and 17 can work under the following conditions: No more than 8 hours per day; and No restrictions on maximum hours per week.  <br/>In Mississippi, minors aged 14 and 15 are only allowed to work between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. For minors between 16 and 17, there are no restrictions on nightwork. <br/>4. Are Work Permits Required? <br/>Only minors working in certain types of occupations are required to secure a work permit. For example, an employment certification is necessary for anyone under 16 years of age hoping to work in the following contexts: <br/> Mills Canneries Workshops Factories <br/>A work permit is necessary for any of these occupational contexts no matter the time of year. During the school year, minors can secure a work permit from their public school. <br/>Even if you are an employer that is not required to obtained a work permit, you must obtain, and retain, proper documentation of proof of age, such as a birth certificate, driver's license, state-issued ID, or passport of every minor you employ, even if the employment relationship is temporary or seasonal. <br/>5. Can You Pay Minors a Lower Wage? <br/>Mississippi does not have any state laws dictating minor wages. As a result, you must abide by the FLSA's minimum wage requirements. Under the FLSA, generally, employees cannot be paid below the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. <br/>However, the FLSA provides for exceptions to this rule for minors under certain circumstances. For example, under the FLSA's youth minimum wage exception, you are allowed to pay new employees who are under 20 years of age at a rate of $4.25 per hour for the first 90 days of unemployment, subject to certain requirements. Although practically speaking, you may not be able to attract workers at that wage given current market conditions. <br/>6. Are Minors Entitled to Additional Breaks? <br/>Employers in the state of Mississippi are not legally required to provide a meal or rest break to their employees. However, you can choose to offer both meal and rest breaks. In those cases, federal laws apply. <br/>If you choose to offer either a meal or a rest break, the law states that: <br/> Meal breaks lasting up to 20 minutes must be paid; Meal breaks lasting over 30 minutes can be either paid or unpaid, according to the employer's preference; and Rest breaks lasting up to 20 minutes must be paid. <br/>7. What Are the Penalties for Violations? <br/>Violations against Mississippi's child labor laws may be assessed civil and/or criminal penalties of varying degrees dependent on the violation. Potential penalties include warnings, monetary fines, and criminal charges. These penalties can compound quickly. Each day a violation continues after you have been notified of the violation by the U.S. Department of Labor constitutes a separate violation. <br/>Penalties under the FLSA are much stricter, allowing for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 per minor who was employed in violation. Willful violations of the FLSA may result in criminal prosecution and the violator fined up to $10,000. A second conviction may result in imprisonment. <br/>A Plan for Mississippi Employers <br/>Reviewing this Insight and understanding the limits of employing minors in Mississippi is the first and most important step to complying with both state and federal law. You also should apply and follow internal policies, and closely monitor your pay practices to ensure you are complying with state and federal laws for all employees. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=d1b86956-069a-46b2-8d89-fc9f0a98513d\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411167062150652425876100142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6728-G0N1-F03R-N113-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><timeReceived>9:31 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 9, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Business &amp;
