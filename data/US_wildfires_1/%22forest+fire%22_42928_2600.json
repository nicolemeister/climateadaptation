(AP) \u2014 Fire crews battled small wildfires across the Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-new-york-fires-2ecc0fa526dc9fe71870f7e6f9b0e5be\">employee over the weekend</url> and postponed Veterans Day plans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A quarter-inch of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters.</p><p>The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree.</p><p>The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California.</p><p>Firefighters <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-mountain-fire-winds-structures-destroyed-7624cdb95885d026892c0f58b42a3e57\">continued making progress</url> against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-mountain-fire-winds-structures-destroyed-2a5d282ccddfa82733f46842a22599a7\">quickly exploded in size</url> due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds.</p><p>The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-mountain-fire-winds-structures-destroyed-f526521a2e1427aa228cad771037bd56\">thousands of residents to flee their homes</url> and was 41% contained as of Monday. The fire\u2019s size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 192 structures and damaged 82, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation.</p><p>In neighboring Nevada, authorities ordered the evacuation of hundreds of homes southwest of Reno and closed the main highway to Lake Tahoe after a wind-whipped wildfire <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfire-nevada-reno-evacuations-callahan-12077f88c48215e8b59a20259f3bc848\">erupted Monday</url> and spread quickly through mountainside vegetation.</p><p>About 3,000 people were told to leave, said Adam Mayberry, spokesperson for the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. Rain began to fall as local, state and federal crews arrived to battle the blaze, Mayberry said.</p><p>Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, crews worked to contain the the 4.7-square-mile (about 12.2 square-kilometer) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday.</p><p>In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger.</p><p>\u201cBeneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry,\u201d Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. \u201cSo right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it\u2019s in the duff it\u2019s going to stay there. It\u2019s going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again.\u201d</p><p>A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons (1,325 liters) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire. The National Guard deployed two Black Hawk helicopters for water drops, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.</p><p>In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander.</p><p>\u201cMany of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,\u201d he posted online.</p><p>Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state\u2019s Greenwood Lake.</p><p>Health advisories were issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction.</p><p>Dana Van Allen, of Ringwood, New Jersey, said she awoke early Saturday to what smelled like a burning campfire. She realized the fires were close enough to leave ashes on her deck.</p><p>\"It was very stifling. We were very scared,\u201d she recalled Monday.</p><p>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles (8.8 square kilometers) in the city some 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Boston.</p><p>The Lynn Fire Department cited \"a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\u201d</p><p>\"We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn\u2019t spread further,\" Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday.</p><p>The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred Sept. 28.</p><p>___</p><p>Ken Ritter contributed to this report from Nevada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-3fd470f223d189848f3aa1802e21fe2820241112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD5-JD81-DYMD-6023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>9:56 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kanzler walked around the signs to avoid the driveway, which is at the center of a dispute between nearby property owners and the town. Rich Abrahamson/Morning SentinelFREEDOM - Tyler Hadyniak lives with his family on Beaver Ridge Road in Freedom.The Hadyniaks moved to town in 1997 to escape the noise of New Jersey, opting for the other side of the pendulum: 90 acres of land deep in the Maine woods.The family has always considered the portion of road by their land abandoned, and therefore their private property.But not everyone in town agrees: Officials mentioned at multiple meetings last summer\u00a0that the road is open to the public, Hadyniak said, and that the family is illegally posting it. The Hadyniak's wooden barricades were run over by an ATV later that month, and shortly after, a private property sign was vandalized to say \"town road open to public.\"Now, Hadyniak, an attorney, is representing his family in a lawsuit against the town, claiming ownership of part of the road. The town is fighting back, wracking up thousands in legal fees, paid by taxpayers, to counter that the family is obstructing a public right of way.This kind of road dispute is not uncommon in Maine. </p><p>It's playing out in Hallowell and about 300 other towns across the state, pitting landowners against members of the public that use privately maintained roads for free. Nonprofits and state commissions are looking for solutions, but until then, road access remains unreliable for landowners, political for residents - and devastating for towns that can't afford to fight legal battles.AdvertisementA LAWSUIT ON BEAVER RIDGE ROADBeaver Ridge Road was laid out in 1823, creating a public easement, according to Kennebec County deeds.But roads are not static. They're a reflection of the people who use them, and patterns of maintenance and public use can change the status of a road from an easement to private property and back again.Hadyniak, who is also chair of the town's planning board, said that Freedom's neglect of Beaver Ridge Road dates back to a 1948 decision to close the middle portion of the road for winter maintenance while failing to address the northernmost mile and a half of road, along which his family's property lies.\"Based on the history of that road and based on representations this town made to my family back when they purchased our land in 1991, we understood this section of the road to be the private property of abutting landowners,\" Hadyniak said.His father, Chuck Hadyniak, is the lead petitioner on the suit with three other family members.The family spent $12,000 to set up Central Maine Power utility lines by their property and $20,000 to line the road with gravel, Hadyniak said, plus regular costs of re-graveling, plowing and maintenance.AdvertisementProperty owners on public easements need to be able to access their homes, and roads that aren't maintained will eventually be destroyed by public use, said Roberta Manter, who runs the nonprofit Maine ROADWays, or Residents and Owners on Abandoned and Discontinued Ways.Roberta Manter is pictured Tuesday near her family's home on Young Road in Fayette. Manter runs Maine ROADWays, a nonprofit organization with the mission to help Mainers in road disputes find historical information about their roads, learn legal precedent and find remedies. Joe Phelan/Kennebec JournalAbutting landowners end up paying for road maintenance twice, she said: once as taxpayers, and again as private landowners paying out of pocket to maintain access to their road, which the public uses for free.In 27 years of posting their property as private, Hadyniak said his family never had a problem until last summer, when town officials declared the road open to the public.\"My family said, 'You know what? We need a decision from the most authoritative source we can get, and that's a court of law,'\" Hadyniak said.In the declaratory judgment request filed last July, Hadyniak cited multiple 1997 letters from former selectmen and the Maine Municipal Association stating that the road was private property of abutters. He claims it's evidence of a town decision.Town decisions are not played out over letters, town attorney Bill Kelly responded in subsequent filings, but through town action required by state law: notifying abutters and the public, holding a hearing, issuing an order of discontinuance, recording the determination in the county registry and notifying the Maine Department of Transportation.AdvertisementThe town did take action on the road in 1956. A vote discontinued maintenance but kept a public right of way \"from O.B. Ward's to discontinued road over Beaver Hill.\"The parties disagree on where that discontinuance lies.The first portion of Beaver Ridge Road is publicly maintained. After a quarter-mile, at a point referred to as O.B. Ward's house, a sign reads: \"Road discontinued to maintenance, pass at your own risk.\" It's another quarter-mile to the Hadyniak's private property sign and residences.This is the beginning of the disputed portion of the road, 1.5 miles in total. Just past the family's property, the road turns into a grassy, wooded path that continues northwest toward the Sibley Road for over a mile until part of the road is washed out. Some say it's impassible there, supporting the idea that the road is abandoned by common law, or 20 years without public use.Manter said that a road abandoned by common law will be all grown up with trees, impossible to get through.\"That's a road that truly is abandoned by common law,\" Manter said. \"Presumably, nobody has used it, nobody has needed it in 20 years, and nobody will miss it if it's gone. So the easement is completely extinguished.\"AdvertisementRobert Kanzler, a Freedom resident who camped on the Beaver Ridge hillside as a Boy Scout through the 1980s, said that the disputed portion of the road is still actively used by many in town.\u00a0He often snowshoes through it- even the part that is washed out and supposedly impassable.Robert Kanzler of Freedom reviews maps and documents from 1823 Tuesday while talking about roads near his home. He said the documents create a public easement over disputed property where he enjoys snowshoeing. Nearby property owners disagree, saying the driveway belongs to them. Rich Abrahamson/Morning SentinelOut-of-towners don't always understand the status of their road when they buy property in Maine, Kanzler said. Sellers weren't even required to inform buyers of the status of their road until 2017, and weren't required to disclose who maintains the road until 2023.\"They're surprised, because they do not understand,\" Kanzler said. \"On their deed, it does not state that it was or is an easement. They think, just because they bought both sides of the road, they automatically own to the center. And they don't.\"Chuck Hadyniak also camped by the road. On a '90s camping trip with his father, he said, a selectman pointed out where the road was abandoned by their property.He said that the family might not have made the move to Maine - quitting their jobs, selling their houses in New Jersey and spending up to $300,000 to build the residences - if they had not been told that Beaver Ridge Road was abandoned. Now, Chuck Hadyniak said he wants to defend his property.\"We want what's legal,\" he said. \"That's why we're going this route. And we would like people to be open minded enough to let the court decide. We're making our argument - if the town wants to make their argument, that's fine.\"AdvertisementWhen a road is abandoned by common law, after 20 years of public non-use, it reverts to the private property of abutters to the centerline. But if a road is abandoned through statutory abandonment, or no public maintenance for at least 30 years, it retains a public easement.The town held a series of hearings over the past month, collecting testimony from dozens of residents about their use of the road. Court action is paused until the Select Board finishes fact-finding and makes a municipal determination on the road.Robert Kanzler of Freedom, a avid snowshoer, helps clear a trail Tuesday near his home. Rich Abrahamson/Morning SentinelAt the last hearing, Select Board chair Laura Greeley proposed using eminent domain to purchase and take the road for public use - a potentially cheaper option than continuing the legal battle, she said.Select Board member Heather Donahue lives on the public portion of Beaver Ridge Road. As an abutter, she has recused herself from any future votes on the road.Donahue, an avid hiker and snowshoer, said she moved to the road because trails were an important feature to her. She said the Hadyniak family's suit amounts to \"extortion.\"\"Two lawyers in the family means it costs nothing for them to pursue this,\" Donahue said. \"It only costs our taxpayers. I can only guess their hope is that by peddling half truths to the court the litigation will get so expensive by the time we actually get to try those facts at trial, that our residents will vote to rescind the easement.\"AdvertisementOUTER CENTRAL 'STREET'Thirty miles to the southwest, Patrick Wynne, a former Hallowell city councilor whose term ended in January, is in a similar battle.Wynne moved with his family to a house at 407 Central St., just a quarter-mile east of the end of the paved road, in 2014. Soon, he began hiking down a street - or rough gravel trail - that continues past the end of the city-maintained section. After a snowstorm one spring, Wynne and his family were coming back from skiing on the trail when they were confronted.Thomas DeRaps, a neighbor, told Wynne he was trespassing. DeRaps and his wife, Cheryl, are the caretakers of the 44-acre property the Wynnes had been skiing on, per the request of owner Michael Newsom, who lives in Pennsylvania.\"We told them when they moved in, 'This is your property line. This is where the Newsom's begins. It's all posted. They don't want anybody up here.'\" Cheryl DeRaps said. \"We'd caught them several times up there trying to fly kites or whatever.\"Wynne continued to use the trail, and still does.\"I just went ahead and exercised my liberty to access public land,\" Wynne said. \"I use it now ... It's fantastic because you can get on the snowmobile trails and actually connect into (the Hallowell Recreation Area and City Forest).\"AdvertisementWynne believes the trail is city property - that the Central Street right-of-way extends all the way down the 1,000 feet of gravel trail to the Manchester line, based on historical deeds of the surrounding properties and 1810 town meeting minutes that say the road began at the \"westerly end of the line\" that divided the properties of two of rural Hallowell's first residents.City Manager Gary Lamb publicized those 1810 minutes in a City Council meeting Dec. 9, claiming that for now, it was sufficient evidence that the road was still the city's property.Wynne said it was a victory for the city. The \"no trespassing\" signs the DeRapses had put up along on the trail had to come down, he said at the meeting, and residents could now use the path for recreation as they please.\"There is actually a sign that specifically says, 'This is not a public hiking trail,'\" Wynne said during the Dec. 9 meeting. \"It is offensive, as a member of the public, to be shut out from land that belongs to all of us.\"The DeRapses, who have lived at 399 Central St. since the 1970s, say it's unclear where that \"westerly end\" actually was, and that no road existed past the\u00a0property until at least 1954.Even if the trail was a municipal road, the couple argues, it would have long since been abandoned after 20 years of public non-use.AdvertisementThe only people accessing that section of trail for decades, they said, would have been the family who owns a woodlot across the town line in Manchester and has permission to use and maintain the trail from abutting landowners. People using a road with permission don't count as \"the public\" in cases of abandonment.A 2008 survey of the area referenced the 1810 minutes and said the status of the section beyond the end of the pavement is unknown. Cheryl DeRaps said Hallowell's code enforcement officer at the time ordered their signs be taken down in 2020, but retracted his decision and said the road's status was unclear \"after further research.\"Since the Dec. 9 meeting, when Wynne said the stretch was \"wide open\" to the public, the DeRapses have received call after call from residents asking to hike or ski on the trail and the Newsom property to the north.They've declined each time. They said it's not their permission, or Wynne's, to give - it's the landowner's.A ROAD FORWARDThe DeRapses eventually reached out to Manter, who became an expert in these disputes after her own abandoned road lawsuit blew up into a Maine Supreme Judicial Court case.David Manter is pictured Tuesday on Young Road in Fayette. Manter has maintained the discontinued road at his own expense for years. He eventually sought reimbursement for the maintenance, which led to case before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Manter and his wife Roberta have since become experts on road disputes and use their expertise to help others embroiled in the same kind of conflicts. Joe Phelan/Kennebec JournalDavid Manter, Roberta's husband, had been maintaining the long-discontinued Young Road in Fayette at his own expense for years - even as logging operations began to take advantage of the public easement that still existed there. He claimed Fayette should reimburse him for maintenance, but town officials declined.AdvertisementThe Maine Supreme Court ultimately sided with the town because it had been too long since the initial discontinuance, choosing not to rule on the constitutionality of a private citizen having to maintain a public easement.Public easements are still common in Maine today, and Fayette alone has about 20, Manter said.Roberta Manter maintains a map full of pins showing disputed roads throughout Maine. Submitted photoNow, 38 years after Fayette v. Manter was decided, Roberta Manter runs Maine ROADWays to help people in road disputes find historical information about their roads, learn legal precedent and find remedies.The Outer Central Street case is one of hundreds of what Manter calls \"problem roads\" across the state. She has identified about 300 towns across the state with problem roads, and about 100 disputes have gone to court in the last 50 years.Many towns don't keep an inventory of their roads, making it difficult to tell which are abandoned or discontinued. Manter keeps track with a map on her wall, where she has noticed trends in the names and locations of problem roads.\"You'll find an awful lot of these discontinued roads contain either the word 'hill' or 'mountain' or 'bog,' and the reason they were discontinued was because they were difficult to keep maintained,\" Manter said. \"So, great idea: 'Because they're hard to maintain, we'll just stop maintaining them and expect them to stay passable.'\"AdvertisementManter said she thinks the best solution to this statewide problem is creating a middle ground.A sign on Young Road in Fayette. Joe Phelan/Kennebec JournalThe Maine Abandoned and Discontinued Roads Commission, of which Manter is a member, recommended the same in their most recent report released earlier this month. The group said the Legislature should create a \"minimum maintenance\" option that doesn't require full upkeep by the town, but would still allow residents \"reasonably passable\" access to their property.The minimum maintenance option would be cheaper than keeping abandoned or discontinued roads up to the current \"safe and convenient for travelers with motor vehicles\" standard for town ways, Manter said.\"Not all roads need to be to that standard, but (sometimes) the town doesn't have any other choice,\" she said. \"If they can't keep a road to that standard, their only other choice is to discontinue it and do no maintenance whatsoever.\"Keeping some level of maintenance would also allow first responders to access roads like Beaver Ridge Road in case of an emergency, Kanzler said.\"Those are actually emergency access routes, these easements, for fire,\" Kanzler said. \"If you had a forest fire, those roads should be open enough to where you could get a four-wheel drive - walkable, hikeable or anything.\"AdvertisementAnd then there's the type of access that only exists between neighbors, he said.\"It's really sad, because locals have used these roads for many years,\" Kanzler said. \"There's a couple gentlemen, one lives on one side, one lives on the other. We ride back and forth up through there on the ATV all the time to go have a cup of coffee and a muffin.\"Chuck Hadyniak said his family isn't trying to block access routes. They just want quiet.\"Listen, we're not monsters,\" he said. \"My goodness, I mean, the reason we're here is because of the compassion that we've seen and the friendships that people have offered us. And if there was fires here? Oh my goodness, that would be ridiculous of us to say, 'No, you can't. This is a private road.'\"Copy the Story Link</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLCEN-httpswwwcentralmainecom20250214freedomresidentsarefightingaboutaroadinmainetheyarenotalone</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLCEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F4D-XW73-RRR6-D010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490509</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Centralmaine.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64500\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 14, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas, Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>New Jersey, Maine, Mississippi, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan &amp;

According to news reporting from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires are important factors that influence and restrict the development of forest ecosystems. In this paper, forest-fire-risk prediction was studied based on random forest (RF) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Strategic International Scientific And Technological Innovation Cooperation Special Fund of National Key Research And Development Program of China; Young Innovative Talents Training Program of Universities in Heilongjiang Province; Heilongjiang University Outstanding Youth Fund. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"The Heihe area of Heilongjiang Province is one of the key forest areas and forest-fire-prone areas in China. Based on daily historical forest-fire data from 1995 to 2015, daily meteorological data, topographic data and basic geographic information data, the main forest-fire driving factors were first analyzed by using RF importance characteristic evaluation and logistic stepwise regression. Then, the prediction models were established by using the two machine learning methods. Furthermore, the goodness of fit of the models was tested using the receiver operating characteristic test method. Finally, the fire-risk grades were divided by applying the kriging method. The results showed that 11 driving factors were significantly correlated with forest-fire occurrence, and days after the last rain, daily average relative humidity, daily maximum temperature, daily average water vapor pressure, daily minimum relative humidity and distance to settlement had a high correlation with the risk of forest-fire occurrence. The prediction accuracy of the two algorithms in regard to fire points was higher than that for nonfire points. The overall prediction accuracy and goodness of fit of the RF and BPNN algorithms were similar.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The two methods were both suitable for forest-fire occurrence prediction. The high-fire-risk zones were mainly concentrated in the northwestern and central parts of the Heihe area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest-Fire-Risk Prediction Based on Random Forest and Backpropagation Neural Network of Heihe Area in Heilongjiang Province, China.

(AP) \u2014 Fire crews battled small wildfires across the Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-new-york-fires-2ecc0fa526dc9fe71870f7e6f9b0e5be\">employee over the weekend</url> and postponed Veterans Day plans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A quarter-inch of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters.</p><p>The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree.</p><p>The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California.</p><p>Firefighters <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-mountain-fire-winds-structures-destroyed-7624cdb95885d026892c0f58b42a3e57\">continued making progress</url> against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-mountain-fire-winds-structures-destroyed-2a5d282ccddfa82733f46842a22599a7\">quickly exploded in size</url> due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds.</p><p>The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-mountain-fire-winds-structures-destroyed-f526521a2e1427aa228cad771037bd56\">thousands of residents to flee their homes</url> and was 36% contained as of Monday. The fire\u2019s size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 170 structures, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation.</p><p>In neighboring Nevada, authorities ordered the evacuation of hundreds of homes southwest of Reno and closed the main highway to Lake Tahoe after a wind-whipped wildfire <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfire-nevada-reno-evacuations-callahan-12077f88c48215e8b59a20259f3bc848\">erupted Monday</url> and spread quickly through mountainside vegetation.</p><p>About 3,000 people were told to leave, said Adam Mayberry, spokesperson for the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. Rain began to fall as local, state and federal crews arrived to battle the blaze, Mayberry said.</p><p>Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, crews worked to contain the the 4.7-square-mile (about 12.2 square-kilometer) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday.</p><p>In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger.</p><p>\u201cBeneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry,\u201d Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. \u201cSo right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it\u2019s in the duff it\u2019s going to stay there. It\u2019s going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again.\u201d</p><p>A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons (1,325 liters) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire. The National Guard deployed two Black Hawk helicopters for water drops, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.</p><p>In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander.</p><p>\u201cMany of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,\u201d he posted online.</p><p>Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state\u2019s Greenwood Lake.</p><p>Health advisories were issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction.</p><p>Dana Van Allen, of Ringwood, New Jersey, said she awoke early Saturday to what smelled like a burning campfire. She realized the fires were close enough to leave ashes on her deck.</p><p>\"It was very stifling. We were very scared,\u201d she recalled Monday.</p><p>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles (8.8 square kilometers) in the city some 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Boston.</p><p>The Lynn Fire Department cited \"a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\u201d</p><p>\"We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn\u2019t spread further,\" Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday.</p><p>The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions.

So, take a look for an example there. A highchair was originally $235, now it's $195. A bib was $29.50, now it's $16.99.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we know some of those prices may be still too high for consumers, but they're banking on the fact that this is going to hit and resonate with their current consumers. And they said that just in the month that they've been doing this, they've actually seen that their lower price items have quadrupled in sales. So, these companies are banking on this being a good business strategy in a time of economic uncertainty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: It does come at a cost, though. It does affect their bottom line, I imagine.</p><p>YURKEVICH: It certainly does. And experts warn that they - that companies need to look at their bottom line to make sure they can do this, because the worst thing to do is you do this and then change your mind, and consumers say, wait a minute, I thought I was getting a deal here. And that can - that can affect brand optics for consumers.</p><p>BERMAN: Right. Vanessa Yurkevich, great to see you. Thank you very much.</p><p>We've got a lot of news. A brand-new hour of CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts right now.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: President Trump preparing to lay out his vision for the country in his big address before Congress, just as Russia says that Trump's foreign policy largely coincides with their vision.</p><p>Elon Musk's purge of the federal workforce has left hundreds of NOAA employees now without a job, leaving experts now warning those cuts are going to hurt much more than just a weather forecast. And Hollywood's big night, the Oscars. The big winners, the long speeches and the history making moments.</p><p>I'm Kate Bolduan, with John Berman. Sara is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, just moments ago, President Trump previewed his speech before Congress tomorrow night. He says, quote, \"tomorrow night will be big. I will tell it like it is.\"</p><p>The last few days that has meant telling it as Russia likes it. A short time ago, a Kremlin spokesperson commented on the president's Oval Office attacks on Ukrainian Leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Kremlin says, quote, \"the new U.S. administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision.\"</p><p>Let's get right to CNN's Alayna Treene at the White House.</p><p>The president, on social media, talking about this speech tomorrow. Alayna, what are you hearing?</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Right. Well, when - in my conversations, John, with White House officials, Trump administration officials, one, they say, of course, they are still working on this speech and they're hesitant to lay out any of the big priorities. Of course, they want it to be a surprise, like all presidents we see like to have it be when it comes to the State of the Union Address. But I am told at some point you can expect him to take a victory lap, not only after his election win, but, of course, he wants to try and point out and highlight some of what they argue are his big accomplishments in his first two months in office. And then you did see him, of course, saying he is going to tell it like it is on Truth Social this morning, referencing that.</p><p>But look, I think just to take a step back and remember the last time Donald Trump delivered a State of the Union Address, it was a far different Washington. One, he was freshly impeached. He also had yet to really see the coronavirus pandemic take place. But now we're also really seeing Washington be dramatically reshaped, in part largely because of what we've seen Trump do so far in office with slashing the federal workforce and trying to reshape it in his image.</p><p>But I think one of the biggest things, of course, is what is his speech going to look like as he addresses the world stage. And specifically, will he talk about Russia and Ukraine?</p><p>We heard another post from the president this morning as well. I want to read for you what he wrote. He said, quote, \"the only president who gave none of Ukraine's land to Putin's Russia is President Donald J. Trump. Remember that when the weak and ineffective Democrats criticize and the fake news gladly puts out anything they say.\" So, clearly, he is watching some of the news this morning and over the weekend where people have been criticizing what took place in the Oval Office on Friday. But look, it wasn't just, John, Democrats who are criticizing him. We've heard people from the president's own party. People like Senator Lisa Murkowski, who argued that the Trump administration is walking away from our allies and embracing Putin. She said it was plainly wrong. So, there's a lot of different reaction we are hearing from Capitol Hill, in addition to seeing, you know, having the White House really dispatch many of the people, top administration officials like Secretaries Rubio, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, all of them really spanning the airwaves as well to defend him.</p><p>Key question today, of course, is, does that rhetoric shift and how do they move forward on this?</p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: Alayna Treene watching it all at the White House. Keep us posted, Alayna. Thank you very much.</p><p>Kate.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Watching it from the White House, but what are lawmakers now preparing for with that big speech tomorrow night?</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>CNN's Lauren Fox is live in Washington. She's got much more on this from that angle.</p><p>Lauren, what are you hearing?</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, there's obviously a lot of concern from some Republicans about what transpired in the Oval Office on Friday. You can expect that some people are going to want more clarity. One of those Republicans was Senator Lisa Murkowski, who had this blistering tweet over the weekend. She said, \"this week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine. It ends with a tense, shocking conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine. I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.\"</p><p>Now, Murkowski is really in a smaller camp in the Republican Party when it comes to concern over that Oval Office meeting. You have people like Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been a longtime supporter of providing aid to Ukraine, who said this over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC): I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of J.D. Vance standing up for our country. We want to be helpful. What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again. He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOX: And, obviously, calling on a democratically elected leader to resign is something that a lot of folks on Capitol Hill are expressing some concern about this morning. A lot of Democrats expressing concern about it. And lawmakers return to Washington this evening. You can expect that they are going to be pressed over and over again on whether or not there is a real change happening in the Trump administration's response to Ukraine, and whether or not all the Republicans are going to be aligned with him.</p><p>Obviously, Murkowski, a voice who is separating herself from some in her party. We'll see if there's others when we talk to them this evening.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Very important questions to be answered for sure.</p><p>It's good to see you, Lauren. Thank you so much.</p><p>John.</p><p>BERMAN: Three years ago Lindsey Graham would be surprised by last night's Lindsey Graham.</p><p>All right, with us now is Christine Quinn, executive committee chair for the state of New York's Democratic committee, and former White House spokesperson under President George W. Bush, Pete Seat.</p><p>Friends, I'm going to change focus a little bit to this speech tomorrow night and what else the president will or will not discuss, because \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"Politico\" and a lot of people are writing this morning about what Donald Trump, the president, has not been focused as much on.</p><p>Stephen Moore, who is a fierce ally of President Trump for years and years now, raises some concerns about how this White House isn't addressing the economy so much. Stephen Moore says, quote, \"I'm nervous about it.\" Stephen Moore, a veteran outside adviser to Trump on economic issues. We have a graphic of this. \"The Trump administration needs to keep its eye on what's happening with prices. It should be a top priority. The trend is a little bit troubling.\"</p><p>What do you think of that, Pete?</p><p>PETE SEAT, VICE PRESIDENT, BOSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS GROUP: Well, presidents have to walk and chew gum at the same time. And particularly when it comes to President Donald Trump, there was a lengthy to do list that he got from the American people when he was sent back to the Oval Office. On that to do list is reducing the size and scope of the federal government and reducing federal spending. We know that massive federal spending is inflationary. You get spending down, you can help prices. It's all interconnected. I understand that folks may want to hear more about the economy and action steps, but there's a lot that needs to happen all at once, and they're tackling it. BERMAN: I - you know, it's interesting because you make the case that cutting spending is anti-inflationary. I actually haven't heard the White House or President Trump make that case yet because that could be an argument that he could try to make if he were trying to say that he is battling inflation and prices right now, but he just hasn't made it.</p><p>Christine, \"Politico\" has got a version of this, too. \"Ahead of this joint session of Congress on Tuesday, a dozen of the presidents allies, Trump aligned Republican strategists and former administration officials are warning that Trump going all in on the Muskian effort is a risky gamble that threatens to overshadow his more popular and politically crucial economic and legislative priorities.\"</p><p>CHRISTINE QUINN, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR, NEW YORK STATE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE: I think that's right. And we're seeing it both in polls where he's losing support amongst independents, among women, among Hispanics, and more people think the country's going in the wrong direction than the right direction.</p><p>But most significantly, in an organic way, we're seeing Americans turn out at all of these congressional town hall meetings, make their voice very clear that they may have voted for Donald Trump, but they didn't sign up for hard working Americans, veterans, being laid off without any real analysis of whether their job is critical to the country, and whether it's a job that should remain or be cut.</p><p>[09:10:18]</p><p>That's not the Donald Trump they voted for. They want prices to go down. They want their pocketbook to go further, not shorter. And that's what's happening.</p><p>BERMAN: What do Democrats do, should they do in your mind tomorrow night during this speech? We've heard from members of Congress who are not going because they don't want to have to sit through it. We've heard from members of Congress, Chris Van Hollen, a senator, saying he's bringing people involved in some of the lawsuits against the administration on these layoffs. How do you think they should behave?</p><p>QUINN: Well, I think the Democrats, us Democrats, we need to hit back hard. We need to stop being the party that takes it on the chin, that turns the other cheek. We need to be as tough on Donald Trump as he has been on us. I think for some people, like Senator Murphy from Connecticut, not going and being a real leader and a voice of opposition is the right answer. I also think bringing people who symbolize who Trump has forgotten can work. But what can't work is just sitting in your seat being angry and discouraged. We need to fight back.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, Pete, how about Republicans? How about those Republicans, like James Lankford? How about those Republicans like Mitch McConnell? I guess the former Lindsey Graham, who were supportive of Ukraine's efforts to beat back the Russian invasion, how will they feel tomorrow night if we see more of the Oval Office Friday version of President Trump in this address to Congress? SEAT: Well, I think it's absurd to say that we are abandoning an ally after what occurred on Friday in the Oval Office. If we were abandoning allies, the president of the United States would not have met with the president of France, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and the president of Ukraine in the span of just a couple of days at the White House. He hosted all of them. He would not have sat next to the president of Ukraine in the Oval Office, which clearly and obviously annoyed Vladimir Putin. He wouldn't have had a mineral deal literally on the table in the East Room, ready to be signed. That also annoyed Vladimir Putin.</p><p>So, to think that we're abandoning an ally I think is farcical, and I'm sure we're all going to be watching and listening very intently for what the president may or may not say about that, and the next steps in the negotiations. But that's the key here, there needs to be a negotiated end to this conflict. It is the only path forward.</p><p>BERMAN: Look, the Kremlin doesn't sound annoyed this morning. I will say that. They say its - they're basically celebrating the fact that U.S. foreign policy seems to, in their words, now align with theirs. We'll see what the next 48 hours holds.</p><p>Christine Quinn, Pete Seat, thanks, both, so much. Great to see you.</p><p>So, amid all of this, as we've been saying, the president will speak to Congress tomorrow night. Join CNN for all the coverage. It begins tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m.</p><p>Kate.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Firefighters are battling more than 175 wildfires across North and South Carolina. Evacuations ordered. A statewide burn ban in place. We're going to take you there for the latest.</p><p>Tariffs. They're coming. That's the message from the commerce secretary, just as he also says very quickly, quote, \"it's a fluid situation\" and maybe an understatement of the year. So, what does it mean for American consumers?</p><p>And all of the highlights from Oscars night. The fashion, the winners, the speeches. They're still talking about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIERAN CULKIN, ACTOR: But it was just over a year ago. She said, I will give you four when you win an Oscar. I held my hand out. She shook it. And I have not brought it up once until just now. You remember that, honey? You do? OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:18:29]</p><p>BOLDUAN: The scene in South Carolina over the weekend, emergency responders, residents rushing to get out of the way of fast burning fires that erupted there. One forest fire near Myrtle Beach has burned upwards of 1,600 acres and is about 30 percent contained now. Residents who were evacuated, they were allowed to be back into their homes Sunday evening. So, some good news there.</p><p>Several fires were also reported in North Carolina, threatening some of the areas still recovering from the disaster that was left behind from Hurricane Helene.</p><p>Let's talk about that. Joining me right now is Bobby Arledge. He's the director of the Polk County Emergency Management in North Carolina.</p><p>Thank you so much for taking some time.</p><p>What is the very latest on the fires, on the situation in your county right now?</p><p>BOBBY ARLEDGE, POLK COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: Good morning. In Polk County this morning, the fire is 481 acres. We're about 30 percent containment as of this morning.</p><p>BOLDUAN: I've seen that the weather forecast is supposed to improve today kind of by and large. Winds dying down. Cooler temperatures setting in. What's that going to mean for your crews?</p><p>ARLEDGE: It's a big help for our crews, especially with the winds. On the first day of the - the first day of the - of the fire, you know, winds were pushing the fire everywhere. With the winds being calmed down, we're able to get lines in, reinforce lines we've already got, do some back burn operations and, you know, protect structures that are in danger.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Now we're also - as I mentioned, we're also talking about an area that is still recovering from the horrible effects of Hurricane Helene.</p><p>[09:20:01]</p><p>Now, add all of this now in. I mean, what have these natural disasters done to the region? What have they meant for your county?</p><p>ARLEDGE: This county and this - this area that it hit, it was one of the hardest hit by Helene. The whole county was hit. But this area that we're in, with this fire up here, was - was one of the worst - worst areas impacted by Helene. So, they're still in the midst of cleaning up. You know, we still have damage to structures. We still have people trying to get their lives back together and now we have this. So, it's just - it's heartbreaking for - for us, as emergency responders, for these folks that's still trying to get their lives back together.</p><p>BOLDUAN: I mean are we talking about, you know, people who lost, you know, everything in Hurricane Helene, they're trying to pick up the pieces, trying to, you know, many of them trying to rebuild their homes. I now these are some of the very same homes that are now threatened by these fires? ARLEDGE: Some are, yes.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Do - do you have everything - do you have everything you need? Do you need help? How's the - what's the coordination with the state? What about with - from the federal government as well?</p><p>ARLEDGE: State has been great. They've offered, you know, additional fire resources for us. So, they're here on the ground with us working. We've had, you know, tremendous turnout from our mutual aid partners throughout North Carolina and South Carolina. We've got - you know, we've got fire departments from North and South Carolina here working the fire, trying to give some of our local guys a break that were here for the first couple days. So, we've had really good luck, you know, with state partners.</p><p>BOLDUAN: That's great to hear.</p><p>Bobby Arledge, thank you very much for taking the time. Good luck out there. My goodness.</p><p>ARLEDGE: Thank you.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Coming up for us, this morning, scientists are warning that lives could be at risk after the Trump administration fired hundreds of people in charge of forecasting the weather. We're going to dig into that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:26:26]</p><p>BOLDUAN: President Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico expected to go into effect tonight at midnight. But how high will they go? And could they still be pushed off another time? Key and significant questions about Trump's trade moves with Canada, Mexico and China included. Even just hours left - with even just hours left before they're supposed to be setting in.</p><p>According to Trump's commerce secretary, the situation is fluid. President Trump, last month, proposed a 25 percent tariff on both Canada and Mexico. Leaders in almost every industry have also then warned that if those tariffs, when those tariffs set in, it's going to raise prices on everything from shoes, to electronics, from groceries, to cars.</p><p>Investor Warren Buffett, he just weighed in for the first time, saying that he thinks tariffs could trigger inflation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How do you think tariffs will affect the economy?</p><p>WARREN BUFFETT, CEO, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: I mean tariffs are actually - we've had a lot of experience with them. They're - they're an act of war to some degree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How do you think tariffs will impact inflation?</p><p>BUFFETT: Over time they're a tax on - on goods. I mean, you know, the tooth fairy doesn't pay them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLDUAN: Donald Trump's treasury secretary, though, pushing back on those inflation fears.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT BESSENT, TREASURY SECRETARY: We have the experience of President Trump's first term, where the tariffs, they did not affect prices. And it's a holistic approach that there will be tariffs, there will be cuts in regulation, there will be cheaper energy. So, I would expect that very quickly we will be down to the Fed's 2 percent target. So, I'm expecting inflation to continue dropping over the year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLDUAN: Joining us right now is Mark Zandi. He's the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, of course.</p><p>It's good to see you again, Mark.</p><p>So, what we just heard there from the Treasury secretary is something that I've heard multiple times now in interviews with Donald Trump's top trade adviser. The tariffs are not going to cost consumers more in driving up prices. What do you say to that?</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: I'm with Warren Buffett. I think they're going to raise prices. They're attacks on American consumers.</p><p>I mean if you add up all of the tariffs that are now in play, those that have already been imposed, like the 10 percent on China, and those that are being discussed, like the 25 percent on Canadian and Mexican imports, add that all up, Kate. That will add about $1,250 to the typical American's bill over a period of a year. So that gives you kind of context.</p><p>And, you know, that assumes that the price increases related to the tariffs are kind of one off. You know, they're just - they - everyone passes those through to American consumers. That's the end of the story.</p><p>But I'm not so sure that's going to be the case this go around because the inflationary backdrop in the current environment is very different than the one in President Trump's first term. Back then, the problem was inflation was too low. Inflation expectations were nonexistent. Today, because of what we've - Americans have gone through, all the inflation that they've suffered, inflation expectations are very fragile.</p><p>So, this increase in tariffs could be more persistent and more of a problem. And I don't think we're going to get back to the Federal Reserve's target if these tariffs go - go through.</p><p>BOLDUAN: That's exactly what I was going to ask you. I mean the two - saying that 2 percent inflation target is going - they're going to be able to hit it quickly, now with tariffs setting in, I mean does that at all seem reasonable?</p><p>ZANDI: Not in the near term, no.

However, what has meteorologists and state officials especially concerned this year is a record-setting dry spell in the Northeast that is fueling a sharp rise in wildfires and their explosive growth.</p><p>The Northeast, like the vast majority of the country, is suffering from abnormally dry conditions, and many states are experiencing severe and extreme drought, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?NJ\">U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln</url>.</p><h>What states and cities have gone without measurable rain?</h><p>On Sunday evening and into the overnight hours, some showers brought the first rain in months to parts of the Mid-Atlantic, including New York City, where 0.17 inches of rain fell \u2013 the only rainfall the metropolitan area has picked up since late September.</p><p>In New Jersey, the dry spell has smashed records in multiple cities. As of Friday, Trenton had gone 41 days without measurable rain \u2013 the prior record was 36 in the fall of 1924. Newark has gone 40 days without measurable rainfall, flying past the previous record of 26 days set in the spring of 1949.</p><p>Similarly, Philadelphia went at least 40 days without rain, breaking the record of 29 days set in 1874.</p><p>Both New Jersey and Delaware reported their driest October on record this year, according to the National Weather Service.</p><h>Are wildfires common in the Northeast?</h><p>Wildfires torch thousands of acres of land in Northeast states each year, though they are most common in the spring.</p><p>In New Jersey, 1,500 wildfires damage or destroy 7,000 acres of forests annually, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/#:~:text=On%20average%20of%201%2C500%20wildfires,New%20Jersey\">according to the state's forest fire service</url>. State officials say that while the high season is in the spring, leaves in the fall months add extra fuel and lead to more blazes, especially when the region is experiencing unusually dry conditions.</p><p> In New York, where thousands of acres of land are engulfed in <url normalizedValue=\"https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/wildfires\">wildfires each year</url>, the state says that 47% of all wildfires occur from March 15 to May 15.</p><p>About 15 wildland fires are reported each October in Massachusetts. This year, the month\u2019s total reached 200, an increase of about 1,200%. The spike, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-wildland-fires-spiked-1200-in-october\">state's Department of Fire Services</url>, rivals \"the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.\"</p><p>Just last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-conservation-recreation\">Massachusetts officials</url> raised the drought level to \"significant\" and \"critical\" throughout the state. Fire authorities reported on Saturday that firefighters were battling at least 175 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/10/28/massachusetts-brush-fires-wildfires-live-updates/\">blazes</url>.</p><h>What regions have been under alerts or warnings about wildfire risk?</h><p>Areas from Washington, D.C., to New England had been under advisories in the past week about heightened risks of wildfires. </p><p>On Saturday, for example, there were red flag warnings in place in the New York metropolitan area, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts as strong winds, relatively low humidity and dry conditions endured, the National Weather Service said. Most of those warnings had expired by Sunday night, but officials urged residents to not let their guard down and to exercise caution with potential ignition sources such as machinery, cigarettes or matches.</p><h>When will the drought end in the Northeast? </h><p>Meteorologists say it's unlikely more rain will alleviate the widespread dry conditions across the Northeast.</p><p>Storms are forecast to barrel toward the region over the next two weeks, potentially bringing rain to New York City and southern New England; however, the showers will be limited and are not projected to soak the dry soil for any meaningful period of time.</p><p>\"While that more active pattern will bring some opportunities for rain this week, it does not guarantee that every spot will get enough rain to keep the fire potential at bay,\" said John Feerick, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. \"Some locations could go at least a full week without a drop of rain.\"</p><p>On Thursday, a front from the Midwest is expected to arrive in the Northeast and it could bring some tropical moisture with it. But, it won't be the large storm that the Northeast needs for sustained relief, Feerick said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Contributing: John Bacon and Jorge L.

The author, founder of the Maui Institute and author of<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Men Are Easy</emphasis>(2007), lays out basic concepts of systems theory and complexity theory from the last half-century and integrates them into a grand framework based on Lenard Troncale's systems processes theory, uniting physical, biological, and cultural aspects of the world. </p><p>Rasmussen covers ideas including self-organization, the process by which simple individual actions yield complex, emergent group behaviors (as when individual birds that instinctively follow a few rules on how to position themselves beside each other become exquisitely coordinated flocks); the structure of networks; chaotic systems like weather and financial markets, in which tiny changes in inputs can generate huge, unpredictable storms or sell-offs; nested fractal patterns visible in everything from lightning strikes to broccoli to bitcoin values; and the breakthrough process of \"systems ontogenesis,\" in which low-level complexity makes a quantum leap to higher-level complexity (as when an assortment of organic molecules assembles itself into a living cell, or farming villages organize themselves into a state). In later chapters, the author applies these notions to higher-order phenomena like consciousness-slime molds, she notes, can do impressive cognitive feats like navigating mazes. Rasmussen's treatise unfolds in concise, well-organized chapters that contain a wealth of instructive photos and charts. She conveys sometimes abstruse scientific concepts in prose that's admirably lucid, straightforward, and intuitively appealing. (\"Self-organizing criticality is the point of catastrophic change to the system...The sandpile after an avalanche has flattened, and its parameters have changed. A pandemic spreads until enough people either die or are immune, and the pandemic ends. A spark leads to a forest fire, leaving ash and debris.\") The result is a fine introduction for lay readers to systems theory that reveals its fertile insights in many ingenious guises.  A fascinating vision of the world as a kaleidoscope of patterns on the smallest and largest scales.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2024-09-04</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>The Maui Institute</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>NonFiction</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$9.99</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Rasmussen, Lynn</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000262903</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C7K-CN11-DYRM-F0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 15, 2024, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N611110QM</classCode><className>PRIMARY SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N610000CC</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N611110QM</classCode><className>PRIMARY SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting from Hacettepe University by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires have devastating effects on biodiversity, climate, and humans. Producing detailed and reliable forest fire susceptibility maps is crucial for disaster management.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Hacettepe University: \"Data-driven machine learning methods can be applied for forest fire susceptibility mapping, and learning data required for this purpose can be obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery along with a fire inventory. In this study, we assessed the performances of Random Forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers for producing forest fire susceptibility maps of a region in north-east Turkiye covering Trabzon, Gumushane, Rize, and Bayburt provinces using freely available Earth observation data and forest inventory provided by the regional directorate. Forest type, EU-DEM v1.1 (25 m), and tree cover density were retrieved from Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. Sentinel-2 images were utilized for calculating spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index and modified normalized difference water index to assess surface water and vegetation characteristics. Thus, a total of twelve variables including topographic, anthropogenic, hydrologic, vegetation and land use data were used as input. The RF and ANN illustrated similar prediction performances based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values, which were 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. The RF performed better in terms of overall accuracy and F-1 score. The susceptibility maps with 25 m resolution were also investigated visually.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The ANN results predicted higher susceptibility levels and larger areas were found prone to wildfire. Leave-one-out analysis results indicated that elevation was the most influential factor based on the achieved OA.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Susceptibility Assessment With Machine Learning Methods in North-east Turkiye.

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday to combat bird flu, which has spread to more than a quarter of all the state's dairies in the last month and infected 34 state residents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The emergency declaration expands the amount of money Newsom can spend fighting the H5N1 virus, which was first detected in California cows in August, and has swept across the nation's largest dairy-producing state. As of Monday, 649 dairies have had infections, including 313 in the last 30 days and about 120 just in a week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All human infections reported had been mild until Wednesday when federal officials said a Louisiana resident hospitalized with a presumptive bird flu infection has the first U.S. case classified as \"severe.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The person had been exposed to sick and dead birds suspected of being infected with H5N1, the Louisiana health department said last week. It is the same flu strain that sickened a teen in Canada, but not the one that has infected cattle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The exact cause of the spread among California cattle isn't clear, said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, which represents most California dairy farmers. Movement of cattle is thought to have first led to the spread, though later, shared milking equipment and personnel likely drove the infections. Testing has dramatically increased to detect outbreaks earlier, too.</p><p>What's known is the virus has substantial effects on the cows that produce tens of thousands of gallons of milk each year, the farmworkers who care for the livestock, and farmers trying to keep businesses afloat.</p><p>\"You do not want this on your herd,\" Raudabaugh said. \"It's that bad.\"</p><p>Consumers shouldn't see impacts to pasteurized milk, cheese, or yogurt at their grocery stores, said Raudabaugh. The pasteurization process destroys the virus's ability to live or replicate, making pasteurized milk safe.</p><p>However, raw milk has been shown to contain the virus. Two raw milk producers in California have had to recall products due to virus present in unpasteurized milk, including one product announced Saturday.</p><p>There have now been 61 confirmed human cases of bird flu in the U.S. during 2024, according to the CDC.</p><p>What happens to dairies</p><p>affected by bird flu?</p><p>Over the long term, Raudabaugh worries about farms' ability to recoup losses in milk production when cows recover.</p><p>California has approximately 1,100 dairies, mostly concentrated in the state's fertile Central Valley, that produce approximately 41 billion gallons of milk annually for an economic value of nearly $20 billion as of 2018, according to a 2019 University of California, Davis, analysis for the California Milk Advisory Board.</p><p>Bird flu was first detected in Texas dairies in the spring after officials believe one herd was infected by wild birds. So far, 16 states have had outbreaks in cows, with 865 herds affected. Three-quarters of infected herds come from California.</p><p>In California, outbreaks in dairies started in and around Tulare County, before moving up and down the Central Valley and now trekking northward, Raudabaugh said.</p><p>What does a state</p><p>of emergency do?</p><p>California's declaration opens up more funding to respond to the crisis, similar to a natural disaster like a forest fire.</p><p>The proclamation by Newsom, a Democrat, allows the state to streamline and expedite resources to address the rapid spread of bird flu across the state, his office said in a news release.</p><p>\"This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"Building on California's testing and monitoring system - the largest in the nation - we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information.\"</p><p>Over the summer, Colorado experienced large bird flu outbreaks among poultry and cattle that led to several outbreaks among livestock workers. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, issued a disaster declaration then to help poultry farms.</p><p>What happens to cows</p><p>and other animals with bird flu?</p><p>The H5N1 virus typically doesn't kill cows the way it does birds and chickens. Estimates have placed mortality rates in cows at no more than 2%.</p><p>Once cows are sick, their digestion process of ruminating stops, they stop drinking water, and they develop a fever, Raudabaugh said. In triple-digit Central Valley temperatures, this may have resulted in some cows dying from heat stress in a hot October. The cool fall and winter months in California have meant fewer cows are getting severely ill and dying, she said.</p><p>Before cows develop these symptoms, their milk shows signs of the virus, Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, an organization representing veterinarians who treat cows, previously told USA TODAY. Bulk milk testing can help detect bird flu circulating in herds before large outbreaks occur.</p><p>After a fever breaks, cows resume eating, drinking and ruminating. The milk production then returns over several weeks, but it still levels out about 20% to 30% less than before a bird flu infection, said Dr. Michael Payne, a researcher and outreach coordinator at the Western Institute of Food Safety and Security, a center within the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine.</p><p>Cats have also gotten sick with bird flu circulating in cows. When officials first identified bird flu in Texas cows, they did so, in part, from dead cats that likely drank raw milk in barns. Last week, Los Angeles County health officials identified two indoor cats that died from suspected bird flu infections after they drank recalled raw milk.</p><p>What happens to people</p><p>with bird flu?</p><p>So far, most people infected with bird flu in the U.S. have had mild infections. The risk to the general public remains low, though livestock workers are at heightened risk, officials have said.</p><p>Of the 61 identified people infected with bird flu across the U.S., more than half have been in California, CDC data shows.</p><p>Only one of the U.S. cases, a child in the San Francisco Bay Area, has had no connection to a dairy or poultry farm. State officials said the child had only mild symptoms of cold and flu.</p><p>The state's 33 remaining cases have been in dairy workers. Their symptoms have typically been limited to eye redness and mild respiratory symptoms, and they soon recovered.</p><p>Officials and experts worry about the potential for the virus to mix with the seasonal flu, which could lead it to become more transmissible or severe. The CDC has sought to vaccinate livestock workers against seasonal flu to prevent this.</p><p>Despite quarantines of farms, outbreaks continue to occur, which suggests other routes of transmission, Payne, of UC Davis, said in an email.</p><p>These may include potential spread from wildlife such as rodents or birds living on or near farms. Additionally, flying insects and even dust plumes in the wind may are being studied, Payne said. \"As a whole, we still have a lot more to learn about the multiple ways the (bird flu) virus is being spread through our domestic species,\" he said.</p><p>In December, the USDA announced it would begin bulk testing of milk supplies to track the virus.</p><p>Given the rapid spread in California dairies, Raudabaugh said the U.S. needs to pursue a vaccine development \"Operation Warp Speed\" for cows, on par with the one during the Trump administration that rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines for people.</p><p>Bird flu \"has been so catastrophic for our herds,\" Raudabaugh said. \"We have to do something really drastic in order to prevent this. Relying on herd immunity is not a good strategy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa3041264216</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DPB-F1C3-RX25-R1TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 20, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Dresden, Germany, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Using the liverwort Hygrobiella laxiflora as an example, this study aims to investigate the impact of climate change on montane species and their ecosystems. The study area is the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in Germany and the Czech Republic, where Hygrobiella laxifolia has an isolated occurrence in deeply carved gorges characterized by a specific microclimate (cellar climate).\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from European Union from the Regional Development Fund. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Technical University Dresden (TU Dresden), \"The focus is on determining the rate at which populations are affected. After little change in the population over a long period, a sudden sharp decline has been observed in recent years. The decline correlates with the mass proliferation of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) observed since 2017, which has led to a strong thinning of the forests in the area. In many areas of occurrence, the forests now have a much sparser tree layer or none at all. Competition from other, more competitive species also plays an important role as a cause of decline, as these have spread more widely on the sites due to the now higher light levels. The severe bark beetle infestation and the large-scale forest fire of 2022 both represent events that led to the almost complete deforestation of large parts of the study area, which was previously unknown on this scale. Since both the bark beetle infestation and the forest fire are strongly intensified by climate change, we assume that climate change is the main reason for the decline of Hygrobiella laxifolia in the area. The populations of Hygrobiella laxifolia of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains show some morphological peculiarities. As two new species have recently been described within Hygrobiella, we have integrated a sample from the area into a molecular phylogeny of Hygrobiella based on the plastid sequences of trnL-trnF intergenic spacer and matK to clarify the relationships.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The sample from Elbe Sandstone Mountains fits well into the clade of Hygrobiella laxifolia.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Too Warm and Too Dry-decline and Threat of the Subarctic-subalpine Liverwort &lt;i&gt;hygrobiella Laxifolia&lt;/i&gt; In a Low Mountain Range In Central Europe Under the Conditions of Climate Change.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Assessing and predicting forest fires has long been an arduous task.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Forest Grassland Fire Disaster Scene Three-dimensional Wind Field Detection Technology And Key Equipment Research; China Fire And Rescue Institute And Emergency Management-level Project. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"Nowadays, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have provided a novel solution to forest fire occurrence assessment and prediction. In this research, we developed a novel hybrid machine-learning-technique algorithm to improve forest fire prediction based on random forest (RF), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), support vector machine (SVM), and other machine learning models. The dataset we employed was satellite fire point data from 2010 to 2018 from the Chinese Department of Fire Prevention. The efficacy and performance of our methods were examined by validating the model fit and predictive capability.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results showed that the ensemble model LR (logistic regression)-RF-SVM-GBDT outperformed the single RFSVMGBDT model and the LR-RF-GBDT integrated framework, displaying higher accuracy and greater robustness. We believe that our newly developed hybrid machine-learning algorithm has the potential to improve the accuracy of predicting forest fire occurrences, thus enabling more efficient firefighting efforts and saving time and resources.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An Ensemble Model for Forest Fire Occurrence Mapping in China.

According to news originating from Melbourne, Australia, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Wildfires generate substantial smoke containing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that adversely impacts health.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Australian Research Council. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Monash University: \"This study develops machine learning models integrating pre-wildfire factors like weather and fuel conditions with post-wildfire health impacts to provide a holistic understanding of smoke exposure risks. Various data-driven models including Support Vector Regression, Multi-layer Perceptron, and three tree-based ensemble algorithms (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost)) are evaluated in this study. Ensemble models effectively predict PM2.5 levels based on temperature, humidity, wind, and fuel moisture, revealing the significant roles of radiation, temperature, and moisture. Further modelling links smoke exposure to deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer using age, sex, and pollution type as inputs.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Ambient pollution is the primary driver of COPD mortality, while age has a greater influence on lung cancer deaths. This research advances atmospheric and health impact understanding, aiding forest fire prevention and management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Data-Driven PM2.5 Exposure Prediction in Wildfire-Prone Regions and Respiratory Disease Mortality Risk Assessment.

According to news reporting originating from Belgrade, Serbia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The tourism sector, which is a significant driver of economic development, is particularly vulnerable to the risks of forest fires.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Belgrade: \"Forest fires are a natural disaster that can have enormous consequences for tourism. This paper analyses the possibility of forest fires occurrence and their impact on tourist facilities in the Sokobanja municipality. Forest fires can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic impact. For the purposes of this analysis data about land cover, relief characteristics (slope and aspect) and distance from roads and settlements were used and processed in GIS environment (open source software 'QGIS'). Based on the forest fire susceptibility index, areas with different degrees of endangerment were identified, which were then overlapped with the locations of tourist facilities.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The applied methodology can be used except for the identification of endangered areas and the prediction of the degree of danger to the tourist offer and for the planning of appropriate prevention measures.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: GIS analysis of the forest fire occurrence possibilities and their impact on tourism offer of the Sokobanja municipality.

According to news reporting out of New Delhi, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Recurring forest fires disturb ecological balance, impact socio-economic harmony, and raise global concern. This study implements multiple statistical and weighted modelling approaches to identify forest fire susceptibility zones in Eastern India.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Taiwan National Science And Technology Council. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Jawaharlal Nehru University: \"Six models, namely, Frequency Ratio (FR), Certainty Factor (CF), Natural Risk Factor (NRF), Bivariate statistical (Wi and Wf), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Logistic Regression (LR) were used in the study. Forest fire inventory (2001 to 2018) mapping was done using forest fire points captured by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. Fire responsible components, namely, topography (which has four variables), climate (5), biophysics (8) and disturbance (4) were used as inputs to the modelling approaches. Multicollinearity analysis was carried out to examine the association and remove the highly-correlated variables before performing the modeling. Validation of model prediction levels was done using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC curve-AUC) value. The results reveal that the areas with west and southwest orientations, and moderate slope demarcate higher susceptibility to forest fire. High precipitation areas with lower temperature but ample solar radiation increase their susceptibility to forest fire.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Mixed deciduous forest type with ample solar radiation, higher NDVI, lower NDWI and lower TWI values exhibits higher susceptibility. Model validation shows that LR (with AUC = 0.809) outperforms other models used in the study. To minimize the risk of fire and frame with proper management plans for the study area, susceptibility mapping using satellite imageries, GIS technique, and modelling approaches is highly recommended.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Susceptibility Zonation in Eastern India Using Statistical and Weighted Modelling Approaches.

I suppose it is the way of things: Once we fought to create a place of our own, and now we'll divide that into halves of a dissonant argument. Then maybe we'll keep slicing it up because somewhere along the way we lost the ability to keep our minds open to the possibility that other opinions matter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm not exactly sure where we went wrong, but it probably has something to do with the invention of decaf coffee.</p><p>The experiences of my fellow Americans seem to differ so greatly from one another, that we cannot imagine the other's to be real or true, valid, or of value.</p><p>We argue for our causes with passion and a kind of righteous assuredness that this issue, or that one, is the crux of the complicated circumstance in which we find ourselves. Is it the literature in libraries we are to blame? The environmentalists and their stunted policies? Gender confusion or taxing the wealthy? The right? The left? Most important is that blame is assigned.</p><p>It's times like these I appreciate my lack of conviction. It is also when I most want to retreat into a natural world that seems to be more patient in its progress, more accommodating to a world order of accommodation and acceptance. But most of all, I'm soothed by the knowledge that it is going to far outlive our yard signs and our rhetoric.</p><p>It's a good time to be a nihilist and lean heavily on none of this matters. It's also a good time to be a person of religion and lean heavily on faith. I just keep leaning on the trees.</p><p>They are stoic and patient things, except for perhaps those ponderosas, what with their fast growth and crowding. They choke out the fir saplings on my property until they are spindly things with a thousand hopeless branches looking for sun they'll never see. When they die, they are the kindling of a future forest fire.</p><p>The few birch that have survived climate change are growing in their own isolated copse in the draw on the southwest corner. They don't mingle beyond this place, like a group of girls that always plays together at recess and never lets anyone join. To the north are the cedars, looking parched either out of protest about my house or the longer summers.</p><p>I planted some more deciduous trees: bright red maples, dogwood. Things the garden store told me would grow well and make shade, but I wouldn't have to wait a generation to notice. Turns out the moose really like those, so I won't have to wait at all. Freshly planted but unfenced trees are the Michelin of moose restaurants.</p><p>I'm almost relieved to have something acutely relevant to fret about. I'd rather look out my window at a snapped maple than at the headlines. Mental hygiene during election season consists mostly of burying my head in the sand and pretending my panic attacks are just too much coffee. Then I worry about the collective of my fellow country folk. You must be exhausted. How will we care for each other after this?</p><p>One thing is for certain: We're all going to need some care.</p><p>When I work in my yard, it is with a pair of small garden shears. I clip carefully away at twigs and overgrowth for hours, then stand back to see if any difference has been made. It's slow work, but I become intimately familiar with the land and flora. I begin to understand why this tree won't grow, or how too much clearing in one area invites bothersome things. I get curious, which is the only way to be, because I really know nothing about trees and plants and this leaves me to just wondering.</p><p>This is also true about so many of the things that matter deeply to half our population, issues of which I have little experience or understanding. I want to dive in there with my pruning shears and cut away the blame and vitriol, get to down to the soil and gain knowledge, not for the sake of weaponizing it, as we often do, but for the sake of compassion and empathy.</p><p>I want to learn how to see the forest for the trees. I hope next week, we can all take a collective breath and do the same.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-43329877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DBR-2NY1-JC0C-J14T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 31, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1LG</classCode><className>SPOKANE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Cardinals have three games left in 2024 until Mid-American Conference play starts in January. Head coach Michael Lewis is worried about his team's ability to compete. \"Definitely worried about it. No question, I'm worried about it,\" Lewis said. </p><p>\"I'm really concerned because I thought we got better in Florida. [The struggles] came back, and maybe we're just gonna fight that all year.\" When they ended their three-game stretch in the Gulf Coast Showcase 10 days ago, the third-year Cardinals' coach believed they were in a good spot. He thought they were taking the correct steps to become a team. Today's 82-69 road defeat to SIU Edwardsville - amongst other things - proved to him that was not the case. \"We didn't practice particularly well when we got back,\" he said. I don't know if [it was us] playing [three straight] games, and then all of a sudden you don't have something on your calendar for over a week. I know really good teams that I've been around. It didn't matter if it was practice or a game, those dudes were wired up. \"They were wired up to compete and get better and push each other in practice. We don't have enough of that.\" But it's not just him. Redshirt senior center Ben Hendriks - who had a season-high 13 points in the loss and is the longest-tenured Cardinal - was equally as frustrated. \"Down the line, it doesn't matter who it is,\" Hendriks said. \"If we want to start winning games, it's just our mentality. We've got to change.\" Though the contest became one that had coaches and players alike scratching their heads after its conclusion, the Cardinals had some of the best play this season in the opening half. Junior guard Juanse Gorosito was 5-for-8 from 3-point range and had 15 points at halftime. \"Most of the guys were [creating shots] for me, and I was able to knock it down for the team,\" he said. \"So at the end of the day, those shots were created by my teammates, and I think that's the reason why we were playing well.\" Ball State's bench had its moments and 18 points to SIUE's six. But near the end of the second half, things started to shift. The Cougars went on an 8-0 scoring run to end the first half, only trailing the Cardinals 41-39.</p><p>But after the Cardinals returned to the court to play the rest of the game, everything changed. \"We weren't nearly as efficient in execution,\" Lewis said. \"You come out of a timeout, and these things are inexcusable. It's on me, because obviously, a guy or two didn't understand coming out of the huddle, and you can't execute a play. You got guys in the wrong spots, and we're not mature enough as players to understand and play through that. It's gotta be perfect for [our] guys.\" There were multiple points where the Cardinals could have come back in the game. But miscues and poor decision-making allowed them to go down as much as 15 when they led the Cougars by nine earlier in the game. To Lewis, the aftermath of the loss showcased what the issue with this roster is. \"In the locker room tonight after the game, I stood in there and listened to us chatter,\" he said. \"We had one guy talking. We got one guy talking about things that have to be corrected, things that we got to be better at, and everybody else was feeling sorry for themselves.\" During his tenure at Ball State, Lewis has spoken about how basketball can prepare athletes for life outside of the game. He spoke about it again today, but his tone was different. He believes this team might not be ready for those challenges. \"You can learn everything you need to learn from this game to be successful in life,\" he said. \"...It may not be in the cards for you to be a professional basketball player. It's not in the cards for a majority of the people, right? But you can learn from this game what it takes to be successful. We are failing miserably at understanding some of those things, and that it's a direct reflection on me.\" But there was one thing that he kept going back to: the Cardinals' competitiveness. \"I think we lack competitiveness and that really doesn't sit well with me, because I'm sitting in this seat because I was a competitor,\" he said. \"I wasn't a great athlete... I've been [in places] where if a practice wasn't going well, you just made it competitive. You had two or three guys that would just raise it to a new level [and] that would bring everybody up. \"That's what I'm concerned about in life. If you're just going to take what somebody gives you, it's going to be a long and lonely life. You've got to be able to fight, scratch and claw. Because, trust me, man, life doesn't care. They don't care who you are, where you come from, what you're like. They'll just eat you up if you don't have some competitiveness and figure out ways to be successful.\" During the presser, the two athletes who sat next to him - Gorosito and Hendriks - didn't look surprised by their coach's demeanor. At one point, Gorosito dropped an 'mmhmm' after Lewis called his team out about their spirit. When Hendriks was asked about his stance on the team's issues, he was honest just like his head coach. \"I'd say I have a lot more experience than guys in a college [basketball] environment,\" Hendriks said. \"But I think a good way to talk about it is like a forest fire starts somewhere. It's just got to burn through everybody. Maybe it's me or somebody else, [but] we just got to figure out someone to start a little fire that'll cause a giant fire for the whole team to get going.\" Ball State will have another long decent break until they head to Bellarmine Saturday, Dec. 14. Tip-off is set for 3 p.m. With the days getting closer and closer to the MAC season, Lewis believes the team is in a spot where they need to find themselves. And it has to happen sooner than later. \"I said it to somebody this past week, we haven't had a fight in two years,\" Lewis said. \"We had a fight my first year [here]... I'm not encouraging fighting. We stop it and all that, but we don't have enough competitive fire within our group to improve.\" Contact Zach Carter via email at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:zachary.carter@bsu.edu\">zachary.carter@bsu.edu</email> or via X @ZachCarter85.</p><p>Read More</p><p>Delta's Jordan Furney voted as Delaware County Athlete of the Week</p><p>By Staff Reports</p><p>/</p><p>4 hours ago</p><p>Delta senior boys' basketball player Jordan Furney was named the Delaware County Athlete of the Week for the week of Monday, Nov. 25 to Saturday, Nov. 30</p><p>Winter graduation offers financial and career advantages</p><p>By Meghan Braddy</p><p>/</p><p>8 hours ago</p><p>Ball State's winter commencement helped Alissa Kizer save money and launch her career early.</p><p>Delta beats Centerville 45-40 at home</p><p>By Logan Connor</p><p>/</p><p>18 hours ago</p><p>Comments</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6008253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DKX-FX61-JBSN-311W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily: Ball State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 8, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>BALL STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Muncie</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>IN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Business &amp;

According to news reporting from Nanchang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and social networks, taking into account the social attributes of objects and diversifying the relationship between humans and objects, which overcomes the limitations of the IoT's focus on associations between objects. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly evolving.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from East China Jiaotong University, \"It is critical to build trustworthy and transparent systems, especially with system security issues coming to the surface. This paper emphasizes the social attributes of objects and uses hypergraphs to model the diverse entities and relationships in SIoT, aiming to build an SIoT hypergraph generation model to explore the complex interactions between entities in the context of intelligent SIoT. Current hypergraph generation models impose too many constraints and fail to capture more details of real hypernetworks. In contrast, this paper proposes a hypergraph generation model that evolves dynamically over time, where only the number of nodes is fixed. It combines node wandering with a forest fire model and uses two different methods to control the size of the hyperedges. As new nodes are added, the model can promptly reflect changes in entities and relationships within SIoT. Experimental results exhibit that our model can effectively replicate the topological structure of realworld hypernetworks.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We also evaluate the vulnerability of the hypergraph under different attack strategies, which provides theoretical support for building a more robust intelligent SIoT hypergraph model and lays the foundation for building safer and more reliable systems in the future.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Dynamic Hypergraph Modeling and Robustness Analysis for Siot.

This material is stated to consist of:</p><p>...residuals that are equivalent to traditional cellulosic biomass (i.e., harvested, plant-derived organic matter).</p><p>Such material is stated to be clean when it contains contaminants at concentration levels no higher than those normally associate with virgin biomass material. See for reference 40 C.F.R. 241.2.</p><p>Cellulosic biomass is typically described as a renewable organic material that can be used to produce biofuels, chemicals, and other materials. . They are typically sourced from non-food crops or agricultural residues as opposed to first-generation biofuels. Examples might include wood, grasses, non-edible parts of plants, aquatic plants, and municipal waste.</p><p>Advantages of this material is its abundance, can be grown quickly, and replenished in poor soil.</p><p>An environmental benefit of cellulosic biomass biofuels is their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because their production and combustion can release fewer carbon dioxide emissions. Further, using agriculture and forestry residues in this manner can help reduce the amount of organic waste that would otherwise decompose or have to be incinerated.</p><p>The EPA Fact Sheet lists as examples of this material as including (but not limited to):</p><p>Agricultural and forest-derived biomass.</p><p>Urban wood.</p><p>Corn stover and other biomass crops used specifically for the production of cellulosic biofuels.</p><p>Bagasse and other crop residues.</p><p>Wood collected from forest fire clearance activities, trees and clean wood found in disaster debris, clean biomass from land clearing operations, and clean construction and demolition wood.</p><p>The EPA Fact Sheet addresses the following questions:</p><p>Are units that combust clean cellulosic biomass as fuel regulated as solid waste incinerators under the Clean Air Act? (stating they are considered equivalent to traditional fuels [i.e., not a secondary material or a solid waste when burned as fuels, unless discarded]).</p><p>What does 'unless discarded' mean in the context of clean cellulosic biomass? (cellulosic biomass that is managed separately from solid waste and is going to be burned for energy recovery would not be considered discarded, but such material that has been mixed with solid waste that has been disposed [buried in a landfill] would be considered discarded).</p><p>How does construction and demolition debris relate to the definition of clean cellulosic biomass? (notes that while clean construction and demolition wood is an example of clean cellulosic biomass, construction and demolition debris, which consist of a mixture of material resulting from construction and demolition debris is not).</p><p>What is the status of biomass that has been combined with municipal solid waste? (biomass that is combined with municipal solid waste or other types of solid waste has been discarded).</p><p>What is the status of clean cellulosic biomass that is processed to make biochar? (clean cellulosic biomass that is processed to make a biochar product using pyrolysis or a similar process would not be considered discarded and would not be a secondary material or a solid waste for purposes of the Clean Air Act).</p><p>What is the status of biomass that does not meet the definition of 'clean cellulosic biomass'?

Trump returned to the White House and, wow, what a whirlwind it has been. In the midst of the constitutional extreme event brought on by the administration, this blog post seeks to do one thing: review the emergency authorities invoked in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/\">Executive Order 14156, Declaring a National Energy Emergency, and assess what types of actions we might reasonably expect to see come from it. If reasonable expectations are applicable, anymore.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The purpose of President Trump's order is to declare a 'national energy emergency' based on his assertion that the United States has unrealized energy resources and that the previous administration's policies caused 'a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply' and 'unreliable grid;' led to high energy prices; and threaten the economy, national security, and foreign policy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/87297.pdf\">Government research and independent assessments (see, e.g., </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://rmi.org/reality-check-electricity-load-growth-does-not-have-to-undermine-climate-goals/\">here and </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://energyinnovation.org/expert-voice/the-future-of-operational-grid-reliability-can-be-bright-with-clean-energy/\">here) contradict President Trump's findings about insufficient energy supply and grid unreliability. In fact, fossil fuel production reached record levels under President Biden. Nevertheless, based on the declared emergency, Trump directs agencies to bolster fossil fuel infrastructure through a series of actions described in the order.</url></p><p>As a general matter, the President derives emergency powers from the Constitution and statutes. Although presidential emergency powers can be quite expansive, the Supreme Court made clear in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf\">Biden v. Nebraska that emergency authority does not empower the President to take actions free from statutory limitations. In other words, announcing a 'national energy emergency,' regardless of fanfare and spectacle, does not give President Trump carte blanche to pursue his energy policy. In exercising emergency powers, the administration must act in accordance with the purposes and limitations of the laws granting those powers. Assuming, that is, that the rule of law continues to prevail in the United States.</url></p><p>Although there are several emergency authorities that Trump's administration could seek to employ\u2014and many more non-emergency legal authorities\u2014the success of this strategy may well depend in part on the legitimacy of the underlying emergency declaration. Because many authorities leave some ambiguity as to what constitutes a sufficient 'emergency,' an argument might be made that agency action taken based on a flawed emergency premise could be subject to 'arbitrary and capricious' challenges.</p><p>Executive Order 14156 cites a handful of specific statutory provisions and regulations but also asks agencies to search for any and all lawful authorities they can use to advance President Trump's energy policy, in an over-the-top, see-if-it-sticks, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach. This blog post breaks down the emergency authorities in two parts. The first examines what could be included in the sections that call upon 'any lawful emergency authorities' to carry out broad policy directives. The second evaluates the specific provisions named in the order.</p><p>Trump's reliance on 'any lawful emergency authorities'</p><p>Sections 2(a) and 3 of Executive Order 14156 contain a broad directive to agencies to develop domestic energy resources on or off federal lands by facilitating 'identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources,' with a particular focus on the West Coast, Northeast, and Alaska. To accomplish this, the Executive Order instructs agencies to rely on 'any lawful emergency authorities' available to them.</p><p>The universe of possible legal authorities related to the activities named above is vast. There are many laws that regulate the leasing of public lands for fossil fuel production and the development of fossil fuel energy infrastructure, such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and coal export terminals, oil and gas pipelines, coal rail transport, refineries, and more. Here, we categorize those legal authorities in four buckets: (1) those that contain no emergency provisions; (2) those with emergency provisions that are irrelevant to, or don't further the purpose of, increasing energy supply or addressing energy prices; (3) those with emergency authorities that require compliance with statutory criteria, including definitions of 'emergency;' and (4) those with emergency authorities that require only a presidential or congressional declaration of 'national emergency,' or give no guidance as to what qualifies as an 'emergency.'</p><p>No emergency provisions</p><p>Leasing federal lands for fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure:</p><p>Regulating refineries:</p><p>Emergency provisions are irrelevant or don't further Executive Order's purpose</p><p>Leasing federal lands for fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/chapter-35\">Federal Land Policy and Management Act: Includes, for example, emergency authorities related to search and rescue on public lands or wildfire response. 43 U.S.C.  1742, 1748a.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/CG-5PC/CG-CVC/CVC1/ocs/general/ocsla/Outer_Continental_Shelf_Lands_Act_OCSLA.pdf\">Outer Continental Shelf Land Act: Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to suspend operations of an OCS lease during a 'national emergency declared by the Congress or the President of the United States.' 43 U.S.C.  1341.

All of these authorities would fall into our 'emergency provision requiring that certain criteria be met' category.</p><p>Section 2(b) of the Executive Order directs EPA to 'consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation' using its authority under <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7545\">42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III). That provision allows EPA to 'temporarily waive a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuel [if] the Administrator determines that . . . it is in the public interest to grant the waiver (for example, when a waiver is necessary to meet projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of the fuel or fuel additive in a State or region of the Nation which cannot otherwise be compensated for).' This provision is not tied to emergency circumstances and does not specify how the 'public interest' requirement should be evaluated. However, it describes the waiver as 'temporary' in nature, which suggests that this is not meant to be a tool to bolster the 'year-round sale of E15.'</url></p><p>Section 4 of the Executive Order directs agencies to use 'the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation's energy supply' found in its regulations under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. The Army Corps of Engineers' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.swf.usace.army.mil/Portals/47/docs/regulatory/Permitting/SWFEmergencyPermitGuidanceMay2014.pdf\">guidance (also discussed above) provides that, under 'emergency situations,' permits issued by Army Corps of Engineers can proceed through the permitting process without following standard procedures. 'Emergency' is described as 'a situation which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship.' The Executive Order also references section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. EPA's regulations under the Act allow 'emergency permits [to] be issued to dump [covered] materials where there is demonstrated to exist an emergency requiring the dumping of such materials, which poses an unacceptable risk relating to human health and admits of no other feasible solution.' The regulation defines 'emergency' as 'situations requiring action with a marked degree of urgency, but is not limited in its application to circumstances requiring immediate action.' 40 C.F.R.  220.3(c).</url></p><p>Section 5 of the Executive Order directs the Department of the Interior to use its Endangered Species Act (ESA) 'regulation on consultations in emergencies, to facilitate the Nation's energy supply.' Interior's regulation provides that '[w]here emergency circumstances [involving acts of God, disasters, casualties, national defense or security emergencies, etc.] mandate the need to consult in an expedited manner, consultation may be conducted informally through alternative procedures that the Director determines to be consistent with the requirements of sections 7(a)-(d) of the Act.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-IV/subchapter-A/part-402/subpart-A/section-402.05\">50 C.F.R.  402.05(a).</url></p><p>Section 6 of the Executive Order directs the Secretary of the Interior to convene the ESA Committee (often referred to as the 'God Squad') at least quarterly to review applications for ESA exemptions. It should also convene 'to identify obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine Mammal Protection Act.' The Committee's authority to meet and review applications for exemptions is granted by section 7(e)(2) of the ESA. Exemptions must meet specific conditions described in section 7(h), which are unrelated to emergency circumstances. According to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12423\">Congressional Research Service, the Committee has only granted two exemptions in its entire history. News sources </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-resurrects-god-squad-to-bend-the-esa/\">suggest the Committee meets very rarely.</url></p><p>Section 7 of the Executive Order directs the Department of Defense to assess vulnerabilities related to 'potentially insufficient transportation and refining infrastructure across the Nation' and 'identify and recommend the requisite authorities and resources to remedy such vulnerabilities.' President Trump invoked the 'construction authority' to address identified vulnerabilities, which provides: 'In the event of . . . the declaration by the President of a national emergency . . . that requires use of the armed forces,' the Secretaries of the military departments can 'undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.' 10 U.S.C.  2808. It is doubtful that President Trump's invocation of this authority could withstand scrutiny, as there is no indication that his declared energy emergency 'requires use of the armed forces.' Further, Trump's requested assessment is redundant with the Department of Defense's existing statutory obligations to annually study its energy performance and resilience. 10 U.S.C.  2925, 2926. The Department's most recent annual report, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateandsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2023-Operational-Energy-Strategy.pdf\">2023 Operational Energy Strategy report, gives no indication of insufficient energy supply or concerns that shifting energy generation towards renewables poses a threat to military operations.</url></p><p>A few reflections on the Energy Emergency Executive Order</p><p>As with much of the Trump-Vance administration's tactics to date, Executive Order 14156 creates an unexplained and unwarranted sense of urgency around an invented crisis. It leans into an unprecedented claim of constitutional authority to aggrandize power to the executive branch, even as the administration seeks to deconstruct the agencies designed to properly exercise executive authority. A close look at the terms of the Executive Order reveals that there are many statutory provisions upon which the Trump administration could, and likely will, attempt to rely on to further its fossil fuel agenda. But, even when there are emergency authorities on point, those powers are limited, and of limited help in advancing the Executive Order's purported goals.</p><p>In addition, as discussed above, many laws include specific statutory criteria or descriptions of 'emergency' circumstances which suggest that the declared energy emergency may not qualify. Under authorities where there is more discretion afforded to the President and agencies to define 'emergency,' those seeking to challenge agency actions based on the fact that the underlying 'emergency' does not actually exist may face some headwinds. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://casetext.com/case/ctr-for-biological-diversity-v-trump\">Center for Biological Diversity v. Trump, for instance, Judge Trevor McFadden dismissed challenges to President Trump's first-term declaration under the National Emergencies Act of an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. The court rejected the plaintiff's argument that 'the Court can invalidate an otherwise lawful [emergency declaration] if the reasons justifying that action were a 'sham'' as a political question where the National Emergencies Act provides no standards by which a court can evaluate the President's motivations. At the same time, the court acknowledged that an inquiry into the basis of the emergency declaration would be permissible under arbitrary and capricious review under the Administrative Procedure Act. Following this line of reasoning, it is possible that, while agency authority that is statutorily predicated solely on a presidential declaration of emergency (e.g., 43 U.S.C.  1341) may be relatively insulated, agency authority that requires the agency to find an emergency, where the agency relies exclusively on the Executive Order, may not be.</url></p><p>There are, of course, legitimate grid reliability challenges to tackle, such as those brought on by increased extreme weather events caused by climate change. But evidence suggests that current energy supply and price conditions simply do not constitute a national emergency. And not even an Executive Order can change that.</p><p>Olivia Guarna is the Climate Justice Fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.</p><p> Michael Burger </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/directory/michael-burger\">Michael Burger is the Executive Director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and Senior Research Scholar at Columbia Law School. </url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-SCCC1000816154042845129425225100120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F4F-57X3-RTDB-6108-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567518</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3567\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news reporting originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Intense, large-scale forest fires are damaging and very challenging to control. Locations, where various types of fire behavior occur, vary depending on environmental factors.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include The Key Research And Development Plan of Jiangsu Province; The Jiangsu Modern Agricultural Machinery Equipment And Technology Demonstration And Promotion Project; The National Natural Science Foundation of China; The Jiangsu Postdoctoral Research Foundation; The Nanjing Modern Agricultural Machinery Equipment And Technological Innovation Demonstration Projects. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"According to the burning site of forest fires and the degree of damage, this paper considers the classification and identification of surface fires and canopy fires. Deep learning-based forest fire detection uses convolutional neural networks to automatically extract multidimensional features of forest fire images with high detection accuracy. To accurately identify different forest fire types in complex backgrounds, an improved forest fire classification and detection model (FCDM) based on YOLOv5 is presented in this paper, which uses image-based data. By changing the YOLOv5 bounding box loss function to SIoU Loss and introducing directionality in the cost of the loss function to achieve faster convergence, the training and inference of the detection algorithm are greatly improved. The Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is introduced in the network to fuse channel attention and spatial attention to improve the classification recognition accuracy. The Path Aggregation Network (PANet) layer in the YOLOv5 algorithm is improved into a weighted Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to fuse and filter forest fire features of different dimensions to improve the detection of different types of forest fires. The experimental results show that this improved forest fire classification and identification model outperforms the YOLOv5 algorithm in both detection performances. The mAP@0.5 of fire detection, surface fire detection, and canopy fire detection was improved by 3.9%, 4.0%, and 3.8%, respectively.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Among them, the mAP@0.5 of surface fire reached 83.1%, and the canopy fire detection reached 90.6%. This indicates that the performance of our proposed improved model has been effectively improved and has some application prospects in forest fire classification and recognition.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: FCDM: An Improved Forest Fire Classification and Detection Model Based on YOLOv5.

According to news reporting out of the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"In this study, a method for verifying the effect of cloud seeding in the case of a mixture of natural and artificial rainfall bands was proposed, and its applicability to each experimental case was evaluated.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Korea Meteorological Administration. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National Institute of Meteorological Sciences: \"Water resources that could be secured through cloud seeding were also quantified for the experiments on forest fire prevention, drought mitigation, and dust reduction in 2020. Data on numerical simulations, radar-derived rainfall, rain gauge-derived rainfall, and weather conditions were applied. Areas with seeding and nonseeding effects were classified according to the numerical simulation results and wind system, and enhanced rainfall was determined by comparing the changes in rainfall between the two areas. The amount of water resources was determined by considering the area of the seeding effect and rainfall density. As a result, 1.74 mm (4.75 million tons) of rainfall increased from the experiment on forest fire prevention, 0.84 mm (1.30 million tons) on drought mitigation, and 2.78 mm (24.44 million tons) on dust reduction.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Thus, an average rainfall of 1.0 mm could be achieved through the experiment.

According to news reporting originating from Artvin, Turkey, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study primarily aims to produce forest fire susceptibility maps for the Manavgat district of Antalya province in Turkey using different machine learning (ML) techniques. Forest fire inventory data were obtained from the General Directorate of Forestry.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Artvin Coruh University. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Artvin Coruh University, \"The inventory data comprise a total of 545 forest fire ignition points during the years 2013-2021. For model training and validation, 70% and 30% of these points were used, respectively. Average annual temperature, average annual rainfall, aspect, distance to rivers, elevation, distance to settlements, forest type, distance to roads, land cover, plan curvature, slope, solar radiation, tree cover density, topographic wetness index, and wind effect parameters were used in the study. Multicollinearity analysis of these 15 factors showed that they are independent of each other. Tree-based ML models, namely, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, and gradient boosting machine, as well as artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to produce forest fire susceptibility maps. The metrics of overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU-ROC) were used to evaluate the performance of the ML models.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Based on our results, the XGBoost model revealed the most appropriate susceptibility map that could be used for fire prevention measures.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Machine Learning Based Forest Fire Susceptibility Assessment of Manavgat District (Antalya), Turkey.

Stefan Jeremiah/Associated Press<br/>RINGWOOD, N.J. -\u00a0Fire crews battled small wildfires across the Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks employee over the weekend and postponed Veterans Day plans.</p><p><br/>A quarter-inch of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters.<br/>The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree.<br/>The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California.<br/>Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds.<br/>The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 41% contained as of Monday. The fire's size remains around 32 square miles. The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 192 structures and damaged 82, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation.<br/>Advertisement<br/>In neighboring Nevada, authorities ordered the evacuation of hundreds of homes southwest of Reno and closed the main highway to Lake Tahoe after a wind-whipped wildfire erupted Monday and spread quickly through mountainside vegetation.<br/>About 3,000 people were told to leave, said Adam Mayberry, spokesperson for the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. Rain began to fall as local, state and federal crews arrived to battle the blaze, Mayberry said.<br/>Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, crews worked to contain the the 4.7-square-mile fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.<br/>Crews work to contain a wildfire in Jennings Creek, N.J., on Saturday.\u00a0 New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection via AP<br/>Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday.<br/>In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger.<br/>\"Beneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry,\" Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. \"So right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it's in the duff it's going to stay there. It's going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again.\"<br/>Advertisement<br/>A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire. The National Guard deployed two Black Hawk helicopters for water drops, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.<br/>In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander.<br/>\"Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,\" he posted online.<br/>Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state's Greenwood Lake.<br/>Health advisories were issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction.<br/>Dana Van Allen, of Ringwood, New Jersey, said she awoke early Saturday to what smelled like a burning campfire. She realized the fires were close enough to leave ashes on her deck.<br/>Advertisement<br/>\"It was very stifling. We were very scared,\" she recalled Monday.<br/>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles in the city some 10 miles north of Boston.<br/>The Lynn Fire Department cited \"a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\"<br/>\"We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn't spread further,\" Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday.<br/>The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred Sept. 28.<br/>Copy the Story Link<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLCEN-httpswwwcentralmainecom20241112firecrewsonbothuscoastsbattlewildfires</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLCEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDC-H821-F03F-K06C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490509</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Centralmaine.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64500\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States &amp;

He remembers the exact moment he discovered the relationship between power lines and wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In Australia, I was originally a lineman and, unfortunately, I experienced what now is called 'Black Saturday' and this was an event where 50 fires were ignited by power lines in one day and 187 people passed away and I was there boots on the ground and we were there working together with the first responders,\" Barat said.</p><p>Motivated to make a difference, he co-founded Gridware with UC Berkeley engineering classmate Hall Chen.</p><p>They created a solar-powered sensor that continuously measures tiny motions in utility lines and poles. </p><p>Using artificial intelligence, they can identify specific vibrations as well as the conditions which cause them. As soon as those vibrations or anomalies are detected, Gridware technology can alert power companies of the danger in real time. It's then up to the utility company to shut down power to those lines. </p><p>\"We like to think of the grid as a guitar where the conductors are the strings and poles are the frets,\" said Chen, Gridware co-founder and chief technology officer. \"When you have a physical event impacting the conductors, it creates vibrations that are very different than what you see on a day-to-day basis and so we monitor those vibrations at the pole level.\"</p><p>Barat, who is an experienced electrical lineman, demonstrated how it works at the Richmond field station.</p><p>\"This happens hundreds of times even in a 24-hour period where a branch will break and it will fall on the lines just like this and it remains there on the lines for up to hours before it actually ignites and only when it ignites does it fall down to the ground and then start a fire,\" Barat explained. \"So we detect the moment that the vegetation contacts the lines.\"</p><p>Gridware's technology is not only about preventing wildfires. It can also help crews get the electricity restored faster after an outage.</p><p>\"Every time you cut the power, the utility needs to patrol every meter of the line and that can take hours and so knowing exactly what has happened -- where it has happened -- allows them to send the crew directly to the location with the right equipment, remove the hazard or make the repair and quickly switch the power back on,\" Barat said. </p><p>Gridware's sensors also monitor real-time environmental weather factors like temperature, pressure, wind and humidity. In California, they place their sensors in the highest-risk areas, covering a thousand miles of our power grid.</p><p>\"I grew up in California,\" Chen said. \"To be able to actually make a difference for the communities around my home state and other states as well around the country -- it's good for the soul.\"</p><p>\"I remember the first time that we received the call back from the utility with confirmation that we had stopped a wildfire,\" Barat recalled. \"Those were their exact words, 'Without your alert, this would've been a forest fire.' That's a very emotional experience.\" </p><p>For Barat and Chen, a future safe from ravaging wildfires powers their passion. </p><p>Gridware has installed about 13,000 sensors around the country in eight states, working with 18 utility companies including PG&amp;E.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

A quarter-inch of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters. The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree. </p><p>The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California. Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds. The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 36% contained as of Monday. The fire's size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 170 structures, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation. In neighboring Nevada, authorities ordered the evacuation of hundreds of homes southwest of Reno and closed the main highway to Lake Tahoe after a wind-whipped wildfire erupted Monday and spread quickly through mountainside vegetation. About 3,000 people were told to leave, said Adam Mayberry, spokesperson for the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. Rain began to fall as local, state and federal crews arrived to battle the blaze, Mayberry said. Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, crews worked to contain the 4.7-square-mile (about 12.2 square-kilometer) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday. In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger. \"Beneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry,\" Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. \"So right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it's in the duff it's going to stay there. It's going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again.\" A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons (1,325 liters) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire. The National Guard deployed two Black Hawk helicopters for water drops, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said. In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander. \"Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,\" he posted online. Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state's Greenwood Lake. Health advisories were issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction. Dana Van Allen, of Ringwood, New Jersey, said she awoke early Saturday to what smelled like a burning campfire. She realized the fires were close enough to leave ashes on her deck. \"It was very stifling. We were very scared,\" she recalled Monday. In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles (8.8 square kilometers) in the city some 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Boston. The Lynn Fire Department cited \"a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\" \"We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn't spread further,\" Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday. The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred Sept. 28.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press Photo Smoke rises from a wildfire in a forested mountain area across from Greenwood Lake, Monday in Warwick, New York.

Wherever you are in the world, you are now in the CNN NEWSROOM with me, Ben Hunte in Atlanta. And it is so good to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[00:30:37]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming up on the show, Europe and Ukraine unite to take the lead towards peace, signaling the U.S. to cooperate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, aid groups sounding the alarm. Israel is once again blocking aid into Gaza. Why they're doing it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And all the glitz, glamor and controversy. We've got the highlights from Hollywood's biggest night.</p><p>Welcome. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the West is now at a crossroads in history, as he urges European leaders to step up and unite around a new plan for peace in Ukraine. Starmer and E.U. leaders sat down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a key summit in London, just days after his explosive meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Zelenskyy called Europe's unity, quote, \"exceptionally high.\" Starmer said leaders were working to craft a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be presented to the U.S.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron told newspaper \"Le Figaro\" that France and the U.K. have proposed a month-long limited ceasefire in Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Zelenskyy says he's aware of that proposal, and also said his country is ready to sign a rare minerals deal with the U.S., a deal that Zelenskyy had been expected to sign on Friday before being asked to leave the White House.</p><p>Despite the tensions, the Ukrainian leader called the U.S. a strategic partner and had this to say about the relationship.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through president): I think our relations with the U.S. will continue, because this is more than relations during a certain moment. We must be open.</p><p>Ukraine is not the biggest country in the world, but everyone can see how it fights for its independence and freedom.</p><p>I represent the interests of a country that heavily depends on support from partners. So, of course, if I am invited for a constructive dialog for solving real problems, for serious questions, and real resolute actions and answers, I will be there out of respect for America, the American people, the president, and the two parties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNTE: Following the summit, the Ukrainian president was welcomed by King Charles for a meeting that one royal source said lasted nearly an hour.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson has more from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: So, President Zelenskyy getting an important meeting with King Charles --</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): -- at one of the king's country residence, about 100 miles North of London, Sandringham.</p><p>They spent an hour together. And it's important symbolically, because it embodies, if you will, the support that the U.K. is giving to the Ukrainian president.</p><p>But remembering, as well, just a few days ago, when the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, was in the Oval Office with President Trump, he handed President Trump a letter, an unprecedented invitation to President Trump of a second state visit to the U.K.</p><p>So, here, Zelenskyy --</p><p>ROBERTSON: -- getting the royal treatment, as well, embodying that support from the British government, the British people, and the monarchy.</p><p>Before he was there, he was at that gathering of European leaders as well as Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, being hosted by the British prime minister, the British prime minister saying that this was an effort to make sure that Ukraine has the military and economic needs that it needs to fight the war.</p><p>Today, he spoke about an additional $2 billion of funding going to Ukraine. Ukraine spending that on air defense missiles, 5,000 of them to be purchased in the U.K.</p><p>All of that very, very important. But they -- but the -- some of the key details that we began to learn was that this was something of an historic moment. That's the way Keir Starmer saw it.</p><p>ROBERTSON: That this was a crossroads in history, where he was trying to build a coalition of the willing European nations, forward leaning, able to step up and be part of the security guarantees. This is how he framed it.</p><p>KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can't mean that we sit back. Instead, those willing will intensify planning now, with real urgency.</p><p>The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.</p><p>[00:05:12]</p><p>But to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. backing.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): And that very important point there, the need to have U.S. support here. And he spoke about it in this way, as well, that France, the U.K., and Ukraine would work on this plan with the European nations and then bring it to the White House.</p><p>So, in a way, there, if you like, shielding President Zelenskyy to some degree from sort of getting in a one-on-one situation in the White House with President Trump again that turned so fractious just a few days ago.</p><p>And an important message, as well, coming at this summit from Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, saying that in just a couple of days, on the 6th of March this week, European leaders would gather and lay out a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe.</p><p>That is something President Trump has been looking for Europeans to do: to step up their defense spending.</p><p>ROBERTSON: So, the Europeans appearing to come together on a plan for that, as well.</p><p>Nic Robertson, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNTE: Officials in the Trump administration continue to offer praise for the U.S. president following last week's very tense exchange with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Oval Office, while at the same time criticizing Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Some of them are even indicating U.S. support for new leadership in Ukraine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL WALTZ, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually, deal with the Russians and end this war.</p><p>And if it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy's either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then -- then I think we have a real issue on our hands.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNTE: Terrell Jermaine Starr is the host of Black Diplomats Official on YouTube. He's joining us from Kyiv, Ukraine.</p><p>Terrell, thanks so much for being with me. How are you doing?</p><p>TERRELL JERMAINE STARR, HOST, BLACK DIPLOMATS OFFICIAL: Oh, I'm doing fine. We're dealing with air alerts, sirens every day, but we're keeping it moving.</p><p>HUNTE: Gosh. Well, you were actually in Kyiv when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Can you believe that it's still ongoing now? And why do you think it hasn't ended?</p><p>And also, what were you doing in Kyiv at that time?</p><p>STARR: OK, so I was in Kyiv right now as a -- as an independent journalist figuring out ways to cover the war. I had been in Ukraine since 2008 on a Fulbright grant.</p><p>Am I surprised that the war is still going on? No, because the Ukrainians learned a lesson that, if they're going to maintain their sovereignty, they have to fight.</p><p>There have been conversations about the Ukrainians not being able to continue on without U.S. aid. But Ukraine feels that, if -- Ukrainians feel that if they continue, if they -- there is a ceasefire, then that means that the Russians will regroup and then they'll go deeper.</p><p>And so, they say, we'll either have to throw more men into this fight and die now, or have a ceasefire. Then three years later, the Russians will come again, and we'll lose even more men because we're further unprepared.</p><p>HUNTE: Yes. Well, I want to talk about the big moment of last week now. Where were you when the Zelenskyy and Trump moment was happening? And what was going through your mind then? What were you thinking now?</p><p>STARR: When this -- when this showdown and -- and this setup in the Oval Office took place, because I don't call it the press. It was a setup. I was here in Ukraine.</p><p>And I think people were in utter shock. But what we really saw was something of a Brexit moment. We really saw that the Trump administration is pulling the United States out of the -- out of the trans-Atlantic security apparatus.</p><p>And I think it evoked fear not only in Ukraine but across Europe, that they will have -- the Europeans have to be responsible for the architecture of their security. And Trump is not going to be the -- or the -- the U.S. is not going to be a part of maintaining that anymore.</p><p>HUNTE: Give me your thoughts on Sunday's European summit. Do you think the Ukraine will get what it needs to keep fighting in the future?</p><p>STARR: Do I feel that Ukraine will get everything that it needs right now? Basically, it sounds better than what was proposed some 30 years ago in the Budapest agreement.</p><p>You hear the French and the U.K. saying that we're going to send troops.</p><p>And so, the sentiment here, here in Kyiv -- I've been talking to people on the streets about this. Their attitudes is a lot of -- they -- deep down inside, they realize that some territory will be given away.</p><p>But what will be different in this go around is that there will be troops on the ground to ensure that the land that is, that they do have will be protected. They don't want a Budapest Memorandum 2.0 where no guarantees of security were assured.</p><p>[00:10:11]</p><p>This cycle of conversations, the Ukrainians are smarter than they were in 1994, when they were pretty much a new country entering into democracy. And so, they know how to bargain for their security and their sovereignty better now.</p><p>HUNTE: Before we let you go -- and I've learned so much. So, I appreciate this. I have to ask, your bio on social says, \"I'm that black dude that talks about Ukraine.\"</p><p>I have to know what is that experience of being on the ground in Eastern Europe like while also black? Do you get push back? Do people shout at you? What's going on?</p><p>STARR: Oh, so, you know, I love being here in this part of the world. What I do is, as a black American I just found a special place here where I feel like I'm just this -- this odd person out that can talk about solidarity, what it means to be a black American, to deal with white supremacy, to deal with racism, et cetera.</p><p>And also, you know, the Ukrainians are dealing with Russian supremacy, Russian aggression, Russian colonialism. And I feel like I'm really good at merging these two stories to people, to bring people into the conversation so that we can understand each other.</p><p>The main problem is that I feel like too much mainstream media, it talks to the think tank community, talks to the academic community. It doesn't talk to the rest of us.</p><p>And so, the way that I tell stories helps to bring everyone to the table and make them feel comfortable about talking about what share -- what shared history is, what shared circumstances do we have? And that's what I'm really effective at. And that's why I'm that black dude that talks about Ukraine, you know.</p><p>HUNTE: And you're good at it. So, keep it going. Terrell Jermaine Starr. I'm sure we'll be talking again very, very soon. Thank you so much for it. Appreciate it.</p><p>STARR: Thank you. HUNTE: Hollywood celebrated its biggest night with fabulous fashion and plenty of joyful tears. Who won big at the Oscars? When we come back.</p><p>Plus, the numbers are in. A new CNN poll shows how Americans feel about President Trump's performance. That's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:16:27]</p><p>HUNTE: It was Hollywood's biggest night with glitz and glamor on full display for the Oscars.</p><p>\"Wicked\" stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande got the night started with a stunning performance of \"Defying Gravity\" from their blockbuster film.</p><p>But in the end, it was the low-budget independent movie \"Anora\" which took on Hollywood giants and won big. Mikey Madison claimed the award for Best Actress for the title role in the film, and she couldn't believe what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKEY MADISON, ACTRESS: I grew up in Los Angeles, but Hollywood always felt so far away from me. So, to be here, standing in this room today is really incredible.</p><p>This is a dream come true. I'm probably going to wake up tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNTE: \"Anora\" also claimed the biggest prize for Best Picture and Best Director going to Sean Baker.</p><p>Adrien Brody won Best Actor in a Leading Role for his work in \"The Brutalist,\" in which he played a struggling immigrant architect in post-World War II America.</p><p>And Zoe Saldana won Best Supporting Actress for \"Emilia Perez.\" She recalled a real-life immigrant story in accepting that award.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZOE SALDANA, ACTRESS: My grandmother came to this country in 1961. I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard-working hands.</p><p>And I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNTE: Let's dig into this Oscars goss. Joining me now live from L.A. are Sam Sanders and Zach Stafford. They co-host the \"Vibe Check\" podcast. Thank you both for joining me.</p><p>Zach, let's kick this off. This was \"Anora's\" night. I'm honestly so buzzing about that, because I saw it randomly at the cinema because nothing else was on, and I was completely blown away. Laughed. Cried. Literally at the end, I said, that's going to win everything. And it did. The most of any film tonight, five awards.</p><p>Zach, were you surprised?</p><p>ZACH STAFFORD, CO-HOST, \"VIBE CHECK\" PODCAST: I was surprised. You know, I thought at the beginning of its run when it came out, you know, four months ago, that it was a big contender for the Oscars.</p><p>However, \"The Brutalist\" has been all anyone talks about in L.A., which is hilarious, since it is 3.5 hours long, which is as long as the Oscars were tonight.</p><p>But, you know, it kind of came out of nowhere for me that \"Anora\" would be the belle of the ball tonight.</p><p>I personally was really hoping that \"Wicked\" would be the surprise win. You know, I think that film is perfect for the moment. You know, it's a movie about a wizard who has no powers, who surprisingly becomes an authoritarian dictator, which I think is perfect for right now to kind of talk about.</p><p>But, you know, \"Anora\" was our winner, and she's a beautiful winner. It's a beautiful film, and I'm really excited for them.</p><p>HUNTE: Love it. Well, let's keep talking about \"Anora.\" Mikey Madison, the lead, won Best Actress, beating Demi Moore, Cynthia Erivo a hugely competitive category. Sam, was that a shock for you?</p><p>SAM SANDERS, CO-HOST, \"VIBE CHECK\" PODCAST: It was a shock. I think after Demi won the Golden Globe and had such a great speech at that award show while dressed like an Oscar. Her dress was, like, statuesque.</p><p>HUNTE: Yes.</p><p>SANDERS: We all expected her to get the Oscar, and she looked pretty surprised when she didn't win. Though I will say I don't understand a world in which this didn't go to Cynthia.</p><p>When you see her sing \"Defying Gravity\" at the end of \"Wicked\" as she's, like, in the sky, I want to give her all the awards.</p><p>So, there wasn't justice, in my opinion.</p><p>HUNTE: OK.</p><p>SANDERS: But I'm happy for Mikey. She's been doing great, and that movie is phenomenal.</p><p>HUNTE: OK, OK. Fair, fair. Well, my stand-out moment from this evening was the Quincy Jones tribute by Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg. I love what they were wearing.</p><p>[00:20:05]</p><p>The Queen Latifah performance, however, was interesting. I was chatting to my team about it as it aired, and we were like, hmm, OK.</p><p>STAFFORD: Where did it come from? Like, why is this happening?</p><p>HUNTE: Yes. That, that. Zach, what were your standout moments?</p><p>SANDERS: In a show that's already too long, we had that.</p><p>HUNTE: Yes. What were your standout moments?</p><p>SANDERS: The show was too long. Listen, we had a James Bond tribute. We had \"The Wiz\" tribute. It didn't make sense to me.</p><p>HUNTE: I love it, I love it.</p><p>STAFFORD: I -- I agree, but I love Queen Latifah, so I will say nothing bad about my Queen Latifah tonight.</p><p>But you know, another moment I loved -- I loved a few things about tonight's -- tonight's Oscars. I love that Oprah and Whoopi were there. Similar to you, Ben, because Cynthia Erivo's career is, in large part, due to Oprah Winfrey casting her in \"The Color Purple\" on the West End and then on Broadway.</p><p>So, for her to be up for Best Actress this evening and to have Oprah there, I thought it was just so beautiful and full circle and magical.</p><p>But besides that, I was really excited for \"No Other Land,\" which won the -- the Oscar for Best Documentary Film. It was made by an Israeli and a Palestinian journalist. And it's about their time in the West Bank.</p><p>And it was a very timely film, and I was surprised that the Oscars gave it space on ABC to talk about the kind of the conflict happening in the West Bank in Gaza right now.</p><p>So, I was really excited to hear those words tonight. I thought I was very surprised by that. That was my big stand-out moment.</p><p>HUNTE: That's real. That's real. So, any more stand-out moments for you?</p><p>SANDERS: I think what I wanted to be a standout, but wasn't, was Conan's opening monologue. Oh, he was nice enough, funny enough. But he didn't land any heavy punches. And I was surprised by how apolitical he was the entire night.</p><p>We really only got politics from those international winners that Zach just spoke of. It was an extremely muted night politically, especially from a host who can be as biting as Conan.</p><p>HUNTE: OK, I want to talk about a controversial topic. Let's talk about \"Emilia Perez.\" I don't think a single person I know liked it, but I thought it was very interesting.</p><p>Zoe Saldana won the Best Supporting Actress award even after so much controversy around the lead actress. Did either of you actually like the film? Sam, I'm going to start with you.</p><p>SANDERS: I hated it. I watched it and tried to make sense of it. I left the -- I left the movies mad at it. I read every think-piece I could, and I got more mad at it. This is not a good movie.</p><p>And even the fact that Zoe won an Oscar for it, she did great, but it was category fraud. She had the most screen time in that movie. She should have been up for Best Lead Actress, I think.</p><p>Everything about that movie just hit me the wrong way. Good for Zoe, but I hope that six months from now, no one is thinking about that film ever.</p><p>HUNTE: Oh. Zach, can you say the same?</p><p>STAFFORD: I really, really. -- I mean, I don't hate it as much as Sam. Sam has a lot -- lot bigger feelings than I do about this film, which I respect and love for him.</p><p>I mean, I had to -- I also didn't understand it. I work a lot with musicals. You know, I've produced musicals. And when I went to the theater and I saw it, I was like, what is happening here? Why are we singing in a gender clinic? Like, I do not understand this at all.</p><p>But, you know, I did go back. There is a film that everyone should watch. I told Sam to watch it tonight. It's called \"Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\" It was made in, like, 1950. Something by Jacques Demy. And it's what inspired \"Emilia Perez.\"</p><p>So, if you're confused at how that movie got made, go back to this French film. Watch it. You're going to maybe hate it, too, but you'll kind of understand why the French are so obsessed with sing-talking all the time. It's very confusing to me.</p><p>HUNTE: All right. Well, thank you both for that. I love it. I'm sure we're going to have you back on again soon, because that was real fun. Loved it. Zach Stafford and Sam Sanders, thank you so much for being with me. Appreciate it.</p><p>SANDERS: Thank you.</p><p>STAFFORD: Have a good night.</p><p>HUNTE: See you later.</p><p>More news when we come back, including swift condemnation for Israel as it keeps humanitarian aid out of Gaza. The latest in the Middle East, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:28:21]</p><p>HUNTE: Outrage as Israel stops the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas break down.</p><p>Now, food trucks are just sitting at Egypt's border. But Israel says there will be no relief for Gaza until Hamas agrees to extend the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, a move that the U.S. supports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): There will be no free lunches if Hamas thinks that the ceasefire can continue, or that it can benefit from the terms of Phase A without us receiving hostages, it is deeply mistaken.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNTE: Now, Hamas rejected extending the first phase of the agreement. It wants to move to the ceasefire's second stage, but this stalled situation leaves many facing uncertainty.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I hope the truce lasts and that these wars finally end. Our children are terrified of the bombings. We want peace for ourselves and our kids. Enough destruction. We don't even have a place to live.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNTE: There are new worries about the safety of hostages that Hamas is still holding.</p><p>Earlier, hundreds of protesters blocked the street outside of the Israeli prime minister's house, demanding a deal. Meanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza are mourning.</p><p>Local officials say Israeli gunfire killed four people in separate attacks.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump will face lawmakers on Tuesday, addressing a joint session of Congress for the first time in his second presidential term.</p><p>It's an opportunity for Mr. Trump to reassure voters about his leadership. Since he took office, we've seen a president's indiscriminate firings of federal workers, threats of massive tariffs on U.S. allies and his catastrophic White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>[00:30:11]</p><p>A CNN poll taken before that meeting shows that a majority of Americans are unhappy with how President Trump is doing his job. Fifty-two percent disapprove of his performance. Only 48 percent approve.</p><p>More than 175 wildfires are burning across the Carolinas. Myrtle Beach. The Carolina forest fire has grown to 647 hectares. South Carolina's Forestry Commission says it's 30 percent contained.</p><p>Some residents who evacuated were allowed to return to their homes.</p><p>This was the view from a flight into Myrtle Beach on Saturday. Dry and windy conditions have been fanning the flames, but firefighters should get a break by Tuesday as forecasts call for more humidity and lighter winds.</p><p>Hungary's Budapest pride parade could look very different this year. Just ahead, the latest on a government clampdown looking to stifle the city's annual public march.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:35:38]</p><p>HUNTE: After a nearly 30-year-run, the annual Budapest pride parade is under threat by the Hungarian government.</p><p>In his State of the Nation address on Saturday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban advised pride organizers to, quote, \"not bother preparing for this year's parade.\"</p><p>While officials did not outline what this clampdown will look like, they say the march should not dominate public spaces but instead be hosted in a closed venue, citing child protection issues.</p><p>Well, you know, I want to dig more into this. So, joining me live from Brussels to discuss is Remy Bonny. He's the executive director of Forbidden Colors, a nonprofit supporting the LGBTIQ+ community across Europe.</p><p>Remy, how are you doing?</p><p>REMY BONNY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FORBIDDEN COLORS: Hi, Ben. Well, despite the circumstances, relatively fine. Yes.</p><p>HUNTE: Good. Well, let's get into it. What were your first thoughts when you heard that Hungary's government would be banning this year's pride march? Were you surprised at all?</p><p>BONNY: Well, I wasn't really surprised. It's been a long time coming. Since 2019 the Orban government has been scapegoating and instrumentalizing the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>It started with banning legal gender reassignment, followed with banning the adoption of same sex -- of children by same-sex couples.</p><p>Then in 2021, they actually adopted its Russia style anti-LGBTQ propaganda law, banning any depiction or promotion of LGBTQ+ people. So yes, it's been coming. The playbook has been there. We knew that this was going to be the next step. We obviously didn't know it was coming this -- the last -- last Saturday. But yes, it's been a long time coming.</p><p>HUNTE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) made a documentary in Hungary just a few years ago about LGBT lives there. And queer Hungarians were so hopeful about things changing for the better, but that doesn't seem to be the case now.</p><p>Can you just break down for me this Viktor Orban decision? Like you say, it's not surprised you, but how has this actually come about? How can this be happening within the European Union?</p><p>BONNY: Well, obviously, it's not been surprising for me, because as a -- as an expert in this, it's not so very surprising. But for the community itself, it's been -- it's been a shock wave, not just for the community and Hungary. But much wider, I would dare to say.</p><p>You need to know Budapest Pride was not just pride anymore for LGBTQ people. It was a pride that was a beacon for hope for many, many people that wanted to live in a liberal democracy and -- and a system based on human rights and the country.</p><p>Every year, more -- around 40,000 people went to the pride, and it was the largest human rights protest in the country. So, it's -- it's -- it's also just for freedom of assembly in general. In Hungary, it's been -- it's been a disastrous week.</p><p>HUNTE: We obviously see discussions usually and literal arguments about whether pride is a protest or whether it is a party. I just wonder if we could just talk about what this means for the rest of the world, now that we're seeing a pride parade literally being banned in Europe.</p><p>BONNY: Well -- well, it's pretty clear now that pride is not a party. It's a -- it's really a protest again, everywhere around the world.</p><p>I mean, we've been seeing what has happened in Hungary, what we've been seeing for many, many years in European countries like Poland, Italy, and so on, where -- where -- where the LGBTQ+ community is under attack. And what we see coming now from the -- from the -- from the Vance, Musk, Trump administration, it's very worrying.</p><p>We see Musk traveling around Europe. Yes, basically distributing money to all kinds of ultra-conservative organizations, meaning that they show the wave of -- of -- of attacks on the LGBTQ+ community is only going to increase in the coming -- in the coming years.</p><p>And yes, we watch -- people watching from the U.S. shouldn't be surprised. This is obviously coming for them, as well. It's one one -- one obviously well-orchestrated, ultra-conservative playbook or scapegoating the LGBTQ community to basically, at the same time, dismantle democracy in general.</p><p>[00:40:18] And that's what Orban has been doing.

According to news reporting out of Lanzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires pose a catastrophic threat to Earth's ecology as well as threaten human beings.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Fundamental Research Funds For The Central Universities of China; Gansu Key Laboratory of Cloud Computing Open Program. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Lanzhou University: \"Timely and accurate monitoring of forest fires can significantly reduce potential casualties and property damage. Thus, to address the aforementioned problems, this paper proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on a lightweight forest fire recognition model, Fire-Net, which has a multi-stage structure and incorporates cross-channel attention following the fifth stage. This is to enable the model's ability to perceive features at various scales, particularly small-scale fire sources in wild forest scenes. Through training and testing on a real-world dataset, various lightweight convolutional neural networks were evaluated on embedded devices.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The experimental outcomes indicate that Fire-Net attained an accuracy of 98.18%, a precision of 99.14%, and a recall of 98.01%, surpassing the current leading methods. Furthermore, the model showcases an average inference time of 10 milliseconds per image and operates at 86 frames per second (FPS) on embedded devices.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fire-Net: Rapid Recognition of Forest Fires in UAV Remote Sensing Imagery Using Embedded Devices.

Authorities in multiple states across the Northeast battled wildfires Monday as conditions remained ripe for blazes to erupt and spread quickly despite some areas receiving their first rainfall in over a month. In New Jersey, firefighters fought the Jennings Creek wildfire\u00a0raging along the New Jersey-New York border, which had grown to 3,500 acres and was 20% contained, officials said Monday evening. Over the weekend, New York state parks worker Dariel Vasquez, 18, was killed by a fallen tree while he was battling flames in Sterling Forest in Orange County. The fire was one of several that burned throughout the weekend in New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Connecticut - the result of historically dry conditions across the region that were only slightly improved by the quarter-inch of rain that fell Sunday night into Monday. Here is what we know about the wildfires, their cause and whether more rain is forecast: Why are there wildfires in the Northeast? The Northeast experiences wildfires every fall season, and the majority of blazes are attributed to human causes such as campfires, burning debris and cigarettes. However, what has meteorologists and state officials especially concerned this year is a record-setting dry spell in the Northeast that is fueling a sharp rise in wildfires and their explosive growth. The Northeast, like the vast majority of the country, is suffering from abnormally dry conditions, and many states are experiencing severe and extreme drought, according to the\u00a0U.S. Drought Monitor\u00a0at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. What states and cities have gone without measurable rain? On Sunday evening and into the overnight hours, some showers brought the first rain in months to parts of the Mid-Atlantic, including New York City, where\u00a00.17 inches of rain fell - the only rainfall the metropolitan area has picked up since late September. In New Jersey, the dry spell has smashed records in multiple cities. As of Friday, Trenton had gone 41 days without measurable rain - the prior record was 36 in the fall of 1924. Newark has gone 40 days without measurable rainfall, flying past the previous record of 26 days set in the spring of 1949. Similarly, Philadelphia went at least 40 days without rain, breaking the record of 29 days set in 1874. Both New Jersey and Delaware reported their driest October on record this year, according to the National Weather Service. Are wildfires common in the Northeast? Wildfires torch thousands of acres of land in Northeast states each year, though they are most common in the spring. In New Jersey, 1,500 wildfires damage or destroy 7,000 acres of forests annually, according to the state's forest fire service. State officials say that while the high season is in the spring, leaves in the fall months add extra fuel and lead to more blazes, especially when the region is experiencing unusually dry conditions. In New York, where thousands of acres of land are engulfed in wildfires each year, the state says that 47% of all wildfires occur from March 15 to May 15. About 15 wildland fires are reported each October in Massachusetts. This year, the month's total reached 200, an increase of about 1,200%. The spike, according to the state's Department of Fire Services, rivals \"the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.\" Just last week,\u00a0Massachusetts officials\u00a0raised the drought level to \"significant\" and \"critical\" throughout the state. Fire authorities reported on Saturday that firefighters were battling at least 175\u00a0blazes. What regions have been under alerts or warnings about wildfire risk? Areas from Washington, D.C., to New England had been under advisories in the past week about heightened risks of wildfires. On Saturday, for example, there were red flag warnings in place in the New York metropolitan area, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts as strong winds, relatively low humidity and dry conditions endured, the National Weather Service said. Most of those warnings had expired by Sunday night, but officials urged residents to not let their guard down and to exercise caution with potential ignition sources such as machinery, cigarettes or matches. When will the drought end in the Northeast? Meteorologists say it's unlikely more rain will alleviate the widespread dry conditions across the Northeast. Storms are forecast to barrel toward the region over the next two weeks, potentially bringing rain to New York City and southern New England; however, the showers will be limited and are not projected to soak the dry soil for any meaningful period of time. \"While that more active pattern will bring some opportunities for rain this week, it does not guarantee that every spot will get enough rain to keep the fire potential at bay,\" said John Feerick, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. \"Some locations could go at least a full week without a drop of rain.\" On Thursday, a front from the Midwest is expected to arrive in the Northeast and it could bring some tropical moisture with it. But, it won't be the large storm that the Northeast needs for sustained relief, Feerick said. Contributing: John Bacon and Jorge L.

This ban follows Governor Ned Lamonts declaration of a state of emergency across Connecticut yesterday. The Governors declaration mobilizes all state resources to address active and potential wildfires and enforce precautionary measures to protect residents, property, and natural resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In support of this emergency response, DEEP issued the Burn Ban that covers all State Parks, Forests, and other state-owned public lands. This measure is part of an effort to prevent new fires in light of the forecast for prolonged dangerous fire weather conditions, and as a proactive measure to avoid overtaxing available fire-fighting resources we have to fight existing fires, which are occurring in several areas across the state. Effective immediately, this ban prohibits kindling or using outdoor fires in these areas to prevent additional fire outbreaks. All open burning permits statewide are also suspended pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes 23-49a until further notice.</p><p>Connecticut remains at VERY HIGH to EXTREME fire risk, with no forecasted rainfall over the next week to alleviate conditions. Since October 21, DEEP and emergency responders have been actively battling the Hawthorne Fire, which has spread over 100 acres. Multiple smaller fires have ignited across the state due to dry conditions, with several requiring substantial resources and posing continued risks to nearby communities. Air support is responding to assist response in several of these locations around the state, so members of the public are advised that if they see air support responding to a fire, there should be absolutely no drones in the air. This interferes with response.</p><p>A No-fly zone remains in effect over Lamentation Mountain, and Lamentation Mountain State Park and the Silver Lake Boat Launch remain closed. Recreational drones, unauthorized hiking, ATV use, and low-altitude flights near active fire zones have also hampered firefighting operations. These activities delay response times, create hazardous conditions for firefighters, and increase risks to both first responders and the public. The public is advised to avoid all non-essential activities in areas near active fires to ensure safety and aid emergency efforts.</p><p>The vast majority of Connecticuts wildfires result from human activities. In these conditions, even a small spark from the following can ignite a wildfire:</p><p>Discarded smoking materials</p><p>ATV and UTV activity especially without spark arresters</p><p>Dragging trailer chains</p><p>Use of outdoor grills</p><p>Campfires</p><p>Power tools and equipment that generate heat or sparks</p><p>DEEP calls on every resident and visitor to recognize the power of their actions in these conditions. Preventing wildfires isnt only about personal safetyits about protecting our neighbors, our communities, and the first responders risking their lives to keep us safe. Each decision to follow fire safety measures, to refrain from outdoor burning, and to avoid risky activities near fire-prone areas directly reduces the likelihood of a new outbreak.</p><p>These conditions represent a real and immediate threat to communities across Connecticut. We need every resident and visitor to understand that their actions directly impact the safety of their neighbors, firefighters, and natural areas, said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes. In support of Governor Lamonts emergency declaration, we are banning outdoor burning within our state parks and forests to help prevent new fires from starting. Taking this step today could save lives.</p><p>Together, we can prevent devastating losses to our homes, businesses, forests, and wildlife and help ensure that our responders can work safely and effectively. Every precaution matters in keeping Connecticut safe. To reduce fire risks, DEEP urges the following safety measures:</p><p>Fires on public lands are prohibited: Do not use campfires, grills, or any other open flame. Again, the ban announced today prohibits the use of outdoor grills, firepits, and campfires, and the kindling and use of flame outdoors in all state parks, forests, and wildlife management areas. This prohibition includes smoking and use of lighters outdoors.</p><p>Properly extinguish smoking materials: Ensure all cigarettes and similar items are fully put out before disposal.</p><p>Avoid equipment that can spark fires: Refrain from using ATVs, chainsaws, or other equipment in dry areas.</p><p>If you observe a wildfire, call 911 immediately and provide the location to emergency dispatch. Timely reporting is crucial to containing fires before they spread further.</p><p>For more information on fire danger and wildfire prevention, visit the Wildfire Prevention page on the DEEP website or contact the DEEP fire danger hotline at (860) 424-3929.</p><p>For more information about todays fire danger level, which is VERY HIGH, go here: Forest Fire Danger Report</p><p>Twitter: @CTDEEPNews</p><p>Facebook: DEEP on Facebook</p><p>Contact</p><p>DEEP Communications</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:DEEP.communications@ct.gov\">DEEP.communications@ct.gov</email></p><p>860-424-3110</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126802648</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D8S-6VV1-JCBF-S08G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 26, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The public is advised to avoid all non-essential activities in areas near active fires to ensure safety and aid emergency efforts.</p><p>The vast majority of Connecticuts wildfires result from human activities. In these conditions, even a small spark from the following can ignite a wildfire:</p><p>Discarded smoking materials</p><p>ATV and UTV activity especially without spark arresters</p><p>Dragging trailer chains</p><p>Use of outdoor grills</p><p>Campfires</p><p>Power tools and equipment that generate heat or sparks</p><p>DEEP calls on every resident and visitor to recognize the power of their actions in these conditions. Preventing wildfires isnt only about personal safetyits about protecting our neighbors, our communities, and the first responders risking their lives to keep us safe. Each decision to follow fire safety measures, to refrain from outdoor burning, and to avoid risky activities near fire-prone areas directly reduces the likelihood of a new outbreak.</p><p>These conditions represent a real and immediate threat to communities across Connecticut. We need every resident and visitor to understand that their actions directly impact the safety of their neighbors, firefighters, and natural areas, said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes. In support of Governor Lamonts emergency declaration, we are banning outdoor burning within our state parks and forests to help prevent new fires from starting. Taking this step today could save lives.</p><p>Together, we can prevent devastating losses to our homes, businesses, forests, and wildlife and help ensure that our responders can work safely and effectively. Every precaution matters in keeping Connecticut safe. To reduce fire risks, DEEP urges the following safety measures:</p><p>Fires on public lands are prohibited: Do not use campfires, grills, or any other open flame. Again, the ban announced today prohibits the use of outdoor grills, firepits, and campfires, and the kindling and use of flame outdoors in all state parks, forests, and wildlife management areas. This prohibition includes smoking and use of lighters outdoors.</p><p>Properly extinguish smoking materials: Ensure all cigarettes and similar items are fully put out before disposal.</p><p>Avoid equipment that can spark fires: Refrain from using ATVs, chainsaws, or other equipment in dry areas.</p><p>If you observe a wildfire, call 911 immediately and provide the location to emergency dispatch. Timely reporting is crucial to containing fires before they spread further.</p><p>For more information on fire danger and wildfire prevention, visit the Wildfire Prevention page on the DEEP website or contact the DEEP fire danger hotline at (860) 424-3929.</p><p>For more information about todays fire danger level, which is VERY HIGH, go here: Forest Fire Danger Report</p><p>Twitter: @CTDEEPNews</p><p>Facebook: DEEP on Facebook</p><p>Contact</p><p>DEEP Communications</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:DEEP.communications@ct.gov\">DEEP.communications@ct.gov</email></p><p>860-424-3110</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126802616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D8M-PDH1-DYTH-G0SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 26, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Joining me today are Qi Chao Hu, Founder and Chief Executive Officer and Jing Nealis, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our shareholder letter just after 4pm today which provides a business update as well as our financial results.</p><p>You'll find a press release with a link to our shareholder letter and today's conference call webcast in the Investor Relations section of our website at SES AI before we get started, this is a reminder that the discussion today may contain forward looking information or forward looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. These statements are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Such statements involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties which may cause our actual or future results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in these statements. The risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations include, but are not limited to, those detailed in our latest earnings release and in our SEC filings. This afternoon we will review our business as well as the results for the quarter.</p><p>With that, I'll pass it over to Qi Chao.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks Tyle Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings. Today we are pleased to present an update on a new era for SESAI as we reap the benefits of our all in on AI strategy, deepen existing EV relationships, move to the next stage of our evolution to a revenue generating company and share our plans for additional revenue streams with new market expansion in drone robotics and battery energy storage systems. As you may have seen, we have made several announcements over the last several weeks including that STS AI is reporting revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter. We are no longer a pre revenue company and look forward to continuing on our commercialization path by growing revenue in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>First, I would like to address the highlights in our EV space. Since the fourth quarter we signed contracts totaling up to $10 million to develop AI enhanced lithium metal and lithium ion batteries for EVs with two automotive OEM partners. These contracts solidify our relationships with our OEM partners and continue to demonstrate the value of these partners see in the use of AI for battery material development, especially the value that an enhanced electrolyte can provide for both lithium metal and lithium ion batteries. Second, I want to address the important work we have accomplished in urban air mobility or UAN drones and robotics. In January at the CES 2025 show, we unveiled an AI enhanced 2170 cylindrical cell for humanoid robotics.</p><p>Earlier in 2024 we signed a significant purchase order with Datablanket for drones for forest fire management and with Softbank per haps communications satellites. This was a game changer as these AI enhanced 2170 cells are the first batteries to use an Electrolyte discovered by SCSAI's Molecular Universe effort, which maps the physical and chemical properties of the entire universe of small molecules suitable for battery electrolytes 10 to the 11th molecules. Our human scientist and AI agent learned that there's great similarity between lithium metal and high silicon lithium ion cells in terms of electrolyte anode interfaces and our development in lithium metal electrolyte could also address high silicon lithium ion challenges, especially swelling and cycle ice.</p><p>We are now in both lithium metal and high silicon lithium ion. 2170 is an industry standard format and is available on the large commercial scale. The Electra discovered through our Molecular Universe effort is a drop in replacement. This allows us to have a CAPEX light model through contract manufacturing and to deliver a high energy density and high power density cell for customers in humanoid robots, drones, EVs, power tools and other applications.</p><p>Third, SESAI is planning to expand into a new and growing field battery energy storage systems. Last month we announced that SCSAI signed an MOU with AI specs targeting up to $45 million to provide up to 100 megawatt hours of advanced battery energy storage systems solution with AI for safety and the first deployment at a crypto mining site in Texas. This relationship is the first of its kind for SCS AI and we believe that this is something that can be replicated with additional partners in the future. This project will involve our battery safety platform Avatar, which includes our AI for manufacturing and AI for safety solutions.</p><p>Powering our commercial success are our two focus areas upstream material discovery, Molecular Universe and downstream battery safety. Avatar in Molecular Universe Our collaboration with Nvidia on GPU enhanced Computation chemistry software helped accelerate this effort to map the entire 10 to the 11th universe of small molecules from more than 8,000 years to just a few months. We have now mapped 28 0.1% of the molecular universe. We think this is the world's largest single molecule density function theory database and we're also mapping solution and interface levels. These unique proprietary synthetic data help train our AI model that will accelerate novel electrolyte discovery as we have seen for lithium metal and high silicon lithium ion and later even LFP cells for BSS and other chemistries.</p><p>With Avatar, we have developed a new foundation model to monitor battery health and predict incidents before they happen. This AI based model works in conjunction with conventional physics based battery management system BMS but is agnostic to chemistry form factor emission profile and currently has been pre trained on manufacturing data and cycling data across a variety of cell chemistries including ncm, LST cathode and high silicon graphite and lithium metal anode and form factors including pouch, prismatic and cylindrical emission profiles ranging from BSS to EV drones and robots. In closing, SCSAI has seen some exciting advancements during the end of 2024 and at the start of 2025, especially with us recognizing revenue for the first time in our history.</p><p>All in on AI is not only critical but is the future. We see great things continuing going forward. Here are some of the things I see happening the Change in Our Business Model Originally we envisioned CAPEX Heavy plans to manufacture sales for EVs and UAM at scale and then offsetting some of the required costs through JVs. Now our business model focuses heavily on selling our AI models and core battery materials, contract manufacturing of cells using our electrolyte and selling of contract imported cells, a focus on hiring of AI scientists and sales and marketing teams to pursue greater expansion of revenue opportunities.</p><p>From 2025 to 2027, continued evolution from a pre revenue EV focused battery technology company levered to one battery chemistry to a company that can leverage its prior work along with its AI technology and AI enabled electrolytes to generate revenue in a CAPEX light model much earlier than anticipated and with an ability to tax two new adjacent verticals that we believe will be much larger than ev.</p><p>Thank you for your continued interest in SESAI and now I'll turn over to June for financial updates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jing Nealis:</emphasis></p><p>Good afternoon everyone. I will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. I am pleased to share our financial results and provide insights into our physical health strategic priorities, commercialization plans and 2025 outlook for the fourth quarter ended December 31. 2024 Revenue Milestone we reported Q4 2024 revenue of 2 million, marking the beginning of our evolution into a commercialized and revenue generating business. This revenue was primarily driven by contracts with our automotive OEM partners to develop AI enhanced lithium metal and lithium ion batteries for EV applications and initial delivery of our lithium metal cells to our customers like Softbank perhaps and data blanket for drone applications.</p><p>Importantly, this revenue comes with a 63% margin, demonstrating the strong value proposition of our technology and O in on AI strategy. Operating Expenses Our GAAP operating expenses were 30.4 million for the quarter, primarily driven by research and development initiatives and general administrative cost. Cash flow we utilized 12.3 million in cash for operations and invested 0.2 million in capital expenditures during the quarter. Liquidity we concluded the quarter with a strong liquidity position of 262.5 million, ensuring our ability to fund ongoing and future projects.</p><p>For the full year 2024. We achieved a total cash usage in operations and capital expenditures of 78.3 million, below the low end of our previous guidance of 80 million to 95 million. This includes operational cash usage of 66.1 million and capital expenditures of 12.2 million. As we look ahead SES AI is well positioned for continued growth and disciplined investment in 2025. The greater visibility we now have on revenue has allowed us to provide some guidance for 2025. As you know, this will be the first time that we are providing this outlook. Therefore, we're being conservative in our expectations and focusing on the full year outlook rather than any particular quarterly cadence of revenue or expenses. We intend to update this outlook during the year as needed.</p><p>Revenue outlook we anticipate 2025 revenue to be between 15 million and 25 million, reflecting growth from our expanding partnerships and commercialization efforts. We expect to generate revenue from development of AI enhanced lithium metal and lithium ion batteries for EV applications, delivery of battery cells to UAM drones and robotics customers, and delivery of integrated battery energy storage systems. With our AI Solutions Plan Spending we forecast total cash usage in operations and capex to be between 70 million and 80 million, prioritizing R&amp; D advancements, commercialization and strategic market expansion with a capital light business model. Cash Management Our strong liquidity position extends our Runway and continues to support our long term vision with a focus on financial discipline and strategic investments.</p><p>With our capex like business model, we expect to maintain adequate liquidity well into 2028. We see tremendous organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us. We are well capitalized to capture these opportunities in a disciplined fashion, particularly with additional funds from a projected revenue growth and or potential capital markets activity further enhancing our liquidity. 2024 was a transformative year for SCSAI. Achieving our first revenue milestone with a positive growth margin is a pivotal moment that signals our evolution from a R and D focused company to a commercial and revenue generating business with high margin revenue growing partnerships and disciplined financial management. We're excited about the opportunities ahead. We appreciate your continued support and confidence in sesai.</p><p>Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator at this time.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>If you would like to ask a question, it is STAR followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, it is STAR followed by two Again to ask a question, it is Star one. As a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone, please remember to pick up your headset before asking a question. I'll pause briefly here as questions are registered. Our first question comes from Winnie Dung with the company Deutsche Bank. Winnie, your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Winnie Dong:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, thanks for taking my question, teacher. I was wondering maybe you can talk about the shift in strategy here. In particular, what led to this shift? And then it was mentioned, you know, that they were signing up contracts totally up to 10 million for two leading auto OEM partners. If you are able to review, are they the same OEM partners that you know, SAS has GDA partners with and how is it different from, you know, those previous ones with Hyundai? Hyundai. Thanks so much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah Winnie. So previously we just focused on just lithium metal for EVs, right? And then and I think our work in lithium metal it wasn't just at the battery cell level, it was more fundamental, it was more at the material discovery level for the electrolyte and then also at the lithium metal battery safety. So and then these two core we noticed and also the OEMs that we're working with noticed that we could actually apply these to lithium ion. And then once you expand to beyond just one technology, just one battery technology and you can apply a platform to actually two platforms to multiple chemistries, then the addressable markets become much larger.</p><p>So of course I think anyone would just make this jump from a single technology in a single market to two platform across almost every battery technology out there. So that was a very obvious jump and, and I think quite exciting jump. And then in terms of the two OEMs, I think you can guess it's the toems that we have been working with for a long time. And they saw this transferability from just a single chemistry in a single market to every battery chemistry across multiple markets that they target.</p><p>Not just EVs, EVs being one of the most important ones, but also drones. They do drones and then robotics, Both of them do robotics as well. And then also urban air mobility. So yeah, that was the motivation for why we switched from just a single chemistry to multiple markets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Winnie Dong:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Thanks so much. I just want to follow up on the contra manufacturing. Are you able to unveil any sort of, you know, economics behind that? It's interesting that, you know, the gross margin was, you know, 63% in Q4, which was very impressive. You know, is this, is this sort of like an initial type of metric that we should look at and how would this evolve, I guess heading into 2025?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I think it's too early to address that. And that margin was actually a mix of the AI models, the service as well as the actual selling of the cells. But going forward, in terms of the contract manufacturing, I mean, our goal to do contract manufacturing is to have a high margin. And I think it's well known that these next generation battery companies just cannot compete at scale with any of the large incumbent battery players. This is why we do contract manufacturing to achieve high margin. But the actual numbers, that's going to evolve based on volume, based on the particular application and customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Winnie Dong:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. That's very helpful. I'll pass along. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Gordon with the company Water Tower Research. Brian, your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Gordon:</emphasis></p><p>Hey everyone, first of all, congratulations on achieving revenue. It's a really significant event for the company. I did want to follow up on the gross margins though. It seems like there are two different ways that you guys are sort of transitioning the business model. One is kind of, let's say selling software versus selling hardware. Could you talk a little bit about how you see both the revenue opportunity for that and how that could potentially impact margins going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, obviously we want to sell just the software because that's a pure high margin business. At the same time, for both the materials and the battery safety, it's hard to just sell the software without the hardware. The hardware is like a hook to get a customer. And then you sell the software on top of that and the hardware on the material side. We counter manufacture these cells and then the cells are like a carrier for our materials. And that demonstrates the benefit and the power of this molecular universe Afscience software.</p><p>So initially it's going to be the margin is going to be a mix between the sales and the software. But once we grow this demand and then we do plan to shift to more of a pure software business, and same thing for Avatar. The pure avatar itself is of course, very high margin. But then it's hard to sell just a software to bss. You want to attach it to a hardware. And that's why initially we, for example, in that partnership with AI stacks, it will be the entire solution. It's the BSS hardware with the software.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Gordon:</emphasis></p><p>So that definitely makes sense, should we expect them going forward that the company will be able to layer on something like an ongoing subscription revenue as it's selling these batteries?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, that is a plan. And then we have a few discussions with a few battery companies where we actually offer subscription to the models. For example, that map that we show in the shareholder letter, that is a treasure map that actually tells any battery company, or any company that needs to develop a battery where to look for in terms of new electrolytes. So that map. So we sell that map. We sell products discovered from that map. And we also sell this AI model that was used to create that map. That's the annual subscription that you mentioned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Gordon:</emphasis></p><p>Great, thank you very much. And congratulations on the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brian.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Jed Deutschmeier with the company William Blair. Jed, your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Shooter:</emphasis></p><p>Hi Xi Xia. You have Mark Shuter on for Jed Doersheimer. I'll echo those sentiments. Congratulations again on the quarter and the revenue outlook. The business is fundamentally different with multiple different revenue streams. So in that guide for the revenue, can you give a rough breakdown of where do you think that's coming from?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So this year, just roughly high level, and we mentioned in the letter, we expect bulk of this year to come from BSS and then the rest to come from a combination of the EV and drones and robotics. Just this year, now next year, and then going forward that could change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Shooter:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Okay. And in that befs, the application you're using, you're doing, you're providing the full stack, Did I hear that correctly? With contracted contract manufacturing facilities, plus the pack integration and the bms?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Shooter:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And is that a difficult market to break into?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Good question. It depends on the market. It's a very fragmented market and I think you have behind the meter and also in front of the meter. And then some parts of the market are obviously pretty dominated by the big players and some parts are more fragmented, but. But at the core, in terms of the types of cells they use are actually quite common. And you see about four to five different types of cells being used across all these different parts of the market. And then so we break into the more fragmented ones and then the medium size. But then by doing that we get access to all the data and then these data.</p><p>So the manufacturing data, the formation data, these data we use to pre train the avatar. And then we use the live cycling data from these to also train the avatar to monitor health. And the nice thing is these data come from the same cells that are used by the larger players. So once we break into the medium size and then gather data, train this avatar. This avatar can be used as a demo that we use to show the larger players.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Shooter:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. That's very helpful. Last one for me, regarding the drone applications, where are your contract manufacturers and are any of your drone customers supply chain sensitive regarding the region?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, for now they are mainly in Asia and yes, the drone manufacturers are sensitive and then they would like us to move to a more US based manufacturing and then we do have plans to do that and then we have a phase where we go through this Asia based country manufacturing first and then switch to a US based.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Shooter:</emphasis></p><p>Understood. Thanks Qia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. At this time I'd like to pass the conference back over to Kyle Pinkerton to answer a few questions. Kyle, you may proceed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyle Pilkington:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. As with past quarters, we solicited questions from investors. Prior to the call, we received a number of submissions and we'll go through a selection of those submissions now. The first question is the performance limit today of cells with high silicon anodes is the stability of the electrolyte with SES's new electrolytes and the new advanced silicon anodes, what is the expected specific energy density, cycling, durability and charge rates for 2170 cells made with these materials? What is the likelihood these cells would be preferred for EV applications?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, the high silicon anode lithium ion behave actually quite similar to lithium metal. And then in fact, the higher the silicon, the more it behaves like a lithium metal from the perspective of this electrolyte anode interface. And so high silicon currently suffer from swelling and also gassing challenges and that lead to short cycle life. And with this new electrolyte, we can significantly enhance the cycle life. And then how much improvement in cycle life really depends on the amount of silicon that's used. And if we go to 100% silicon, we actually expect to improve the cycle life. We actually expect to more than double the cycle life. So the improvement is actually higher as we increase the amount of silicon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyle Pilkington:</emphasis></p><p>Great. The next question we have is can competitors copy the new solvent your AI discovered? Is it patentable or just trade secrets?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>Definitely they can. And in this industry, especially if you have something that works really well, people will copy. And so the only way to compete is the speed. And we try to focus more on the speed of innovation and not just the innovation itself. For example, that map that we showed in the shareholder letter, that's a very good example. And others. So we're not just finding a new electrolyte and then this new electrolyte or this new solvent. Yes, if it works well, it will get copied. And that's just how it works in the industry. Anytime you have new material, if it works well, it gets copied. And if it doesn't work well, then people won't copy it. But in our case, we're not just selling a new solvent. So each dot on that map is a solvent. We're selling the map and this map. No one else has that. And the tool to create this map, to find this map, no one else has that. So we have the ability to know where these new solvents are for different applications. And this ability, for now, no one can copy that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyle Pilkington:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Going down the list. Next question. As AI technology evolves, how is SES improving its AI models to enhance battery performance, safety and manufacturing efficiency?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>So the cost of AI has come down a lot. And this has allowed us to train these models, both large language models and foundation models with more data and then this ability. And we are getting more data and both actual data from actual battery cycling and also a lot of synthetic data, basically data that did not exist before, especially for the molecule properties. And the more data we have and the more data we use to train these models, it gets more sophisticated and also the cost and efficiency have improved a lot. So it's now possible to actually run training on these massive databases in a much more cost effective way than before.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyle Pilkington:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. We'll do one more from the pre submitted questions. EVs are the number one market for 2170 cells. If SES has a better one, what is the prognosis for selling these into automotive? It seems the high silicon version might be an earlier candidate than lithium metal cells.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qichao Hu:</emphasis></p><p>So the high silicon and lithium metal are sort of parallel tracks. And then previously we focused just on lithium metal. And then now we are actually improving the cycle life of high silicon, so we're doing both. And then we already have been working with three OEMs quite closely. And I think a few quarters earlier we mentioned that there were OEMs that used 2170 cylindrical cells that we did not address because we only made pouch. So now our pouch lithium metal, we use that to address OEMs that use pouch. And then our 2170 cylindrical high silicon, we use that to address OEMs that we did not address before because we didn't have that form factor. And also, same thing for robotics. A lot of the OEMs that make EVs also make robotics. And this 2070 really allows us to address a really big market that we did not address before.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kyle Pilkington:</emphasis></p><p>Excellent. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it back over to the moderator for conclusion of the call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-a24331de5c4559988f924f3b733c53ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB2-8H23-RXHD-V4X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4272\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 AlphaStreet Inc.

The fire stands at 300 acres with no containment.</p><p>Crews yesterday completed blackline around the entire fire's perimeter. Blacklining is pre-burning fuels along the control line, which are primarily roads for this wildfire.</p><p>The area remains open, including the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and Forest Service roads. The driving public is asked to keep speeds down while around fire personnel and equipment.</p><p>The lightning-caused Yeso Fire was first reported on July 9. For safety, crews are using a less aggressive strategy to indirectly contain the fire along existing roads while it provides ecosystem benefits within the interior.</p><p>\"The fire effects are looking good so far,\" said District Ranger Angie Krall. \"This work will tie in nicely with the nearby Canjilon Wildland Urban Interface Project.\"</p><p>That project to reduce the risk of wildfire around the village of Canjilon has been in the works since 2011.

According to news originating from Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"[Objective] In order to know the changes of nutrient content and distribution of soil aggregates under Larix gmelinii plantation of different forest ages after vegetation restoration in severely burned areas of Greater Khingan Mountains. [Methods] Takes the Larix gmelinii plantation (11, 21 and 32 years) planted in 1989, 2000 and 2010 on the severely burned areas formed by the severe forest fire in Greater Khingan Mountains in 1987 as the research object.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"By measuring the contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium in soil aggregates, the nutrient distribution characteristics of soil aggregates were studied. [Results] (1) The contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen and available potassium in soil aggregates of different particle sizes increased gradually with the decrease of particle size, and the content of &lt; 0.5 mm particle size was the largest. (2) As the age of forest increased, the content of organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkali hydrolyzed nitrogen and available phosphorus in soil aggregates gradually increased. The nutrient content of soil aggregates in 32 years Larix gmelinii plantation was significantly higher than that in 11 years Larix gmelinii plantation. The contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen and available phosphorus in soil aggregates were significantly increased by 77.35%~130.24%, 77.61%~143.36%, 105.84%~147.98%, 94.58%~155.96% and 206.98% ~ 537.09%, respectively, compared with 11 years Larix gmelinii plantation (p &lt; 0.05). The organic carbon content of soil aggregates at different particle sizes in 21 years was higher than that in 11 years Larix gmelinii plantation, but there was no significant difference. (3) There was a strong correlation between organic carbon and total nitrogen and alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen in soil aggregates (p &lt; 0.01). Soil organic carbon and alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen content had the strongest correlation with &lt; 0.25 mm fraction content. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus and available potassium had the strongest correlation with &gt; 0.25 mm fraction content (p &lt; 0.01). [Conclusion] The nutrient of soil aggregates in Larix gmelinii plantation showed surface aggregation. The nutrient content of soil aggregates in Larix gmelinii plantations planted on severely burned areas in Greater Khingan Mountains increased with the increase of forest age.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The Larix gmelinii plantation planted for 32 years significantly increased the nutrient content of soil aggregates. The results provide a scientific basis for the restoration of artificial vegetation in the severely burned area of Greater Khingan Mountains.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Nutrient Characteristics of Soil Aggregates in Larix gmelinii Plantations of Different Forest Ages from Seriously Burned Area in Great Khingan Mountains.
