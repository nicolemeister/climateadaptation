According to news reporting originating from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forests are significant terrestrial biomes for carbon storage, and annual carbon accumulation of forest biomass contributes offsets affecting net greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The immediate loss of stored carbon through fire on forest lands reduces the annual offsets provided by forests.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from U.S. Forest Service (USFS): \"As such, the United States reporting includes annual estimates of direct fire emissions in conjunction with the overall forest stock and change estimates as a part of national greenhouse gas inventories within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Forest fire emissions reported for the United States, such as the 129 Tg CO2 reported for 2022, are based on the Wildland Fire Emissions Inventory System (WFEIS). Current WFEIS estimates are included in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2022 published in 2024 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Here, we describe WFEIS the fire emissions inventory system we used to address current information needs, and an analysis to confirm compatibility of carbon mass between estimated forest fire emissions and carbon in forest stocks. The summaries of emissions from forests are consistent with previous reports that show rates and interannual variability in emissions and forest land area burned are generally greater in recent years relative to the 1990s. Both emissions and interannual variability are greater in the western United States. The years with the highest CO2 emissions from forest fires on the 48 conterminous states plus Alaska were 2004, 2005, and 2015. In some years, Alaska emissions exceed those of the 48 conterminous states, such as in 2022, for example. Comparison of forest fire emission to forest carbon stocks indicate there is unlikely any serious disconnect between inventory and fire emissions estimates.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The WFEIS system is a user-driven approach made available via a web browser. Model results are compatible with the scope and reporting needs of the annual national greenhouse gas inventories.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Application of the wildland fire emissions inventory system to estimate fire emissions on forest lands of the United States.

The EO also suggests that the Interior Department offer up more land for timber lease sales.</p><p>Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) in a social media post thanked Trump for \"slashing bureaucratic red tape and expanding America's timber production.\"</p><p>But environmentalists argue the move will \"decimate\" federal forests. \"Clearcutting our public lands for private profit will destroy mature and old-growth forests, pollute our air and water, and in bypassing the Endangered Species Act (ESA), actively drive vulnerable wildlife to extinction,\" says a statement from the Climate Forests coalition that includes the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice and Sierra Club.</p><p>The timber EO \"is part of a pattern to undermine science, gut the federal workforce, and privatize our public lands.\"</p><p>The coalition also notes that the Trump administration recently tapped timber industry leader Tom Schultz to lead the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) -- which, like numerous other federal agencies, is facing a major reduction in staff. Schultz served as the vice president of resources and government affairs at Idaho Forest Group.</p><p>\"The order is a disingenuous effort to shift management of our public lands from the public to private companies focused on exploiting natural resources at the expense of communities, wildlife, and clean water. Privatizing management of our public lands will increase the risk of wildfire, exacerbate the climate crisis, and lead to the extinction of species that depend on these ecosystems,\" the coalition's release says.</p><p>Environmentalists generally dispute the claim that using biomass for power results in a net reduction in carbon emissions, and they add that logging older trees harms climate adaptation efforts because they are more resilient to the effects of wildfire compared with younger trees.</p><p>The move comes as California policymakers are also grappling with whether to adopt a carbon credit or offset to help encourage proactive burning in ways that would help avoid forest fires.</p><p>A California state senator recently introduced legislation that would require state air officials to adopt such a carbon credit or offset protocol for biochar or other such natural wood products created from prescribed burns for forest fire prevention or agricultural biomass that helps to avoid major fires that would lead to far greater carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>At the federal level, lawmakers have long clashed over whether biomass energy should be treated as carbon neutral for regulatory purposes.</p><p>Democrats unsuccessfully floated a proposal in 2022 that would have softened a longstanding appropriations policy pressing EPA and the Energy and Agriculture Departments to recognize biomass as carbon neutral. The longtime rider included in such spending bills generally directs those agencies to make policies based on the carbon neutral assumption.</p><p>The Democrats' proposal -- backed by environmentalists -- would have added a requirement that the best available science be used in any policy decisions related to biomass emissions.</p><p>EO Actions</p><p>Specifically, the new EO directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USFS to issue new or updated guidance on increasing timber production.</p><p>\"The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall also each submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget any legislative proposals that would expand authorities to improve timber production and sound forest management.\"</p><p>In terms of directives to speed permitting, Interior officials should complete a strategy to \"improve the speed of approving forestry projects\" under the section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which requires agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service when proposed actions might affect a listed endangered species.</p><p>\"The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the FWS, shall also examine any applicable existing authorities that would permit executive departments and agencies . . . to delegate consultation requirements under section 7 of the ESA to other agencies and, if necessary, provide a legislative proposal to ensure consultation is streamlined.\"</p><p>The EO also says that within 180 days, the secretaries of Interior and Agriculture \"shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adopt categorical exclusions administratively established by other agencies to comply with [NEPA] and reduce unnecessarily lengthy processes and associated costs related to administrative approvals for timber production, forest management, and wildfire risk reduction treatments.\"</p><p>Within 280 days, Interior should also consider establishing a new categorical exclusion for timber thinning, and it should also re-establish a categorical exclusion for timber salvage activities.</p><p>More broadly, \"all relevant agencies shall eliminate, to the maximum extent permissible by law, all undue delays within their respective permitting processes related to timber production.\" Agencies should also work to \"suspend, revise, or rescind\" any prior agency actions that impose \"an undue burden on timber production.\"</p><p>The EO's NEPA-related language comes as Trump's White House Council on Environmental Quality has revoked its cross-agency NEPA implementing rule and replaced it with guidance that directs agencies to rely on their individual NEPA regulations. This could increase uncertainty for those awaiting federal approvals, while also shifting the focus to individual agencies' rules.</p><p>The timber EO also directs Interior and Agriculture to submit to Trump a plan detailing how much BLM- and USFS-managed land should be offered for lease sale for each of the next four years. -- Abigail Mihaly (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:amihaly@iwpnews.com\">amihaly@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IUSCLI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IUSCLI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F84-GPD3-RTGX-W547-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1159\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside EPA's Climate Extra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 4, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

According to news reporting originating from the University of Bonn by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The conversion of tropical forests in the Amazon region for agriculture and other land uses is associated with health risks linked, for example, to air and water pollution from forest fires and agrochemical use.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Bundesministerium FuR Bildung Und Forschung; Ec | Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Bonn: \"Several conservation policies introduced in the 2000s aimed at reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Here we exploit variations in the regional targeting of these policies to measure human health externalities of conservation policy enforcement using a double-difference approach at close distance to the Amazon biome border. We find that the change in deforestation pressure reduces forest fire incidence. As a consequence, fine particulate matter concentrations in the air-a main vector for adverse health effects of fire smoke-also decrease.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This leads to a reduction in the hospitalization and death prevalence rate due to respiratory health problems and other health benefits for the local population.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Health benefits of reduced deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Communications Earth &amp; Environment, 2024,5(1):1-9.

According to news originating from Pune, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forests are vital for life on Earth but are threatened by forest fires, which have significant impacts on climate change both locally and globally.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Savitribai Phule Pune University: \"This study examines a forest fire that lasted from 15 to 26 February 2019 in Karnataka, India, using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to analyze the effects and atmospheric spread of fire-emitted aerosols. Model simulations are analyzed to understand the horizontal and vertical transport and radiative effects of the fire. The results show high aerosol levels and smoke particles reaching up to 3.5 km altitude and above.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The fire raised near-surface air temperatures by ~1-1.5 \u00b0C. The net atmospheric forcing due to the fire over the affected area ranged from approximately 10 to 14 W/m2, resulting in heating rates between about 0.002 and 0.005 K/day in the impacted region.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Aerosol Emission Patterns from the February 2019 Karnataka Fire. Fire, 2024,7(12). (Fire - https://www.mdpi.com/journal/fire). The publisher for Fire is MDPI AG. <br/> A free version of this journal article is available at https://doi.org/10.3390/fire7120424. <br/> Our news editors report that more information may be obtained by contacting Rohini L. Bhawar, Department of Atmospheric and Space Sciences, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune 411007, India.

The strong winds and dry conditions have been cited as major contributing factors to the widespread weather event.</p><p>Two Syracuse University faculty experts weigh in on the historic natural disaster impacting California this week. Their comments below can be quoted directly. They are also available for interviews.</p><p>********</p><p>Jacob Bendix is professor emeritus in the Geography and the Environment Department in Syracuse University's Maxwell School. His research areas include impacts of disturbance (principally fire and floods) on plant communities and media coverage of the environment. He has spoken extensively with journalists about the 2023 Canadian wildfires, California Corral Fire and the Maui wildfires.</p><p>Bendix says:</p><p>\"The fires currently devastating multiple neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area serve to remind us of the impact of climate change. The fires are driven by the infamous downslope Santa Ana winds that become hotter and drier as they descend, creating particularly incendiary conditions. These winds are strongest in the winter, but historically by winter there was enough rain to soak fuels and limit wildfires. Thus, Santa Ana-driven fires were usually concentrated in the fall, when the winds had begun but fuels were still dry.</p><p>\"This is where climate change comes in. It is already January, but Southern California remains dry, gripped by drought and high temperatures. Both drought and heat are known to be more likely in the context of human-caused climate change, so the fires burning now cannot be dismissed as anomalous events. We must recognize that such fires are likely to become more common in the future. The news stories each time will fade after a few days or weeks, but the impacts in terms of lost homes and workplaces will last far longer for local residents, and virtually everyone in the region is likely to face escalating insurance costs, or difficulty obtaining insurance at all.\"</p><p>Tripti Bhattacharya is an associate professor in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department in Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences. Her work focuses on understanding the sensitivity of regional rainfall to global climate change.</p><p>She is available for interviews by phone, web video conferencing or email.</p><p>Bhattacharya says:</p><p>\"It's really devastating to see what is unfolding.</p><p>\"It is a combination of several factors: one is drought, as Southern California has seen very little precipitation this winter, resulting in extremely dry vegetation and soils. On top of that, recent days have seen gusts of dry wind, typically known as 'Santa Ana' winds. These gusts have the ability to cause fire to propagate quickly.</p><p>\"We cannot attribute a single event to human-caused climate change per se, but we do know from peer-reviewed scientific literature that the length of the fire season is increasing. Moreover, state of the art models analyzed in peer reviewed studies have shown that climate change is responsible overall for higher temperatures and drier vegetation, amplifying forest fire activity.</p><p>\"This is the new reality communities in places like Southern California are facing.\"</p><p>To request interviews or get more information:</p><p>Daryl Lovell</p><p>Associate Director of Media Relations</p><p>Division of Communications</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126910553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVM-NX93-RRTR-H230-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 8, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from the Forest Research Institute by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"On 1 April 1963, the Department of Forest Fire Protection was established at the Forest Research Institute, which resulted from the need to develop scientific and organisational bases for building a forest fire protection system that would effectively minimise the growing fire hazard of Polish forests.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Forest Research Institute: \"The Department began its activities by developing a programme that took into account both the immediate but urgent needs of the forestry and the anticipated directions of research. Over the course of 60 years, more than 350 research reports were produced.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Among the achievements that have influenced the currently functioning forest fire protection system in Poland there are: the method of forest fire risk assessment, forest fire risk prediction, the creation of fire risk monitoring based on a network of forest meteorological measuring points, the development of forest fuel models, the extensive use of aircraft to detect and extinguish forest fires, the conduct of the first studies on the possibility of using television cameras to detect forest fires, the operation of the National Forest Fire Information System, the purpose of which is to collect data on forest fires and natural non-forest areas, the development of an application for forest fire models and the conduct of the first workshop on controlled heath burn in the country. Among the many projects completed, there were also those dealing with the evaluation and suitability of equipment and chemicals for extinguishing forest fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Laboratory of Forest Fire Protection - 60 Years of Research in the Field of Forest Fire Protection.

According to news reporting out of Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The timely and effective detection of forest fires is crucial for environmental and socio-economic protection.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Key Research And Development Plan of Jiangsu Province. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"Existing deep learning models struggle to balance accuracy and a lightweight design. We introduce SWVR, a new lightweight deep learning algorithm. Utilizing the Reparameterization Vision Transformer (RepViT) and Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM), SWVR efficiently extracts fire-related features with reduced computational complexity. It features a bi-directional fusion network combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, incorporates lightweight Ghost Shuffle Convolution (GSConv), and uses the Wise Intersection over Union (WIoU) loss function. SWVR achieves 79.6% accuracy in detecting forest fires, which is a 5.9% improvement over the baseline, and operates at 42.7 frames per second. It also reduces the model parameters by 11.8% and the computational cost by 36.5%.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our results demonstrate SWVR's effectiveness in achieving high accuracy with fewer computational resources, offering practical value for forest fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: SWVR: A Lightweight Deep Learning Algorithm for Forest Fire Detection and Recognition.

But some programs spend thousands, even millions, of dollars raising parrots in captivity, only to find that these birds are not able to survive in the wild because they don't have enough 'real-world experience.'\"</p><p>While blue and yellow macaws are not endangered, the researchers hope to apply their techniques to populations in desperate need of conservation help.</p><p>The new method uses free-flight training, a technique developed to allow pet owners to fly macaws and other large parrots in open areas, similar to falconry.</p><p>Though the technique has been used with parrots for a couple of decades, this team of researchers has only recently introduced free flight as a conservation tool.</p><p>\"We facilitate young macaws learning to fly, join flocks and evade predators by carefully exposing them to situations they would normally encounter anyway, all at the right stage of development,\" said Chris Biro of Liberty Wings Freeflight Training, an expert in free flying parrots who helped develop the technique back in the early 2000s. \"Using this method, the macaws in this study gradually learned to fly outside their cages in a controlled environment, which helped them be ready to fly freely in the wild.\"</p><p>\"This method is incredibly efficient because it doesn't require generations of a species learning how to survive in a specific environment by trial and error,\" said Dr. Connie Woodman, the program manager for the USDA Conservation Innovation Grants program at Texas AandM University and a VTPB faculty member. \"By fledging into the release environment and watching the trained adults, our released birds can quickly learn key survival skills and significantly increase their chances of survival.\"</p><p>Learning To Fly</p><p>Preparing captive macaws to survive in the wild begins when the birds are young, about the time that they begin to get curious about the world outside the nest.</p><p>\"Before a baby parrot begins fledging the process of learning to fly and leave the nest it will start climbing up and looking out at the world outside,\" Biro said. \"Already, that chick is creating a mental database of what's normal for its world. If they see a predator, that would be out of the ordinary, so the chick learns to react to threats.\"</p><p>At a later developmental stage, the chicks are encouraged to walk onto a perch and then to jump to nearby perches. From there, they begin learning to fly.</p><p>\"To help the chicks learn to fly as a flock, we even train them together with other chicks and the trained adult birds, so they learn to go from 'point A' to 'point B' together. Before long, they learn to fly in beautiful, tight flocks,\" Brightsmith said.</p><p>At night and in between training sessions, the parrots rest safely in the aviary, where they receive food and water. But over time, the young birds spend less and less time in the aviary and with the adult birds, learning to find food and water on their own.</p><p>\"A key part of the process is actually breaking the bond between the parrots and the humans that have been feeding them,\" Brightsmith said. \"In his work with parrots, Chris actually discovered that when the chicks are around 8 months old, they begin to move away from their parents and become independent. We make sure to wean the birds off hand feeding by this time so they transition to being independent wild birds, just like they would with their parents.\"</p><p>Combining Free Flight With Conservation</p><p>Free flying is a promising conservation strategy because it takes advantage of macaws' natural development while allowing researchers to control certain variables, like location.</p><p>\"In many traditional releases, once you open the cage, the birds get only one shot at success,\" Brightsmith said. \"Often, they fly off in one direction for 10 to 15 kilometers (six to nine miles) until they're exhausted; then they land and have no idea where anything is. They get hungry and thirsty and become easy for predators to pick off. But by doing free flight training in the environment where the birds will be released, they gradually learn the landscape, where to find food and water, and how to find their way home.\"</p><p>Releasing macaws in groups also increases the chances of creating new populations that will grow over time, increasing their numbers in the wild.</p><p>\"With those traditional releases, the parrots might fly off in completely different directions and not be anywhere near a potential mate,\" Brightsmith said. \"That's not very helpful for increasing the numbers of an existing population or starting a new one.\"</p><p>Surviving A Forest Fire</p><p>The ultimate test for the researchers' study flock came the day after their article was published.</p><p>\"A forest fire ripped through the area,\" Woodman said. \"To survive a natural disaster like that, animals have to have very good skills. We were very worried, both for the flock's survival and for the effect it would have on our research. Without good evidence of our method's success, it was less likely that other researchers would believe that it works.\"</p><p>For about 36 hours, the team waited anxiously for news of the flock's survival.</p><p>\"We finally received word from the field project leader, Dr. Humberto Mendes of the Universidade Federal de Alfenas, that all six birds were found sitting in the trees outside the fire zone,\" Woodman said. \"Not only did they survive, but they reunited as a flock. That means they've survived now for two years without human help, and they're skilled enough to survive a disaster like this.\"</p><p>As humans continue to encroach on parrots' natural habitats and droughts become more common due to climate change, disasters like the fire may become a more common challenge, making it vitally important that conservationists help animals learn to adapt to new situations.</p><p>\"I think a lot of us probably remember those nature documentaries for kids that stress the importance of not interfering with nature, that it's important to let something take its course,\" Woodman said. \"The problem is that we've already interfered so much with the changes we have made to our climate and ecosystems worldwide. The good news is that with techniques like free flight training we can also help put species back and rewild our damaged ecosystems.\"</p><p>The Future Of Free Flight Research</p><p>Free flight conservation research is tricky to do because it involves so many different organizations.</p><p>\"We call it a trans-boundary partnership,\" Woodman said. \"That's because it involves academia, government and private industry, and they all have their own boundaries and rules to follow. Not only are we having to cross boundaries to make the research happen, but the birds themselves cross boundaries literally when they fly into other countries.\"</p><p>With the success of their recent study, the team is hopeful that other conservationists will begin applying free flight techniques, especially to species that are endangered or threatened.</p><p>\"There's room to believe that similar techniques might be possible with other kinds of animals,\" Biro said. \"What's important is that whoever is using this method understands the reason behind each step.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126851470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHF-Y4W1-JCBF-S26X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1375\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 26, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>TEXAS A &amp; M UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EVP</classCode><className>MEDICAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001319</classCode><className>PETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000092</classCode><className>ANIMAL WELFARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CR2G</classCode><className>BIOMEDICINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002046</classCode><className>PATHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CR2G</classCode><className>BIOMEDICINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002046</classCode><className>PATHOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS159</classCode><className>TEXAS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting out of Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Earth resource and environmental monitoring are essential areas that can be used to investigate the environmental conditions and natural resources supporting sustainable policy development, regulatory measures, and their implementation elevating the environment. Large-scale forest fire is considered a major harmful hazard that affects climate change and life over the globe.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include King Khalid University, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, \"Therefore, the early identification of forest fires using automated tools is essential to avoid the spread of fire to a large extent. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of automated forest fire detection using a fusion-based deep learning (AFFD-FDL) model for environmental monitoring. The AFFD-FDL technique involves the design of an entropy-based fusion model for feature extraction. The combination of the handcrafted features using histogram of gradients (HOG) with deep features using SqueezeNet and Inception v3 models. Besides, an optimal extreme learning machine (ELM) based classifier is used to identify the existence of fire or not. In order to properly tune the parameters of the ELM model, the oppositional glowworm swarm optimization (OGSO) algorithm is employed and thereby improves the forest fire detection performance. A wide range of simulation analyses takes place on a benchmark dataset and the results are inspected under several aspects.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The experimental results highlighted the betterment of the AFFD-FDL technique over the recent state of art techniques.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Fusion-based Deep Learning Model for Automated Forest Fire Detection.

According to news originating from Barrie, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The Internet of Things (IoT) applications generate large volumes of data, which needs to be processed securely, reliably, and promptly for effective decision-making. However, the limited processing capability of IoT devices is a significant bottleneck in processing these datasets.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Natural Sciences And Engineering Research Council of Canada; Lakehead University. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Lakehead University: \"In scenarios like forest fire surveillance, flash flood alert systems, or wildlife activity tracking, where IoT devices are deployed in remote locations and only need coverage for a few weeks a year, thus deploying permanent base stations is not a feasible solution. One potential solution to overcome this challenge is to use Federated learning (FL) with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. FL enables collaborative model training across decentralized IoT devices by keeping data local, eliminating the need for centralized data collection. This approach is especially effective when IoT devices generate large volumes of data, making FL an ideal solution for data-sensitive, resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a UAV-aided FL framework that utilizes the computation capacity of UAV-MEC to process some portion of the datasets from the straggling devices (devices which are unable to process their dataset in reasonable time and are lagging, increasing delay in the whole system). We also incorporate an IoT device importance and selection scheme to further improve system performance. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize system delay, considering UAV-MEC's computation power, computation and communication power of IoT devices, and quality of service constraints. To solve the problem, we transform the proposed problem by introducing auxiliary variables and epigraph form. We then use the concurrent deterministic simplex with root relaxation algorithm.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We also propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to improve runtime complexity. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to existing approaches.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Minimizing Delay in UAV-Aided Federated Learning for IoT Applications With Straggling Devices.

According to news reporting originating from Belgrade, Serbia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Deforestation and forest degradation are one of the most complex ecological challenges worldwide.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Belgrade: \"Multispectral imaging and remote sensing help researchers and forest managers to quantify forest loss and degradation. By combining multiple bands of satellite data, multispectral indices can highlight changes in forest structure and reduce the cost and time required for field research. In this research multispectral indices and remote sensing are used in different areas of forestry (such as deforestation, wildfires, phenology) and five examples of remote sensing in forest monitoring are presented. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to quantify deforestation in ski center in Kopaonik National park. The Normalized Burn Ration (NBR) is used to assess forest fire damage in \u0160ar planina National Park. The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) is used to monitor some phenological events in Fru\u0161ka gora National Park.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The moisture content of vegetation in Djerdap National Park is analyzed with the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and pest damage is monitored with the NDVI and the Normalized Difference Rededge Vegetation Index (NDRE) in Tara National Park. The results of these five case study analyses show that multispectral imaging provides the most evident results in monitoring deforestation, while pest and disease damage is difficult to detect.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Application of multispectral imaging in forest monitoring: A case study of national parks in Republic of Serbia.

Speech, press, assembly, religion: these are all accepted as sacrosanct rights by reasonable people across the political spectrum. But should we not have the same freedom when it comes to the economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In view of today's divisive tariff debate, I want to explore economic freedom in as nonpartisan a tone as possible by looking at the two diametrically opposed schools of trade-related economic thought: free trade and its arch nemesis, protectionism. And to help us understand the relationship between free trade and protectionism I will also examine two closely related and time-tested economic principles, comparative advantage and the division of labor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Free trade has been one of the more contentious and enduring public economic policy issues, from America's colonial days until today. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn1\">[1] To most economists and businesspeople it means the possibility of unlimited economic and social opportunity. But to others (like politicians and many of their uninformed constituents) it's a zero-sum boogeyman that spells trouble in the form of lost jobs, lower wages, higher prices, and an overall decline in our standard of living.</url></p><p>It's unfortunate that the contemporary debate over free trade is influenced more by the smoke-and-mirrors of left-right partisanship than by objective economic understanding. It's a debate that too often skitters off the road into a ditch of emotional irrationality, with fear and anger overpowering reason and logic-and we can blame social media for fostering and amplifying our state of manic irrationality. It's a debate fueled, for example, by the misunderstood effects of the twenty-odd bi- and multi-lateral free trade agreements (FTAs), beginning with Israel in 1985 and Canada in 1988, ratified by the U.S. over the last forty years. The mainstream media regularly feed the public a mixed bag of truth and fallacy about either the benefits or the evil consequences of free trade, and the rhetoric was especially intense on both sides in the years leading up to the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn2\">[2] But when we cut through all the partisan and emotional blather, it's empirically clear that FTAs like NAFTA have grown the U.S. economy by opening up new market opportunities for our goods, services and technologies that would otherwise be more difficult to penetrate. U.S. Commerce Department statistics show the aggregate net benefits of free trade. The USMCA is still too new to glean any meaningful statistical insight, but a review of NAFTA data shows that U.S. trade with our NAFTA partners increased almost three-fold over the first fifteen years of NAFTA, from $343.2 billion to $967.8 billion.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn3\">[3]</url></p><p>Despite the evidence of NAFTA's benefits, many continue to rail against freer trade as inherently harmful to the American economy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn4\">[4] Free trade agreements, they also say, nibble away at America's sovereignty by placing limits on our ability to self-regulate our economy with trade barriers. Writing in pre-NAFTA 1986, the late economist John Culbertson, who was one of the most vocal critics of free trade, said that 'our blind allegiance to free trade threatens our national standard of living' and condemns America to a future of economic despair.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn5\">[5]</url></p><p>Like Culbertson, some current critics of free trade-most notably President Trump-argue that an open-border trade policy comes at too heavy a price. Labor unions habitually complain that free trade causes high-paying manufacturing jobs to move to lower-cost regions of the world, such as Southeast Asia or Latin America (and yet these same unions fail their membership all too often by insisting on concessions that stunt growth and innovation in favor of a status quo that fails to reflect current economic realities). Many well-known global consumer brands outsource their manufacturing activities to specialized contract manufacturing firms that operate factories in low-cost regions. Indeed, states that traditionally had local economies based primarily on blue-collar industrial jobs, rustbelt states like Ohio and Michigan lost many of these jobs, and trade agreements like NAFTA were denounced as the reason. Ross Perot, arguably the most prominent opponent of NAFTA (until Donald Trump came along), famously warned us during the 1992 presidential campaign of the 'giant sucking sound' of jobs leaving America if NAFTA were to become reality. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn6\">[6] There is absolutely no credible empirical evidence (as opposed to conjecture, cherry-picked outliers, or anecdotal gotchas!) that free trade agreements, or global trade in general, have ever resulted in a net loss of American jobs.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn7\">[7]</url></p><p>To free trade advocates, the lost-jobs argument is a red herring because it looks at isolated snapshots of our economy to damn free trade, without considering a broader range of potential benefits-benefits that are harder to see unless one makes the effort to look below the surface. All a free trade critic has to do is find an industry (or a town or region) in decline, and name free trade as the villain. Human beings need to find someone or something to blame when bad things happen, so if a factory closure can be blamed on the elephant in the room-hello, NAFTA-then inevitably there will be indignant condemnation of free trade from business leaders, labor unions, and local politicians. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn8\">[8] But NAFTA must be the culprit! It's so obvious! This myopic cause-and-effect argument is persuasive to an observer with emotional ties to the affected communities or families, or even to some arm's-length casual observers. Indignant complaints based on nothing more than phantom speculation (reinforced by preconceived biases against foreigners and aversion to change)</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn9\">[9] become accepted as fact when repeated loudly and often. But when an isolated snapshot appears to show that NAFTA was the cause of a factory closure in Ohio, we need to look at the broader consequences to reveal how the benefits of free trade accrue over time across the entire economic spectrum. In the aggregate, all strata of society benefit when trade barriers are reduced or eliminated, whether in mature economies like the U.S. or in developing economies. Generally speaking, factory workers and CEOs and everyone in between will see improvement in living standards and personal wealth over time in an open market system, unhindered by artificial political borders or excessive regulation (or rampant corruption, as is the case in some countries), in which productive workers in innovative enterprises are allowed the opportunity to succeed or fail.</url></p><p>In a healthy, growing economy, the death of an underperforming company or industry is not an unwelcome outcome when considered in pragmatic economic terms (and by underperforming I mean relative to the current economic environment). <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn10\">[10] Paradoxically, creative destruction of underachieving companies is necessary in a healthy economy because it frees up resources for more efficient redeployment, just as an occasional forest fire cleanses a forest and encourages new growth. But, some may shout, what about the workers who lose their jobs? Clearly the labor aspects of free trade pose major challenges on several levels. Jobs are lost when a company decides to move a factory from the American side of the border to the Mexican side, affecting the families of every worker who loses their job-but the effects are no less injurious to these families than if the factory had moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona. Workers will be temporarily displaced when a factory closes its doors for any reason-this is, after all, the nature of capitalism, regardless of the influences of politically motivated trade policies-but a failed business will be replaced by a new enterprise that, unencumbered by bad habits and calcified management, is hungrier, more nimble, more innovative, more aware of and responsive to the marketplace, and thus in a better position to enrich its workers, its stakeholders, and the broader society. Charles Darwin's evolutionary theories are at work in business as well as biology.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn11\">[11] Species must evolve or they stagnate and inevitably die, just as industries must innovate-by optimizing customer experience, by continuously improving both its products and its processes, by rationalizing its costs, by outsmarting the competition, and by adapting to ever-changing market and regulatory forces-or fail. The taxi industry operated under a business model that hadn't changed all that much in nearly a century, but the industry was forced to deal with the new business paradigm introduced by Uber and Lyft. The innovation and convenience offered by these start-ups has forced the old-school taxi businesses to reexamine-and hopefully improve-their business model. A tech company that was famously slow to adapt is Blackberry. Once the gold standard in the early years of the smartphone industry (under its previous name, Research in Motion, or RIM), Blackberry failed to respond to the innovative products introduced by its larger yet more nimble competitors like Apple and Samsung. Blackberry made the mistake of taking its customers' brand loyalty for granted and then found itself on the brink of disaster as the iPhone and Android phones gained popularity. Perhaps the most impressive example of a change agent is Amazon, the internet retailer that strikes fear into the hearts of every (remaining) brick-and-mortar retailer.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn12\">[12]</url></p><p>In a dynamic economy, the loss of jobs in one sector sparks a realignment of the marketplace, resulting in the creation of new jobs in another sector, often a sector that did not exist previously. Propping up inefficient and underperforming industries is counterproductive in the long term because it delays the redeployment of labor into more innovative and profitable enterprises. Workers who linger in dying companies, rather than getting the training they need to be more successful in the next phase of their worklives, are ill-served by postponing the inevitable. Those workers who once made carburetors, walkmans, typewriters and cabbage patch dolls were forced to adjust their careers as technologies and consumer demands evolved.</p><p>Creative destruction of jobs is not a new phenomenon. Lee Francis Lybarger wrote in 1914 that: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn13\">[13]</url></p><p>Transition is not destruction. It usually means growth. Because people have ceased to produce one thing and are producing another in its place, is no evidence that they are losers. They are probably gainers. Look at the men who were 'thrown out of work' because the self-binder took the place of the cradle; because the threshing machine took the place of the flail, and the mowing machine 'drove out' the scythe. Think of the hundreds of men that every invention throws out of employment. But has labor ceased to produce? Not at all. It has simply changed the direction of its production. Is it less productive because of the transition? On the contrary, it is more productive.</p><p>Economic progress is often a one-step-back-two-steps-forward proposition. It's unfortunate from a public relations perspective that the full cycle of creative destruction is not immediately evident, because the connection between today's destruction and tomorrow's creation goes unnoticed. So, while job destruction inexorably leads to job creation, it's the immediacy of destruction that typically makes the headlines. Bad news always gets more attention than good news, with news consumers' angst over a backward step overpowering their interest in the successes of the forward steps. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn14\">[14] An industry may make headlines when it gives pink slips to 10,000 workers in one fell swoop, but the creation of the next generation of jobs is more incremental and thus less newsworthy. Even in an economy driven ever-increasingly by speed-speed of innovation, speed of bringing a product to market-it takes time to build a brick-and-mortar infrastructure and to bring innovation to the marketplace (far less time, of course, than fifty or eighty years ago, but certainly it's not an instantaneous transformation) with the connection between the destruction and the creation going unnoticed. For workers who struggle from paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet, getting caught in the destruction phase of an economic transition period can be uncomfortable at best and devastating at worst, especially for those with the least education and the fewest marketable skills, but the majority of workers will in the aggregate and over time ultimately find themselves and their families in a better financial position. Protectionists view trade with fear, believing that more for those evil foreigners means less for America. But free traders understand that trade isn't a zero-sum competition that requires a winner and a loser. The goal of everyone, our politicians included ought to be to grow the economy without regard to artificial political fences, raising the standard of living for all.</url></p><p>Free trade creates access, choices and opportunities-intrinsic conditions that drive an economy to greater success in a free capitalist society. Free trade creates an environment that in many ways is self-correcting. It forces a weak industry to improve or perish, and it propels a shrewd enterprise to achievement that wouldn't be possible under a restrictive trade regime. It forces an industry to constantly reinvent itself, to reallocate its resources-including its labor force-in order to realize greater efficiencies resulting in lower costs and thus lower prices for consumers. Free trade also rightly places emphasis on the needs of consumers, not the interests of producers, because the ultimate goal always must be consumption rather than production. Production occurs to serve consumption, not vice versa. And free trade encourages a smart business to leverage its absolute and comparative advantages.</p><p>Comparative Advantage and Division of Labor</p><p>My very first class on my very first day of college forty-nine years ago was Macroeconomics 101. In that early-morning seminar (7:00am!) I was introduced through bleary eyes to the work of the early nineteenth-century British economist David Ricardo, who developed the theory of comparative advantage. On its face, the theory may seem illogical, yet it stands as one of the more enduring principles in the field of international economics. Comparative advantage looks at the differences between those who have the capacity to produce a good. Comparative advantage tells us that two countries (or companies) will mutually benefit from engaging in trade with each other as a consequence of their relative productivity in various industries. In a hypothetical example let's presume that the United States (clearly a dominant economic power) and the tiny west African nation of Togo (clearly not a power) both produce scissors and paper. If we also presume that the U.S. is undoubtedly better at making both products, is there any benefit to either country to initiate bilateral trade in scissors or paper? The answer is yes, even though the U.S. has an absolute advantage in both industries. If the U.S. is five times more efficient than Togo at making paper, but only twice as efficient at producing scissors, it holds a relatively greater advantage in papermaking. Comparative advantage tells us that a country should sell what it's more efficient at producing and purchase what it's less efficient at producing. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn15\">[15] Hence both Togo and the U.S. will benefit if the U.S. sells paper to Togo and Togo sells scissors to the U.S.-even though the U.S. is the better scissors-making country. In other words, everyone wins when countries produce (export) based on their comparative strengths but buy (import) based on their comparative weaknesses.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn16\">[16]</url></p><p>Comparative advantages aren't chiseled in stone but are constantly changing as a country's economy evolves. A country's roster of industries is in constant flux, guided by the invisible hand of market forces. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn17\">[17] Industries constantly innovate, developing new products and services that consumers find attractive while phasing out the older and thus less desirable (and less profitable) offerings. Developed countries (such as the U.S., Canada, South Korea, Japan or the E.U. members) are typically where most innovation occurs, so these countries develop comparative advantages in the cutting-edge industries and technologies that fuel (and are fueled by) more innovation. But as an industry matures, and as the attention and resources of an innovative country are diverted to the next great opportunity, the comparative advantages linked to the mature industry are likely to migrate to less-developed countries where production costs are cheaper. And in many of today's industries we find, even at the individual product level, that comparative advantages are dispersed over multiple countries, which one could argue is either a cause or a consequence of modern supply chain and serial production practices. We also find that comparative advantages can be enhanced by natural advantages, like a longer growing season or a nearby supply of a particular natural resource, but it can also be the result of man-made advantages, whether existing or created a new, that are available within a local economy. Proficiency in English is a man-made advantage, as is access to specialized universities. So, too, is a government willing to bestow subsidies to a favored industry or company. So comparative advantage is derived from the symbiosis between an entrepreneur's creativity and the environment in which he or she creates.</url></p><p>Economic activities are commonly categorized based on artificial political borders or industry segmentation, but comparative advantage is applicable to more than just nation-to-nation or industry-to-industry comparisons. Whether we realize it or not, we practice comparative advantage every day in our own lives. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn18\">[18] In fact, practically every transaction we enter into is based on comparative advantage-and on another of Adam Smith's time-tested principles: the division of labor, which speaks to the development of specialized skills in individual workers. It is fair to say that we, as individuals, don't sew our own clothes, build our own homes, grow our own crops, slaughter our own livestock, pull our own teeth, write our own software, or fix our own cars. Most of us wouldn't have a clue about how to accomplish any of these tasks, so we outsource these activities to specialists (or clusters of specialists that range in size from self-employed individuals to multinational corporations) who have the skills, experience and resources to do these jobs far more efficiently, more cost-effectively, and with greater quality than we could do them ourselves. We may know some of these specialists personally, like our dentist or landscaper, but many, many more of these specialists who improve our lives are strangers to us. Our only connection to these strangers is mutually beneficial trade.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn19\">[19]</url></p><p>Imagine how different your life would be if you literally had to do everything yourself. Yes, you may feel pride in your self-sufficiency, but being self-sufficient (in the do-it-all-yourself sense rather than the making-your-way-in-the-world sense) doesn't lead to prosperity, whether individually or as a society. Quite the contrary, self-sufficiency mires an individual in a life of poverty, with few opportunities to achieve even the most rudimentary level of comfort and security. Any pride you may initially feel about your self-sufficiency will be replaced in short order by desperation and hopelessness. Look around your house and take a mental inventory of everything you've acquired-using the money you earned from your own specialty-and then identify everything you made with your own two hands. Maybe you dabble in woodworking as a hobby and made a coffee table or kitchen chair, or maybe your walls are hung with seascapes your spouse painted in his or her free time. But virtually everything else in your house (and the house itself!) was made by nameless specialists scattered across the globe, in many cases using technologies that you have no need to understand except to satisfy your curiosity. And even if you are a prolific weekend woodworker or still-life painter, where did your supplies and tools come from? Did you chop down the tree and mill the lumber? Did you mine the iron ore used to produce your tools, or the pigments that make Cerulean Blue? Did you spin the fibers and weave the canvas that you paint on? And, more fundamentally, what forces are at work to afford you the luxury of free time to devote to a hobby?</p><p>If we each had to personally mine, grow, or make every necessity and accoutrement in our lives, we'd be so busy wasting our most valuable resource-our time-on a multitude of different chores that we'd never become proficient at anything-and we'd be hopelessly impoverished, no better off than a peasant in the Dark Ages. We would be utterly unable to produce even a tiny fraction of the goods (and services) that we can buy with the click of a mouse, using the money we each earned from our work in our own particular specialties. How could we become doctors or plumbers or artists or engineers or auto mechanics or teachers or trade compliance experts if all our time was spent doing things that we could hire a specialist to do? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn20\">[20] Life's necessities would be an existential daily worry, and leisure goods and activities would be unthinkable. We'd waste the minutes and hours of each day trying in vain to keep up with the many tasks necessary for a comfortable and safe life, and we could never do any of them as efficiently and skillfully as a specialist could, no matter how diligent we were, because we couldn't afford the education, training, technology and capital infrastructure needed to improve production (not to mention quality). Efficiency is impossible without know-how and access to modern technologies. If we each decide it's a good idea to fix our own cars, could we? Should we? Do we each have a garage with a hydraulic lift and every mechanic's tool imaginable? Of course not. And so it would take us ninety highly inefficient (and perhaps dangerous) minutes to change our oil in our driveway rather than the ten minutes it would take the pros at Jiffy Lube.</url></p><p>The technology conundrum is one of the major reasons why underdeveloped countries or regions remain underdeveloped. It's not viable for a farmer who owns only one acre of land in a country with an immature economy (or a restrictive political system) to buy modern farming machinery because the cost would be beyond his reach, and could never be recovered even if he could afford it, so he continues to use outdated methods and equipment, as do all his neighbors. He doesn't have the economies of scale that would allow him to invest in more efficient technologies. It's not that the farmer is lazy, nor is he necessarily unaware of the technologies that would improve his productivity; the problem is that he's stuck, as Luciano Pellicani explained, in a 'caged' economy in which his opportunities are severely limited. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn21\">[21] And thus the farmer and his neighbors remain much poorer when compared against farmers in developed countries that have the laws, infrastructure, technology, education, experience, and political will to encourage economic progress with innovation and the smart allocation of its resources. Society is built on the power of incremental innovation, compounded over time.</url></p><p>Government intervention</p><p>Comparative advantage makes sense of the economic relationships between individuals or collections of individuals. If I produce a gizmo better than you, and you produce a widget better than me, the mutually beneficial and logical response would be for you and me to trade the fruits of our comparative strengths. But when there's an artificial barrier-a border-between you and me, the comparative advantages that arise out of our desire to trade our gizmos and widgets are diluted, if not cancelled outright, by the effects of unnatural trade barriers created by politicians and civil servants who proclaim where and with whom we can spend our money, and by the obstructive and bullying demands of special interest groups like labor unions and industry advocacy groups. This isn't to say that governmental influence ought to be banished from matters related to global trade, or that special interest group ought to be outlawed. Government certainly plays an essential regulatory role in creating uniform and consistently applied rules and norms in areas such as transaction law, property rights, anti-corruption laws, intellectual property protections (i.e., trademark, copyright, and patent law), fair labor standards, financial and monetary institutions, education, judicial systems, and public health and safety. Inherent to a productive economy is the expectation of consistent and nondiscriminatory rules that everyone understands and relies upon. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn22\">[22] Whether they take the form of contracts, formal regulations, informal standards (like Incoterms), or the unwritten 'Law Merchant' rules of trade etiquette and commercial transaction governance that evolved over the centuries in parallel with, but separate from, legislated national laws, these rules are the foundation upon which trade can be built because rules eliminate or mitigate risk and uncertainty.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn23\">[23] The Supreme Court told us long ago that 'uncertainty and ambiguity are the bane of commerce.'</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn24\">[24] A century earlier Adam Smith, in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, warned that:</url></p><p>Commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice; in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property; in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law; and in which the authority of the state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the payment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state, in which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government.</p><p>Douglass North, economic historian and co-recipient in 1993 of the Nobel Prize in Economics, wrote about the influence of organizations and institutions on a country's economy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn25\">[25] He argued that a productive economy will organically arise from a supportive institutional infrastructure; a country perceived as a high risk in any of its political, social, legal or economic institutions-what North called the 'institutional matrix'-has more difficulty attracting investors and trading partners than does a stable low-risk country. Thus, as absolutely necessary as certain laws and regulations and institutions are to the growth of a nation's global trading activities, too much regulation (or more precisely, too much of the wrong regulations) can poison growth. Just as a referee should not dictate the outcome of a sporting event, government shouldn't unnecessarily stand in the way of legitimate trade between two willing parties who by the circumstances of their lives happen to be on different sides of a political border.</url></p><p>Geography and Politics</p><p>The market forces of capitalism are illogically constrained by political geography. Borders are an inherent characteristic of global trade (and are the reason we trade compliance practitioners have a career), but pure capitalism doesn't give a hoot about political borders. The intrinsic rules of competition are border-blind. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn26\">[26] Market forces are at work regardless of whether the competition or the customer is across the street or on the other side of the world. In other words, political geography is a poor-destructive!-basis for the justification of trade restraints.</url></p><p>Let's say ABC Gizmo Company, a small manufacturer in Calais, Maine, competes in the U.S. market with several small foreign gizmo makers and one very large gizmo manufacturer in San Diego, California. What advantage does ABC Gizmo get from politically driven trade restraints on imports of the foreign-made gizmotchotchkes when the greatest threat to ABC is its domestic competition? Put another way, why should it matter to ABC where its competition is in terms of political or physical geography? Whether they're in competition with a company in California or Kazakhstan-or a mile away across the border in St. Stephen, New Brunswick-what's the difference? In the event that ABC Gizmos must layoff workers, will its unemployed workers in Maine find patriotic comfort in the fact that they lost their jobs because of a stronger competitor in California? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn27\">[27] And why does the Goliath in California need regulatory protection from the foreign Davids?</url></p><p>To drive this point home even more emphatically, let's imagine a United States in which each state is allowed to create its own trade barriers against the other states. A trucker picks up a load of goods from a factory in Mobile, Alabama, and heads west on I-10. He has to pay a tariff and satisfy various bureaucratic requirements when he crosses into Mississippi, and then again a few miles down the highway when he enters Louisiana, and then still again in Texas, and New Mexico, before he reaches his destination in Albuquerque. Would such a system benefit anyone? Every manufacturer in every state would find its marketplace severely curtailed, with limited prospects for growth. The supposedly protective measures mandated by each state would do nothing but isolate the state from its neighbors, forcing each caged state to allocate its limited resources towards the internal production of goods that otherwise could be obtained far more efficiently through external trade. All the goods and services we enjoy in our modern standard of living would evaporate if each state had to produce everything consumed within its borders. Each state would necessarily have its own washing machine factory, its own automobile factory, and its own oil refinery, but none of these factories could achieve anywhere near the productivity or quality of a national or global manufacturer. Innovation would be stunted. Prices would soar. Ricardo's lessons of comparative advantage would be ignored, and the efficiencies that arise from specialization (Smith's division of labor) would never be realized. Workers in each state's jack-of-all-trades-but-master-of-none economy would earn lower wages and consumers would pay higher prices for inferior goods. Living standards would plummet; poverty would increase. Hey, wait a minute!-isn't this the same unsuccessful model we tried two hundred and forty-odd years ago under the Articles of Confederation, our first attempt at a federal constitution? Isn't this exactly what happens in global trade when countries erect artificial tariff barriers based on political expediency rather than economic foresight? If it makes no sense to erect trade barriers between towns or counties or states, why does it make sense at the national level? What are we trying to protect?</p><p>As individuals and as a society, we tend to frame our opinions about economic and social policies based on our personal political orientation, which is the portal through which most of us view our society and government. But the opinions of most Americans are not nearly as informed or well-formed as they could be (and I include myself in this group). Even though the economy is apolitical at its core, it is manipulated by economic policies-often half-baked-driven by our obfuscating and partisan ideologues in Washington. Issues are typically addressed superficially, incoherently, emotionally, and dishonestly, and are often simplistically portrayed using a good-versus-evil dichotomy-'taxes are bad!' or 'taxes are good!'-rather than with any attempt to reach a nuanced, rational, and fact-based middle ground, the result being that many people believe that their strongly held opinions are their own, when in fact they haven't given any thought to understanding what they really believe and, more important, why they believe it. They've simply adopted an opinion that fits their political affiliation, or that has become 'fact' because it's been commonly accepted over time. But unlike dog crap, insight doesn't just happen. And so with our politicians, whether on the right or the left, constantly playing to the nearest microphone, pontificating on economic policy as if they knew what the heck they were talking about, we blithely accept as dictum that our economic borders necessarily must mimic our political borders. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn28\">[28]</url></p><p>Too few of us engage in the introspection it takes to understand that the privilege of governing a democracy (or a constitutional republic like the United States) does not confer upon the government the right to unreasonably constrain the economic opportunities of citizens to within that sphere of governance.

Equal development of both is necessary to the healthful existence of nations. Why commerce is the Cinderella of our government may be a conundrum to some. The reason is, however, a very plain one. We all know that the 'fostering of our home industries' uses up all the energies of our statesmen, so that no time is left to inquire into the real causes of the decline of our commerce.</p><p>These sentences from our distant past lead us neatly into our discussion of protectionism. Protectionism is governmental intervention intended to protect domestic economic interests. Protectionist policies can be implemented in a number of ways, some obvious (direct) and some subtle (indirect); essentially, though, it is the practice of assessing import tariffs or employing other restrictive trade measures, traditional measures like quotas, or antidumping and countervailing duties, or newer restrictions such as those based on labor or environmental concerns (or national emergencies under IEEPA), or by providing economic incentives to protect domestic industries-ostensibly the 'infant industry' argument-from foreign competition, whether 'fair' or 'unfair'. Milton and Rose Friedman disputed in Free to Choose the supposition that young industries must be given tariff protection, calling it a smokescreen because 'the so-called infants never grow up.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn32\">[32] Most protection, they argued, is for the benefit of mature, politically connected industries-precisely the entities least in need of protection.

It is disproved by American experience[.] The divisions between nations are not natural, and the common people seldom of their own motion cherish national animosities. They are promoted by professional politicians, the eternal enemies of human peace and security. It is always to the interest of such politicians to arouse fears. They make their living doing so, and then promising to get rid of the bugaboo by quack devices. One of the worst of these quack devices is the customs barrier. It may have some use in the early days of a rapidly developing nation, but as between nations that have pretty well reached their growth, it is an intolerable evil. What is universally good should be obtainable everywhere, and at substantially the same price.</p><p>The Friedmans' and Mencken's cynicism is well founded. But let's for a moment indulge in fantasy and assume that protection is implemented altruistically, without any trace of bias or self-interest. If a gizmo industry takes root in the United States that is superior, in terms of quality and market share, to all foreign gizmo manufacturers, then the U.S. may assess a relatively low 'Column 1' duty rate (perhaps even 0%) against imports of foreign-made gizmos because of the minimal threat to the U.S. industry. But, if the reverse were true-if the domestic gizmo industry is weak relative to the foreign competitors, whether as a consequence of youth, lesser competency, a technology gap or some other defect-then a relatively higher duty rate (or perhaps a quota) may be imposed to offer a protective buffer to the domestic industry. Protection can also take the form of direct or indirect government subsidies granted to a domestic industry at the federal or local level, such as reductions in certain taxes or in the cost of essential services like energy or water. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn37\">[37] But there is great disparity between how protectionism ought to be administered (to the extent one thinks it's necessary) and how it really is, and in many cases protectionist measures are rescinded with less enthusiasm than they when they were implemented.</url></p><p>For much of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the U.S. operated under a series of broadly protective tariff laws primarily driven by myopic political influences. In contrast, the GATT-based trade policies practiced today by America and its industrialized trading partners, which are largely the legacy of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn38\">[38] implemented under FDR's first administration, were created much more in the spirit of free trade than protectionism. So does this policy shift mean that free trade is unequivocally preferable to protectionism? The answer is yes, but a one-word answer doesn't begin to tell the whole story. It's not a binary choice between wide-open borders and an impenetrable tariff wall. Even the most ardent free traders will agree that some forms of limited trade barriers are necessary, as when interests not directly driven by market forces like public safety or national security are legitimately at risk, just as reasonable protectionists will stop short of advocating isolationism.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn39\">[39] Nor is the choice a zero-sum equation in which more for 'them' necessarily means less for 'us.' Nor is it a referendum on our national sovereignty, as some would argue. American trade policy, always a muddy puddle of competing interests, has generally fallen somewhere in the middle depending on the prevailing political, social and economic imperatives and attitudes of the day. But as each year passes-and as our economy became more global in recent decades, not from a simple buying-selling perspective but from a business integration point of view-the puddle grows muddier.</url></p><p>***</p><p>Ida Tarbell was an investigative journalist-a muckraker-at the turn of the last century, a time when hard investigative journalism aimed at uncovering corruption and injustice was primarily a male profession. Although perhaps best known for her serialized magazine expos of the Standard Oil Company's antitrust woes, The History of the Standard Oil Company, Tarbell also covered American tariff-making policy with dogged passion. In what might be the most entertaining book ever written on U.S. tariff policy (for those of us who are entertained by such things), Tarbell paints an unflattering picture in The Tariff in Our Times of how tariffs were negotiated from the time of the Civil War to the first decade of the twentieth century: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn40\">[40]</url></p><p>Difficult as it would be for one to realize it who took up for the first time the present tariffs of the United States, they rest on a formula which as it always has been understood by the majority of the people of the country is not especially intricate or confusing. Put yourself back a hundred years or so, when the country was busy with agriculture and commerce and mining. We had an enormous advantage in these pursuits. We were at a disadvantage in manufacturing. To be sure, from the start we did a little. In the nature of things we would gradually do more, and what we did would be on a solid basis. But, obviously, only the born iron-master, potter, weaver, was going to practice his trade in the new country with the foreigner importing goods cheaper than he as a rule could make them. And so we decided to encourage manufacturing by taxing ourselves.</p><p>That last sentence summarizes in ten words the inherent absurdity of protectionism, which is that the tariffs assessed against imports into the U.S. are paid almost exclusively by Americans. America punishing Americans. (And it's not just a punishment isolated to the obvious effect of increased duties on each import transaction, but also a punishment that artificially reduces choices resulting in higher prices across the board, even for domestic alternatives.) Tarbell didn't hide her antipathy toward protectionism. At times you could almost imagine the smoke coming from her ears as she pounded out the words on her typewriter. But her disdain wasn't merely based on empirical economic evidence; she believed that protectionist tariffs were highly immoral, and in fact she devoted the last chapter of the book to a moralistic attack on the tariff-making process: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn41\">[41]</url></p><p>Let us admit that reasonable people must not expect in a popular government to arrive at results save by a series of compromises. As long as men disagree as to what is desirable to accomplish, as well as on the methods which are to be employed in getting what they all agree to be desirable, each successive step comes by one side agreeing to take less than it believes should be given, and the other yielding more than it believes wise. No reasonable person can expect the protective system to be handled without compromises, backsets, and errors of judgment, but he can expect it to be handled as a principle and not as a commodity. The shock and disgust come in the discovery that our tariffs are not good and bad applications of the principles of protection, but that they are good or bad bargains. Dip into the story of the tariff at any point since the Civil War and you will find wholesale proofs of this bargaining in duties; rates fixed with no more relation to the doctrine of protection than they have to the law of precession of the equinoxes. The actual work of carrying out these bargains is of a nature that would revolt any legislator whose sensitiveness to the moral quality of his acts has not been blunted-who had not entirely eliminated ethical considerations from the business of fixing duties. And this is what the high protectionist lawgiver has come to-a complete repudiation of the idea that right and wrong are involved in tariff bills. There is no man more dangerous, in a position of power, than he who refuses to accept as a working truth the idea that all a man does should make for rightness and soundness, that even the fixing of a tariff rate must be moral. But this is the man the doctrine of protection, as we know it, produces, and therein lies the final case against it,-men are worse, not better, for its practice.</p><p>Tarbell's writings show us that passionate rhetoric (on both sides of the free trade debate) isn't a contemporary phenomenon that took root only in the forty years since the U.S.-Israel FTA was implemented. Indeed, tariff policy before 1913 was a far more contentious public policy issue than today because tariffs were far and away the primary source of federal revenue, and tariff rates were generally much higher despite the fact that many items were afforded duty-free status. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn42\">[42] The extreme disparity between tariff rates fostered passionate debate. A number of nineteenth-century grass-roots special interest groups, some local and some larger, like the International Free Trade Alliance, the American Free Trade League, and the previously mentioned New York Free-Trade Club, sang the virtues of free trade. There were groups that straddled the fence, like the Chicago-based American Reciprocal Tariff League, which generally supported protectionism but advocated for tariff concessions with countries willing to reciprocate. And the staunch protectionists had their own organizations, like the Young Men's Republican Tariff Club in Pittsburgh and the influential American Protective Tariff League.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn43\">[43] The propaganda machines on both sides were relentless and often shameless, employing talented shills who cleverly twisted facts to support their group's positions (not unlike today). In one of the APTL's propaganda pieces published in 1888, the welfare of the working-class family was melodramatically depicted by contrasting life in America under highly protective tariffs against the 'indescribably wretched' life of workers in Europe under less-protective policies:</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn44\">[44]</url></p><p>Both men and women, and their children, in Europe, are literally slaves of toil and hunger, working hopelessly and aimlessly, looking forward to the grave as their first and only resting-place. The family bonds and relations barely exist, and that motive which in this land inspires the hours of toil-the hope of advancement, if not for parents, at least for the children-has little if any force. Here, then, do we find the pre-eminent advantage of our American protective policy. It protects the workingman and his family. It saves them from degradation and distress. It makes the family relation, in all its attractive qualities, possible. It elevates the wives and children of the workingman. It relieves them, or most of them, from the need of working for their daily bread. It makes home-life possible. It affords to children leisure for early education, and thus opens up to them endless opportunities. The rich and the middle class get some of the benefits of Protection. As compared with the poor and the working people, they get but little, and they would be nearly as well off under free trade, while the condition of the poor would become indescribably wretched. Our American workingmen who have never contrasted their condition with that of their competitors under low wages and insufficient work abroad, cannot, and do not, realize the perils of free trade. Let them read about their fellow-workmen on the other side of the water, or talk with one who has been forced to leave his native land by starvation wages and the hopeless destitution of his family, and they will comprehend the danger which now threatens them. Workingmen have, then the greatest interest in the pending discussion [the debate over the legislation that became the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890] between Protection and Free Trade. Let them watch it, and see to it that no party and no combination of men or circumstances are permitted to overthrow or lower the barrier of Protection, which is the safeguard of their happiness for the present and of their hopes for the future.</p><p>Farmers and manufacturers have always been at odds over tariff policy. More than a century before social media made it easy to share an opinion with anyone willing to listen, individual citizens would sometimes print pamphlets in order to get their views heard. Albert Thayer, an opinionated farmer from Kansas, published in 1888 a 16-page pamphlet that included this: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn45\">[45]</url></p><p>Tariff is a tax that takes hold of everything from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet; it taxes your hat, your coat, your vest, your breeches, your boots, your shoes, the tools you use, the food you eat, and to say that taxing a man from the top of his head to the sole of his boot is a benefit to him, is nothing else than absurdity.</p><p>Protection against what?

No women!] whose aim is to build up home industries and the prosperity of this country rather than the prosperity of rival foreign manufacturers, foreign countries and foreign governments, and it was an encouraging indication that the issue of protection, which when properly presented to the people of this country has always been upheld, will again be one of the dominant issues of next year's campaign and will be pressed home to the electorate by convincing arguments.

The editorial-published only months after the end of the First World War-used extreme emotional rhetoric to argue that America's national security was at risk because the legislation would aid Germany's rebuilding of its chemical industries: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn47\">[47]</url></p><p>Opposition of [Senator Moses' special interest supporters] to a measure is rather a peculiar explanation for a member of the United States Senate to give for his efforts to defeat a measure so important in the national defense.

So much is said about tariff barriers that one might overlook the fact that the absence of tariff can be a definite barrier to our domestic producers. How little attention has been given to the position of our domestic producers in all this wave of interest in foreign trade!

Alternative policies might have shaped our history differently. Less emphasis on protection might have taken us down a more prosperous road-or it might not have. One may be willing, grudgingly, to give protectionism the benefit of the doubt in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; national economies were much more insular before 1900, which made it much easier, both morally and logically, to justify tariff walls. And because every action has repercussions, there's no denying that the state of our twenty-first-century economy must be attributed to some degree to the butterfly effect of the historical protection of our infant industries.</p><p>But the body of empirical evidence we now have from duty reduction programs (like the thirty-plus years of NAFTA|USMCA data presented at the beginning of this article) offers incontrovertible vindication of free trade policies. Extreme protectionism is simply not a viable option-practically or politically-in the twenty-first century. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn57\">[57] But those who support free trade can't fall victim to hubris and flatly dismiss the concerns of those who advocate for moderate, targeted, short-term, politically neutral (if such an animal exists), and sensible protectionism intended to benefit the economy as a whole rather than just a handful of politically connected industries. As with most things in life, the best results usually come from the middle rather than the extremes.</url></p><p>Fallacies have been perpetuated on either side of the argument. One misunderstanding adopted by free trade advocates is that protectionism necessarily reduces employment; protection may, in fact, artificially redistribute jobs from productive enterprises-enterprises that live or die on the merits of their own innovation and business acumen-to less-productive enterprises that survive only with the beneficent assistance of governmental handouts, whether in the form of tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or any other public welfare. Artificial redistribution of labor (and all other resources) as a result of protection is wasteful and inefficient-and fails to honor the time-tested insights of Smith and Ricardo (and the more recent proponents of free markets like Joseph Schumpeter, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman). And yet protectionism endures, generally gaining more traction during times of lackluster economic growth; it is, therefore, important to encourage healthy and fact-based debate on both sides regardless of where the evidence predominantly seems to point. In a 2015 report on the protectionist measures adopted by countries that trade with the European Union, the European Commission found that from 2008-2015 there were 1,059 new protectionist measures implemented, while only 180 measures were eliminated. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn58\">[58] In addition to increased general duty rates on certain products, these measures included antidumping and antisubsidy (countervailing) determinations, import-based fees, increased subsidies and other 'export support measures' for domestic manufacturers, import minimum pricing requirements, import licensing regulations, local content requirements (including tighter origin thresholds for government procurement activities), and 'behind-the-border' barriers like prohibitive tax policies or technical regulations (like recycling fees) tagged to certain products or activities. The report noted as a disturbing trend that the greatest number of restrictive trade measures were adopted by developing countries like the BRICs, Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa and Ukraine. Just as children learn bad habits from their parents, these developing countries have learned bad trade habits from the U.S., Canada, the EU, and the other developed countries.</url></p><p>What is a 'foreign' company, anyway?</p><p>The paradigm for success in a global economy is clearly changing. A half century ago, back in the days of the Fab Four and the Space Race, or even as recently as the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, it was much easier to build effective trade barriers because the targets were clear and the effects could be reasonably anticipated and more easily segregated, but now the bright line that once stood between American economic interests and the interests of the rest of the world is less bright. But as a practical matter today, the policies of a sovereign nation like the United States are inherently at odds with globalization. Our domestic and foreign policy mindsets have always been-and, of course, will continue to be-to protect and to further American interests. There can be no question that this is a proper and necessary role of our government. But our policies must be implemented in a way that recognizes American economic interests are irrevocably married to the economic interests of all other countries, both friends and foes.</p><p>Today it's nearly impossible to erect a trade barrier that doesn't to some degree have a negative boomerang effect on workers and consumers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn59\">[59] Trade barriers have become increasingly anachronistic, created by nations with clear political and physical borders for a world in which businesses, even small businesses, now operate essentially as transnational borderless entities. Another intrinsic problem with trade barriers is that they're typically implemented to address a precise moment in the transactional timeline-that is, the day when goods are granted entry into a country's commerce. They're not constructed with any foresight to their impact on downstream activities or with any consideration of contemporary supply chain practices. This is especially problematic for imports of intermediary goods that domestic manufacturers will use to produce further-advanced or finished goods. Take U.S. antidumping laws. For all the effort the goes into investigations of alleged dumping, antidumping measures don't look beyond the first sale of goods into the U.S., the result being that we hit, say, Chinese steel with antidumping duties without concern for the extra costs a downstream U.S. manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer and ultimate consumer will be forced to bear. Once the steel enters the U.S. and is used to produce new goods, its origin becomes essentially invisible, as do the dumping duties-yet these duties remain forever baked into the cost of all ensuing activities using the steel, with the extra cost passed from one party to the next until the finished goods get to the ultimate consumer, who has no one else to pass the cost to. Antidumping remedies are frustratingly myopic, intended to protect so-called 'injured' industries while ignoring any impact of dumping duties on the broader domestic economy.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn60\">[60] The interests of the broader economy-in a word, consumers, whether the family next door or a company that buys intermediate inputs to support its business-would be better served by letting market forces decide an injured company's fate. When a doctor treats a patient's disease, he carefully considers how the cure will affect the patient-but far too frequently our trade policies are conceived only to satisfy superficial political interests, without any concern for the underlying damages inflicted on the economy.</url></p><p>A robust economy is dependent to a large extent upon the ability of a country (that is, its industries and entrepreneurs) to stay ahead of the competition in technology and scientific innovation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn61\">[61] In this century an increasing percentage of technology is developed offshore by both foreign-owned companies and by U.S. When the United States was unquestionably the leader in many fields of technological innovation, it was relatively easy to justify the building of tariff and export control walls.

But the world of 2025 is not the same as the world of 1918 or 1945 or even 1991.

Fifty years ago, an American small business typically focused its purchasing and sales efforts within its local, regional, or perhaps national marketplaces. But today the success of that same small business may be equally, if not more, reliant on building a global footprint that will allow it to maximize its offshore opportunities (remember: choices and access). <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn67\">[67] It can no longer be disputed that free trade forces an enterprise to operate at the top of its game, as efficiently and effectively as possible. It stimulates innovation and creates competition, and it wards off the laziness, inefficiency and complacency that can creep into our domestic industries if they're insulated from the energy generated by global competition. But innovation and competition is obstructed when a country feeds its industries a diet of trade restrictions-although a moderate level of success might still be achieved, that success is nowhere near the heights that could be attained in an unfettered economy. Tariff barriers (and outdated export controls) that prevent the relatively free two-way flow of commerce, investment and technology discourage, if not smother, economic growth.</url></p><p>The U.S. was at the forefront of technological innovation during the twentieth century, but we can't maintain our preeminent influence and leadership in this century from behind a wall of trade restrictions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn68\">[68] Were the U.S. to adopt a fear-driven, build-a-moat-around-the-castle mindset (as with America's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership) our economy will surely suffer while we watched the rest of the world reap the benefits of global opportunities. Policies that support isolationism and unwise protectionism are, today more than ever, antithetical to innovation and economic growth for any enterprise, and therefore ought to have no place in an increasingly intertwined global economy. Protectionism can take hold through direct action, like legislation or executive fiat (like the avalanche of executive orders issued since January 20), or by taking advantage of loopholes in existing laws or international obligations, or through the lost opportunities of inaction, like America's failure of leadership at the Doha trade talks. But once implemented, trade restrictions invite retaliation and strangle investment opportunities-and they become so entrenched that the effort required to eliminate them typically is far greater than the effort to resist them in the first place.</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftn69\">[69]</url></p><p>Government plays a critical, but all too often counter-productive, role in the promotion of economic growth. No matter how many laws a government implements to control or restrict global trade, its efforts will always cause disruption, will always lead to unintended consequences, or (at best) simply will be ineffective because a government-any government-cannot change the fundamental laws of capitalism, any more than it can change the laws of physics. Laws and regulations that unreasonably restrict trade will ultimately not succeed to an extent that serves the general good-but because the economy is by its very nature shrouded in a fog of complexity that prevents an immediately identifiable cause-and-effect event, we never realize that these supposedly well-intended trade restrictions really do far more harm than good. It is a sad but simple truth: a government addicted to trade restraints cannot imagine-cannot tolerate-a world without them. The political pressures to slide backward into protectionism, especially in difficult economic times, can be persuasive but must be resisted.

A frequently cited example is a lawyer who's a better typist than her secretary, but her time is better spent on providing legal advice to clients than typing briefs. Hiring a specialist could even mean something as simple as paying your kid an allowance to take out the garbage so that you can spend those five minutes on more productive (or more enjoyable) activities. You may be the best garbage-taker-outer in your family, but it's a better economic decision to subcontract the job to your ten-year-old.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftnref21\">[21] In The Genesis of Capitalism and the Origins of Modernity (translated by James G.

While I find much to nitpick in Tarbell's opinions-notably her demonization of John D. Rockefeller's character, in The History of the Standard Oil Company and then in John D. Rockefeller: A Character Study, both published in McClure's Magazine between 1902 and 1905-her ability to engage a reader cannot be questioned. In A Character Study (Vol. XXV, No. 4, August 1905, 397), for example, she wrote: 'He is not a great man, not a human man. He is a machine-a money machine-stripped by his overwhelming passion of greed of every quality which makes a man worthy of citizenship. He has not made good. He cannot make good. It is not in him.

It's difficult for American automakers, for example, to sell cars and trucks into some markets because of differing safety and environmental regulations. Food and beverage makers, as well as drug and medicine manufacturers, also must deal with a plethora of inconsistent product safety rules that add enormous costs to transnational trade-costs that inevitably find their way into consumers' wallets.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftnref60\">[60] Even if a U.S. manufacturer buys its steel from a U.S. source rather than from China, the ripple effect of the dumping duties on the Chinese steel will cause higher prices and will reduce choices across the entire steel industry.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftnref61\">[61] Although his insights were published a half-century ago, Raymond Vernon wrote that in free-market developed countries 'the search for knowledge is an inseparable part of the [entrepreneurial] decision-making process and that relative ease of access to knowledge can profoundly affect the outcome' of production decisions.

Billions of dollars of profits earned in foreign markets by U.S. companies is parked offshore, unable to be reinvested into the American economy. These companies have little incentive to bring these profits home because doing so would trigger a massive tax bill from the IRS. As well, the practice of inversion (moving a U.S. company's headquarters offshore to avoid onerous corporate taxes) has recently been in the public eye. Walgreens announced in 2014 that it planned to relocate its headquarters to Switzerland but then changed its mind, forgoing to its shareholders dismay the several billion dollars in tax savings the move would have generated. Shortly afterwards, Burger King announced it was buying Tim Hortons, the Canadian coffeeshop chain, and would be moving its headquarters to Canada. A company that chooses inversion is painted by the media as dastardly and un-American, but a company's fiduciary obligation to its shareholders (or ownership, if privately held) must take priority. If you or I own stock in Burger King (whether directly or in a mutual fund), and Burger King can earn greater profits through the legal practice of inversion, why is it un-American?</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=f11a17ea-f5e1-43f1-87e4-264b0c6fbbdb#_ftnref69\">[69] One long-entrenched barrier to trade is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (more commonly known as the Jones Act), Pub.

In Nantahala and Pisgah National Forests, Helene caused moderate to catastrophic damage to some 187,000 acres, vastly increasing the threat of wildfire, the North Carolina Forest Service said in a bulletin.</p><p>To help people clear some of the debris left by the unusually destructive storm, the service in October waived the requirement for burn permits in 21 counties. But it warned residents to use caution when burning debris.</p><p>Adding to the potential fuel for fire are the hundreds of new homes and commercial buildings that have sprung up in the region in the last decade, especially around the popular city of Asheville. As of 2020, more than half of North Carolina residents lived in wildland-urban interface areas shown to be a threat for increased wildfires, the NC Forest Service said.</p><p>\"The topography also makes it difficult to reach and repair some places,\" Stewart added.</p><p>Few homeowners in the region have considered the risk of fire and many may not be fully insured. \"A lot of people don't see secondary perils,\" Stewart said.</p><p>And although November was slightly wetter than in 2023, December brought less precipitation than it did the year before, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Much of this year so far, especially last week, has been unusually dry in much of the state, raising the fire threat level, authorities said.</p><p>Experts are now so concerned that they have planned a meeting next week, Jan. 28, to discuss the risk and ways to reduce it. North Carolina State University's <url normalizedValue=\"https://ncics.org/\">Institute for Climate Studies</url> in Asheville is hosting the gathering.</p><p>Compounding the potential risk from fire is a continuing shortage of firefighters in parts of the state, according to news reports. North Carolina saw a decline of almost 5,000 volunteer firefighters, from 2020 to 2023. That's when the North Carolina Association of Fire Chiefs put out an urgent call for more volunteers to sign up. But the numbers have changed little since then, the N&amp;O has noted.</p><p>Another issue: Some in the state have blamed the homebuilders' lobby for pushing through legislation last year that limits local governments' abilities to heighten fire prevention and other regulations beyond what state building codes already require, news sites have reported. Firefighter organizations raised red flags last fall after the governor's veto of the legislation was overridden.</p><p>Wildfires in parts of the state could exacerbate insurance costs for some property owners in the region, costs that have risen steadily for homes, businesses and mobile homes in recent years. In the most recent increase, North Carolina's insurance commissioner, Mike Causey, announced last week that he had negotiated a 15% <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2025/01/21/808852.htm\"> average rate increase</url> for homeowner insurance. That came after the North Carolina Rate Bureau, basing its recommendation on data from property insurers, had asked for a 42% average increase.</p><p>Counties that endured historic flooding from Helene will see smaller increases than other parts of the state.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Top photo: North Carolina's Chimney Rock area forest fire in 2016, a year that saw a number of fires in the area.

The consumer price index hit a multi-decade high in mid-2022, and partially as a result, real, inflation-adjusted incomes fell by nearly 9% over the two years begining in the second quarter of 2020. During that period, the imbalance between wages and the cost of living gave way to reduced purchasing power and lower living standards for millions of American households.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">24/7 Wall St. Key Points:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last year of available data, wages for the typical American worker went up by about 3%, more than enough to offset the effects of inflation.</p><p>Still, many of the economic forces benefitting the labor force as a whole are fueling meaningful pay cuts in dozens of occupations, and millions of American workers are being impacted.</p><p>Also: <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/discover-the-next-nvidia?tpid=/1494910\">Discover the next Nvidia</url></p><p>Even though real, inflation-adjusted incomes have yet to return to their all-time high, reported in 2020, wage growth has generally outpaced inflation in the last few years. As of May 2024, the typical American worker earned $49,500, a year-over-year increase of about 3%. Accounting for inflation, real wages climbed about 1% over roughly the same period.</p><p>Still, these broad economic trends do not tell the whole story, as millions of Americans are currently employed in occupations that are reporting meaningful wage declines. And these pay cuts are only exacerbated by inflation rates that remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.</p><p>Using data from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 24/7 Wall St. identified the jobs where wages are falling the fastest. We reviewed median annual wage data for hundreds of detail-level occupations for both May 2023 and May 2024, and identified those that reported the largest decreases over that period. All supplemental data is also from the BLS.</url></p><p>Among the more than 800 occupations with available data, 46 reported wage declines of at least 2% in the last year. In a handful of these jobs, wages have gone down by over 10%. Depending on the occupation, these pay cuts have resulted in a nominal loss of anywhere from about $1,200 to $37,600 per year for the typical worker. Notably, however, the vast majority of occupations on this list still pay more than most jobs in the U.S. labor market. (Here is a look at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/jobs/2025/03/07/make-more-money-with-these-remote-jobs-than-you-could-in-your-office/\">the remote jobs that pay more than office jobs.)</url></p><p>The occupations on this list employ some 3.4 million Americans and span a range of industries, including transportation, social sciences, and resource extraction. The largest share of occupations on this list are in education or arts, entertainment, and media.</p><p>Despite falling wages, most jobs on this list are reporting rapid employment growth. Over the last year, total employment grew by more than 2% in 27 of the occupations on this list. For context, overall employment across all occupations increased by 1.5% over the same period. Meanwhile, only 14 of these jobs employ fewer workers now than they did a year ago.

More recently, however, most workers have seen increased buying power and an improved standard of living, as inflation has cooled and incomes have continued to rise. Still, there are dozens of occupations in which median wages have fallen in the last year - and millions of Americans have been impacted.</p><p>46.

In Nantahala and Pisgah National Forests, Helene caused moderate to catastrophic damage to some 187,000 acres, vastly increasing the threat of wildfire, the North Carolina Forest Service said in a bulletin.</p><p>To help people clear some of the debris left by the unusually destructive storm, the service in October waived the requirement for burn permits in 21 counties. But it warned residents to use caution when burning debris.</p><p>Adding to the potential fuel for fire are the hundreds of new homes and commercial buildings that have sprung up in the region in the last decade, especially around the popular city of Asheville. As of 2020, more than half of North Carolina residents lived in wildland-urban interface areas shown to be a threat for increased wildfires, the NC Forest Service said.</p><p>\"The topography also makes it difficult to reach and repair some places,\" Stewart added.</p><p>Few homeowners in the region have considered the risk of fire and many may not be fully insured. \"A lot of people don't see secondary perils,\" Stewart said.</p><p>And although November was slightly wetter than in 2023, December brought less precipitation than it did the year before, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Much of this year so far, especially last week, has been unusually dry in much of the state, raising the fire threat level, authorities said.</p><p>Experts are now so concerned that they have planned a meeting next week, Jan. 28, to discuss the risk and ways to reduce it. North Carolina State University's <url normalizedValue=\"https://ncics.org/\">Institute for Climate Studies</url> in Asheville is hosting the gathering.</p><p>Compounding the potential risk from fire is a continuing shortage of firefighters in parts of the state, according to news reports. North Carolina saw a decline of almost 5,000 volunteer firefighters, from 2020 to 2023. That's when the North Carolina Association of Fire Chiefs put out an urgent call for more volunteers to sign up. But the numbers have changed little since then, the N&amp;O has noted.</p><p>Another issue: Some in the state have blamed the homebuilders' lobby for pushing through legislation last year that limits local governments' abilities to heighten fire prevention and other regulations beyond what state building codes already require, news sites have reported. Firefighter organizations raised red flags last fall after the governor's veto of the legislation was overridden.</p><p>Wildfires in parts of the state could exacerbate insurance costs for some property owners in the region, costs that have risen steadily for homes, businesses and mobile homes in recent years. In the most recent increase, North Carolina's insurance commissioner, Mike Causey, announced last week that he had negotiated a 15% <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2025/01/21/808852.htm\"> average rate increase</url> for homeowner insurance. That came after the North Carolina Rate Bureau, basing its recommendation on data from property insurers, had asked for a 42% average increase.</p><p>Counties that endured historic flooding from Helene will see smaller increases than other parts of the state.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Top photo: North Carolina's Chimney Rock area forest fire in 2016, a year that saw a number of fires in the area.

New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection via AP<br/><br/>POMPTON LAKES, N.J. - A New York parks employee died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday.</p><p><br/><br/>The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue and the New York state forestry services.<br/><br/>\"Rip brother your shift is over job well done,\" the New York State forestry services post said.<br/><br/>New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake and identified the victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state Parks and Recreation aide employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department.<br/><br/>The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California.<br/><br/>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 3.9 square miles near the border in Passaic County's West Milford and Orange County, New York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease.<br/><br/>New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75% containment of a 175-acre fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered.<br/><br/>Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County.<br/><br/>Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of \"incendiary or tracer ammunition\" was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday.<br/><br/>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves burned more than 200 acres in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 3.4 square miles in the city 10 miles north of Boston.<br/><br/>\"This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years,\" the Lynn Fire Department said in a statement on social media as firefighters continued to battle the blaze, blaming its intensely on low humidity as well as winds and dry leaves on the ground.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It was one of many brush fires that cropped up across the region. In Foxborough, fire crews said that containing a wildfire at the F. Gilbert Hills State Forest would be a \"a multi-day event.\"<br/><br/>Wind gusts topped 40 mph on Saturday, and less-powerful gusts continued Sunday.<br/><br/>Firefighters and forest agencies warned against outdoor burning.<br/><br/>The drier-than-normal weather is expected to continue, and virtually all of New England is categorized as being in drought or being abnormally dry. Most of the region was expected to see some light rain Sunday night, but there are no large rainfall events in the forecast, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jerry Combs.<br/><br/>Firefighters in California were also battling a scattering of blazes over the weekend, including one north of Los Angeles that had burned more than 100 structures.<br/><br/>Evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings for residents in several areas of Ventura County, where the Mountain Fire held at around 32 square miles and was 26% contained, authorities said.<br/><br/>Copy the Story Link</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLCEN-httpswwwcentralmainecom20241110nyparksemployeediesfightingfiresairqualitywarningsissuedinnewyorknewjersey</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLCEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCY-HJV1-JCMC-W0W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490509</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Centralmaine.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64500\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 10, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom &amp;

According to news originating from Selangor, Malaysia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Global climate change and landform alteration are correlated with a high impact on rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), vegetation conditions, and soil moisture.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia: \"This study examines rainfall, temperature, vegetation condition, moisture, and drought index to identify the decadal change from 2002 to 2021 using Landsat and global Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index-base (SPEIbase) data in Google Earth Engine (GEE). In between 20 years, 50.54 mm of mean rainfall decreased in the study area while 6.31 \u00b0C of LST increased in the entire region. The most affected states are Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. Similarly, in northeast India, Assam, Tripura, and Meghalaya have huge effects on temperature variation. The green space (0.158), and moisture (-0.082) fluctuated mainly in Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Tripura states. The SPEI has increased (-0.232) in Bihar, Manipur, Tripura, Assam, and Meghalaya.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The analysis observed that decreased rainfall and high-temperature variation may impact crop production, moisture loss, cyclonic affected in West Bengal coastal areas, floods in the Brahmaputra River basin and Bihar, droughts, and urban heat island-related effects. Some policies like reduction of forest fire (northeast), flood (Assam), urban planning (West Bengal, Bihar, and Assam), industrial pollution, and jhum cultivation decrease can improve the climate change in those states, India.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Long-term climate change analysis in northeast and eastern India.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires ignited by lightning accounted for 68.28% of all forest fires in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) region of northeast China.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Key R&amp;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"Forecasting the incidence of lightning-triggered forest fires in the region is imperative for mitigating deforestation, preserving biodiversity, and safeguarding distinctive natural habitats and resources. Lightning monitoring data and vegetation moisture content have emerged as pivotal factors among the various influences on lightning-induced fires. This study employed innovative satellite remote sensing technology to swiftly acquire vegetation moisture content data across extensive forested regions. Firstly, the most suitable method to identify the lightning strikes that resulted in fires and two crucial lightning parameters correlated with fire occurrence are confirmed.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Secondly, a logistic regression method is proposed for predicting the likelihood of fires triggered by lightning strikes. Finally, the method underwent verification using five years of fire data from the GKM area, resulting in an AUC value of 0.849 and identifying the primary factors contributing to lightning-induced fires in the region.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Forest Fire Prediction Method for Lightning Stroke Based on Remote Sensing Data.

Cormier's election marks a significant milestone, as she becomes the first Maine State Forester to hold this prestigious position since Austin Wilkins 59 years ago. Cormier will serve a one-year term as NASF President, continuing her long-standing commitment to sustainable forestry and forest management.</p><p>\"I am honored to step into this role and carry forward the legacy of Austin Wilkins, who was such a pivotal figure in Maine forestry,\" said Cormier. \"This is a pivotal time for forest conservation, and I look forward to collaborating with state foresters from across the nation to elevate their voices and work with partners to find answers to challenges we all face.\"</p><p>\"Patty's contributions to forestry in Maine and nationally make her very well qualified to lead NASF over the coming year,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"We are truly fortunate to have a State Forester who clearly has earned and enjoys the respect of her NASAF colleagues and those who have the privilege of working with her in Maine as well.\"</p><p>Cormier has served as Maine State Forester since 2019 and has over 20 years of experience as a Forester with the Maine Forest Service. Before working with the Maine Forest Service, she worked as a Landowner Assistance Forester for Georgia Pacific Corporation. She also holds a Bachelor of Science in Forest Management from the University of Maine at Orono and has been a strong advocate for forest fire prevention and management, serving on multiple forestry committees, including the National Fire Committee and the Northeast-Midwest State Foresters Association Fire Committee and the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention committee.</p><p>The NASF is a non-profit organization representing forestry agency directors from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and eight U.S. territories. The association promotes the sustainable management of state and private forests, which comprise two-thirds of the nation's forested lands. Since its founding in 1920, NASF has worked to conserve and protect forest resources and advocate for sustainable forestry in rural and urban environments.</p><p>Cormier's election as President comes at a critical time, as state foresters face growing challenges related to climate change, wildfire management, and the protection of forest resources.</p><p>Supporting documents</p><p>Maine State Forester Patty Cormier (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=13065147&amp;an=1\">https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=13065147&amp;an=1</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/news.shtml?id=13065147\">https://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/news.shtml?id=13065147</url></p><p>Contact: Jim Britt, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov\">Jim.Britt@maine.gov</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8847321 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8847321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D2S-W601-DYG2-R3FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><timeReceived>9:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 28, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Helsinki, Finland, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity across Europe, which makes accurate wildfire risk estimation crucial for decision-makers and emergency responders.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Horizon 2020. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Finnish Meteorological Institute: \"Wildfire risk is usually estimated using meteorological-based fire weather indices such as the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI). By using weather forecasts, the FWI can be predicted for several days and even weeks ahead. Probabilistic ensemble forecasts require verification and calibration in order to provide reliable and accurate forecasts, which are crucial for informed decision-making and an effective emergency response. In this study, we investigate the potential of non-homogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR) for statistically calibrating ensemble forecasts of the FWI. The FWI is calculated using medium-range ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with lead times up to 15 d over Europe. The method is tested using a 30 d rolling training period and dividing the European region into three training areas (northern, central, and Mediterranean Europe).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The calibration improves FWI forecast particularly at shorter lead times up to 84 h and in regions with elevated FWI values, i.e. areas with a higher wildfire risk such as central and Mediterranean Europe. The study demonstrates that NGR can be used to improve probabilistic FWI forecasts especially in the time range most critical for firefighting resource management and thereby supporting effective wildfire response strategies.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Statistical calibration of probabilistic medium-range Fire Weather Index forecasts in Europe.

At noon, the fire had been just 40 acres, showing how quickly it spread upslope in the current drought conditions.</p><p>\"Fire activity is very active, moving up a ridge through dry fuels,\" according to a forest service press release.</p><p>As the fire spread up the steep terrain, the safety of hikers along the Appalachian Trail \u2014 which passes through the area \u2014 became a concern.</p><p>Haywood County Emergency Service began working to alert hikers of the fire danger, Haywood County Emergency Services Public Information Officer Allison Richmond said. The Appalachian Trail between I-40 and Max Patch has been closed, and hikers already in the area were instructed to leave immediately.</p><p>The N.C. Forest Service and U.S. Forest Service led the assault on the fire Thursday. Personnel and equipment on scene included air attack, air tankers, helicopters, a 20-person hand crew, and dozers. Aircraft dropped water and retardant to slow the fire progression.</p><p>Resources from the Southern Area Blue Team \u2014 which has been fighting the massive forest fire in Cherokee County \u2014 were being mobilized to the Black Bear Fire and would assume command once they arrived.</p><p>The accident occurred around 8 a.m., about 3.5 miles from the state line. When the fire first started along the interstate, smoke impacted visibility for motorists, North Carolina State Highway Patrol First Sgt. Brent Hipp said. Motorists are cautioned about smoke still lingering in the area.</p><p>State troopers have closed Cold Springs Creek Road and Brown Mountain Road near I-40 exit 7 to keep people away from the fire.</p><p>Editor's note: This is a developing story.

According to news reporting out of Lancaster, United Kingdom, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Anxiety related to disasters is a topic of emergent research significance. Literature has shown that the potential occurrence of disasters can trigger feelings of anxiety for individuals.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Lancaster University, \"While a scale for measuring general anxiety and anxiety symptoms exists, a scale that measures worried thoughts related to land and forest fire is not yet available in the disaster and land and forest fire literature. The aim of this research was to measure and develop a valid scale for worried thoughts related to land and forest fire. We mapped worried thoughts related to land and forest fire onto anxiety over land and forest fire. We used focus groups to generate items for anxiety over land and forest fire and validated the scale for anxiety over land and forest fire. We used an online sur-vey to collect the data in Indonesia and we targeted residents who live near the fire prone areas in Kalimantan and Sumatra islands of Indonesia as participants. Through a systematic scale devel-opment procedure: Exploratory Factor Analysis (n=430), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n=252), Confirmatory Factor Analysis for external validity (n=254), we developed a three -dimension scale for anxiety over land and forest fire i.e., habitat loss-related anxiety, economic and financial-related anxiety, and health-related anxiety. A further nomological network (n=370) established the validity and reliability of the scale.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our newly developed scale is found to be psychometrically sound as a valid instrument for the purpose of measuring anxiety over land and forest fire.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Developing and Validating a Scale for Anxiety Over Land and Forest Fire.

Dasgupta's voice is tender yet sturdy. Emotions are running high as he sings about the heartache of a failed relationship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I won't spend another year in denial, a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">nd you won't change your mind</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Still I can't help but love you like a forest fire, h</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">eaven knows I've tried</emphasis></p><p>Dasgupta lives just outside of Boston in Allston, Massachusetts. How he came to live there is a story that was born of trauma, but one that has led him to a happier\u00a0 existence.</p><p>In April 2019, Dasgupta was closing a vertical window in his Portland apartment when it fell out of its frame, hitting him in the head.</p><p>The moment changed his life forever when the injury shifted from a simple concussion into a full-blown health crisis.</p><p>Nearly six years later, Dasgupta, now 30, shared during a Zoom interview that despite everything he's been through, he's more at peace than ever before.</p><p>I first became aware of Dasgupta when his band SnugHouse (named for the pub he lived above) released its debut, self-titled EP in 2017.</p><p>It was love at first listen when I heard the harmony-rich <url normalizedValue=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6BdCNIaMdsijCsAnJI2XWP?si=5b06dd66c63242ab\">\"I Couldn't Be.\"</url> The song still knocks me sideways.</p><p>The \"Like Water\" EP followed in 2018 with the track <url normalizedValue=\"&lt;embed type='oembed'&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OI_HSfX4o&lt;/embed&gt;\">\"Firefly\"</url> followed by the bright and breezy single<url normalizedValue=\"&lt;embed type='oembed'&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17n3wLDyxg&lt;/embed&gt;\"> \"Irie.\"</url></p><p>That same year, SnugHouse played at the Old Port Festival and that fall played to a pretty packed house at One Longfellow Square. In 2019, SnugHouse performed as part of Coffee By Design's 25th anniversary celebration.</p><p>Sometime around then, Dasgupta and I met for coffee so he could ask for advice on promoting the band. I remember thinking that he seemed extremely focused and eager to bring more attention to SnugHouse.</p><p>But then the shows abruptly stopped, as did any new music from SnugHouse. I remember hearing that Dasgupta had been either injured or was ill.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Dasgputa reached out with the news about \"Heaven Knows.\"</p><p>He shared that initially when the window fell on him, he experienced classic symptoms of concussion that he assumed would clear up within a few weeks. But when they didn't, Dasgupta retreated to his parents' house in Massachusetts to recover, while the rest of SnugHouse tried to salvage its first tour. \"I think it kind of triggered some sort of kind of systemic thing, and I think it turned into a kind of PTSD with a lot of neurological problems,\" said Dasgupta.</p><p>He developed an acute sensitivity to screens and sounds, along with severe dizziness, rendering Dasgupta unable to play or even listen to music. For a year, Dasgupta even had to shower with earplugs because he couldn't tolerate the sound of water.</p><p>His doctors believed he was suffering from chronic Lyme disease, but tests were inconclusive. \"My takeaway from this is that it's a gray area of medicine. Long Covid is very similar, where people just have all the symptoms and no one really understands,\" he said.</p><p>These days, Dasgupta doesn't focus on a diagnosis. \"The conventional medical system doesn't seem to have answers for me right now and I know what I have to do. I have to try and find meaning and happiness in each day.\"</p><p>To that end, Dasgupta pays close attention to what he eats and how much sleep and exercise he gets. He also gave up consuming alcohol permanently.</p><p>\"I'm not gonna obsess over what went wrong, and in the end I think that the almost spiritual separation from looking for answers is what kind of helped to get me to where I am now, where I'm more at peace then I've ever been. \"</p><p>However, Dasgupta also had to reckon with the idea that he may never be able to play music, a huge part of his identity.</p><p>But during a particularly dark period in 2020 grappling with both health issues and heartache, the concept for \"Heaven Knows\" came to him. \"Simply put, it was about a relationship. Those are very poignant emotions for all of us as humans and it was about kind of surrendering to helplessness,\" said Dasgupta.</p><p>Last year, Dasgupta submitted an early version of the song to Boston public radio station <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/10/02/favorite-massachusetts-npr-tiny-desk-contest-nikhil-dasgupta-heaven-knows\">WBUR</url> as part of its Tiny Desk Concert contest. Although he didn't win, the panel at the station loved the song and it was a top five contender.</p><p>Dasgupta recorded a more formal version of \"Heaven Knows\" in his home studio and it can be streamed everywhere.</p><p>Dasgupta no longer has dreams of touring the country and releasing a steady flow of music, but he also knows that music is in his core. He has a goal of playing one headlining show in 2025. \"I am embarking on a journey to figure out what it looks like.\"</p><p>To keep up with his music and any future live appearance, follow Dasgupta on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/nyquildasgupta/\">Instagram</url> (@nyquildasgupta) and sign-up for his mailing list at <url normalizedValue=\"https://nikhildasgupta.com/\">nikhildasgupta.com</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLPRE-httpswwwpressheraldcom20250210musiciannikhildasguptareturnstomusicafterflukeinjuryandchronicillness</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLPRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F3F-5GC3-RTVK-53RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Press Herald  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pressherald.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64498\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 10, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland, United States &amp;

In this Perspective, I consider methane emission and uptake in trees, the underlying mechanisms and their response to environmental changes. Methane emitted from trees predominantly originates in soils, being transferred through the stem. The highest tree methane emissions occur in waterlogged soil conditions. As such, trees in wetland and riparian forests are a net source of methane, with topical wetland trees emitting up to ~44 Tg CH4 yr\u22121. By comparison, trees on free-draining upland soils are a net sink of methane on the order of 50 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, with microbially mediated methanotrophy along the soil\u2013tree continuum dominating the vertical attenuation of soil-derived methane fluxes. </p><p>Latitude (temperature) and nutrient status also influence net methane exchange. For example, tree methane emissions in the more nutrient-replete Amazon floodplain are up to 1,000-fold higher than those in ombrotrophic peat swamps of Panama and Borneo. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations are predicted to enhance wetland tree methane emissions and reduce upland tree net methane uptake, with the latter effect probably being strongest. Evidence from ice core records suggests that notable changes in global forest cover in the Americas in the 1500s following European first contact might have reduced global atmospheric methane concentrations by up to 50 ppb, indicating that forest area influence over the global methane budget is potentially substantial. Future research should better quantify tree methane exchange responses to environmental changes and reduce uncertainty in the global methane budgets.</p><p>Tree methane exchange is an important component of the terrestrial and global methane budget. This Perspective explores the mechanisms underlying why wetland trees are a net source of methane to the atmosphere and upland trees are a net sink, and the effect environmental changes will have on these processes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse gas1. Atmospheric concentrations of methane have dramatically increased from a pre-industrial baseline of ~700 ppb (ref. 2) to modern levels in excess of 1,900 ppb (ref. 3), with the rate of increase reaching 12.7 ppb yr\u22121 between 2014 and 2017 (ref. 4). Atmospheric sinks (hydroxyl (OH)-radicals) dominate methane losses at the global scale5. As a result, the atmospheric lifetime of methane is only about a decade, meaning that atmospheric levels can reflect short-term variations in components of the methane budget6. However, there is uncertainty over the size of the atmospheric sink7 and the global methane budget cannot be closed, partly owing to bottom-up emissions estimates exceeding those of top-down estimates by ~94 Tg yr\u22121 (ref. 5). As the terrestrial methane sink is thought to solely comprise the relatively small soil sink5, it is possible that the observed disparities between estimates results from a substantial terrestrial sink either being omitted or poorly represented in global methane budget estimates.</p><p>Trees, their bark and foliage facilitate the exchange of methane between the land surface and the atmosphere8, 9\u201310. For example, half of all methane emissions from the Amazon are emitted from floodplain trees11. Indeed, flooded or high water table trees mediate up to half (~44 Tg yr\u22121) of all tropical forested wetland methane emissions12. In wetlands with hypoxic and anoxic soils, tree morphological adaptations \u2014 such as the development of hollow aerenchyma tissue \u2014 facilitate air ingress into the rhizosphere13 and further permit soil-produced methane to exit via the same pathway14. Conversely, upland trees on free-draining, non-flooded soils, are net methane sinks15 on the order of 25\u201350 Tg yr\u22121 (ref. 15), potentially matching or exceeding the size of the terrestrial soil methane sink5,15. Consumption of methane by methanotrophic bacteria living in and on tree stems probably dominates tree uptake of atmospheric methane15.</p><p>Globally, there are an estimated 3 trillion trees16 in forests spanning ~4,000 Mha across lowland tropical to arctic and alpine environments17. Woody surfaces alone can provide a surface area of biosphere\u2013atmosphere contact that is equal to that of the global land surface15. Thus, given the need to understand how all components of the methane cycle contribute to the atmospheric burden, constraining how different agents of global change influence trees and forests will help the accurate quantification and prediction of responses in the global methane cycle and budget. Such insights will help reduce uncertainties in the global methane budget and support efforts towards meeting Paris Agreement targets for climate change18.</p><p>In this Perspective, I summarize the processes and mechanisms driving methane emission and uptake by trees. Then I discuss the response of tree methane exchange to global changes, including land use, warming, precipitation changes and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Next, I consider the role of trees in the past and future methane cycle. Finally, I highlight priorities for future research, including extending observations networks, interrogating past atmospheric methane fluctuations preserved in ice core records and leveraging forest ecosystem experiments to understand forest methane exchange sensitivity to environmental change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tree methane exchange with the atmosphere</emphasis></p><p>Trees, their bark and foliage, provide an additional surface for methane exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, with woody surfaces alone providing an area of biosphere\u2013atmosphere contact that is as vast as that of the global land surface15.

It occurs by methanogenesis under anaerobic conditions in wetland soils14 and, to a much lesser and highly uncertain extent, within trees themselves. Conversely, methane oxidation (methanotrophy) is facilitated by microbes along the soil\u2013tree continuum and within the tree bark, which attenuates methane emissions from the tree stem to the atmosphere21,22 (Fig. 2a).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global distribution of wetland tree methane (CH4) exchange observations.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, The global distribution of wetland tree stem methane emission observations.

Methane production and emission or uptake via tree stems is governed, principally, by soil hydrology.</p><p>Soil-produced methane is the dominant source of tree-emitted methane. Although bark-transmitted emissions can occur independently of transpiration22, tree methane emissions are generally controlled by hydrology via diffusion or transpiration14. Net primary production also governs methane production23. Methane production has a tight dependence on net primary productivity through its influence on available substrates via root exudates24, fine root and leaf litter. Both carbon production and carbon allocation within trees and to forest soils can determine net fluxes.</p><p>Methane emissions from tree stems vary with environmental conditions. Tree stem emissions can range by several orders of magnitude depending on latitude (which is closely related to mean annual temperature)25, hydrological12 (for example, floodplain11,12 versus peatland20,26, 27\u201328) and nutrient status (such as mineral-rich Amazonian floodplain versus ombrotrophic peatland). Observed emission rates range from 10s of \u00b5g m\u22122 h\u22121 in ombrotrophic peat swamps20,27 to ~140 mg m\u22122 h\u22121 in floodplains of mineral-rich clear water rivers of the Amazon11 (Fig. 1).</p><p>Tree traits9 and proximity to the coast also influence emissions. Stem lenticel density29 and wood density27 are important regulators of wetland tree methane emissions25. Inland wetland trees exhibit relatively high emissions compared with coastal mangrove trees (with notable exceptions30)25,31. This contrast is in part attributed to sulfate inhibition of coastal mangrove tree emissions, whereby sulfate-reducing bacteria competitively exclude methanogenesis when substrates are limiting32, 33\u201334. Whether wetland tree species are angiosperms (high emissions) or gymnosperms (very low emissions by comparison)25 also influence emissions. Though small, emissions measured in gymnosperm needle leaves and shoots35 are thought to reflect a highly uncertain aerobic foliar methane source36,37. In addition, tree traits related to transport and diffusion (such as rooting depth) or microbial mechanisms can influence exchange9. However, the effects of nutrient status have not yet been considered, despite probably having a strong influence on emission flux rates (Fig. 1).</p><p>Although methanogenesis is associated with waterlogged anaerobic soil conditions, trees in upland free-draining soils can also emit methane. Evidence comes from observations of the accessible lower tree stem portions of upland trees19,38, 39, 40\u201341 and in wetland-adapted tropical floodplain trees under temporarily low water table conditions that can be considered functionally upland12,15. Given the low water table, these emissions most probably derive from anaerobic microsites within free-draining soils42,43. These upland tree emissions are typically orders of magnitude smaller than those of wetland trees and decline with height above the forest floor until 1.5 m when average fluxes become negative and the tree stem above that height acts as a methane sink15.</p><p>Observations are biased towards sampling lower stem sections, potentially misrepresenting whole-tree methane fluxes. Typically, fluxes are reported at 1.3 m (breast height) above the forest floor25. Thus, sampling probably captures methane emissions and omits uptake, which is more prevalent higher up in the tree (as confirmed by measurements on stems and branches at 2, 5 and 11 m above the forest floor)15. However, available evidence suggests that methane is also emitted by leaves in some trees. For example, immature Amazon floodplain tree leaves11 and pioneer tree species sampled at around 1.2 m above the forest floor in Bangladesh10 exhibit small foliar emissions. These emissions are attributed to the entrainment of soil-produced methane by this successional class of trees having higher xylem flow rates that promote foliar methane emissions, which is not the case for later stage successional classes10.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane uptake by trees</emphasis></p><p>Microbial methanotrophy governs methane consumption (oxidation) and potential net uptake in trees. Methane oxidation in free-draining upland soils is thought to account for ~30 Tg of methane removal from the atmosphere each year44. Although generally occurring in the rhizosphere of herbaceous wetland plants45, 46\u201347, methanotrophy has also been observed in Australian wetland <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Melaleuca</emphasis> trees where as much as 33% of emissions were mitigated by methanotrophy between lower and upper tree stem portions21. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that methane consumption and uptake can occur within48 and on the surfaces of trees. When upscaled, methane uptake by trees globally could account for 25\u201350 Tg of atmospheric methane removal15.</p><p>Tree stems uptake of methane from the atmosphere has been observed across a range of forest types and locations. There is evidence of tree methane uptake in boreal forests of Scandinavia49,50, temperate forests51 and tropical forests, including those of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean52 and the Amazon floodplain during low water dry seasons12, and spanning a transect of a boreal to tropical climate gradient15 (including Sweden, the UK, Panama and the Amazon forest15). However, despite the region\u2019s importance, few data exist for Africa53.</p><p>As with wetland tree methane emissions, there is a distinct vertical variation in methane uptake along the tree stem. After emissions diminish near the tree base, atmospheric methane uptake then increases with distance from the forest floor15. The change in flux direction and magnitude, together with likely changes in bark methanotroph methane affinity with increasing height above the forest floor15, suggests a response in net methane exchange attributed to competing processes varying in the vertical plane (Fig. 3). The relative importance of each process is governed by the hydrological status of the soil and other variables, such as the presence or absence of tree morphological adaptations to periods of inundation13 (as is the case in the Amazon floodplains). In this example, tree root aeration apparatus might further permit mass flow of methane to the rhizosphere where it can be consumed by soil methanotrophs (Fig. 2b).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Idealized variability in methane processes with height above ground.</emphasis></p><p>Competing methane (CH4) processes in trees growing in wetland soils (solid line) and upland soils (dashed line) are shown on the left. The combined net influence of these competing processes is shown on the far right. Note the exaggerated representation of transiting soil methane for upland soils. Methane-relevant processes operating across the soil\u2013tree\u2013atmosphere continuum are spatially disaggregated in the vertical plane.</p><p>There is a clear need to better characterize methane exchange across woody surfaces. Given the spatial disaggregation of processes and evidence of increasing uptake with distance from the forest floor, it can be anticipated that uptake fluxes exceed those used in global scaling, potentially leading to the global tree methane sink being underestimated.</p><p>Given the range of factors involved in determining both tree methane emission and uptake, there is potential for each of these to respond differently to agents of global change with a net global forest methane exchange outcome that can be either more methanogenic or more methanotrophic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Response of tree methane to global change</emphasis></p><p>The net response of methane production and oxidation in soils and tree stems to environmental changes is uncertain; however, inferences can be made based on analogous systems. The influence of changes in forest extent, temperature and precipitation, and elevated atmospheric CO2 on net tree methane exchange are now discussed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Land-use change</emphasis></p><p>Forest extent is a primary control on global scale tree methane fluxes. In 2015, the global forest area was ~4,000 Mha (ref. 17) \u2014 equivalent to ~30% of the Earth\u2019s land surface \u2014 with 52% in tropical and subtropical zones, and 26% and 22% in temperate and boreal zones, respectively17. Other wooded lands (land with trees but not categorized as forest) cover ~1,200 Mha (ref. 17). Forest area is highly variable over time owing to climate change, deforestation and afforestation, wildfire (an additional source of methane54), and climate-induced mass forest die back55,56. In 2024, global woody plant surface area was estimated at 146 million km2 (ref. 15), an area equivalent to the global land surface area. Thus, any change in forest area, composition or function presents a clear mechanism to alter biosphere\u2013atmosphere exchange of methane in globally important quantities.</p><p>The type of forest subject to land-use change will also impact the magnitude of the impact on tree methane fluxes. This biome-specific shift in forest area is crucial to quantify is crucial as changes in forest area in wetland or upland environments will have different net effects on tree methane sources12 and sinks15. For example, there has been widespread deforestation and drainage in Southeast Asian peat swamp forests since the mid-1800s (ref. 57). Between 1990 and 2015, 71% of wetlands were converted (mostly to palm oil plantations), with peat swamp forest cover only remaining on 4.6 Mha of peatlands in the region, which spans Indonesia and Malaysia57. However, Southeast Asian peat swamp forests have low nutrient ombrotophic status27,58 and, as such, are a relatively small source of methane when compared with tree emissions from nutrient-replete tropical seasonal floodplain forests11,12 (Fig. 1). However, assessing tree methane impacts in such regions is challenging as drainage waters from deforested areas of Southeast Asian peat swamps are substantial methane emission sources59 and emissions from replacement agroecosystems, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acacia</emphasis> sp. plantations, are up to 50% of those of intact peat swamp forest ecosystems60.</p><p>Trees within the pulsing freshwater system of the Amazon floodplain emit up to 21 Tg yr\u22121 methane12 and are subject to a range of environmental pressures61,62. Changes in floodplain and forest extent, and alterations to the flood pulse through construction of upstream dams62, all have the potential to influence methane emissions from floodplain trees. For example, since 1980, climate change has increased the maximum flood extent in the Amazon by 26% (ref. 63). Assuming inundation adaptation among newly inundated trees or broader ecosystem adaptation, these changes could have resulted in tree methane emissions being elevated to globally important levels. However, portions of the lower Amazon are experiencing ~50% floodplain deforestation64, affecting many riparian areas, which are sources of tree methane emissions12. Collectively, mining, dam building, deforestation and climate change all affect the hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of floodplain forests, with uncertain consequences for biome-wide wetland tree methane emissions.</p><p>Upland forests have experienced extensive deforestation, globally losing 3% of forest area between 1990 and 2015 (ref. 17). Since 2001, upland forest loss resulted from a combination of permanent land-use change for commodity production, forestry, shifting agriculture and wildfire in similar proportions65. In total, global forest cover has diminished from 6 billion ha at the start of the Holocene 10,000 years ago to 4 billion ha in the first quarter of the twenty-first century, representing a decline from 57% to 38% of total land cover66. These changes will have reduced the tree surface sink term and will have shifted vegetated land surfaces towards a methanogenic state, through the hydrological effects of reduced evapotranspiration and increased run off increasing wetland area67. By contrast, although standing dead trees and decaying coarse woody debris can be a methane source68,69, coarse woody debris at the forest floor resulting from deforestation and other activities would tend to act as a methane sink70. Accounting for global shifts in forest demography and mortality71, this link with forest methane exchange requires further examination.</p><p>In addition, as with soil uptake, tree methane uptake is probably also controlled by atmospheric concentrations72, which were relatively small during the pre-industrial Holocene73 and so reducing uptake rates, which vary with atmospheric methane concentrations (smaller atmospheric concentrations lead to smaller fluxes). Conversely, uptake rates will probably be larger in the future when atmospheric methane concentrations are projected to be higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changes in temperature and precipitation</emphasis></p><p>Methanotrophy in soils is a potential analogue for the behaviour of woody surface methanotrophy. In soils, methanotrophy is limited by moisture availability, temperature and diffusive transport of methane to the uptake site72. Within a given climatic zone, hydrology is a primary control on methanotrophy as water availability probably governs soil and tree methane production and oxidation. Responses in microbial community composition, tree taxonomy and their associated methane-relevant traits to soil hydrology probably further affect net methane exchange8,40,74,75 (Fig. 2c).</p><p>Forests have the capacity to modify multiple processes that are relevant to the cycling of methane in response to climate change and its drivers, directly and indirectly. Direct effects of climate change include the net outcome of different temperature responses between the competing processes of methanogenesis and methanotrophy, and the influence of moisture availability on these processes. Indirect effects include the cascading effects of how productivity within forests responds to climate. For instance, warming might increase productivity and labile substrate allocation to soils76 that, if wet, could boost methane production and reduce the uptake of atmospheric methane.</p><p>Q10 temperature coefficients reflect how much the rate of a biological process changes for every 10 \u00b0C increase in temperature. Q10 values have not been quantified for methanogenesis or methanotrophy within or on tree surfaces and so inferences must be made based on observations of soil systems and other vegetated surfaces. The Q10 values for wetland methane emissions vary between 1.7 and 16 (ref. 77) and vary in rice paddies between 1.5 and 3 (ref. 78). The latter probably being closer to Q10 values in high pH tropical forested wetlands that are most likely to follow a similar proportion of acetate metabolism (up to 80%) as the methane precursor to rice paddy methane production79. In contrast, soil methanotrophy does not respond as strongly to temperature, with Q10 values ranging from 1 to 2 (refs. 80, 81\u201382). In forest soils, warming inconsistently affects uptake of atmospheric methane83, suggesting that other factors, such as diffusion rates, limit activity81. Overall, the responses of trees to direct climate change are highly uncertain, although Q10 values for methanogenesis exceed those of methanotrophy, suggesting that warming favours methane production over consumption in trees.</p><p>Methanogenesis and methanotrophy are both highly dependent on moisture availability. Saturated water conditions promote methane production and emission from wetland trees26 and, less frequently, upland tree bases19, provided there is a transport mechanism for methane egress as gas transfer is typically impeded in saturated soils81. Conversely, aridity impedes both methanogenesis and methane uptake81,83. However, drought of unspecified severity enhanced soil methane uptake in 11 forest experiments spanning a range of bioclimatic zones83, probably owing to reduced methanogenesis at anaerobic microsites in otherwise free-draining upland soils but without insufficient aridity to limit methanotrophy83. Depending on tree water demands, this limitation of anaerobic methanogenic microsites would shift the total tree exchange balance in favour of methane uptake.</p><p>Other factors that shift tree methane exchange in favour of methane oxidation can also respond to global change. Sulfate is an alternate electron acceptor supplied globally in fossil fuel-derived pollution. Sulfate-reducing bacteria outcompete methanogens for substrates33,84, resulting in decreased methane production in soils. Therefore, air pollution legislation to reduce this sulfate source could result in greater methanogenesis in wetland soils and, conceivably, upland soils, potentially decreasing net tree methane uptake in the future85.</p><p>Tree bark is also susceptible to local environmental change. Although direct evidence is lacking, it is likely that high vapour pressure deficits will affect tree bark methane exchange. More specifically, bark interception of methane (either uptake or emission) will decrease under sufficiently low moisture availability to impair endophytic methanotrophy83. Under constant entrainment of a weak soil methane source via the root system, reduced bark methane exchange could result in enhanced upland tree stem base emissions through limiting egress-interrupting oxidation and reducing atmospheric methane ingress and removal (Fig. 4).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hypothesized effects of stem surface moisture and aridity on methane exchange.</emphasis></p><p>The black arrows represent methane (CH4) ingress into the tree from soil sources and the red arrows represent the differences in exchange between the tree and atmosphere attributed to varying surface moisture levels. Independent of rhizophere-derived methane ingress into the tree, surface moisture is hypothesized to influence rates of bark interception, in either direction.</p><p>Despite these uncertainties, there have been attempts to represent tree methane emissions in estimates of future ecosystem responses to climate change. For example, representation of methane emissions from tropical wetland trees in wetland responses to different climate scenarios where trees are assumed to emit half of all tropical wetland emissions23. Such findings are in agreement with budgets where inclusion of tree emissions reconciled top-down and bottom-up methane emission estimates in the Amazon11. As climate-induced changes in wetland emissions are estimated to range from an additional 0.6 to 5.5% over the 21st century, there is a clear need to refine tree representation in global climate models so that all processes related to methanogenesis, transport and uptake are fully represented.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Influence of increasing atmospheric CO2</emphasis></p><p>Atmospheric CO2 continues to increase. Depending on the scenario considered, concentrations could reach around 506 ppm by 2050 and 602 ppm by 2100 under a moderate Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2-4.5)86. Broad physiological responses of growing plantation and mature trees to elevated CO2 (eCO2) have been examined in the temperate northern hemisphere (Duke FACE87, BIFoR FACE88,89, SPRUCE90 and in Switzerland91,92) and subtropical Australia (EucFACE)93,94, with upcoming free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments planned for the Amazon forest near Manaus in Brazil (AmazonFACE95). However, measurements of within or subcanopy methane exchange in these large-scale experiments are incredibly scarce. Thus, interpretation of the factors governing methane exchange must be inferred from known physiological responses in trees to eCO2 and how these responses more broadly influence edaphic conditions likely to influence methane exchange (Fig. 5).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tree physiological and ecosystem scale responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.</emphasis></p><p>Responses to CO2 in trees growing in both wetland (part <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) and upland soils (part <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) and the hypothesized combined influence of these responses on tree methane exchange. The black arrows represent relative photosynthate allocation to the rhizosphere, the red arrows represent tree\u2013atmosphere methane exchange, the yellow arrows represent increasing photosynthesis and the blue arrow represents the effects on evapotranspiration. The thickness of arrows reflect relative magnitude of flux. The inset images in part <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> represent the stomatal response. Trees exhibit variable physiological and ecosystem responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations in terms of methane exchange that, in the absence of any other limitation, should lead to a more methanogenic (and diminished methanotrophic) land surface under future CO2-enriched atmospheres. ET, evapotranspiration.</p><p>Tree transpiration partially controls the amount of water stored in soils that, in turn, controls the capacity of soils to produce or consume methane. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2) are modifying plant water-use efficiency through modified stomatal control96. At the leaf level, these modifications reduce the amount of water plants transpire97. Plant stomata respond to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations by narrowing their opening to conserve moisture (with sufficient CO2 for photosynthesis maintained in a CO2-enriched atmosphere), ultimately increasing soil moisture83.</p><p>However, the mechanism of reduced evapotranspiration at the leaf level from eCO2 could be nullified by a corresponding increase in leaf area98,99, with more leaves compensating for eCO2-reduced stomatal conductance. Synthesized evidence of soil methane exchange in seven elevated CO2 experiments indicates a 33% decrease in methane uptake under eCO2 exposure relative to controls. This decrease in methane uptake is associated with increases in soil moisture83, supporting the hypothesis that eCO2 increases water use efficiency and favours net methanogenesis over methanotrophy.</p><p>Canopy leaf methane exchange in trees is poorly constrained owing to the scarcity of observations and contradictory nature of existing data10,11,51,100. For example, notable methane uptake has been observed in canopy leaves of Canadian temperate upland trees51, whereas small emissions were recorded in young subcanopy Amazon floodplain tree leaves11 and in near-forest-floor pioneer tree species in Bangladesh10. The possibility remains that methane-utilizing bacteria on leaf surfaces facilitate the apparent leaf uptake of methane and so would not be controlled by stomatal conductance. However, if stomatal exchange is involved in either form of net methane exchange, then stomatal narrowing in response to eCO2 will exert some control over methane fluxes, particularly if soil hydrology is affected, as would be the case in upland trees (Fig. 5).</p><p>Finally, an increase in net primary production might result in increased biomass in various structural components of the trees89. Carbohydrate allocation to the soil rhizosphere could also be boosted24,89,101. Together, these effects could impact methanogenic and methanotrophic soil microbial communities and potentially enhance the entrainment, transport and egress of soil methane via roots and stems, resulting in a more methanogenic, or less methanotrophic, forest.</p><p>With atmospheric CO2 concentrations continuing to increase, there is a range of sometimes conflicting processes whose outcome might further influence climate via altering tree and forest methane exchange. These include leaf level transpiration responses to eCO2, compensatory ecosystem level responses through enhanced productivity and rhizospheric responses to enhanced carbon allocation, which could determine the methanogenic or methanotrophic status of a forest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role in the past and future methane cycle</emphasis></p><p>Forests have experienced change throughout history, from the Pleistocene expansion and contraction across glacial minima and maxima102, to the excesses of twentieth and twenty-first century deforestation66. The emerging understanding of the role of trees in the methane cycle warrants further exploration of past and future global atmospheric change. Ice core records and modern global monitoring networks show striking variations in atmospheric concentrations of methane over millennia and centuries73,103, as well as decades104. Understanding of tree\u2013atmosphere methane exchange presents opportunities to examine how long-term forest changes influenced past atmospheric composition. In addition, individual known past events that impacted forest area over relatively short timescales could be used to constrain the processes in question through analysis of their influence on atmospheric methane as recorded in ice cores105.</p><p>Atmospheric methane concentrations rose gradually from ~550 ppb 6,000 years ago106 to 700 pbb at the onset of industrialization73. The cause of this rise is still debated. The impact of human agricultural practices on the Earth system107 and natural responses to changes in orbital configuration108 are two proposed explanations. The so-called Early Anthropogenic (or Anthropocene) Hypothesis109 posits that the altered trajectory of atmospheric methane concentration change 5,000 years ago, as recorded in ice cores, could be attributed to the inception of rice agriculture around that time. Replacement of wetland-adapted and methane-emitting weeds with early planted rice plants, which also emit methane110, means that total wetland area, and so methane source, might not have changed appreciably despite some small-scale irrigation111. However, the impact of associated deforestation on the upland tree methane sink is omitted from this hypothesis. Deforestation would have reduced the tree methane sink in addition to probably increasing wetland area through reduced evapotranspiration67. It is likely that early forest clearance was confined to upland forests, rather than wetland swamps or floodplains, but the potential for global methane impact remains.</p><p>Natural forest regeneration on abandoned farmland in the Americas following the arrival of Europeans in the late fifteenth century and the introduction of disease is another period worthy of consideration. The resultant large-scale depopulation of the Americas from ~61 million people in 1492112 to ~6 million people by 1650 coincides with the CO2 minimum, or Orbis Spike, in the Law Dome ice core record dated ~1610112. As a response to the atmospheric drawdown of CO2 in regrowing forests, this CO2 minimum was argued to be a marker for the start of the Anthropocene112, although the cause is still debated113, 114\u2013115.</p><p>Ice core records from the Antarctic Law Dome show a methane minimum of 672 ppb preceding the 1610 Orbis Spike by 18 years (in 1592)116. This minimum is preceded by a rapid decline of 50 ppb in atmospheric methane after a peak of 722 ppb in 1561. This decline, which coincides with widespread forest regrowth in the Americas, exceeds other decreases observed in the previous 1,600 years. Owing to its relatively short lifetime, atmospheric methane responds rapidly to any change in sources or sinks. Forest regrowth following depopulation and farmland abandonment was on the order of 250 million ha of forest115,117, savannah and grassland. Increased tree stem surface area would have led to growth in the upland tree woody surface methane sink, reducing atmospheric methane. This atmospheric signal would have preceded any atmospheric CO2 effect, as is apparent in the Law Dome ice core record (Fig. 6).Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The effect of post-Colombian depopulation of the Americas, and associated forest regrowth on atmospheric methane concentrations.</emphasis></p><p>Land cover map depicting estimated natural vegetation117 (using scenario KK10 adapted by Jed Kaplan with permission from ref. 126) as a fraction of each grid cell in AD 1500 (panel <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) and AD 1600 (panel <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), which represent the post-Colombian period of New World disease and loss of life leading to natural vegetation (forest) regeneration. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>, Law Dome ice core-derived atmospheric CO2 (blue) and CH4 concentrations (pink) for the past 1,000 years. The inset panel displays the 200 years immediately after New World first contact, including a postulated Early Orbis Methane Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) boundary (dashed blue line), representing the collision of the Old and New World peoples and associated transcontinental biological exchange. The dashed red line is the later CO2 Orbis GSSP112. Data from ref. 116. Strong reductions in atmospheric methane concentrations in the 1500s, as recorded in ice cores, are consistent with a strengthening upland tree sink and a weakened wetland source following first European contact with the Americas and ensuing regrowth of forests following depopulation and farm abandonment.</p><p>Forest regrowth would induce hydrological changes that would impact methane exchange. For instance, evapotranspiration would increase with increasing forest cover, at the expense of soil moisture and run off, potentially leading to a small reduction in wetland extent67. Additionally, a reduction in forest fire methane contributions cannot be ruled out118. It is possible that the 1592 methane minimum was partially attributable to cooling associated with the Little Ice Age118,119. However, this effect would have been more pronounced in temperature-sensitive high-latitude northern wetlands118, which are not as strong a source of methane as neotropical wetlands11. In neotropical wetlands, a decrease in source strength or increase in sink might be more plausibly explained through reduced wetland area and a strengthened tree methane sink.</p><p>The tree methane sink could help to explain past changes in atmospheric composition and offer another climate benefit of reforestation and natural forest regrowth strategies. Using existing estimates of potential areas for future forest expansion, developed in light of efforts to meet Paris Agreement targets via natural climate solution approaches120,121, the woody surface methane sink could yield an additional 7% and 12% per ha of climate benefit for new temperate and tropical forest regrowth, respectively15. Globally, an additional 10% climate mitigation potential over current estimates of CO2 drawdown is estimated when forest expansion is considered at the global scale, highlighting the value of constraining tree methane uptake processes when seeking to mitigate climate change15.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Summary and future perspectives</emphasis></p><p>Trees and their woody surfaces are a key interface of methane exchange in the Earth system. In wetlands, trees provide substrates on which soil methanogens feed24, and their tissues and surfaces are an egress point of soil-produced methane emission to the atmosphere26. In both wetland and free-draining upland soils, trees are home to microbes that consume methane transiting from where it is produced in soils and tree bole interiors21. In free-draining upland soils, the tree methanotrophic microbiome directly accesses and consumes methane from the atmosphere15. Different drivers of global change can modify this diverse array of processes, with implications for past, present and future atmospheric chemistry and climate. Changing global forest area directly influences the woody surface area available to interface with the atmosphere. Increasing temperatures favour a more methanogenic state, whereas aridity might shift the balance towards global methanotrophy. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations can, depending on soil hydrological status, shift trees towards a more methanogenic or less methanotrophic status.</p><p>Accounting for the role of woody tree surfaces as an atmospheric methane sink can reduce uncertainties in the global methane budget. There is a pressing need to incorporate the processes of wetland tree methane emission and upland tree atmospheric methane removal into global Earth system models. However, uncertainties remain regarding how the tree methane sink is affected by global change. Reducing these uncertainties would require more extensive field-based flux and process measurements, which should include microbial community characterization122. In addition, tree stem, branch, twig and foliar measurements need to be incorporated in the suite of measurements made in plot-scale monitoring networks that span global forests123 and certainly across Africa, about which there is a particular poverty of tree flux data. The isotopic influence of methane uptake in tree crowns and canopies, which offer the largest surface area for methane uptake, should be observationally constrained with canopy-level flux measurements that can discern the influence of individual contributing surfaces.</p><p>Understanding of methane emissions in wetland trees greatly exceeds that of net atmospheric methane removal mechanisms in upland trees. However, the size of upland tree methane sink (25\u201350 Tg yr\u22121), though uncertain, is sufficiently substantial to warrant as much attention. Most information on upland tree flux from variable heights above the forest floor is from the tropics and subtropics, though these tend to be confined to humid and closed canopy forests that are not water limited. Temperate trees and trees from drier climates should be prioritized in future work to understand their methane uptake, with many more measurements needed across all biomes. In addition, existing observations predominantly represent Central and South America, North America and Europe. Expanding this observation network to include important regions, such as Africa, should also be a priority.</p><p>Addressing knowledge gaps in the mechanistic understanding of atmosphere\u2013tree methane exchange will require investigations into the microbiology of tree surfaces and interiors. In particular, the number, function, and interspecific interactions within microbial communities might respond differently to various aspects of global change with uncertain outcomes for tree methane exchange. Identifying the temperature responses for these different components and processes \u2014 including anaerobic production, emission, and in-stream oxidation and methane uptake \u2014 can refine estimates of future terrestrial methane exchange in Earth system models. Large-scale forest manipulation experiments, such as BIFoR FACE, AmazonFACE and EucFACE, can control CO2 concentrations at scale, with numerous smaller-scale experiments that control temperature and precipitation. Such experiments can be used to uncover the sensitivity of these mechanistic processes to environmental change.</p><p>Expansion of the tree methane observational network requires technological advances to develop low-cost sensors capable of measuring concentrations lower than ambient atmospheric concentrations. Low-cost sensors will democratize access to flux measurements124,125, extending data coverage on methane exchange. If embedded in global ecosystem monitoring plots, these measurements will have an auxiliary framework of broader ecosystem parameters. Low-cost sensors are a necessary step to quantifying methane uptake using chamber approaches, which themselves should be nested within sequential plot-, biome- and regional-scale measurements. Ultimately, such sensors will further extend and expand data coverage of these processes, allowing them to be mechanistically included in global land surface models.</p><p>Small-scale experiments combined with interrogation of Holocene and Anthropocene ice core records of atmospheric methane can strengthen understanding of the methane cycle at the global scale. Such understanding is essential to accurately predict atmospheric methane for the remainder of the twenty-first century and guide mitigation efforts to stay within safe climate limits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The author thanks the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), the Royal Society and the AXA Research Fund for earlier financial support.

But some programs spend thousands, even millions, of dollars raising parrots in captivity, only to find that these birds are not able to survive in the wild because they don't have enough 'real-world experience.'\"</p><p>While blue and yellow macaws are not endangered, the researchers hope to apply their techniques to populations in desperate need of conservation help.</p><p>The new method uses free-flight training, a technique developed to allow pet owners to fly macaws and other large parrots in open areas, similar to falconry.</p><p>Though the technique has been used with parrots for a couple of decades, this team of researchers has only recently introduced free flight as a conservation tool.</p><p>\"We facilitate young macaws learning to fly, join flocks and evade predators by carefully exposing them to situations they would normally encounter anyway, all at the right stage of development,\" said Chris Biro of Liberty Wings Freeflight Training, an expert in free flying parrots who helped develop the technique back in the early 2000s. \"Using this method, the macaws in this study gradually learned to fly outside their cages in a controlled environment, which helped them be ready to fly freely in the wild.\"</p><p>\"This method is incredibly efficient because it doesn't require generations of a species learning how to survive in a specific environment by trial and error,\" said Dr. Connie Woodman, the program manager for the USDA Conservation Innovation Grants program at Texas A&amp;M University and a VTPB faculty member. \"By fledging into the release environment and watching the trained adults, our released birds can quickly learn key survival skills and significantly increase their chances of survival.\"</p><p>Learning To Fly</p><p>Preparing captive macaws to survive in the wild begins when the birds are young, about the time that they begin to get curious about the world outside the nest.</p><p>\"Before a baby parrot begins fledging -- the process of learning to fly and leave the nest -- it will start climbing up and looking out at the world outside,\" Biro said. \"Already, that chick is creating a mental database of what's normal for its world. If they see a predator, that would be out of the ordinary, so the chick learns to react to threats.\"</p><p>At a later developmental stage, the chicks are encouraged to walk onto a perch and then to jump to nearby perches. From there, they begin learning to fly.</p><p>\"To help the chicks learn to fly as a flock, we even train them together with other chicks and the trained adult birds, so they learn to go from 'point A' to 'point B' together. Before long, they learn to fly in beautiful, tight flocks,\" Brightsmith said.</p><p>At night and in between training sessions, the parrots rest safely in the aviary, where they receive food and water. But over time, the young birds spend less and less time in the aviary and with the adult birds, learning to find food and water on their own.</p><p>\"A key part of the process is actually breaking the bond between the parrots and the humans that have been feeding them,\" Brightsmith said. \"In his work with parrots, Chris actually discovered that when the chicks are around 8 months old, they begin to move away from their parents and become independent. We make sure to wean the birds off hand feeding by this time so they transition to being independent wild birds, just like they would with their parents.\"</p><p>Combining Free Flight With Conservation</p><p>Free flying is a promising conservation strategy because it takes advantage of macaws' natural development while allowing researchers to control certain variables, like location.</p><p>\"In many traditional releases, once you open the cage, the birds get only one shot at success,\" Brightsmith said. \"Often, they fly off in one direction for 10 to 15 kilometers (six to nine miles) until they're exhausted; then they land and have no idea where anything is. They get hungry and thirsty and become easy for predators to pick off. But by doing free flight training in the environment where the birds will be released, they gradually learn the landscape, where to find food and water, and how to find their way home.\"</p><p>Releasing macaws in groups also increases the chances of creating new populations that will grow over time, increasing their numbers in the wild.</p><p>\"With those traditional releases, the parrots might fly off in completely different directions and not be anywhere near a potential mate,\" Brightsmith said. \"That's not very helpful for increasing the numbers of an existing population or starting a new one.\"</p><p>Surviving A Forest Fire</p><p>The ultimate test for the researchers' study flock came the day after their article was published.</p><p>\"A forest fire ripped through the area,\" Woodman said. \"To survive a natural disaster like that, animals have to have very good skills. We were very worried, both for the flock's survival and for the effect it would have on our research. Without good evidence of our method's success, it was less likely that other researchers would believe that it works.\"</p><p>For about 36 hours, the team waited anxiously for news of the flock's survival.</p><p>\"We finally received word from the field project leader, Dr. Humberto Mendes of the Universidade Federal de Alfenas, that all six birds were found sitting in the trees outside the fire zone,\" Woodman said. \"Not only did they survive, but they reunited as a flock. That means they've survived now for two years without human help, and they're skilled enough to survive a disaster like this.\"</p><p>As humans continue to encroach on parrots' natural habitats and droughts become more common due to climate change, disasters like the fire may become a more common challenge, making it vitally important that conservationists help animals learn to adapt to new situations.</p><p>\"I think a lot of us probably remember those nature documentaries for kids that stress the importance of not interfering with nature, that it's important to let something take its course,\" Woodman said. \"The problem is that we've already interfered so much with the changes we have made to our climate and ecosystems worldwide. The good news is that with techniques like free flight training we can also help put species back and rewild our damaged ecosystems.\"</p><p>The Future Of Free Flight Research</p><p>Free flight conservation research is tricky to do because it involves so many different organizations.</p><p>\"We call it a trans-boundary partnership,\" Woodman said. \"That's because it involves academia, government and private industry, and they all have their own boundaries and rules to follow. Not only are we having to cross boundaries to make the research happen, but the birds themselves cross boundaries literally when they fly into other countries.\"</p><p>With the success of their recent study, the team is hopeful that other conservationists will begin applying free flight techniques, especially to species that are endangered or threatened.</p><p>\"There's room to believe that similar techniques might be possible with other kinds of animals,\" Biro said. \"What's important is that whoever is using this method understands the reason behind each step.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/press-releases/free-flight-captive-parrot-release/\">https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/press-releases/free-flight-captive-parrot-release/</url></p><p>Contact: Jennifer Gauntt, Director of VMBS Communications, Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp;

It is about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/26/us-cities-wildfire-risk/77886030007/\">vulnerable communities across the nation</url>, from the arid regions of the western U.S. to parts of Florida, Appalachia, the New Jersey Pine Barrens and many at-risk communities in between.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem is that, as a society, we cannot seem to have that essential conversation. There is a sort of cultural anomaly, like a spell, that inexorably steers the discussion and the funding for wildfire policies toward \u201cforest management.\u201d This misdirection is putting lives and communities at risk. </p><p>The Eaton and Palisades fires that destroyed communities and killed at least 28 people in Los Angeles <url normalizedValue=\"https://lpfw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-LA-Fires_EVeg_Chart_v2.png\">were not forest fires</url>. The fire that destroyed Lahaina in Maui in 2023, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.khon2.com/lahaina-a-path-forward/one-year-in-numbers-and-people-as-lahaina-moves-forward/\">killed at least 102 people</url>, was not a forest fire. In fact, most of the wildfires that have had the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk5737\">worst impacts on lives and homes have not been forest fires</url>. </p><p>Yet every time another town is destroyed by a wildfire, usually nowhere near a forest, politicians shift the conversation and the funding away from creating fire-safe communities and instead focus on \u201cforest management.\u201d Congress and President Biden did this when they passed the Infrastructure Act in 2021, and again when they passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Billions of taxpayer dollars were allocated for forest management, supposedly to save vulnerable communities from wildfires. </p><p>President Trump and the current Congress are also doing it. As Trump toured the Palisades fire in Los Angeles on Jan. 24, 2025, with the nearest forests dozens of miles away, he once again suggested that the community devastation was somehow about the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-24/trump-visits-california-fire-damage\">lack of forest management</url>. </p><p>House Republicans recently claimed that, in order to protect communities in Los Angeles and elsewhere from wildfires, we must \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://westerncaucus.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5844\">aggressively increase the pace and scale of our forest management</url>\u201d on federal lands by passing the \u201cFix Our Forests Act.\u201d This is a bill that would override and weaken environmental laws to facilitate a huge increase in taxpayer-subsidized logging of mature and old-growth trees on federal lands under euphemisms like \u201cthinning\u201d and \u201cfuel reduction.\u201d </p><p>On Jan. 23, 2025, House Republicans passed this backcountry logging bill, <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202525\">joined by 64 Democrats</url>. This was the response of the House to the tragic losses of entire communities in Los Angeles, and at least 28 deaths, nowhere near forests. </p><p>Why is this misdirection so dangerous? Because it diverts attention and resources away from the only actions that are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2315797120\">scientifically proven to effectively protect communities from wildfires</url>: home hardening; defensible space pruning within 100 feet of homes and other structures; and evacuation planning and preparedness, including better early warning systems. This community-based approach <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-09-23/bridge-fire-wrightwood-wildfire-protection-home-hardening\">really works</url>.</p><p>In contrast, science shows that vegetation management and removal activities <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/wf13158\">beyond about 100 feet from homes provide no additional benefit</url> to home protection. Moreover, while politicians keep talking about forest management, they are not talking about building, and post-fire rebuilding, with fire-resistant materials that, unlike wood, don\u2019t easily burn, such as recycled light-gauge steel, structural <url normalizedValue=\"https://hempblockusa.com/\">hempcrete blocks</url> and 3-D <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azureprintedhomes.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Azure-Printed-Homes&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9k2G0BUm02EkscDRRu62KBNW1y-k&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA19e8BhCVARIsALpFMgFZIugXc2BHh0bXBmvtDNQFJABTK-EFHmbCNo-M72Ct44hRN3H4mIsaAjtCEALw_wcB\">printed homes</url>.  </p><p>Even in forested areas, abundant scientific evidence shows that <url normalizedValue=\"https://johnmuirproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/JMP-fact-sheet-thinning-and-fire-29Nov24.pdf\">removing trees reduces wind resistance</url> and allows gusts to dramatically increase the speed of wildfires, giving people less time to safely evacuate, and first responders less time to help save lives and homes.</p><p>In recent years, large fires have rapidly <url normalizedValue=\"https://johnmuirproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CPP-DN-2-Objection-2-12Dec24.pdf\">swept through \u201cthinned\u201d forests before burning down towns</url>, as we saw tragically with the towns of Paradise, Grizzly Flats and Greenville in northern California in recent years. Nor would mastication or other removal of native chaparral have helped in the Los Angeles fires, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.4996/fireecology.130312013\">such actions only cause chaparral to be replaced by highly combustible invasive grasses</url>, which spread flames and embers even faster. </p><p>Moreover, \u201cthinning\u201d and other logging activities contributes to the global cycle of climate chaos by <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/110057\">increasing carbon emissions more than threefold per acre relative to fire alone</url>, worsening climate change and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/extreme-weather/\">extreme weather</url> that drives big fires. </p><p>Politicians of both parties: Knock it off with this dangerously misdirected narrative about forest management. People need your help. If you don\u2019t change course, and focus on helping create fire-safe communities, the heartbreaking impacts that we just witnessed in the Los Angeles fires will happen again, and again, across the country. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chad Hanson, based in Kennedy Meadows in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains, is a wildfire scientist with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://johnmuirproject.org/\">John Muir Project</url> of Earth Island Institute, and the author of the book \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kentuckypress.com/9780813181073/smokescreen/\">Smokescreen: Debunking Wildfire Myths to Save Our Forests and Our Climate</url>.\u201d </emphasis></p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com\">For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THHLCM-httpsthehillcomopinion5119480wildfirespoliticsmisdirection</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THHLCM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1S-BK73-RS2H-V4YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487142</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 NEXSTAR MEDIA INC.

LaTourette today announced that the Murphy Administration is providing an additional $3 million to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service budget to enhance protection of lives and property through investments in new equipment and staff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The investment was announced as part of a ceremony at Coyle Field Forest Fire Service air attack base in Burlington County, during which the DEPs Forest Fire Service also presented awards to individuals and agencies that have assisted during New Jerseys most active wildfire season in more than a decade. The funding announcement and awards presentation coincided with Climate Week, which runs from Sept. 17 through 24. Climate Week provides the public with an opportunity to learn about climate change and actions that can be taken to become more resilient and mitigate its impacts.</p><p>The need to further strengthen our Forest Fire Service cannot be understated during Climate Week as the impacts of climate change increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires right here at home, said Commissioner LaTourette. In addition to protecting lives and property, our Forest Fire Service assists with natural disasters, maintains hundreds of miles of roads, works alongside multiple cooperators to develop and implement strategic plans that reduce the risk of future wildfires, and lends their talents to other states when wildfires strike.</p><p>The $3 million investment will help upgrade the Forest Fire Services aging fleet of equipment. All fire engines used by the Forest Fire Service are constructed and modified in-house at the services Research and Development facility, resulting in significant cost savings. These specially designed engines are equipped to access difficult-to-reach areas of New Jerseys forests while keeping firefighters safe during a growing wildfire. Additional funds will also be made available to expand the Forest Fire Services contracted air support during peak spring fire season and to help fund full-time employees that will fill critical vacancies.</p><p>Extended Fire Seasons</p><p>This year we saw the challenges the Forest Fire Service can face with a prolonged wildfire season and multiple significant wildfires burning simultaneously in the Pinelands and elsewhere throughout the state, said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests and Historic Sites. It is imperative that we provide our brave wildland firefighters the best resources possible to do their jobs safely while they protect lives and property.</p><p>Fire seasons across the country have increased in length, including in the Garden State. Wildfire season in New Jersey has historically been from mid-March through mid-May but has increased noticeably in length during the past decade, with major wildfires occurring in February and extending into summer. In New Jersey, 99 percent of wildfires are caused by people, through accidents, carelessness and arson. The remainder are caused by lightning strikes.</p><p>Major wildfires continued to flare through this summer, with the most recent being the Dragway Wildfire in late August that burned 1,778 acres, and the Airpark Wildfire that burned more than 800 acres during Labor Day weekend. Both fires were in the wildfire-prone Pinelands region.</p><p>A new nationwide analysis of weather conditions during the past 50 years by the nonprofit Climate Central found that the annual number of days with a high risk of wildfire has increased by 10 days in northern New Jersey and four days in southern New Jersey. The 2020 New Jersey Scientific Report on Climate Change notes that wildfire seasons are expected to lengthen, and the frequency of large fires will increase due to hot, dry periods that will result from increasing temperatures.</p><p>To date in 2023, the Forest Fire Service has responded to 1,034 wildfires which have burned 17,979 acres in New Jersey. Fourteen of these fires were considered to be major wildfires burning in excess of 100 acres, making 2023 the busiest fire season in more than a decade.</p><p>The most significant of these fires include the Jimmys Waterhole Wildfire in Manchester and Lakehurst in Ocean County, which burned 3,450 acres and caused the evacuation of 170 homes; the Kanouse Wildfire in West Milford, Passaic County, which burned 972 acres and caused the evacuation of five homes; the Allen Road Wildfire in Bass River Township, Burlington County, which burned 5,474 acres, forced the evacuation of a campground and the closure of a portion of the Garden State Parkway; and the Flat Iron Wildfire in Medford, Burlington County, which burned 212 acres and threatened 40 homes.</p><p>The 14 major wildfires that have occurred this year are:</p><p>March 7: Governors Branch Wildfire (418 acres), Little Egg Harbor Township, Ocean County</p><p>April 11: Jimmy's Waterhole Wildfire (3,450 acres), Manchester Township and Lakehurst Borough, Ocean County</p><p>April 12: Kanouse Wildfire (972 acres), West Milford Township, Passaic County</p><p>April 14: Log Swamp Wildfire (1,607 acres), Little Egg Harbor Township, Ocean County</p><p>April 18: River Road Wildfire (241 acres), Washington Township, Burlington County</p><p>May 13: Cannonball Wildfire (102 acres), Pompton Lakes Borough, Passaic County</p><p>May 29: Box Turtle Wildfire (158 acres), Monroe Township, Gloucester County</p><p>May 31: Allen Road Wildfire (5,474 acres), Bass River Township, Burlington County</p><p>June 2: Flatiron Wildfire (212 acres), Medford Township, Burlington County</p><p>June 9: City Line Wildfire (711 acres), Manchester Township, Ocean County, and Pemberton and Woodland Townships, Burlington County</p><p>June 9: Buzby Boggs Wildfire (703 acres), Evesham Township, Burlington County</p><p>June 19: Acorn Hill Wildfire (246 acres), Woodland Township, Burlington County</p><p>20: Dragway Wildfire (1,778 acres), Waterford Township, Camden County, and Shamong and Medford, Burlington County</p><p>2: Airpark Wildfire (810 acres), Lacey Township, Ocean County</p><p>Important Partnerships</p><p>To mark the historic fire season, the Forest Fire Service presented the Interagency Cooperators Award to six interagency partners for distinguished service during the extraordinary event of wildfires in New Jersey, Spring 2023.</p><p>Without the cooperation of our interagency partners the Forest Fire Services job would be immensely more difficult, said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator and Chief of the Forest Fire Service. Celebrating these interagency partners is a reminder that preventing wildfires and keeping the public safe requires the support and commitment of many people and departments.</p><p>Awards were presented to:</p><p>Christopher Warwick, Trooper II, New Jersey State Police Office of Emergency Management</p><p>Michael Mastronardy, Sheriff, Ocean County Sheriffs Department</p><p>Kristen Carr, Deputy Emergency Management Coordinator, Burlington County Office of Emergency Management</p><p>Stephen J. Letts, Captain, Fire Investigations K9 Unit, New Jersey State Fire Marshal's Office</p><p>Whiting Volunteer Fire Company No. 1</p><p>West Milford Fire Companies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6</p><p>In addition, DEP Senior Press Officer Caryn Shinske was given the Smokey Bear Award for Journalism in the Service of Wildfire Prevention in recognition of her work coordinating and facilitating media requests involving the Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Partnerships are critical to the mission of the Forest Fire Service, which also administers the Volunteer Fire Capacity Program to help organize, train and equip local fire departments to assist the Forest Fire Service in fighting wildfires in small, rural communities with populations of 10,000 or less.</p><p>This year, the DEP through the Forest Fire Service is making $200,000 available in grants to help prepare local departments to assist in fighting wildland fires. Eligible departments must match their grant amount, use funding for equipment and training, and agree to assist the Forest Fire Service with emergency operations when asked.</p><p>Created through legislation on July 4, 1906, the DEPs Forest Fire Service is tasked with protecting life, property and natural resources from wildfire in the Garden State. The Forest Fire Services primary response area is 3.72 million acres, comprising 77% of the states land area.</p><p>Throughout this very busy wildfire season, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, as operational needs allow, has supported efforts in other parts of the country to fight wildfires and continued to support emergency response efforts in New Jersey, including the recent impacts from torrential rain that caused mudslides and other damage in July.</p><p>The DEPs newly updated climate change website includes a more user-friendly homepage and a collection of interactive story maps titled Climate Change in New Jersey: Impacts and Effects, which provide up-to-date climate change research, build upon the findings of New Jerseys Scientific Report on Climate Change, and use a direct, easy-to-understand format that includes maps, photos, graphs, animations and more.</p><p>To learn more about wildfires in New Jersey, steps to protect property and other resources, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.njwildfire.org\">www.njwildfire.org</url></p><p>Like the Forest Fire ServicesFacebook page at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/NJForestFireService\">www.facebook.com/NJForestFireService</url>/</p><p>Follow the Forest Fire Service on Twitter @njdepforestfire and Instagram @newjerseyforestfire</p><p>Follow Commissioner LaTourette on Twitter and Instagram @shawnlatur and follow the DEP on Twitter @NewJerseyDEP, Facebook @newjerseydep, Instagram @nj.dep and LinkedIn @newjerseydep</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126145526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6986-92P1-DYTH-G1XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 21, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Saveetha Engineering College by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires are a regular occurrence throughout the year with an increasing intensity in the summer and fall periods. Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, property and human lives.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Saveetha Engineering College: \"Early detection and rapid response are critical to mitigate the devastating effects of these fires. This article presents a Long Range (LoRa) Alert Network System designed for the early prediction and timely notification of forest fires. The system leverages LoRa technology to create a robust and cost-effective wireless communication network in remote forested areas. These fires primarily stem from various natural and environmental phenomena and natural disasters. The timely dissemination of forest fire alerts was hampered, resulting in delays in fire management. In order to address this issue, efforts were made to enhance the capability for prompt forest fire detection. The challenges predominantly revolve around forested regions where data communication infrastructure is deficient. In the event of a forest fire, there exists a network barrier that impedes information transmission. Consequently, forest fire detection systems leveraging Mesh LoRa networks and image processing networks have been devised. An integrated module within the LoRa/GPS HAT has been explored as a potential solution to the fire predicament. The Flame Sensor Module, functioning as a fire detection sensor component, and the LoRa/GPS HAT, serving as a hardware medium for radio frequency data transmission communication, have been employed. The interconnection of these devices within a network facilitates the development of a prototype fire detection system.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Combining a Flame Sensor Module with a LoRa/GPS HAT is indeed a viable approach to creating a prototype fire detection and alert system. By combining the Flame Sensor Module with the LoRa/GPS HAT, a scalable and cost-effective fire detection and alert system appropriate for distant and wooded locations with limited traditional communication infrastructure is created. This system can play a crucial role in early fire detection, potentially reducing the severity of forest fires and protecting both natural resources and human lives.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Long Range (LoRa) and Alert Network System for Forest Fire Prediction.

They have also delayed critical infrastructure projects, such as the12.5-mile waterline replacement project, which supplies water to the South Rim and the Town of Tusayan. And ahead of fire season,Forest Service firingswill hamper forest maintenance and wildfire prevention to protect Arizona communities.</p><p>\"From Horseshoe Bend to the Grand Canyon to Saguaro National Park, Arizona's public lands are central to our state's identity and drivers of local economies. Elon Musk and his DOGE minions are willing to put that at risk and jeopardize Arizonans' safety so they can give tax cuts to their billionaire buddies,\"said Senator Gallego.\"I'm proud to join Senator Kelly in fighting to ensure that our national parks are fully staffed, and our national forests are safely managed.\"</p><p>\"Trump's indiscriminate firings are directly affecting Arizona families. When there aren't enough staff at the gates of the Grand Canyon, Petrified Forest, Saguaro, and other national parks around the state, that means visitors are stuck in long lines and local businesses suffer. And when the Forest Service can't properly prepare for fire season, Arizona communities are at risk,\"said Senator Kelly.\"We're doing right by hardworking federal employees and ensuring our parks and forests have the staff they need to stay open, keep visitors safe, and get critical projects done on time.\"</p><p>\"Anyone who has hiked the Appalachian Trail through the White Mountain National Forest or visited Saint-Gaudens in New Hampshire knows just how spectacular our public lands can be. Without proper staffing and resources, public safety, ecosystems and local economies will all suffer,\"said Senator Shaheen.\"I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation to restore national park and forest service employees who were unjustly fired by the Trump Administration and ensure the investments Congress has made in our outdoor economy continue to flow as intended.\"</p><p>\"National Parks Service workers like Park Rangers keep us safe in some of our country's most wild and extreme areas, including places like Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. U.S. Forest Service workers keep our forest areas healthy and productive, including the largest forest east of the Mississippi River, the Superior National Forest. I've met these fired workers, I've heard their stories and losing them makes our most cherished wild areas less safe and less cared for,\"said Senator Smith.\"Elon Musk indiscriminately and illegally fired thousands of the workers meant to keep these areas safe, including Minnesotans who worked with loggers to sell timber in a way that protected the health of our forests and Park Rangers up at Voyageurs. Republicans are risking the longevity of our parks and forests all to pay for tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. These bills are commonsense proposals that clarify that Congress and only Congress has the power to decide where we spend tax dollars.\"</p><p>\"As the mayor of a city surrounded by state and national forest land, it is imperative that we preserve the positions of those who work for the Forest Service and the National Park Service because they are our frontline for protecting the community from the fire danger that prolonged drought and the effects of climate change expose us to. Without the vigilance and personal commitment to the preservation of these areas of our rangers, we become an unmonitored tinderbox waiting for a single destructive spark. For the sake of safety, please reinstate the positions of the dedicated park staff who serve our cities, states, and nation,\"said Ann Shaw, Mayor of the City of Cottonwood.</p><p>\"Clarkdale has the pleasure of being located in two National Forests Prescott and Coconino and the home of Tuzigoot National Monument. For the visitors who come to enjoy our beautiful area of grand vistas, wonderful outdoors adventures of hiking, fishing, and kayaking, and to learn about our Singuan history; having well-staffed facilities and services ensures they have a safe and enjoyable experience. These areas are important economic drivers that help sustain our local economy. For those who live here this is a critical fire area. It is very important that our national forests and monument have the necessary personnel needed to manage these lands. They are a big part of our overall fire mitigation efforts. A forest fire would be devastating to our community,\"said Robyn Prud'homme-Bauer, Mayor of the town of Clarkdale.</p><p>\"It is of great importance to have appropriately staffed National Parks and forest service to maintain our tourism industry, sustain our local economies and provide critical fire mitigation. In light of the current drought situation in Yavapai county we need more forest service personnel not less. National Parks must remain open and fully staffed. Thank you for your attention on this important matter for Yavapai county and the Verde Valley,\"said Christina Alex Barber, Mayor of the Town of Jerome.</p><p>\"More than 5 million tourists visit the Grand Canyon National Park each year. The National Park is an economic engine for Arizona and our rural gateway communities. Terminating essential Grand Canyon employees just prior to the summer tourist season threatens a positive visitor experience and impacts our tourist economy. These terminations, together with the hiring freeze, which prevents the hiring of 70-100 needed seasonal workers, imperils the protection, operation, and management of the Grand Canyon, one of the natural wonders of the world,\"said Vice Chair of Coconino County Board of Supervisor Patrice Horstman.\"Our National Forests in Arizona provide premier outdoor recreation and hunting opportunities and it is not a surprise that these lands are being utilized beyond the capacity of the employees to provide adequate law enforcement or emergency response. Not to mention the important role of the Forest Service must play in fire suppression and healthy forest management. For the health and safety of our communities, rather than terminating employees, forest Service staffing needs to be increased.\"</p><p>\"Right now, our local communities, fire departments, and land management partners are getting no information from the Forest Service, leaving us in the dark about fire prevention, recreation management, and critical projects that impact public safety and tourism. We appreciate Senator Kelly for introducing legislation to restore staffing at the Forest Service and address the uncertainty facing our wildland-urban interface,\"said Yavapai County Supervisor Brooks Compton.</p><p>To effectively address fire prevention, recreation management, and essential projects impacting public safety and tourism, Yavapai County emphasizes the need for timely and consistent information from the Forest Service. We appreciate Senator Kelly's leadership in introducing legislation to bolster Forest Service staffing and reduce uncertainty in our wildland-urban interface. We look forward to working closely with the Forest Service to ensure our communities are well-informed and prepared,\"said Yavapai County Vice Chairman Brooks Compton, and the Yavapai Firewise, Prescott Area Urban Wildland Interface Commission Representative to the Board of Supervisors.</p><p>Specifically, theProtect Our Parks Act of 2025and theSave Our Forests Act of 2025will:</p><p>Restore staffing levels at the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service to improve visitor experience and ensure the safety and upkeep of public lands.</p><p>Rehire recently terminated employees to address staffing shortages that have led to long entrance wait times and delayed maintenance projects.</p><p>Keep critical projects moving, including those funded under the Great American Outdoors Act, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act.</p><p>Provide necessary funding to support staffing and maintenance needs, preventing further disruptions to park operations and conservation efforts.</p><p>Read the full Protect Our Parks Act of 2025 and Save Our Forests Act of 2025.</p><p>Washington, DC</p><p>SH-302 Hart Senate Office Building</p><p>Washington, DC 20510</p><p>P# 202-224-4521</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127024713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB0-6RH3-RTNH-N28Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 12, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Both fires are located outside the Sedona area and pose no threat to communities.</p><p>The Knob Fire, located 6.5 miles north of Sedona (<url normalizedValue=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/3w1AWyiRRo8nwuuB7\">https://maps.app.goo.gl/3w1AWyiRRo8nwuuB7</url>), is approximately 4 acres in size. Resources working to contain and suppress the Knob Fire include one engine, one hand crew and one Type 3 helicopter.</p><p>The Clay Fire, located 6 miles east of Sedona (<url normalizedValue=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/VJiyFL6vTyhKrC6x7\">https://maps.app.goo.gl/VJiyFL6vTyhKrC6x7</url>), is roughly 4 acres in size. Resources working to contain and suppress the Clay Fire include two engines, a helitack module and a Type 1 helicopter conducting bucket drops.</p><p>Smoke will remain highly visible from Sedona and nearby areas, including Munds Park, Jerome and Interstate 17, during suppression work.</p><p>Both fires were reported Monday following a weekend storm.</p><p>Coconino National Forest fire managers made the decision to suppress the Knob and Clay fires due to the location of both fire starts. Both fires originated in rugged, steep terrain with poor access for wildland firefighting operations. These locations also lack good holding features (such as wide roads and canyons) that would safely confine the fire to a pre-determined area and ensure full containment.</p><p>When lightning-caused fires are reported, fire managers complete a full analysis before deciding whether to suppress a fire or manage it to benefit the fire-adapted ponderosa pine ecosystem of northern Arizona.</p><p>While the Knob and Clay fires will both be managed with a full-suppression strategy, Coconino National Forest fire managers will continue to seek opportunities to manage lightning-caused fires for forest health as outlined in the Forest Service's 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis</url>). The management - which includes planned, strategic growth - of certain lightning-caused fires can reduce hazardous fuel loading, improve watershed health, and protect northern Arizona communities from future catastrophic and unwanted wildfires.

According to news reporting out of Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"In recent years, frequent forest fires have seriously threatened the earth's ecosystem and people's lives and safety.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Nature Science Founding of China. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics: \"With the development of machine vision and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) technology, UAV monitoring combined with machine vision has become an important development trend in forest fire monitoring. In the early stages, fire shows the characteristics of a small fire target and obvious smoke. However, the presence of fog interference in the forest will reduce the accuracy of fire point location and smoke identification. Therefore, an anchor-free target detection algorithm called FuF-Det based on an encoder-decoder structure is proposed to accurately detect early fire points obscured by fog. The residual efficient channel attention block (RECAB) is designed as a decoder unit to improve the problem of the loss of fire point characteristics under fog caused by upsampling. Moreover, the attention-based adaptive fusion residual module (AAFRM) is used to self-enhance the encoder features, so that the features retain more fire point location information.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Finally, coordinate attention (CA) is introduced to the detection head to make the image features correspond to the position information, and improve the accuracy of the algorithm to locate the fire point. The experimental results show that compared with eight mainstream target detection algorithms, FuF-Det has higher average precision and recall as an early forest fire detection method in fog and provides a new solution for the application of machine vision to early forest fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: FuF-Det: An Early Forest Fire Detection Method under Fog.

Understanding the differential effects of socioeconomic and climatic factors on forest fire incidence across different administrative and climatic scales can provide new information for wildfire studies. In this study, we applied a cross-classified multilevel model with forest fire incidence data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products (MODIS 14A1) to explore the relationship between the spatial distribution of fire incidence and socioeconomic and climatic factors at different levels and to estimate the effects of these drivers on forest fire incidence. Our results showed that the density of impervious surfaces, density of cropland, mean monthly precipitation, mean monthly temperature, density of primary gross domestic product, annual monthly average relative humidity, and annual monthly average precipitation at the county level, prefecture-level city and climatic levels had significant multilevel associations with forest fire incidence in the Changbai Mountain area.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These findings will effectively support the development of forest fire administrative policies for specific regions.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Study on the socioeconomic and climatic effects of forest fire incidence in the Changbai Mountain area based on a cross-classified multilevel model.

According to news reporting out of Piaui, Brazil, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires cause damage to life, biodiversity, and properties, affecting natural ecosystems, healthy and only. During the practical application of fire prevention, numerous detection techniques have been thoroughly researched to prevent devastating fires.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Federal University, \"The techniques improve early fire detection and accelerate emergency response, reducing damage and optimizing system containment operations. Wildfire detection requires a robust infrastructure for equipment, maintenance, and ongoing monitoring. Effective cooperation between components and integration of technologies is key to a consistent and comprehensive response to fires. This article proposes a fire monitoring system using drones, cameras, and edge computing technologies. We use Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) to model the structure and evaluate the system's performance. The model is parameterizable, allowing adjustments to the components' resource capabilities and service time. Twenty-four parameters can be defined, making it possible to evaluate a wide variety of different scenarios.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results obtained in different scenarios in this work have the potential for auxiliary administrators of monitoring systems to estimate more than six analyses and plan more optimized architectures as needed.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Monitoring System Supported By Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Edge Computing: a Performance Evaluation Using Petri Nets.

According to news reporting originating from Zibo, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires often pose serious hazards, and the timely monitoring and extinguishing of residual forest fires using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can prevent re-ignition and mitigate the damage caused.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Regional Leading Research Center of Nrf And Mocie; Basic Science Research Program Through The Nrf of Korea Funded By The Mest. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Shandong University of Technology: \"Due to the urgency of forest fires, drones need to respond quickly during firefighting operations, while traditional drone formation deployment requires a significant amount of time. This paper proposes a pure azimuth passive positioning strategy for circular UAV formations and utilizes the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to effectively adjust the formation within a short timeframe. Initially, a passive positioning model for UAVs based on the relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle is established, with the closest point to the ideal position being selected as the position for the UAV to be located. Subsequently, a multi-target optimization model is developed, considering 10 UAVs as an example, with the objective of minimizing the number of adjustments while minimizing the deviation between the ideal and adjusted UAV positions.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The DQN algorithm is employed to solve and design experiments for validation, demonstrating that the deviation between the UAV positions and the ideal positions, as well as the number of adjustments, are within acceptable ranges. In comparison to genetic algorithms, it saves approximately 120 s.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Multi-Target Optimization Strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Formation in Forest Fire Monitoring Based on Deep Q-Network Algorithm.

According to news reporting from Wageningen, Netherlands, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"As climate change intensifies, temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, leading to increased droughts and elevated wildfire risks.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Wageningen University and Research: \"This trend is especially pronounced in with an emerging wildfire risk under climate change, including Northwestern Europe. This study evaluates the use and needs of climate information services (CIS) for supporting Integrated Fire Management in these regions. Employing a qualitative approach, an online survey was distributed to professional stakeholders in Northwestern Europe, focusing on their awareness and perception of preparedness for wildfires, their use of CIS, and their future needs for fire management. Results indicate that while stakeholders are experiencing wildfires and although there is a high perception of preparedness for current wildfire conditions, their preparedness for future conditions is considerably lower. Most rely on short-term weather forecasts, yet there is a significant gap in the use and perceived need for long-term climate projections. Additionally, engagement with and awareness of the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) are limited.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The findings underscore the critical need for more detailed and locally relevant CIS that are salient, credible, and legitimate to foster proactive and adaptive management strategies. Enhancing stakeholder engagement and co-producing tailored CIS can contribute to improving prevention, preparedness, and resilience against the escalating threat of wildfires in Northwestern Europe.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: The role of weather and climate information services to support in wildfire management in Northwestern Europe.

Let's ensure that even the smallest step we take in our daily lives will be an effort towards conserving nature and natural resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">~ Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p>Forests play a vital role in combating climate change by absorbing carbon, preserving biodiversity, and providing clean air and water. However, growing environmental pressures are challenging these essential ecosystems. In India, though, there is a positive shift. The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023 shows that the country's Forest and Tree cover now spans 827,357 square kilometers, covering 25.17% of the nation's total land area. This includes 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) of forest cover and 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) of tree cover. This progress reflects Indias successful efforts to balance development with environmental conservation.</p><p>ISFR 2023: A Snapshot of Indias Forests</p><p>The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023, published by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), is a biennial assessment of the country's forest resources using satellite data and field information. The first report was published in 1987, and the ISFR 2023 marks the 18th edition.</p><p>The report is published in two volumes:</p><p>Volume-I provides a national-level assessment, covering aspects like forest cover, mangrove cover, forest fires, growing stock, carbon stock, agroforestry, forest characteristics, and decadal changes.</p><p>Volume-II offers detailed information on forest cover and field inventory data for each State/UT, including district and forest division-wise forest cover data.</p><p>Growth in Forest Cover</p><p>The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023 highlights positive growth in Indias forest cover, increasing from 698,712 km in 2013 to 715,343 km in 2023. Fire incidents have also decreased, with 203,544 fire hotspots recorded in 2023-24, down from 223,333 in 2021-22. In line with India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target, the country has achieved a carbon sink of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This represents an additional 2.29 billion tonnes of carbon sink in Forest and Tree Cover since 2005, nearing the target of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. These advancements in forest cover and the reduction in fire incidents highlight India's progress toward sustainable environmental conservation.</p><p>Govt. Schemes and Initiatives to Increase the Forest Cover</p><p>The Forest Survey of India (FSI) has been key in improving forest monitoring through better forest cover mapping, the creation of an upgraded Forest Fire Alert System, and the completion of the first five-year cycle of the National Forest Inventory, which has provided important data on forest growth and carbon stocks. Additionally, the digitization of forest boundaries in 25 States and UTs has significantly improved forest cover assessments. These initiatives, coupled with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change's efforts to expand forest and tree cover and conserve mangroves and wetlands, have greatly contributed to the development of forest cover. Here are some schemes that have supported these advancements:</p><p>National Mission for a Green India (GIM): Launched in February 2014, this mission aims to enhance India's forest cover through protection, restoration, and expansion initiatives via Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs). The program has released Rs. 944.48 crore to 17 States and 1 Union Territory for plantation and eco-restoration efforts.</p><p>Nagar Van Yojana (NVY): Established in 2020, this scheme focuses on developing green spaces in urban and peri-urban areas. The Ministry has approved 546 projects across 31 States/UTs, with Rs. 431.77 crore allocated for the initiative.</p><p>School Nursery Yojana (SNY): Aimed at raising awareness about the importance of plants, this scheme encourages tree planting in schools across India. With an allocation of Rs. 4.80 crore, 743 projects have been sanctioned in 19 States/UTs.</p><p>Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes (MISHTI): This five-year initiative (2023-2028) seeks to restore and promote mangroves along India's coastline, enhancing coastal habitats' sustainability. Rs. 17.96 crore has been allocated to states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Odisha, West Bengal, and U.T. of Puducherry.</p><p>Under the National Coastal Mission, through the \"Conservation and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs\" component, the Ministry has extended financial support to coastal States and Union Territories for the protection and conservation of mangroves. This initiative spans across 9 coastal states and 1 Union Territory, aiming to safeguard these vital ecosystems.</p><p>National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA) for conservation and management of wetlands in the country, on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments</p><p>Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam: Launched by the Prime Minister on 5th June 2024, this campaign encourages citizens to plant trees in honor of mothers, fostering a deep connection between nature and nurturing.</p><p>Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA): This scheme compensates for the loss of forest cover and ecosystem services caused by the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, in line with the Van Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan Adhiniyam, 1980.</p><p>Afforestation Targets under the Twenty-Point Programme: The Ministry sets annual afforestation targets for States/UTs, utilizing a mix of Central Government schemes, State Government plans, and efforts by NGOs, private organizations, and civil society.</p><p>Awareness and Mass Plantation Drives: The Ministry promotes tree planting through events like International Day of Forests, World Environment Day, Van Mahotsav, and Wildlife Week, alongside conferences, workshops, and informational campaigns.</p><p>Indian Forest Management Standard: A part of the National Working Plan Code 2023, this standard establishes criteria and frameworks for monitoring sustainable forest management and supports the Indian Forest and Wood Certification Scheme, particularly benefiting small-scale timber producers.</p><p>National Action Plan on Forest Fire-2018: This plan provides measures to prevent forest fires, build resilience, and enhance community capacity for fire control and prevention.</p><p>Joint Forest Management and Eco Development Committees: In line with the National Forest Policy of 1988, the Ministry has promoted community involvement through Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) for better forest and wildlife protection, ensuring local participation in management and conservation activities.</p><p>Additionally, the conservation of forests, mangroves, and wetlands is ensured through strict enforcement of relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, and Court orders.</p><p>Legal Framework for Forest and Wildlife Protection</p><p>In India, the protection and management of forest and wildlife resources are governed by a strong legal framework designed to ensure conservation and sustainable use. Key laws include the Indian Forest Act, 1927, the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980, and the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, aimed at protecting wildlife species and their habitats, including the creation of protected areas like national parks and sanctuaries. Additionally, State Forest Acts cater to forest management specific to each state, while Tree Preservation Acts and Rules focus on protecting trees in both urban and rural areas.

Through innovative government initiatives and the involvement of local communities, India is not just protecting its natural resources but actively restoring them. With continued commitment and collective action, India is paving the way for a greener, healthier future for all.</p><p>References</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2023\">https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2023</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/PIB_India/status/1870398986433200536\">https://x.com/PIB_India/status/1870398986433200536</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2086742\">https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2086742</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2078356\">https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2078356</url>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2086125\">https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2086125</url>.</p><p>Click here to see in PDF:</p><p>Santosh Kumar/ Sarla Meena/ Kamna Lakaria</p><p>(Release ID: 2088477) Visitor Counter : 36</p><p>Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change</p><p>India's Green Recovery</p><p>Forest and Tree Cover Grows, Fire Incidents Fall</p><p>Posted On: 27 DEC 2024 7:33PM by PIB Delhi</p><p>We are blessed to be a part of a culture where living in complete harmony with the environment is central to our ethos. Let's ensure that even the smallest step we take in our daily lives will be an effort towards conserving nature and natural resources.</p><p>~ Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Forests play a vital role in combating climate change by absorbing carbon, preserving biodiversity, and providing clean air and water. However, growing environmental pressures are challenging these essential ecosystems. In India, though, there is a positive shift. The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023 shows that the country's Forest and Tree cover now spans 827,357 square kilometers, covering 25.17% of the nation's total land area. This includes 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) of forest cover and 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) of tree cover. This progress reflects Indias successful efforts to balance development with environmental conservation.</p><p>ISFR 2023: A Snapshot of Indias Forests</p><p>The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023, published by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), is a biennial assessment of the country's forest resources using satellite data and field information. The first report was published in 1987, and the ISFR 2023 marks the 18th edition.</p><p>The report is published in two volumes:</p><p>Volume-I provides a national-level assessment, covering aspects like forest cover, mangrove cover, forest fires, growing stock, carbon stock, agroforestry, forest characteristics, and decadal changes.</p><p>Volume-II offers detailed information on forest cover and field inventory data for each State/UT, including district and forest division-wise forest cover data.</p><p>Growth in Forest Cover</p><p>The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023 highlights positive growth in Indias forest cover, increasing from 698,712 km in 2013 to 715,343 km in 2023. Fire incidents have also decreased, with 203,544 fire hotspots recorded in 2023-24, down from 223,333 in 2021-22. In line with India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target, the country has achieved a carbon sink of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This represents an additional 2.29 billion tonnes of carbon sink in Forest and Tree Cover since 2005, nearing the target of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. These advancements in forest cover and the reduction in fire incidents highlight India's progress toward sustainable environmental conservation.</p><p>Govt.

The strong winds and dry conditions have been cited as major contributing factors to the widespread weather event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two Syracuse University faculty experts weigh in on the historic natural disaster impacting California this week. Their comments below can be quoted directly. They are also available for interviews.</p><p>********</p><p>Fires burning now cannot be dismissed as anomalous events</p><p>Jacob Bendix</p><p>Jacob Bendix is professor emeritus in the Geography and the Environment Department in Syracuse University's Maxwell School. His research areas include impacts of disturbance (principally fire and floods) on plant communities and media coverage of the environment. He has spoken extensively with journalists about the 2023 Canadian wildfires, California Corral Fire and the Maui wildfires.</p><p>Currently, he is available to answer questions via email.</p><p>Bendix says:</p><p>\"The fires currently devastating multiple neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area serve to remind us of the impact of climate change. The fires are driven by the infamous downslope Santa Ana winds that become hotter and drier as they descend, creating particularly incendiary conditions. These winds are strongest in the winter, but historically by winter there was enough rain to soak fuels and limit wildfires. Thus, Santa Ana-driven fires were usually concentrated in the fall, when the winds had begun but fuels were still dry.</p><p>\"This is where climate change comes in. It is already January, but Southern California remains dry, gripped by drought and high temperatures. Both drought and heat are known to be more likely in the context of human-caused climate change, so the fires burning now cannot be dismissed as anomalous events. We must recognize that such fires are likely to become more common in the future. The news stories each time will fade after a few days or weeks, but the impacts in terms of lost homes and workplaces will last far longer for local residents, and virtually everyone in the region is likely to face escalating insurance costs, or difficulty obtaining insurance at all.\"</p><p>This is the 'new reality' for Southern California communities</p><p>Tripti Bhattacharya</p><p>Tripti Bhattacharya is an associate professor in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department in Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences. Her work focuses on understanding the sensitivity of regional rainfall to global climate change.</p><p>She is available for interviews by phone, web video conferencing or email.</p><p>Bhattacharya says:</p><p>\"It's really devastating to see what is unfolding.</p><p>\"It is a combination of several factors: one is drought, as Southern California has seen very little precipitation this winter, resulting in extremely dry vegetation and soils. On top of that, recent days have seen gusts of dry wind, typically known as 'Santa Ana' winds. These gusts have the ability to cause fire to propagate quickly.</p><p>\"We cannot attribute a single event to human-caused climate change per se, but we do know from peer-reviewed scientific literature that the length of the fire season is increasing. Moreover, state of the art models analyzed in peer reviewed studies have shown that climate change is responsible overall for higher temperatures and drier vegetation, amplifying forest fire activity.</p><p>\"This is the new reality communities in places like Southern California are facing.\"</p><p>To request interviews or get more information:</p><p>Daryl Lovell</p><p>Associate Director of Media Relations</p><p>Division of Communications</p><p>M 315.380.0206</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dalovell@syr.edu\">dalovell@syr.edu</email> | @DarylLovell</p><p>Syracuse University</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.syr.edu/blog/2025/01/08/environmental-experts-weigh-in-on-growing-wildfires-out-west/\">https://news.syr.edu/blog/2025/01/08/environmental-experts-weigh-in-on-growing-wildfires-out-west/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8988015 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8988015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVH-X3B3-RRHS-V53F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"646\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 8, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
