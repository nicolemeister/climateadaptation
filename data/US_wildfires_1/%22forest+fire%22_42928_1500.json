It was July of 2018, and he was traveling to the Greek island of Kos with his friends. Looking out his window during takeoff, he was shocked by the horror below.

Fire seasons are</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tovima.com/climate/greece-readies-for-fire-season-with-record-firefighters/\">longer, and the fires are harder to extinguish. In 2023, Greece experienced the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/wildfires-2023-among-worst-eu-century-2024-04-10_en#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%202023%20saw%20the,and%20caused%20numerous%20human%20casualties.\">largest single wildfire to scorch Europe since 1980.</url></p><p>Fires like these are testing the country's firefighting mechanisms and aging infrastructure. The firefighters managing them are bracing for the worst: They know that this is just the beginning.</p><p>After seeing the blaze in Mati, Papadakis decided to become a firefighter. In 2019, he joined the Volunteer Forest Fire Rescue Team (abbreviated to  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oedd.gr/\">OEDD in Greek), a volunteer station in the Ekali suburb north of Athens. Funding constraints that began with Greece's economic crisis more than a decade ago have left the country reliant on the services of</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/greece-enhances-firefighting-capacity-ahead-of-2025-summer-season/\">roughly 5,000 volunteer firefighters like those at OEDD to help tame these growing fires.</url></p><p>Working alongside state services, these volunteers have become a mainstay of Greece's fire season, but they say they don't have all the resources they need. The local municipality owns the land the station stands on and pays for the water in their trucks, but they rely on donations for most of their equipment.</p><p>At a time when the United States is  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/13/heres-how-trumps-illegal-military-deployment-weakens-firefighting-resources-already-strained-by-his-dangerous-u-s-forest-service-cuts/\">slashing funding for climate mitigation initiatives created by agencies like the US Forest Service-which plays an integral role in US wildfire prevention and response-people are looking for a way forward. Across the ocean, in Greece, the work of the OEDD serves as a valuable model as people take the fight against climate change into their own hands. As the climate crisis worsens around the world, this kind of steadfast dedication and resilient adaptation will prove increasingly vital.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Greece-Flags-img.jpg\">Greek and OEDD flags fly outside the station.(Maggie Stewart)</url></p><p>In 1997, a teenage Phoevos Bartsiokas, a founder of the station, watched a fire scorch his neighborhood while he was out riding his bike. Three years later, he started the OEDD volunteer team, determined to fight back. He gathered up some friends to man a fire truck and water tanker that the municipality owned, but could not staff, he said. It marked the start of OEDD, which was formalized as a nonprofit in 2007.</p><p>Current Issue</p><p>In OEDD's early years, Bartsiokas said the Hellenic Fire Service treated the volunteers as a nuisance rather than a help. In the midst of the financial crisis, however, the state began to rely on them. The closest state-run station is 10 kilometers away. Today, OEDD has six trucks and over 50 active volunteers who spend their days as university students, translators, airport employees, and musical theater singers.</p><p>Papadakis planned to join Greece's professional firefighting service once he turned 18, but when the Hellenic Fire Academy implemented a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://academy.fireservice.gr/en/pages/52/%CE%95%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%B3%CE%AE-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%A6%CE%BF%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7.html\">university-level test for enrollment-requiring nearly perfect scores in writing and math-Papadakis knew his dyslexia would make this impossible.</url></p><p>Now, 24 and an OEDD crew commander, he is responsible for assessing incidents, giving orders, and ensuring the safety of his team. Papadakis has been at the station for six years and is grateful to be a volunteer rather than a professional firefighter. 'The emotional reward to help the people without taking something in return is something amazing,' he said as he sat in one of the station's old fire trucks. 'It's the biggest reward.'</p><p>The quality of the team's equipment does not reflect the magnitude of the threat they are under. Their main truck is a 1985 model from Germany. Its wear is obvious, but so too is the care they have shown it for decades. Across the station lot sits the team's newest and most prized possession, a bright red fire engine they recently bought from Switzerland.</p><p>'It's like you are in the Middle Ages, and suddenly you bought a Ferrari,' Papadakis said with excitement. This Ferrari, however, is from 2005. 'It's our new star,' he said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Equipment-img.jpg\">Papadakis' locker (middle) is left ajar during a shift and surrounded by team equipment.(Maggie Stewart)</url></p><p>Walking around the back of the engine, Papadakis pulled up an iron hatch revealing an operating panel labeled in German. He and his team started translating the labels into Greek, but have struggled to understand the function of each of the dozens of buttons, since the panel of the 40-year-old German truck has only three, all of which they installed themselves.</p><p>Papadakis stepped away from the truck and into the storage container that holds each volunteer's uniform and personal equipment. While on shift, Papadakis's bright red locker is left ajar and half-empty. He leaves most of his gear in the trucks, ready for his next call. He reached in, pulling out a brand-new red-and-yellow wildfire helmet, turning it over in his hands. 'A gift for me. To me,' he said with a proud smile. He saved up and bought it three months ago for (EURO)350. Most of the other gear, provided by the station, was far older.</p><p>Next to the lockers, a row of thick, soot-covered structure fire uniforms purchased from the UK hang on a silver rack. Some are 20 years old. In professional fire departments worldwide, gear is replaced  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ati-fire.com/my/blog/how-often-should-firefighters-replace-their-gear-a-global-perspective-\">every five to 10 years to meet safety standards. Since OEDD volunteers don't get routine gear upgrades, they are reliant on hand-me-downs or left to purchase their own. While a law passed in 2020 requires the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://civilprotection.gov.gr/en\">Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection to provide volunteers with personal protective equipment, the uniforms have not yet arrived.</url></p><p>Regardless of their aging equipment, the team keeps fighting-a testament to their scrappy resilience. On a Sunday evening, sirens filled the air. A fire truck flashed around the corner, and the OEDD team hopped out, sporting mismatched uniform pants and helmets in varying shades of yellow. They rushed to the scene of a two-car crash: one car on its side, two passengers trapped. With their phones aloft, a crowd of spectators pushed up against the safety tape for a better view. One volunteer shouted orders; two more laid out tarps and tools. Metal sizzled as the firefighters sliced through the flipped car's roof with an extrication cutter. They peeled it back and converged with a stretcher.</p><p>They pulled the dummy out and placed it on the ground with care. The crowd erupted in applause. The team posed by the now roof-less car as a photographer emerged from the sea of onlookers.</p><p>It was the station's third consecutive annual Open Day, an event for the team to recognize its supporters and for the community to get to know its station. This year, the team was celebrating its 25th anniversary. Kids in Paw-Patrol T-shirts and face paint ran through the station's lot, toy firetrucks and souvlaki in hand. Friends, family, and neighbors of the station sipped beer as they chatted with the volunteers.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Open-Day-img.jpg\">Community members watch as volunteers simulate a car accident rescue.(Maggie Stewart)</url></p><p>Through years of insufficient state instruction, the OEDD team has developed its own training programs and curricula to involve these types of crucial simulations. The following week, those who hadn't participated in the demonstration would recreate it, training on the same mangled cars left sitting in the lot. They would hold a third training session in a few days: No piece of the equipment they buy goes to waste.</p><p>At 11 pm in July, the OEDD team returned to its station after a long, hot day battling a South Athens wildfire. Some volunteers clustered to debrief, while others trained, or exercised with a volunteer gym trainer in the back corner of the lot. Only four volunteers were on shift, but over 15 people were at the station.</p><p>Bartsiokas looked out at his team and said the thing that makes him proudest is watching 'people evolve' over the years. 'If you look at him, I would never say he's a firefighter,' Bartsiokas laughed, describing Papadakis with a smile. Though he says he looks like 'a geek,' Bartsiokas admires Papadakis's dedication to his training. 'He knows more technical stuff than I do,' Bartsiokas said.</p><p>For Papadakis, pyro-meteorology is a hobby. He studies wildfire behavior and weather patterns in his free time. Fire fighting has taken over many parts of his life, and his Instagram feed is filled with pictures of the fires he has fought.</p><p>In 2018, Bartsiokas was on the ground, fighting the same Mati fire that had inspired Papadakis to join his ranks. 'It's like someone is shouting from hell,' Bartsiokas said, searching for the words to describe the reality of a megafire. A fire that big, he explained, creates a dynamic microclimate that can be extinguished only by running its course. 'What's the strategy? I don't know,' he admitted. 'You can't fight this.'</p><p>Confronted with these unstoppable fires, experts are calling for a shift toward prevention over suppression strategies. 'We need to do things and activities in the forest to prepare them for summer, in order for them to be more resilient,' said Panagiota Maragou, head of Conservation at the Greek Branch of the World Wildlife Fund. The organization recently prepared a legislative proposal calling for forest management and prescribed burns during the off-season to minimize fire risk.</p><p>Still, Bartsiokas dedicates his life to this formidable fight. 'Greece can become a very nice example of people caring about their country and offering their service to the community,' he said.</p><p>The volunteers' resilience and dedication are all the more impressive considering the structural constraints and red tape they face in their efforts to help their fellow citizens and protect their land.</p><p>In 2020, Greece established the National Crisis Management and Risk Response Mechanism to help contend with forest fires and other emergencies. This gave volunteer firefighters the right to help extinguish structure fires and respond to traffic accidents-in addition to their ongoing work fighting wildfires-provided that they received formal training. But five years later, the state still lacks the necessary training infrastructure to fully implement the legislation.</p><p>Even as the Greek government calls on volunteer firefighters to fill essential roles in its wildfire response, volunteers say the state fails to provide the equipment, training, and legal protection they need to do their jobs safely.</p><p>Ten years ago, a car wrecked 100 meters from the OEDD station. The closest Hellenic Fire truck was 25 minutes away, and the paramedics said the trapped passenger would die within five if she wasn't freed. But, legally, OEDD was not allowed to engage.</p><p>Giorgios Dertilis, OEDD's president, called the Hellenic Fire Service and explained the situation. The answering officer asked if Dertilis knew what to do and how to do it. Dertilis said yes, and, because of their long-standing trust and rapport, the officer gave them permission to intervene. Although it was still technically illegal, OEDD felt confident that a direct order from the Hellenic Fire Service would protect them in court.</p><p>On many Greek islands, there is only a volunteer fire station, meaning there is no professional station to give such an order. If a house catches fire or a car crash occurs, volunteers could be sued or incarcerated for any property damage or injuries incurred during their intervention.</p><p>Even some of the articles that have been activated have not been effective. The Civil Protection Ministry has provided volunteer training opportunities-two theoretical workshops and one practical one in five years.</p><p>The station continues to conduct its own training. Some members of the team traveled recently to learn how to fight electrical fires, and last year they hosted Greece's first-ever Hellenic Rescue Days event, bringing together firefighters from around the country to train together-officers from the Hellenic Fire Service came to learn from the volunteers, Dertilis said.</p><p>Because of these bureaucratic delays and severe legal risks, volunteer fire stations across Greece<url normalizedValue=\"https://poeodp.gr/\">came together in 2021 to establish the Panhellenic Federation of Voluntary Forest Protection and Firefighting Organizations.</url></p><p>Dertilis, who also serves as the Federation's Head of Public Relations, says this unified front is essential for putting greater pressure on the ministry to better address the needs of volunteer firefighters and allow for their further involvement in shaping laws that affect them.</p><p>Papadakis feels that these legislative obstacles are representative of how the service that volunteer firefighters provide is undervalued and overlooked. 'We exist and we don't exist,' he said, 'at the same time.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Vehicle-img.jpg\">Volunteers simulate a vehicle rescue.(Maggie Stewart)</url></p><p>Volunteer firefighters are not alone in this struggle. Professional firefighters with the Hellenic Fire Service also face challenges in dealing with insufficient equipment, training, and funding.</p><p>At 22 years old, Evi Mitsiouli serves as a chief for the Hellenic Fire Service after graduating from the Hellenic Fire Academy last year. Shortly after graduation, Mitsouli was sent to the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/firefighters-battle-contain-two-wildfires-near-athens-2024-08-11/\">Varnavas megafire, named for the small village east of Athens which it surrounded. 'I have never seen such a big fire in my life,' she said. For a month straight, Mitsiouli worked 24-hour shifts with intermittent 48-hour breaks. When asked if her studies had prepared her, she responded, 'No, not at all.'</url></p><p>'The Hellenic Fire Academy is just like a university. We have a lot of subjects, and we have no training,' she said.</p><p>Popular</p><p>'swipe left below to view more authors'Swipe \u2192</p><p>Like volunteer stations, professional teams in Greece often fight with outdated equipment. According to Mitsiouli, some volunteer stations in affluent neighborhoods like OEDD use donated funds to build fleets and gear arsenals that surpass those of the state-funded Hellenic service.</p><p>Professional stations, as well as the Greek civilians they serve, have come to rely heavily on the manpower, knowledge, and technical expertise of volunteer firefighters. Phoevos Bartsiokas said that of the 80 fire trucks that responded to the South Athens fire in early July, 25 of them were dispatched from volunteer stations. 'It's a really hard task,' Mitsiouli said. 'We are trying our best, but I think it is not enough.'</p><p>Across the country, thousands of fire crews-paid and unpaid-are doing what they can with what they have. At OEDD, volunteers rally around secondhand trucks, sacrificing their limited free time to risk their lives for their community.</p><p>In the team's command center, a large TV faces couches covered with flame-embossed pillows. Children's drawings of firefighters and thank-you notes from the community are attached to the fridge. At the heart of the room sits their radio system, which, like the team, is active 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>At 5:53 pm on July 2, the intermittent murmurs coming from the radio became urgent shouts. Smoke had been spotted in  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/16/the-new-reality-athens-wildfire-victims-vow-to-adapt-and-stay-put\">Varnavas, the same area near Athens that a megafire scorched last year.</url></p><p>The station snapped into action. Volunteers huddled around the radio and turned up the volume. Joyful smiles became clenched jaws. Some rushed outside, pulling hoses from a truck, as they prepared to respond. Papadakis stayed by the radio in the command center, scrolling through a Facebook group for updates, relaying real-time images and information to his team.</p><p>Ultimately, they got lucky. The fire was contained quickly, and they were never deployed. But such breaks are becoming rare. As fires grow more frequent and intense with each passing summer, calm days like this are the exception. The next day, the team was dispatched to a wildfire near Athens. This time, it took a full day's work to bring it under control.</p><p>In such a stressful, dangerous environment, memories of the people Papadakis has helped keep him motivated. Three years ago, he was called to pick up an old woman in the middle of a rare Athens snowstorm. The streets were shut down, and she was stuck at a dialysis appointment. Papadakis and his colleagues drove her home and carried her up two flights of stairs on their backs to her apartment. 'She thanked us by crying,' he said, offering the team money, which they refused. But already 16 hours into his shift, he felt rested after receiving the woman's hug of gratitude. It is 'one of the best moments that keeps me going,' Papadakis said.</p><p>In this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump.</p><p>We're starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel.</p><p>The Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here?</p><p>At The Nation, we know which side we're on. Every day, we make the case for a more democratic and equal world by championing progressive leaders, lifting up movements fighting for justice, and exposing the oligarchs and corporations profiting at the expense of us all. Our independent journalism informs and empowers progressives across the country and helps bring this politics to new readers ready to join the fight.</p><p>We need your help to continue this work.

According to news reporting originating from Chuncheon, South Korea, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The 1996 Goseong forest fire, the largest recorded, prompted a debate on the potential for natural forest recovery, leading to the designation of a natural restoration research area. This study mainly aimed to demonstrate the forest's natural regenerative ability in a prefire Pinus densiflora forest that had been affected by a stand-replacing fire.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Ministry of Environment. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Kangwon National University: \"To achieve this, the study tracked the key aspects of the succession process, specifically the formation of vertical structure and changes in species composition. The regenerating vegetation initially passed through stages dominated by herbaceous and shrub layers, then differentiated into the canopy layer, eventually forming the early-stage forest after 20 years. Site A had developed into a forest with an average canopy height of 13.3 m and 73% coverage, while Site B was restored with a canopy height of 10 m and 27% coverage. Tree species of the genus Quercus dominated the canopy layer, occupying 99% of the tree basal area (from 17% prefire). Consequently, the prefire pine forest shifted to a Quercus-dominated forest after secondary succession. Pinus densiflora (83% of the prefire basal area) occupied only 1% after 20 years. Oak species became dominant from the initial stages of regeneration, playing a key role in shaping the early-stage forest structure. The species composition of the regenerating stands was already determined in the initial stage and closely resembled that of 20 years later. Since most species regenerated through resprouting, the understory remained dominated by pine forest companion species. Oak-associated species tended to increase in later stages. No invasive species were observed, and annual plants had low abundance.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study demonstrated the natural regenerative power of the forest following the fire, revealing that it takes around 20 years for a prefire pine forest to be restored an early-stage oak-dominated forest. Quercus trees, particularly Quercus variabilis and Quercus mongolica, regenerated rapidly immediately after fire, contributing to the development of the early-stage forest. Although this study was small in scale, it is a rare study conducted at permanent plots over 20 years, revealing the secondary succession process.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fire-induced shift from Pinus to Quercus forests: a twenty-year study following the 1996 Goseong forest fire.

Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn\u2019t been put out.</p><p>Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said \u201cwe can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d He declined further comment on why authorities believe the man they arrested was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing.</p><p>It's forest fire season in the pinelands, a wilderness that encompasses more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon.

Hundreds of miles north, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was battling a blaze in the Wharton State Forest.</p><p>The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles west of Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cVisibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,\u201d the agency said in a social media post.</p><p>A shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina.</p><p>There were three active fires in Polk County, with one spanning 1.9 square miles (5 square kilometers) and another spread over 2.8 square miles (7.3 square kilometers) with no containment by Sunday afternoon. County spokesperson Kellie Cannon said one home was lost to the larger of the two fires.</p><p>A third fire that had burned about 199 acres (81 hectares) with 50% containment had destroyed three homes.

Spot fires ignited fresh flames outside of the original fire area and the steep terrain was making it hard for heavier equipment used to contain fires to reach the area, officials said. Downed timber from Hurricane Helene was exacerbating the situation. Voluntary evacuations of approximately 100 residences remained in effect Sunday afternoon.</p><p>North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September.

The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) as of early Sunday morning and was about 50% contained, according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page.</p><p>Emergency officials said they evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire, but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated.</p><p>The cause of that fire was under investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-f28fcfcf1f8acb5761121024766e138420250324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDB-1TY3-RRRF-624H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"573\"/><timeReceived>3:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 24, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Barcelona, Spain, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, property, and human life, making their early and accurate detection crucial for effective intervention. This study presents a novel, lightweight approach to real-time forest fire detection that is optimized for resource-constrained devices like drones.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya: \"The method integrates multi-task knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from a high-performance DenseNet201 teacher model that was trained on a hierarchically structured wildfire dataset. The dataset comprised primary classes (fire vs. non-fire) and detailed subclasses that account for confounding elements such as smoke, fog, and reflections. The novelty of this approach lies in leveraging knowledge distillation to transfer the deeper insights learned by the DenseNet201 teacher model-specifically, the auxiliary task of recognizing the confounding elements responsible for false positives-into a lightweight student model, enabling it to achieve a similar robustness without the need for complex architectures. Using this distilled knowledge, we trained a MobileNetV3-based student model, which was designed to operate efficiently in real-time while maintaining a low computational overhead. To address the challenge of false positives caused by visually similar non-fire elements, we introduced the Confounding Element Specificity (CES) metric. This novel metric, made possible by the hierarchical structure of the wildfire dataset, is unique in its focus on evaluating how well the model distinguishes actual fires from the confounding elements that typically result in false positives within the negative class.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The proposed approach outperformed the baseline methods-including single-task learning and direct multi-task learning-achieving a primary accuracy of 93.36%, an F1-score of 91.57%, and a higher MES score, demonstrating its enhanced robustness and reliability in diverse environmental conditions. This work bridges the gap between advanced deep learning techniques and practical, scalable solutions for environmental monitoring. Future research will focus on integrating multi-modal data and developing adaptive distillation techniques to further enhance the model's performance in real-time applications.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Real-Time Forest Fire Detection with Lightweight CNN Using Hierarchical Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation.

Hundreds of miles north, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was battling a blaze in the Wharton State Forest. The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles west of Charlotte. </p><p>\"Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,\" the agency said in a social media post. A shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina. There were three active fires in Polk County, with one spanning 1.9 square miles and another spread over 2.8 square miles with no containment by Sunday afternoon. County spokesperson Kellie Cannon said one home was lost to the larger of the two fires. A third fire that had burned about 199 acres with 50 percent containment had destroyed three homes. An earlier evacuation order associated with that fire had been lifted, Cannon said. Additional mandatory evacuations were ordered for areas of Polk County on Sunday evening, according to a North Carolina Emergency Management social media post. The North Carolina Forest Service's online wildfire public viewer indicated active fires Sunday in Burke County and in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster (R) declared a state of emergency Saturday as emergency crews in Pickens County fought the Table Rock Fire in the Blue Ridge Mountains. \"The State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need,\" McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post. That human-caused fire grew to more than 300 acres with no containment, the commission said Sunday. Spot fires ignited fresh flames outside of the original fire area, and the steep terrain was making it hard for heavier equipment used to contain fires to reach the area, officials said. Downed timber from Helene was exacerbating the situation. Voluntary evacuations of approximately 100 residences remained in effect Sunday afternoon. North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Helene in September. The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina. Also over the weekend, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has been battling a wildfire that broke out in the Wharton State Forest on Saturday. The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles as of early Sunday morning and was about 50 percent contained, according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page. Emergency officials said they evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire, but the flames were moving away from them, and no structures had been evacuated. The cause of that fire was under investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000195c8a0d95dabb5e8b9d9470000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FMD-69H3-S4CG-03RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 24, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina.</p><p>Also this weekend, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has been battling a wildfire that broke out in the Wharton State Forest on Saturday. The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) as of early Sunday morning and was about 50% contained, according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page.</p><p>Emergency officials said they evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire, but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated.</p><p>The cause of that fire was under investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-f28fcfcf1f8acb5761121024766e138420250324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDB-1TY3-RRRF-624T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><timeReceived>3:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

According to news originating from Calgary, Canada, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires are increasingly destructive, contributing to significant ecological damage, carbon emissions, and economic losses.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Nserc Discovery Grant; Alberta Innovates \u2018nserc Alliance-alberta Innovates Advance Program' Grant. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Calgary: \"Monitoring these fires promptly and accurately, particularly by delineating fire perimeters, is critical for mitigating their impact. Satellite-based remote sensing, especially using active fire products from VIIRS and MODIS, has proven indispensable for real-time forest fire monitoring. Despite advancements, challenges remain in accurately clustering and delineating fire perimeters in a timely manner, as many existing methods rely on manual processing, resulting in delays. Active fire perimeter (AFP) and Timely Active Fire Progression (TAFP) models were developed which aim to be an automated approach for clustering active fire data points and delineating perimeters. The results demonstrated that the combined dataset achieved the highest matching rate of 85.13% for fire perimeters across all size classes, with a 95.95% clustering accuracy for fires 100 ha. However, the accuracy decreased for smaller fires.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Overall, 1500 m radii with alpha values of 0.1 were found to be the most effective for fire perimeter delineation, particularly when applied at larger radii. The proposed models can play a critical role in improving operational responses by fire management agencies, helping to mitigate the destructive impact of forest fires more effectively.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Active Fire Clustering and Spatiotemporal Dynamic Models for Forest Fire Management.

However, their potential dual roles as symbiotrophs and saprotrophs are still debated. Here, we provide evidence from a series of experiments on the plasticity of symbiotrophic-saprotrophic lifestyles of the ectomycorrhizal fungus <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Piloderma croceum</emphasis> associated with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quercus robur</emphasis> L. Specifically, we find that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> efficiently colonizes deadwood of oak in an experimental system without living oak. Results based on the productions of hydrolytic enzymes and corticrocin as well as the 14C content in deadwood and mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> demonstrate its capability of wood decomposition and assimilation of C from the decomposing wood. Our results also show that in presence of wood pieces colonized by saprotrophic mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>, the roots of oak plants develop true EM symbiosis with Hartig net formation. Collectively, our results indicate a role for mycelium growing in deadwood as an underestimated EM fungus propagule bank, suggesting that deadwood and other decomposing plant material may indirectly influence the productivity of forest ecosystems by contributing to the recruitment of mycorrhizal fungi, thereby enhancing plant nutrient acquisition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Evidence is provided for plasticity between symbiotrophic and saprotrophic lifestyles of the ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungus <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Piloderma croceum</emphasis> associated with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quercus robur</emphasis> L., indicating a role for deadwood as an underestimated EM fungus propagule bank.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM fungi) play a central role in providing trees with important nutrients especially in boreal and temperate but also in some subtropical and tropical forest ecosystems1. The existence and functioning of EM fungal mycelia determine plant growth and productivity in the forest ecosystems and contribute to the large global pool of carbon in soils1,2. The mycelia of EM fungi extend from different individual host tree species and form common mycorrhizal networks in soils, which influence plant nutrient and carbon acquisition at ecosystem level3. These mycelia can act as propagules for EM fungi to colonize seedlings and stimulate forest regeneration3. In areas where mycorrhizal networks are not available or poorly formed, EM fungal spores in soils can be considered an important source of propagules4. EM fungal spores may persist in the soil for decades before colonizing plant roots5. Extramatrical mycelium and spores in soils are thus considered as the major propagule banks of EM fungi3, but it is currently unknown whether EM fungi colonized plant debris could also serve as propagule banks.</p><p>Recent experimental evidence, based on high-throughput sequencing, has demonstrated that deadwood harbors diverse EM fungal communities6, 7\u20138. EM fungi colonize deadwood and use this niche, among others (litter and living roots). EM fungi have evolved on repeated independent occasions among clades of initially humus and wood saprotrophic fungi, so that EM fungal taxa are spread across the classification of Asco- and Basidiomycota, where they still neighbor some saprotrophic sister taxa within clades9,10. EM fungi can compete with saprotrophs in deadwood. Their competitiveness depends on priority effects (or community assembly history), depending on their early arrival to the substrate or the wood decay stage8,11. Although EM fungi can also be detected at early wood decay stages in some temperate and subtropical tree species, they dominate during the late decomposition stages6,8,12. Some EM fungi have been suggested to have proteolytic activity via the secretion of relevant enzymes that support the decomposition of dead biomass13,14. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of EM fungi to degrade complex plant polymers, including cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin15,16. However, the enzymatic machinery for the decomposition of these polymers is strongly reduced in EM fungi15,17,18. Some EM fungi can oxidize organic matter, either by Fenton chemistry, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Paxillus involutus</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Piloderma croceum</emphasis>19, or by using peroxidases, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cortinarius</emphasis> spp.20. It has been suggested that these activities serve to obtain nitrogen from organic sources21. The conservation level of enzymes for plant polymer decomposition is particularly high in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>, whose genome contains 52, 18, and 38 genes related to cellulose/hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin decomposition, respectively17. Such carbon degrading enzyme activities can serve to release glucose and other small carbon compounds and molecules from complex organic sources22,23 which can be utilized by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>. Therefore, decomposing plant materials may promote ectomycorrhizal establishment and propagation of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P croceum</emphasis> in temperate forest ecosystems24. It has been hypothesized to be a potential ectomycorrhizal propagule bank in forest ecosystems6,25. Although some EM fungi might have evolved from either saprotrophic or endophytic fungi, their evolution via saprotrophic fungi has been more common26. Decomposing plant materials including, deadwood and leaf litter are present together or in the vicinity with fine roots in the detritusphere and topsoil24,27. Closely related fungi even within the same genera have evolved differently, by specializing in these substrates17. While saprotroph fungi have evolved toward litter and deadwood materials with increasing/maintaining of plant cell wall degrading enzymes related genes (especially Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes (CAZymes)), many EM fungi displayed reduction of such genes, while maintaining and increasing symbiosis related genes such as sugar transporters, transposable elements (TEs) and small secreted proteins (SSPs)17,28. However, some EM fungi have retained substantial numbers of plant cell-wall degrading genes and have been found to have the ability to decompose plant organic matter17,29,30. Thus, deadwood and leaf litter can be considered as alternative substrates for such EM fungi, in life phases or compartments where they cannot establish ectomycorrhiza6,11,12,31. In forest ecosystem, it is also common that fine root patches of diverse trees colonize decomposing deadwood and leaf litter, from which they obtain nutrients via their EM fungal partners. When EM fungi can survive as saprotroph on decomposing plant materials (especially deadwood), they can increase their potential to find right host plants and to increase the chance of successful colonization6.</p><p>The plasticity of symbiotroph-saprotroph EM fungal lifestyles has been hypothesized for more than a decade32. A study also demonstrated that many saprotrophic fungi are able to colonize fine roots of ectomycorrhizal trees and form either incomplete or complete ectomycorrhizas, indicating the potential for such plasticity29. However, thus far there is no substantial evidence that demonstrates the efficient colonization of deadwood and its components by EM fungi and whether EM fungi-colonizing deadwood can change their lifestyles from saprotrophic to ectomycorrhizal programs. The dual role of EM fungi as a symbiotroph and a saprotroph therefore still under debate33.</p><p>In this study, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Piloderma croceum</emphasis> associated with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quercus robur</emphasis> L. was used to demonstrate the plasticity of symbiotroph-saprotroph lifestyles of EM fungi. The saprotroph lifestyle can be demonstrated by the ability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Piloderma croceum</emphasis> to colonize and decompose dead organic matter from wood. The decomposition products (especially glucose) and nutrients released from dead organic matter have to be incorporated into the mycelium of the fungus. To demonstrate the switch from the saprotroph to the symbiotroph- lifestyle, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> living in the saprotroph stage on dead wood, had to be able to colonize the living roots of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q. robur</emphasis> plants and exhibit a clear symbiotic apposition structure (i.e. Hartig net), as well as a benefits of EM formation, i.e. tree growth stimulation. Therefore, in this current work nine experiments were carried out to test whether (1) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> can colonize a decomposing plant material, deadwood (bark, outer sapwood, inner sapwood, and the complete deadwood) of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quercus robur</emphasis> in the absence of living oak plants (experiments 1 to 4) and (2) such colonized decaying wood can serve as a propagule bank for forming new mycorrhizal symbiosis when faced with roots of living oaks (experiments 5 to 9). Specifically, we aimed to answer four questions. First, could <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> grow and persist on bark and wood substrates (experiment 1)? This would demonstrate the capacity to live or persist when not in symbiosis with roots (but not yet to establish a saprotrophic lifestyle). Second, what was the fungal enzymatic activity in wood colonized by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> (experiment 2)? This would demonstrate that the fungus can release enzymes (as expected) that are capable of decomposing polymers of wood fibers, i.e., that it is truly saprotrophic. Third, was any wood carbon or related products, as measured via all-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis>-tetradeca-2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12-hexaene-l,14-dioic acid (corticrocin) (experiment 3) and carbon isotope (14C) (experiment 4), detectable in vegetative tissue of the fungus? This would further demonstrate that the fungus is capable of decomposition and assimilating carbon and glucose from wood fibers and polymers, i.e., saprotrophic. Fourth, can deadwood be a source of dispersal for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> to establish ectomycorrhizal roots (experiments 5 to 9)? This would show that wood can be a source of inoculants for the fungus, a key tenant of the research.</p><p>Based on plasticity of symbiotroph-saprotroph lifestyles of EM fungi, we hypothesized that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> is able to grow and persist on bark and wood substrates32 (hypothesis 1). We hypothesized that based on its gene repertoire, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> can secrete both hydrolytic (\u03b2-glucosidase) and oxidative enzymes (laccase and peroxidases) that are important for cellulose/hemicellulose and lignin degradation during an exclusive saprotrophic life phase17,18 (hypothesis 2). Furthermore, we expected that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> would produce N-acetyl glucosaminidases and acid phosphatases to acquire N from chitin and organic P. Because of its ability to produce enzymes for C acquisition and lignin degradation/modification, we also hypothesized that the C released from deadwood could be transferred to and assimilated by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> mycelium (hypothesis 3). We expected that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q. robur</emphasis> plants associated with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> originating from deadwood would show the benefit of EM formation34 and their plasticity to outsource C with higher principal root, lateral root, and total root biomass, and stimulate plant growth with higher stem, shoot, and total plant biomass, compared with non-inoculated plants (hypothesis 4).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> efficiently colonized deadwood of oaks in the experimental system without living oak, however, the rate of colonization after 4 months of incubation time varied depending on the substrate (100 in bark, 84.6 in complete wood, 40 in sapwood, and 16.7% in inner sapwood) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 1, experiment 1). This finding answers our first question (hypothesis 1) and demonstrates the capacity of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> to live or persist when not in symbiosis with roots of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q. robur</emphasis>. The earliest colonization of deadwood by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> was observed after 2 weeks to 1 month in the bark and complete wood samples (Figs. 1 and S1). At this stage, white mycelium covered parts of the deadwood near the inoculated areas. After 1\u20132 months, the white mycelium became yellow and extended its development on deadwood (Figs. 1 and S1). After 4 months, the bark and complete wood were covered with massive amounts of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> yellow mycelium, whereas the colonization on sapwood and inner sapwood was moderate. The yellow pigment synthesized by the mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> has been identified as corticrocin, which is formed during colonization of mycorrhizal host roots35. We demonstrate here that the production of the yellow pigment, as indicated by the size of yellow colonies (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) and optical density (OD) 379 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001), was significantly influenced by the available glucose and growth of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> in pure culture (Fig. 2a\u2013c and Supplementary Data 2). Thus, corticrocin production in the mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> colonizing deadwood in MMN 1/10 medium without any other soluble carbohydrate source, but with deadwood substrate, is a good indicator that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> can partly decompose bark and sapwood to acquire organic carbon and glucose, which is consistent with our hypothesis 3. Substantial amount of glucose released from deadwood is required for corticrocin synthesis, thus <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> had to decompose deadwood over 1\u20132 months to reach such level, which also depended on the types of the deadwood materials. Our results show that on fresh bark fastest colonization rates are displayed by a yellow <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> mycelium that produces corticrocin. A recent study demonstrated that for temperate trees, the non-structural carbohydrates (NSC especially sugars and starch) are the most concentrated, in the outermost stem wood36. In contrast, the concentrations of NSC is lower, when the mycelium colonization is progressing deeper toward the pith36. We hypothesize that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> takes advantage from the higher concentration of NSC at the outermost part of the stem (bark and vicinity area) to synthesize the corticrocin using the beta-glucosidase produced. Further studies are needed to confirm what supports <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> growth in the bark, whereby it is documented in literature that the front of mycelium colonies may recycle resources accumulated in their older part37.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saprophytic ability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>.</emphasis></p><p>Saprophytic ability <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> colonization success of different woody materials and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> increase in \u039414C in mycelium (mean \u00b1 SE) of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> that assimilated C from the introduced wood (IM = initial mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>, M = 4-month mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>, MW = 4-month mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> growing near inner sapwood, and W = inner sapwood). \u039414C values of agar media are provided in Table S1.

The results show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> produced significant amounts of hydrolytic enzymes on deadwood (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.007\u20130.009), including \u03b2-glucosidase (588.4 \u00b1 54.7 nmol h\u22121 g dry wood\u22121, mean \u00b1 SE), N-acetylglucosaminidase (717.2 \u00b1 157.5, mean \u00b1 SE), and acid phosphatase (603.7 \u00b1 95.1, mean \u00b1 SE), whereas the activities of oxidative enzymes, including laccase and peroxidase, were undetectable (Table 1). Thus, the glucose available for corticrocin formation was apparently related to \u03b2-glucosidase activity, which enables the hydrolysis of cellulose or hemicellulose from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q. robur</emphasis> bark or sapwood. The found activity of N-acetyl glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase demonstrated that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> was also able to recycle N via chitin degradation from part of its own mycelium, and to acquire phosphorus from the wood substrate. The chitinase activity of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> is directly related to earlier observations of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. involutus</emphasis>. Under C starvation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. involutus</emphasis> uses autolysis with the associated chitinase activity to recycle N and C from its dead fungal mycelium37. The results from enzymatic assays demonstrate that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> can release hydrolytic enzymes that are capable of decomposing wood fibers, i.e., to adopt a saprotrophic lifestyle in deadwood (hypothesis 2). The absence of oxidative enzymes, including laccase and peroxidase observed in this study, may reflect either a limited potential of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> to produce lignin degrading/modifying enzymes17, or a potential not to produce these enzymes as long as more readily available resources are available. Production of oxidative enzymes important for lignin modification/degradation is more energy intensive than for hydrolytic enzymes, and also requires more resources, such as copper and manganese40. These metals are limited in our experimental setup, which contains only deadwood on diluted Modified Melin-Norkrans 1/10 medium.Table 1</p><p>Hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities (mean \u00b1 SE, nmol h\u22121 g dry wood\u22121) on complete oak deadwood with and without (control) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis></p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Enzyme</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Degrading substrates</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Control oak wood</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Oak wood with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Beta-glucosidase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Cellulose/hemicellulose</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.0 \u00b1 0.0a</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">588.4 \u00b1 54.7b</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">N-acetyl glucosaminidase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Chitin</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.4 \u00b1 1.4a</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">717.2 \u00b1 157.5b</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acid phosphatase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Organic phosphate</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.0 \u00b1 0.0a</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">603.7 \u00b1 95.1b</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Laccase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Lignin</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.0 \u00b1 0.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.0 \u00b1 0.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Peroxidase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Lignin</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.0 \u00b1 0.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.0 \u00b1 0.0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Different letters indicated significant differences of enzyme activities between the oak deadwood with and without (control) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> according to Mann\u2013Whitney <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">U</emphasis>-test at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.05 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 5).</p><p>After we introduced the mycelia on deadwood with higher 14C content than on agar, the mycelium 14C content significantly increased from the agar value and initial mycelia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.01), further demonstrating the capability of wood decomposition and assimilation of C from the wood (hypothesis 3) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 1). Taking the common definition of fungal saprotrophs as \u201cfungi that are able to live independently from dead materials and to degrade organic residues contained therein to obtain carbon\u201d41, all the evidence from this series of experiments demonstrates the saprophytic capacity of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> when grown on deadwood as a unique organic substrate. Deadwood can be considered to be more resistant compared to other forms of plant materials such as leaf and fine root litter, as it can persist many years in temperate forest ecosystems12. Obviously, the colonization success of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> on deadwood warrants its long lasting survival apart from symbiotic association. Our finding that bark appears to be preferentially colonized and decomposed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">croceum</emphasis> can be explained by the higher concentration of macronutrients and mineral elements (especially N, Mg, Fe) in bark of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q. robur</emphasis> as compared to sapwood42. Furthermore, the concentration of non-structural carbohydrates, including sugars and starch is also higher in the outermost part of the wood than the inner part of the wood36. Such non-structural carbohydrates, macronutrients and mineral elements are crucial for microbial enzyme production and activities43,44.

Sterile oak wood without <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> was used as the control. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> was detected in the rhizosphere of oak plants after 14 weeks in most inoculation treatments; however, only in the bark (one out of five replicates) and complete deadwood (two out of seven replicates) treatments was yellow mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> visible on the oak roots (Supplementary Data 4 and Fig. S1). The oak plants with visible <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> mycelium on the roots had significantly higher dry biomass of principle root (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.008), lateral roots (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.003), total roots (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.001), stem (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001), shoot (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001), and total plant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) compared to other oak plants, regardless of treatment (hypothesis 4) (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Data 3).

Microscopic observations of root tips surrounded by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> mycelia showed the formation of a Hartig net (Fig. 3g, h), indicating a typical ectomycorrhizal symbiotic interaction. These results show that in presence of wood pieces colonized by saprotrophic mycelium of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis>, the roots of oak plants were not only superficially colonized by yellow mycelium, but also developed true EM symbiosis with Hartig net formation. Although noteworthy because <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. croceum</emphasis> requires a delay and a certain carrying capacity of the plant to form fully differentiated EM with a Hartig net46, this result indicates that the inoculation efficiency provided from the pre-colonized deadwood can urge full EM differentiation.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Role of deadwood as a source of propagule to form mycorrhizal symbiosis on roots of living <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quercus robur</emphasis>.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Root dry weight (mean \u00b1 SE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> plant growth parameters (stem, shoot, and total plant dry weight) (mean \u00b1 SE).

Hundreds of miles north, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was battling a blaze in the Wharton State Forest.</p><p>The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cVisibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,\u201d the agency said in a social media post.</p><p>A shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina.</p><p>There were three active fires in Polk County, with one spanning 1.9 square miles (5 square kilometers) and another spread over 2.8 square miles (7.3 square kilometers) with no containment by Sunday afternoon. County spokesperson Kellie Cannon said one home was lost to the larger of the two fires.</p><p>A third fire that had burned about 199 acres (81 hectares) with 50% containment had destroyed three homes. And earlier evacuation order associated with that fire had been lifted, Cannon said.</p><p>The North Carolina Forest Service's online wildfire public viewer indicated active fires Sunday in Burke County and in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia.</p><p>In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as emergency crews in Pickens County fought the Table Rock Fire in the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p><p>\u201cThe State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need,\u201d McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission.</p><p>Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post.</p><p>That human-caused fire grew to more than 300 acres (121 hectares) with no containment, the commission said Sunday. Spot fires ignited fresh flames outside of the original fire area and the steep terrain was making it hard for heavier equipment used to contain fires to reach the area, officials said. Downed timber from Hurricane Helene was exacerbating the situation. Voluntary evacuations of approximately 100 residences remained in effect Sunday afternoon.</p><p>North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September. The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina.</p><p>Also this weekend, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has been battling a wildfire that broke out in the Wharton State Forest on Saturday. The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) as of early Sunday morning and was about 50% contained, according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page.</p><p>Emergency officials said they evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire, but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated.</p><p>The cause of that fire was under investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-f28fcfcf1f8acb5761121024766e138420250323</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FD4-6433-RTHP-X11Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><timeReceived>10:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>SECTION 5 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>5.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.98% is 0.94 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.23%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.98</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.23</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.25</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 4% is better than the Index average of 1.0%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 4%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.0% is 410.3%.

Confirmation of the beetle's presence in rural Carlton County \u2014 as opposed to population centers where the beetle is usually found \u2014 could indicate the infestation is worse than previously thought.</p><p>\"We find in a rural area that's kind of indicative of its pretty widespread through that area,\" said Mark Abrahamson, plant protection division director for the Department of Agriculture.</p><p>Carlton County now joins neighboring</p><p>Pine,</p><p>Aitkin and southern St. Louis counties in quarantine, which makes it illegal to transfer non-treated firewood and other ash tree byproducts outside the county. The goal is to prevent the beetle's further encroachment on Minnesota's northern forests, which are estimated to be home to 900 million black ash trees, according to estimates by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>The emerald ash borer, native to Asia, was discovered in the United States in 2002 and in Minnesota in 2009. It preys on native ash trees by laying larvae that tunnel under the bark and feed on the tree, eventually killing it. Signs of infestation include more woodpeckers, which feed on emerald ash borer larvae; sprouting from the stump; D-shaped holes; and S-shaped galleries beneath the bark.</p><p>Though emerald ash borers have devastated the ash tree population across the eastern half of the U.S., it has been slow to overwhelm Minnesota. This is partly due to Minnesota's natural advantage over other states: frigid winters. When the temperature drops to 30 below zero for a sustained period, it kills the larvae.</p><p>\"We had held out hope that in northern Minnesota we would see winter continue to kind of hold out emerald ash borer, but we don't often have really cold winter temps these days,\" Abrahamson said.</p><p>The non-native bug will inevitably infest all of Minnesota, according to Abrahamson. Still, he said it is important to continue to slow the spread.</p><p>He stressed the importance of purchasing certified heat-treated firewood, which kills any insects inside it. He said most gas stations sell heat-treated wood, which can be identified with an emblem that reads \"Certified Safe to Move.\"</p><p>Because the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is a sovereign nation, Minnesota does not have the authority to quarantine the reservation. Abrahamson said the state is working collaboratively with the band to prevent further infestation.</p><p>After discovering the beetle last year, the band has since confirmed its presence in three locations in the southern portion of the reservation, according to Madison Bear, an invasive species specialist with the Fond du Lac Resource Management Division.</p><p>\"We haven't found it anywhere else, and we like to keep it that way,\" Bear said.</p><p>To control the spread, the band quarantines areas of the reservation with confirmed emerald ash borer by banning the movement of all ash tree products in and out of the quarantine area from May 1 to Sept. 30, roughly when the beetle takes flight and infests other trees.</p><p>Bear, a member of the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, noted that the black ash tree is culturally significant to the Ojibwe peoples and is used to make lacrosse sticks, cradleboards and ash baskets.</p><p>\"It's super significant,\" Bear said. \"I know a lot of people who make ash baskets that will be affected if we lose all of our ash.\"</p><p>The forests of northern Minnesota lack the biodiversity of the deciduous hardwood forest elsewhere in the state. Where the black ash grows, it often constitutes 90% of the plants, according to Kyle Gill, director of forest stewardship for the University of Minnesota's Cloquet Forestry Center. Because of this, Abrahamson said the Department of Agriculture has dreaded an infestation of the beetle in northern Minnesota.</p><p>\"It is unique, it is important, and it's also super susceptible to emerald ash borer,\" Abrahamson said. \"So, bad combination.\"</p><p>Black ash is especially dominant in wet forests, where it is sometimes considered a keystone species, according to Gill. Because of the tree's ability to draw water, which Gill compares to a straw, the tree is an essential hydrological function of the forest. If the black ash is killed, Gill said the forests where it is dominant could turn into wetland or shrubland.</p><p>\"They're already wet communities, but they can be made even wetter if they don't have that kind of hydrological or just water draw,\" Gill said.</p><p>Because of the black ash's unique niche in lowland hardwood forests, Gill said the ecological ramifications of its eradication are impossible to know fully.</p><p>\"We know that black ash are there,\" Gill said. \"We don't necessarily know all of the fungal species or songbirds or other species that are relying on those just because it's black ash.\"</p><p>Moreover, because the emerald ash borer is targeted and aggressive, Gill said it is difficult to model and predict its broader impacts on the northern forest as opposed to other disruptors like forest fire.</p><p>Still, Gill said that ecosystems are tougher than they are often perceived and have a tendency to rebound. He said the best-case scenario is that another tree will begin serving a similar ecological function without black ash trees. Gill listed trees like balsam poplar, burr oak, tamarack and red maple as possible successors to black ash.</p><p>Gill cited studies conducted at Chippewa National Forest that suggested if the emerald ash borer were to slow its infection of trees, it could allow other trees to establish instead of eviscerating the area and turning it into shrubland or wetland.</p><p>\"My hope would be that maybe as these trees go away, that there's a new tree species that actually might start to thrive, or maybe a couple different ones,\" Gill said.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 The Pine Journal (Cloquet, Minn.).

According to news originating from Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Because of the special geographical location, dry weather, high temperature and dense vegetation in Liangshan, Sichuan, it is easy to cause forest fires, so it is of great significance to use remote sensing data to evaluate forest fires in Liangshan, Sichuan.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Henan University of Technology: \"In this paper, the forest fire in Muli County, Liangshan, Sichuan Province on March 28th, 2020 was evaluated by using Landsat-8 remote sensing data which can be obtained free of charge. The NDVI of the pre-processed remote sensing images before and after the fire was calculated respectively. After the difference was made, the threshold of the classification of fire and non-fire areas was determined according to the maximum inter-class difference threshold method, and then the over-fire areas were extracted, and the interference was eliminated by open operation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"And using the DEM data of the study area, combined with the topography of the study area, the over-fire area is analyzed. The results show that the '3.28' forest fire in Muli County, Sichuan Province, which is studied, belongs to a serious forest fire according to the burned area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Assessment and Analysis in Liangshan, Sichuan Province Based on Remote Sensing.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships.

Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share. In addition, BCE's common share dividend payout policy has been updated to target a dividend payout range of 40% to 55% of free cash flow. In order to allow investors to consider the effects of lease liability repayments on our cash available for dividend payments, we will also going forward be disclosing both free cash flow and free cash flow after payment of lease liabilities13.</p><p>This measure is expected to strengthen the Corporation's balance sheet, while providing enhanced flexibility in the context of economic uncertainty. BCE's Board has declared today a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per common share, payable on July 15, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2025.</p><p>BCE also announced today that the Board has determined to terminate the discounted treasury issuances under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan effective from the July 15, 2025 dividend payment date.

The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in advertising revenue of $6.9 million (14.5%), circulation revenue of $3.2 million (9.7%) and parcel revenue of $0.9 million (7.2%), partially offset by decreases in other revenue of $2.6 million (31.9%). Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, advertising revenue for the quarter increased by 5.2%.</p><p>Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring increased $4.6 million, or 4.6%, for the quarter ended May 31, 2025, relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase relates to increases in distribution and production expense, partially offset by decreases in compensation and other operating expense. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring decreased $6.0 million or 6.1%.</p><p>Operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the quarter was $5.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring is due to an increase in total revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the quarter was $3.2M.</p><p>Net income in the quarter ended May 31, 2025 was $7.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $15.9 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, and an increase in foreign</p><p>currency exchange gains, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, and a decrease in gains on derivative financial instruments.</p><p>Year to Date Operating Results</p><p>Revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $330.3 million as compared to $302.8 million in the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $27.5 million (9.1%). The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in advertising revenue of $19.5 million (13.7%), circulation revenue of $8.7 million (8.9%), parcel revenue of $0.8 million (2.1%), partially offset by decreases in other revenue of $1.5 million (6.2%). Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, advertising revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 increased by 4.2%.</p><p>Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring increased $9.5 million, or 3.2%, for the nine months ended May 31, 2025, relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase relates to increases in distribution, production and other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and newsprint expenses. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring decreased $22.7 million or 7.6%.</p><p>Operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $20.6 million, an increase of $18.0 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring is due to an increase in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $15.1 million.</p><p>Net loss in the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $32.6 million, as compared to a net loss of $46.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net loss was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, net financing expense and an increase in gains on disposal of assets held for sale and other assets, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in gain on derivative financial instruments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/\">https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/</url></p><p>Quebecor Group (TSX: QBR.A)</p><p>The parent company of the Quebecor Group is the Canadian company, Quebecor Inc.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion. On August 12, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d) for the sale of Freedom to Videotron Ltd. (\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.  It will also enable network expansion, bridging the digital divide, and the next-generation wireless and wireline networks that will drive innovation and economic growth.</p><p>As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes and related hearings, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust have agreed to extend the outside date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from July 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which outside date may be further extended to January 31, 2023 at the option of Rogers or Shaw, demonstrating their commitment to completing this transformative combination. The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Due to its unique geographical and climatic conditions, the Liangshan Prefecture region is highly prone to large fires.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"There is an urgent need to study the growth rate of fire-burned areas to fill the research gap in this region. To address this issue, this study uses the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters in the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, constructing a GWO-XGBoost model. Finally, the optimized ensemble model (GWO-XGBoost) is used to create a fire growth rate warning map for the Liangshan Prefecture in Sichuan Province, China, filling the research gap in forest fire studies in this area. This study comprehensively selects factors such as monthly climate, monthly vegetation, terrain, and socio-economic aspects and incorporates monthly reanalysis data from forest fire assessment systems in Canada, the United States, and Australia as features to construct the forest fire dataset. After collinearity tests to filter redundant features and Pearson correlation analysis to explore features related to the burned area growth rate, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to oversample the positive class samples. The GWO algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters in the XGBoost model, constructing the GWO-XGBoost model, which is then compared with XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) models.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Model evaluation results showed that the GWO-XGBoost model, with an AUC value of 0.8927, is the best-performing model. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis method to quantify the contribution of each influencing factor indicates that the Ignition Component (IC) value from the United States National Fire Danger Rating System contributes the most, followed by the average monthly temperature and the population density. The growth rate warning map results indicate that the southern part of the study area is the key fire prevention area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Predicting Forest Fire Area Growth Rate Using an Ensemble Algorithm.

I am Larissa Yocom, the Director of the Utah Forest Restoration Institute and an Associate Professor of Forest Fire Ecology &amp; Management at Utah State University. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss the \"Utah Wildfire Research Institute Act of 2025\" bill, introduced by Representative Kennedy with a companion bill S.457 introduced by Senator Lee. This bill would amend the Southwest Forest Health and Wildfire Prevention Act of 2004 to require the establishment of an additional Southwest Ecological Restoration Institute under the Act in the state of Utah. Currently three institutes exist in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. Passing this bill into law is an important initial step to benefit the people of Utah, as well as our neighboring states, by adding to an existing program with proven results accelerating science-based forest management and reducing wildfire risk.</p><p>Fire plays an essential ecological role in keeping diverse Western forests healthy and has wideranging benefits. For example, aspen trees thrive after fire, and wildlife often seek out recently burned areas. However, early settlers viewed fire as a destructive force that resulted in the waste of valuable timber. For decades, forest managers were remarkably successful in preventing and suppressing fire, while communities expanded into fire-prone areas. Then, about twenty-five years ago, large and destructive megafires suddenly started to become a regular occurrence. At present, we are experiencing more destructive fire, spending more resources on fighting fire, and dealing with other cascading effects such as fire-induced damage to water supplies and rising homeowner insurance costs. Everyone is looking for answers. How can we better manage our forests, keep communities safe, and reduce the risks for millions of Americans who depend on forests for services such as timber, clean air, recreation, hunting, grazing, and water supply?</p><p>In 2004 Congress created the Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes, or SWERI, to serve as the critical connector of science and practice to restore forest health and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Hosted at universities to stay on the cutting edge of research, the SWERI work side by side with managers, policymakers, and communities to ensure that locally relevant science and technology reaches the people who need it most. The SWERI have worked for 20 years to demonstrate that adaptive and active management is an effective tool for improving outcomes. Although there is still plenty of work to do, we have learned a great deal in the last two decades about how to reduce fuels through mechanical thinning of trees and prescribed fire, as well as developed science-based fire response strategies that are safer and more effective. We have learned more about how to engage residents to garner support for active forest 5230 Old Main Hill Logan, UT 84322 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.qcnr.usu.edu\">www.qcnr.usu.edu</url></p><p>management. We have learned about how to support collaboration across boundaries, so that important fire prevention work does not get hung up in the courts. We have learned about how to manage areas that have recently burned, to restore vegetation and prevent erosion into waterways. Much of this learning has been developed and applied on the ground under the leadership of the SWERI, through their place-based monitoring and timely and nimble production of actionable ecological and social science.</p><p>The work of the SWERI is so distinct and impactful that Utah wants a SWERI of their own. In 2024, the Utah state legislature authorized the formation of an institute housed at Utah State University, provided start-up funding, and named it the Utah Forest Restoration Institute. I was named the Director in January of this year. Initial responses in Utah to the formation of the institute have been universally positive, from partners including the state of Utah, the U.S.</p><p>Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management, tribal representatives, non-profits, and policymakers. Everyone acknowledges that we have a fire and forest resilience problem, and we need focused attention on solutions. Utah's mix of forest and woodlands are unique. We have different fire patterns from our neighboring states and our solutions will need to be unique too. Frankly, we are behind many of our neighbors in determining which management tools work best for Utah's forests and woodlands, and how to engage residents and decision makers. Establishing a SWERI in Utah is critical to help us get ahead of the curve before it is too late.</p><p>The benefits of establishing a SWERI in Utah include healthier forests, safer communities, a stronger workforce, and a more informed public. We have been collaborating closely with the other SWERI to ensure that we are additive and complementary to the SWERI program and will enhance their work across the Intermountain West. Federal designation of a SWERI in Utah will need to be followed by sufficient appropriations for the new Utah institute and sustained appropriations for the existing SWERI. Sustained federal funding allows the SWERI to reliably and swiftly respond to the substantial and increasing need for science-based solutions for reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire and sustaining the health and vitality of our forests in the Intermountain West, in alignment with the broader intent of the Southwest Forest Health and Wildfire Prevention Act of 2004.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to address this Subcommittee. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here:</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9314426 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9314426</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2Y-10V3-RT04-M0FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1004\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 19, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Ron Johnson is sounding the alarm about the deficit impact of President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill,' raising the prospect that he will ultimately vote against the president's landmark bill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Johnson released a long-hyped  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/services/files/800B1EC1-4DA0-4C09-8F95-6544A9959AD1\">report on the fiscal impact of President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill Wednesday morning, arguing the legislation would add to the national debt even in high economic growth scenarios and fail to put the country on a path toward shrinking budget deficits. The</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/26/trump-senate-make-changes-big-beautiful-bill/\">fiscal hawk and known</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/06/03/ron-johnson-budget-federal-spending/\">critic of Washington's alleged failure to rein in government spending told reporters Tuesday that he's informed leadership he will vote against the budget package as currently drafted and urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune to not put the bill on the floor before his self-imposed deadline of July 4.</url></p><p>'I hope he [Thune] doesn't, because I really think it'll be voted down,' Johnson told reporters. 'If we do vote down, I don't want anybody to interpret it as a slap in the face of either Leader Thune or President Trump. It's just saying, 'Guys, we need more time.''</p><p>'I want the Senate to take what the good work the House did and make it a much better bill - and that's going to take a little more time,' Johnson added. 'We need to understand the depth of the problem and what it's going to take to dig us out of this enormous debt hole we've dug for ourselves.'</p><p>Though Johnson lauded the House for  <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/06/16/speaker-mike-johnson-big-beautiful-bill-america-first-wins/\">slashing roughly $1.6 trillion over a ten-year period in their budget proposal, he argued the level of spending reduction is not adequate to combat the increase to budget deficits and the national debt.</url></p><p>'It is historic. It's unprecedented how much they are reducing spending in the House bill,' Johnson said. 'Unfortunately, it's just inadequate for the moment.'</p><p>The senatoris pleading with Thune to postpone a vote on the president's landmark bill until he can work with congressional leadership and the White House to formulate a plan to return to pre-pandemic levels of spending. Johnson's report builds on his argument that without firm commitments to return to pre-pandemic spending levels, Congress will never be in the position to balance the budget. Though commitments to dramatically rein in spending have not materialized thus far, Johnson said that everyone continues to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>Johnson has repeatedly qualified his  <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/06/04/ron-johnson-elon-musk-trump-one-big-beautiful-bill/\">opposition to Trump's landmark bill by stating that he wants the president to succeed and is supportive of many of the budget package's provisions, but the Wisconsin Republican says he cannot stomach a multi-trillion increase to the national debt.</url></p><p>'Clearly, the OBBB does not bend the deficit trajectory downward,' the report states regarding the projected growth in average annual deficits from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2034. 'It adds $3 trillion to the cumulative deficit and continues the upward trajectory on the same unsustainable path.'</p><p>The release of Johnson's report comes as the Congressional Budget Office<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61486\">released new analysis Tuesday accounting for the projected growth the House-passed bill would create. The report found that while the economy would grow somewhat faster due to the bill's passage by spurring economic growth by a modest 0.5% on average, the legislation would also add $2.8 trillion to budget deficits over a ten-year period.</url></p><p>The growth in budget deficits expands to more than $3 trillion when accounting for increased government borrowing costs due to rising interest rates.</p><p>'We've got to get out there that we're facing a $21.1 trillion 10-year deficit [FY2025-FY2034] just in the baseline and 24.1 trillion [increase in cumulative ten-year deficit when accounting for House budget proposal] with a CBO score,' Johnson said.</p><p>Johnson told reporters he will be sending the report to his colleagues and expects them to read his analysis. He gently pushed back on Senate GOP leadership and the White House's  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/fact-one-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-spending-fuels-growth/\">claims that the legislation will not contribute to the national debt.</url></p><p>The Wisconsin Republican's report also contained notable criticism of the president's global tariffs, which the administration has largely  <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/09/trump-sends-markets-soaring-with-big-tariff-announcement/\">paused as it seeks to negotiate trade deals with countries across the world. Johnson's report dubbed the president's universal tariffs a 'recessionary risk' and compared it to the 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which many economists attribute to worsening the Great Depression and increasing costs for American consumers.</url></p><p>Though Johnson is likely to face an immense amount of pressure to ultimately back the legislation containing vast swathes of the president's legislative agenda, he has shown no signs of backing down - at least for now.</p><p>'If there's one role I'm playing in this process it's forcing everybody to look at the reality, to look at the forest, and the forest is on fire,' Johnson said. 'You can argue about the twigs and leaves on the forest floor, but I'm forcing everybody to take a step back and look at the forest. It's blazing, and we got to put this forest fire out.'</p><p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

These expected temperatures follow warm temperatures in recent days. Damage from freezing weather now can significantly reduce yields of certain fruits and vegetables that are in the flowering stage.</p><p>The DEP and Department of Agriculture are allowing these steps to protect farmers livelihoods and to ensure that consumers will be able to enjoy an ample supply of Jersey produce later this year.</p><p>The DEP intends to exercise its authority and discretion under the Air Pollution Control Code, N.J.A.C. 7:27, et seq., and other applicable authorities to permit the following procedure for open burning or the use of smudge pots to assist farmers to protect their crops in low temperatures.</p><p>Farmers who believe they will need to conduct open burns and/or use smudge pots must provide notice to the DEPs 24-hour Communications Center at 1-877- WARNDEP (1-877-927-6337).</p><p>Notification to DEP does not require the implementation of either technique but ensures proper procedures are followed should they become necessary.</p><p>If a farmer does not call DEP in advance but uses either technique, the farmer must notify DEP by 9 a.m. the following day. The farmer will be asked which technique was used.</p><p>Farmers must record the incident number provided to them by the Communications Center. The following information is to be provided:</p><p>Name of the individual making the decision to conduct the open burning/use of smudge pots and name of the farm.</p><p>Actual street address of the farm on which either technique will be used (no P.O. Boxes).</p><p>Telephone number of a contact at the farm.</p><p>Predicted temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at the agricultural operation when the technique will be used.</p><p>Wind speed anticipated when the technique will be used.</p><p>Predicted hours of open burning and/or use of smudge pots.</p><p>Materials expected to be burned.</p><p>At the time of the initial call to the Communications Center, farmers will be given an email address and incident number.</p><p>Within two days, they must submit to DEP via this email address the following information:</p><p>The DEP Communications Center incident number.</p><p>Ambient temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) at the time the technique was used.</p><p>Actual wind speed at the orchard at the time the technique was used.</p><p>A statement verifying that all restrictions in the open burning or use of smudge pots were followed.</p><p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and New Jersey Forest Fire Service caution all farmers and agriculture businesses with respect to the use of open burning in high wind velocity conditions. Please take note that farmers are encouraged to utilize smudge pots for warming as necessary during higher wind conditions. Use of open burning when wind velocity is greater than 5 mph is strictly prohibited, may contribute to wildfire risk, and can carry significant penalties.</p><p>Smudge pots must be fueled only with either kerosene or No. 2 fuel oil.</p><p>Open burning can consist only of either the following materials: clean and untreated scrap lumber, felled trees, clippings pruned from trees and shrubs, hedgerows, or firewood. Absolutely no refuse, trade waste, tires or garbage of any type may be added to the authorized open burning material.</p><p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and New Jersey Forest Fire Service caution all farmers and agriculture businesses with respect to the use of open burning in high wind velocity conditions.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships. The initiative aims to strengthen bilateral connections between French and Canadian producers, with a focus on the development of new English-language television series across genres.</p><p>In addition to bringing together experienced producers from Canada and France to strengthen bilateral content collaboration, the CMPA and USPA will discuss the ongoing shared challenges faced by the independent production sectors in their respective countries.</p><p>\u201cUSPA is thrilled with the ongoing international cooperation fostered by its partnership with CMPA in Canada. In the current international context, it is necessary to strengthen the links between our two countries, both operationally and politically,\u201d said Amanda Borghino, Deputy General Delegate of the USPA. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this collaboration and shaping together new paths for transatlantic content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrance has long been a valued production partner for Canada, and we are thrilled to collaborate with USPA on this initiative,\u201d said Reynolds Mastin, President and CEO of the CMPA. \u201cToday, our two countries are leading global efforts to ensure foreign streaming services respect the right of national governments to require equitable contributions to domestic production, and opportunities for local producers to hold and exploit their own intellectual property. This is critical to the success of local independent production sectors, and to safeguarding individual countries\u2019 national cultural sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Participants from Canada:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Amos   Adetuyi, Circle Blue Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Alfons Adetuyi, Inner City Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Kerry Appleyard, Lionsgate Canada  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Eli Campbell, Peacock Alley Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Annette Clarke, Ruby Line Productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Lauren Corber, LoCo Motion Pictures</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   David Cormican, Fun Republic Pictures</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Malachi Ellis, Area V5 Pictures</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sibel Guvenc, Kybele Films Inc.  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Frederick Kroetsch, Catapult Pictures</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michelle Morris, Lily Pictures</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michael Souther, Amaze Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Steven Thibault, Screen Siren Pictures</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Participants from France:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Iris Bucher, Quad Drama (USPA President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Thomas Anargyros, Mediawan Studio France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Isabelle Degeorges, Gaumont Televisions France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Patricia Boutinard Rouelle, Nilaya Productions (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Odile McDonald, Wildcats Productions (USPA Drama college VP)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Arnaud de Cr\u00e9miers, Jour Premier  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sophie Deloche, Ashart\u00e9&amp;Cie  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Nicolas Deprost, What\u2019s up productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Fabrice Est\u00e8ve, Yuzu Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Emmanuel Fran\u00e7ois, Brother Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Corine Janin, Bleu Kobalt  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Betty Johnson, Hababo Studios  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Am\u00e9lie Juan, Morgane Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Jean-Marie Laronze, Monde et media TV  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Gini Lorin, Scriptline  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Tatiana Maksimenko, Hamak (Effervescence group)  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The initiative is presented in collaboration with Telefilm Canada, the Canada Media Fund, CanExport for Associations (Global Affairs), the French Embassy in Canada and the Canadian Embassy in France.</p><p>Source: The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/\">https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/</url></p><p>Canada Media Producers Association</p><p>The Canadian Media Producers Association is Canada\u2019s trade association for independent producers.

Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share. In addition, BCE's common share dividend payout policy has been updated to target a dividend payout range of 40% to 55% of free cash flow. In order to allow investors to consider the effects of lease liability repayments on our cash available for dividend payments, we will also going forward be disclosing both free cash flow and free cash flow after payment of lease liabilities13.</p><p>This measure is expected to strengthen the Corporation's balance sheet, while providing enhanced flexibility in the context of economic uncertainty. BCE's Board has declared today a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per common share, payable on July 15, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2025.</p><p>BCE also announced today that the Board has determined to terminate the discounted treasury issuances under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan effective from the July 15, 2025 dividend payment date.

The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in advertising revenue of $6.9 million (14.5%), circulation revenue of $3.2 million (9.7%) and parcel revenue of $0.9 million (7.2%), partially offset by decreases in other revenue of $2.6 million (31.9%). Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, advertising revenue for the quarter increased by 5.2%.</p><p>Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring increased $4.6 million, or 4.6%, for the quarter ended May 31, 2025, relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase relates to increases in distribution and production expense, partially offset by decreases in compensation and other operating expense. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring decreased $6.0 million or 6.1%.</p><p>Operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the quarter was $5.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring is due to an increase in total revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the quarter was $3.2M.</p><p>Net income in the quarter ended May 31, 2025 was $7.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $15.9 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, and an increase in foreign</p><p>currency exchange gains, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, and a decrease in gains on derivative financial instruments.</p><p>Year to Date Operating Results</p><p>Revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $330.3 million as compared to $302.8 million in the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $27.5 million (9.1%). The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in advertising revenue of $19.5 million (13.7%), circulation revenue of $8.7 million (8.9%), parcel revenue of $0.8 million (2.1%), partially offset by decreases in other revenue of $1.5 million (6.2%). Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, advertising revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 increased by 4.2%.</p><p>Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring increased $9.5 million, or 3.2%, for the nine months ended May 31, 2025, relative to the same period in the prior year.

Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring decreased $22.7 million or 7.6%.</p><p>Operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $20.6 million, an increase of $18.0 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring is due to an increase in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $15.1 million.</p><p>Net loss in the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $32.6 million, as compared to a net loss of $46.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net loss was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, net financing expense and an increase in gains on disposal of assets held for sale and other assets, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in gain on derivative financial instruments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/\">https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/</url></p><p>Quebecor Group (TSX: QBR.A)</p><p>The parent company of the Quebecor Group is the Canadian company, Quebecor Inc.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion. On August 12, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d) for the sale of Freedom to Videotron Ltd. (\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.  It will also enable network expansion, bridging the digital divide, and the next-generation wireless and wireline networks that will drive innovation and economic growth.</p><p>As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes and related hearings, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust have agreed to extend the outside date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from July 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which outside date may be further extended to January 31, 2023 at the option of Rogers or Shaw, demonstrating their commitment to completing this transformative combination. The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

Phase-II of Geo-MGNREGA project monitored changes over three years due to implementation of natural resource management activities in 23 Gram Panchayats (one Gram Panchayat for each state) of MGNREGA.</p><p>Integrated Watershed Management Programme: ISRO/ DOS has implemented Geospatial solution for monitoring of about 86,000 micro-watersheds under the Integrated Watershed Management Programme (PMKSY-WDC 1.0). Under this, more than 18 lakh watershed development interventions are geotagged. Under PMKSY-WDC 2.0, around 1150 projects are assessed through Bhuvan tools employing high resolution satellite data (Cartosat 2S and 3).</p><p>Space based Information Support for Decentralized Planning (SIS-DP): Under two phases of this project, very large scale (1:10,000) country level thematic database on Land Use / Land Cover, Drainage, Settlements, Rail and Road and slope is generated using remote sensing data. Visualisation and analytical tools are deployed on Bhuvan Panchayat geoportal (<url normalizedValue=\"https://bhuvanpanchayat.nrsc.gov.in\">https://bhuvanpanchayat.nrsc.gov.in</url>) to facilitate developmental planning at Panchayat / Village level.</p><p>Rural Road Infrastructure Mapping: The high-resolution satellite data on Bhuvan was used for mapping rural roads under Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana (PMGSY). Database of rural roads is prepared for entire country and PMGSY dashboard is deployed on Bhuvan Web Portal for monitoring the progress by MoRD and State Govt. Officials.</p><p>Under Pradhan MantriAwasYojana - Housing for All (PMAY-HFA) and Gramin project, a geospatial platform on the Bhuvan portal is developed to streamline the implementation of the (PMAY-HFA) initiative. It helps in managing the construction of homes for 78.64 Lakhs beneficiaries, to monitor progress through five distinct stages of construction and releasing funds based on project advancement.</p><p>Under the Disaster Management Support Programme (DMSP) of ISRO/ DoS, ISRO enables the use of space-based inputs for disaster management activities by the respective nodal Ministries/ Departments. Space based inputs are being used in the hazard; vulnerability; risk (HVR) assessment, disaster monitoring, damage assessment, and development of early warning systems for major disasters such as flood, cyclones, landslide, earthquakes and forest fire. Data from Indian Earth Observation satellites such as Resourcesat-2 and 2A, Cartosat-2 Series, Cartosat-3, EOS-04 (RISAT-1A), EOS-06 (Oceansat-3) and INSAT-3DR and 3DS are being used for disaster management support, in addition to the data from various global satellite missions.</p><p>During 2024, major floods were monitored using satellite data and about 300 flood inundation maps were provided to various State and Central disaster management agencies. As part of the National Hydrology Project (NHP), ISRO developed spatial flood early warning system for Godavari and Tapi Rivers. Flood alerts were disseminated through Bhuvan-NHP and NDEM Geoportals, and also to AP State Disaster Management Authority, with 2- day lead time and 85% accuracy. Very High Resolution data from Indias RISAT satellite was used for assessing the extent of the Wayanad (Kerala) landslide in July 2024. In the year 2024, tropical cyclones Remal, Asna, Dana and Fengal were monitored with INSAT-3DR, INSAT-3DS and Oceansat-3 data. Active forest fires were detected using satellite data daily 6 to 8 times during the Indian forest fire season in 2024 and the activity is ongoing for the fire season in 2025.</p><p>This information was given by Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, MoS PMO, Department of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Space and Department of Atomic Energy, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127062017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGJ-2WD3-RV7P-F10P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 3, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

India reported a consistent increase in forest and tree cover, now encompassing 25.17% of its geographical area as per the latest India State of Forest Report as a result of key national initiatives like the restoration of land under the Aravalli Green Wall, a 7.86% increase in mangrove cover over the past decade, afforestation of over 1.55 lakh hectares under the Green India Mission, and plantation of 1.4 billion seedlings under the Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam (Plant4Mother) campaign.</p><p>A key moment of Indias participation was the invitation to all UN Member States to join the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA)a global platform launched by India to support conservation of the seven big cat species through joint research, knowledge exchange, and capacity-building.</p><p>The Indian delegation called for global action on the outcomes of the Country-Led Initiative (CLI) hosted by India in Dehradun in October 2023, which focused on forest fire management and forest certification. India also acknowledged and appreciated CLI efforts led by the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, and Austria, and emphasized the importance of integrating CLI outcomes into formal global mechanisms to support priority forestry issues.</p><p>India also hosted a side event on Restoring Degraded Forest Landscapes: Indias Approach to Sustainable Forest Management and Climate Resilience. The event showcased Indias experience with integrated forest restoration through policy innovation, convergence of resources, active community engagement, and use of technology for monitoring and evaluation. Key achievements and contributions toward global forest goals were presented during the session.</p><p>Further, India joined a high-level panel on Valuing Forest Ecosystems in National Policy and Strategy, where the delegation shared findings from pilot studies in Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, and tiger reserves. These studies quantified ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water provisioning, and biodiversity conservation using frameworks such as the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA). While acknowledging challenges in valuing non-market services, India emphasized the need to integrate ecosystem valuation into national planning for informed forest governance and long-term ecological sustainability.</p><p>The Indian delegation to UNFF20 was led by Shri Sushil Kumar Awasthi, Director General of Forests and Special Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127131937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FS7-1C83-RRSM-K403-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 9, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The New Jersey Forest Fire Service responded around 2:15 p.m. to the Warren Grove Air to Ground Range in Ocean County, where weapons testing had been scheduled for late Tuesday morning. </p><p>It wasn't immediately clear whether the testing had taken place or, if it did, played a role in the fire. The blaze had burned roughly 150 acres by late Tuesday afternoon, and the fire service said crews were burning brush ahead of the blaze to prevent its spread. No further details were available. The range covers 9,400 acres and 60 miles of airspace, according to the New Jersey National Guard. It's used for a variety of military exercises, including weapons delivery practice for helicopters and other aircraft teams, laser training, and gunnery and munitions drills. The range, which is secluded from roads by dense forests, is 34 miles south of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, one of the largest military facilities in New Jersey. It also was the scene of a 2007 fire that burned 17,000 acres and led to the evacuation of thousands of residents. That fire, which was touched off when a pilot dropped a flare into the range during a training exercise, destroyed four homes and damaged about 50 others.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000190c11bdd41afb9e99feaad0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CR3-GCF1-DY7N-F1X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"232\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 17, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties.

By late Wednesday night, it had grown to 13,250 acres and was about 50% contained, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Heavy smoke from the fire is now expected to affect the air quality in and around the Big Apple, forecasters said.</p><p>According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the Air Quality Index for the area reached unhealthy levels on Thursday.</p><p>Ranging from 0 to 500, the AQI is used to measure air pollution levels and to alert the public when pollutant levels may make the air hazardous to health.</p><p>When levels are between 101 and 150, air is considered \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\"</p><p>In a Thursday morning update, health officials warned that the AQI for fine particulate matter in the New York City metro area (the five boroughs, Rockland and Westchester counties), as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island, was expected to fall within that unhealthy range.</p><p>Particulate matter is defined as a mixture of solid particles and liquids in the air that, when inhaled, could potentially lead to \"serious health problems like difficulty breathing, heart and lung damage.\" </p><p>While the general public is less likely to be affected by such levels, individuals in \"sensitive groups\" are urged to avoid strenuous outdoor physical activities and watch for symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath.</p><p>Sensitive groups include children and teens, older adults, pregnant individuals, people with preexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease, individuals in disadvantaged communities, as well as anyone who exercises or works outdoors.</p><p>The advisory would remain in effect through midnight on Thursday, officials said. Air quality appeared to improve later in the afternoon falling within the moderate range.</p><p>The Jones Road blaze may \"end up being the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years, according to state Commissioner of Environmental Protection Shawn LaTourette.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYNWS-UniqueID227636932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYOR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN5-W803-RSFF-61JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 New York Daily News Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</copyright><publicationName>New York Daily News</publicationName><edition>1STAR Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Billhimer and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette said Thursday morning in a joint statement posted to Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blaze - which was 50% contained as of late Thursday afternoon - could become New Jersey's largest since 2007, when a 17,000-acre wildfire burned in the same general area, LaTourette told reporters at a Wednesday night news conference.</p><p>The fire started about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday, when a Cedar Bridge Fire Tower spotter noticed plumes of smoke in Ocean Township near Jones and Bryant Roads. Upon arrival, the statement said, emergency crews observed a fire inside the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust's Forked River Mountains Wilderness Area, a preserve known for birding and biking.</p><p>Since then, the fire has snaked through the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area to the wilderness of the Pinelands, prompting acting Gov. Tahesha Way to declare a state of emergency. More than 5,000 people in neighboring Lacey and Ocean Townships were also ordered to evacuate Tuesday night, but have since returned home.</p><p>No injuries have been reported. Several vehicles and one commercial building had been destroyed by the flames as of Thursday afternoon, when wafting smoke triggered air quality warnings for Atlantic City and the New York City metropolitan area. Officials advised people in those areas with heart or lung conditions to limit outdoor activities.</p><p>Kling allegedly set several wooden pallets on fire Tuesday morning, the statement said, and left them there to burn unattended.</p><p>A police affidavit obtained by The Inquirer alleges that Kling \"did purposely start a fire with the purpose of destroying or damaging any forest, specifically by lighting a bonfire off Jones Road in Waretown N.J. and leaving it unattended causing a wildfire.\"</p><p>At a late-afternoon news conference, Billhimer, the Ocean County prosecutor, when asked to clarify if he was saying Kling intended to start a wildfire, replied: \"I didn't say he intentionally set it to be a wildfire. I said we're confident he intentionally set a fire.\"</p><p>Kling was taken into police custody Wednesday, according to the statement. During a brief court appearance Thursday via Zoom before Ocean County Judge James Gluck, Kling looked solemn, staring at the floor or nervously fidgeting with his hair. Gluck ruled that Kling will be detained at the Ocean County Jail until a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>Kling had been arrested in January on charges of misdemeanor assault and endangering an injured person alongside six other men and one teenager in connection with a fight that occurred near the site of Lacey Materials. A hearing in that case is scheduled for May 12.</p><p>\"This is the worst fire in the history of our township,\" Peter Curatolo, mayor of Lacey Township, previously told The Inquirer. \"I know our residents were terrified.\"</p><p>On the tree-lined street in Waretown where Kling's family resides, ashes floated across the gravel and stone front yards, smudging black on the front steps. Kling's family did not answer when a reporter knocked on the door of their one-story home on Letts Landing Road.</p><p>High temps and steady winds fan the flames</p><p>The wildfire threatened eight unspecified structures as of Thursday afternoon, according to an X post from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, but roads have begun to reopen.</p><p>Wells Mill Road in Waretown had reopened just before 5 a.m. Thursday, while the heavily used Garden State Parkway and Route 9 reopened Wednesday night.</p><p>Experts, however, say the fire still could spread further.</p><p>During Wednesday night's news conference, LaTourette said that the blaze's growth was \"influenced\" by drought conditions from last summer that have lingered into peak wildfire season. The weather is favorable for fires: low humidity, high temperatures, and steady winds.</p><p>Thursday had been expected to be especially bad for fire-containment efforts, according to Ray Martin, a lead meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, with temperatures potentially reaching 80 degrees as wind speeds hovered between 35 and 45 mph.</p><p>\"We do expect additional spread today, but no raging infernos,\" Martin said earlier in the day. \"It's not likely the fire would break the containment\" area.</p><p>About 1,320 buildings were threatened when the fire broke out Tuesday. That number had dropped to 20 by Wednesday night. LaTourette said he was \"hopeful\" that the fire would remain away from people, \"but I'm not going to tell you there's no chance because wildfires are risky.\"</p><p>\"There's a lot of work to do,\" LaTourette told reporters. \"We've truly averted a major disaster.\"</p><p>While humidity will tick up Friday, Martin said that Saturday's forecast showers could put a \"real dent\" in the fire even if they don't necessarily extinguish it.</p><p>\"It probably needs a really good soaking to really shut it down, and we're not sure we're going to get that Saturday,\" Martin said. \"It could smolder for weeks.\"</p><p>New Jersey has had a busy wildfire season, charting 662 fires and over 16,500 acres burned. That is 52 times more acreage burned than a year ago, New Jersey Forest Fire Service chief Bill Donnelly said, when 310 wildfires caused 315 acres' worth of damage this time last year.</p><p>           Staff writers Ryan W.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>Press Release article 10 of 11, Source: WEC, 76 words </p><p>November 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 48.4 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 25.3:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 48.4 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 25.3 and market average of 23.9.</p><p>6.1 Rank in the bottom 11% by Relative Valuation in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price/Earnings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 11%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings Yield %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 10%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>6.2 Rank in the bottom 24% by Price Performance in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PV1000 [1 yr] $</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">903</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 24%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Rel Strength 6 mo</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 14%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>6.3 Downtrend</p><p>Price/Moving Average Price of 0.92:</p><p>- The Price/MAP 200 for Weyerhaeuser is 0.92.

Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience.

LaTourette said Thursday morning in a joint statement posted to Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blaze - which was 50% contained as of late Thursday afternoon - could become New Jersey's largest since 2007, when a 17,000-acre wildfire burned in the same general area, LaTourette told reporters at a Wednesday night news conference.</p><p>The fire started about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday, when a Cedar Bridge Fire Tower spotter noticed plumes of smoke in Ocean Township near Jones and Bryant Roads. Upon arrival, the statement said, emergency crews observed a fire inside the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust's Forked River Mountains Wilderness Area, a preserve known for birding and biking.</p><p>Since then, the fire has snaked through the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area to the wilderness of the Pinelands, prompting acting Gov. Tahesha Way to declare a state of emergency. More than 5,000 people in neighboring Lacey and Ocean Townships were also ordered to evacuate Tuesday night, but have since returned home.</p><p>No injuries have been reported. Several vehicles and one commercial building had been destroyed by the flames as of Thursday afternoon, when wafting smoke triggered air quality warnings for Atlantic City and the New York City metropolitan area. Officials advised people in those areas with heart or lung conditions to limit outdoor activities.</p><p>Kling allegedly set several wooden pallets on fire Tuesday morning, the statement said, and left them there to burn unattended.</p><p>A police affidavit obtained by The Inquirer alleges that Kling \"did purposely start a fire with the purpose of destroying or damaging any forest, specifically by lighting a bonfire off Jones Road in Waretown N.J. and leaving it unattended causing a wildfire.\"</p><p>At a late-afternoon news conference, Billhimer, the Ocean County prosecutor, when asked to clarify if he was saying Kling intended to start a wildfire, replied: \"I didn't say he intentionally set it to be a wildfire. I said we're confident he intentionally set a fire.\"</p><p>Kling was taken into police custody Wednesday, according to the statement. During a brief court appearance Thursday via Zoom before Ocean County Judge James Gluck, Kling looked solemn, staring at the floor or nervously fidgeting with his hair. Gluck ruled that Kling will be detained at the Ocean County Jail until a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>Kling had been arrested in January on charges of misdemeanor assault and endangering an injured person alongside six other men and one teenager in connection with a fight that occurred near the site of Lacey Materials. A hearing in that case is scheduled for May 12.</p><p>\"This is the worst fire in the history of our township,\" Peter Curatolo, mayor of Lacey Township, previously told The Inquirer. \"I know our residents were terrified.\"</p><p>On the tree-lined street in Waretown where Kling's family resides, ashes floated across the gravel and stone front yards, smudging black on the front steps. Kling's family did not answer when a reporter knocked on the door of their one-story home on Letts Landing Road.</p><p>High temps and steady winds fan the flames</p><p>The wildfire threatened eight unspecified structures as of Thursday afternoon, according to an X post from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, but roads have begun to reopen.</p><p>Wells Mill Road in Waretown had reopened just before 5 a.m. Thursday, while the heavily used Garden State Parkway and Route 9 reopened Wednesday night.</p><p>Experts, however, say the fire still could spread further.</p><p>During Wednesday night's news conference, LaTourette said that the blaze's growth was \"influenced\" by drought conditions from last summer that have lingered into peak wildfire season. The weather is favorable for fires: low humidity, high temperatures, and steady winds.</p><p>Thursday had been expected to be especially bad for fire-containment efforts, according to Ray Martin, a lead meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, with temperatures potentially reaching 80 degrees as wind speeds hovered between 35 and 45 mph.</p><p>\"We do expect additional spread today, but no raging infernos,\" Martin said earlier in the day. \"It's not likely the fire would break the containment\" area.</p><p>About 1,320 buildings were threatened when the fire broke out Tuesday. That number had dropped to 20 by Wednesday night. LaTourette said he was \"hopeful\" that the fire would remain away from people, \"but I'm not going to tell you there's no chance because wildfires are risky.\"</p><p>\"There's a lot of work to do,\" LaTourette told reporters. \"We've truly averted a major disaster.\"</p><p>While humidity will tick up Friday, Martin said that Saturday's forecast showers could put a \"real dent\" in the fire even if they don't necessarily extinguish it.</p><p>\"It probably needs a really good soaking to really shut it down, and we're not sure we're going to get that Saturday,\" Martin said. \"It could smolder for weeks.\"</p><p>New Jersey has had a busy wildfire season, charting 662 fires and over 16,500 acres burned. That is 52 times more acreage burned than a year ago, New Jersey Forest Fire Service chief Bill Donnelly said, when 310 wildfires caused 315 acres' worth of damage this time last year.</p><p>           Staff writers Ryan W.

Humans.</p><p>\"Spruce budworm's largest impact, in my opinion, is that it can help perpetuate dense stands of balsam fir on the landscape that are fire prone,\" said Mike Reinikainen, a silviculture program consultant with the state's Department of Natural Resources' forestry division.</p><p>Much of the area was infected by spruce budworms, whose infestations worsened the Greenwood fire near Isabella, Minn., in 2021.</p><p>What is a spruce budworm?</p><p>The spruce budworm is a forest caterpillar that feeds on tree leaves until they are able to transform into a moth. Those moths lay about 10 egg masses, which can hold more than one budworm, before dying within a year. The worms are a crucial food source for predators like the Cape May warbler and purple finch, and they often drop balsam fir seedlings that help repopulate forests.</p><p>After they hatch, spruce budworms larvae can defoliate mature trees like balsam fir and spruce until they are killed.</p><p>Humans' work to suppress fires may have also exacerbated the budworms' growth, according to the DNR's 2024 Forest Health Annual Report. Stopping natural fires allows fir and spruce forests to grow older and denser, which means more food for budworms.</p><p>\"When there's a forest fire that's starting on the ground, say on the grass, the fire can move up into the canopy of the woods via balsam fir, kind of like it's climbing up a ladder,\" said Sarah Waddle, an educator for the University of Minnesota Extension program. \"And there's a lot more balsam fir in the woods than there would have been presettlement of this region.\"</p><p>Now fires are happening on larger scales than what might have occurred if they were allowed to happen more naturally.</p><p>Spruce budworm populations rise and fall in the state every 25 to 40 years, but their outbreaks can last up to a decade.</p><p>Observers have tracked budworm activity every year in Minnesota since 1954, but Waddle said the bugs have been native to Minnesota for \"many hundreds, thousands of years.\"</p><p>Data from the DNR suggests the current outbreak began in about 2020.</p><p>Where are they?</p><p>Spruce budworm outbreaks have been reported in Lake, Cook and St. Louis counties. The insects infected more than 700,000 acres of forest last year, marking the largest impact recorded since 1961.</p><p>\"Over 90% of spruce budworm damage in the last 24 years has occurred in these counties,\" Reinikainen said.</p><p>So what can people do?</p><p>Waddle advised people with infected trees to cut them down. Doing so helps the wood decompose and can become shelter for animals.</p><p>Plant trees besides the balsam fir to diversify what plants they can go after. And for professional help, contact your local soil and water conservation district or DNR stewardship forester.</p><p>Tim Harlow and Jana Hollingsworth of the Minnesota Star Tribune contributed to this story.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kyeland.jackson@startribune.com\">kyeland.jackson@startribune.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN78282613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FTM-00G3-S8BT-D2MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 15, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FIRE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INSECT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000038</classCode><className>AGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000094</classCode><className>ANNUAL REPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting out of National University by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are the main threat to ecosystems and human life.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National University: \"The frequency, seasonality, extent and severity of fires affect ecosystems and the physical and chemical properties of the soil by direct (heating) and indirect (ash) effects. This could affect biodiversity and forest residency in the face of climate change. In this study, we evaluated the impact of fire severity on soil physical and chemical properties caused by forest fires in a high Andean area of Peru. For this purpose, the severity levels, the degree of hydrophobicity, and the physical and chemical properties of the soil were analyzed by sampling in affected areas (Pinus radiata D. Don plantation and shrubland) and unaffected areas. The results showed a very low severity in soil components, with a strong hydrophobicity, more persistent in the forest plantation area than in the shrubland.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The physical properties of the soil did not show variations; however, in the Pinus plantations they showed variations in their chemical properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, nitrogen and cation exchange capacity compared to areas not affected by the forest fires. Likewise, in the study area an adequate regeneration process was evidenced; in fact, it is important to apply mechanisms to accelerate the restoration of the vegetation cover and the physical and chemical quality of the vegetation.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Impact of forest fire severity on soil physical and chemical properties in pine and scrub forests in high Andean zones of Peru.

The Republicans have decided that the best avenue to generate revenue that they can then give in tax breaks to wealthy people is to eliminate health insurance coverage for 16 million Americans. That's going to have a dramatic impact on their lives... The notion of losing your health insurance leaves you as vulnerable as possible in some of the most important moments of your life. And that they would consider this provision--to eliminate health insurance coverage for 16 million families--is unimaginable and cruel.\"</p><p>Durbin continued, \"Let's not act like there is a unified Republican front on this issue. Even some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want to be here at this moment jamming this unpopular bill through this chamber under arbitrary deadlines... Behind closed doors, my Republican colleagues continued to be consumed with infighting, bickering over the bill's substance--and for good reason.\"</p><p>Durbin outlined how the Senate Republican bill cripples one of the main ways that states fund their Medicaid programs and keep hospitals afloat, especially in rural and low-income areas--the provider tax.</p><p>Earlier this week, a Republican Senator circulated a flyer to his fellow caucus members detailing just how much each state will lose in Medicaid provider tax funding under their proposal. It said: Iowa would lose $4.1 billion; Missouri would lose $6.1 billion; Kentucky would lose $12 billion; Louisiana would lose $20 billion; North Carolina would lose $38.9 billion dollars.</p><p>\"This list of states and what they will lose was passed around by a Republican Senator to his own caucus. They know what they are up against here,\" Durbin said. \"If Republicans have their way and pass this bill, hospitals will be forced to shrink or eliminate services... doctors and nurses will leave, and--in some cases--the hospital will close.\"</p><p>Durbin continued, \"As it stands today, half of the rural hospitals around the country already operate in the danger zone... If Republicans have their way, we are going to see massive layoffs--fewer nurses, technicians, and doctors--along with decreasing quality of care.\"</p><p>The American Hospital Association estimated how these cuts to Medicaid could impact not just the jobs at these red-state hospitals, but jobs across the entire state economy. Here's what they found: Maine could lose nearly 5,000 jobs. Kansas could lose 6,200 jobs. Iowa could lose nearly 11,000 jobs. And Missouri could lose 26,600 jobs.</p><p>Durbin then discussed the so-called \"rural hospital fund\" Senate Republicans concocted, which is designed to mask the harms of their own Medicaid cuts.</p><p>\"They [Republicans] came up with a rescue fund to solve the political problem... [the] overall cut in Medicaid now is about a trillion dollars. $1 trillion... Cutting Medicaid nationwide a trillion dollars. And the rescue plan for the small hospitals that are in danger, the ones I've talked about, a trillion dollars cut, how big is the rescue plan? 25 billion dollars. Do the math. It's a joke,\" Durbin said. \"If Republican leaders think this is an adequate amount to alleviate the pains all of our nation's rural hospitals are going to feel, then that's like trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose. This simply won't work.\"</p><p>Durbin concluded by highlighting how congressional Democrats worked in a bipartisan manner to craft the Affordable Care Act, which has allowed more than 40 million Americans to gain health insurance coverage and led to a historic decline in our nation's uninsured rate.</p><p>\"I want to conclude by saying this: we passed the Affordable Care Act 15 years ago. Of all the things that I've worked on in Congress, I think it had more positive impact to help the families across America than anything. We found a way to make health insurance more affordable for families, 15 years ago. And to do it, we held hearings--[Senate Democrats] [held] 100 hearings on the Affordable Care Act, roundtables, [and] walkthroughs. Two Committees spent a combined 21 days holding markups so that everyone could offer an amendment. Do you know how many amendments were made to the Obamacare program? 400 votes in Committee and on the Floor on amendments. 147 Republican amendments were included, though not a single Republican Senator ended up supporting Obamacare,\" Durbin said. \"At the end of the day, that legislation, Obamacare, allowed more than 40 million Americans to gain health insurance.\"</p><p>Durbin continued, \"Today, how many hearings have we had on this bill before us, this dramatic, multitrillion dollar bill? None, zero, not a single one. Zero markups for Senators to offer amendments. 400 amendments on Obamacare. None on this one, until it comes to the Floor today. Zero bipartisan input. Our friends on the Republican side have said basically, 'It's a big deal. Take it or leave it.' Should this bill become a law, do you know what it will have done? Thrown 16 million Americans off health insurance and closed many vulnerable, small hospitals all to pay fortax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. Maybe some of my Republican [colleagues] are okay with that. I don't think the American people are.\"</p><p>Durbin concluded, \"I'm hoping that sanity and commonsense prevail. We need four [Republican] Senators to step up and say stop this train. We've got to sit down and do our homework. We cannot expose the American families and the American economy to do this in the name of preserving tax breaks for the wealthiest people. Elon Musk seems to be doing okay in life, right? The wealthiest man in the world. Do you know what the tax break is for Elon Musk on the bill that is before us on the floor? $346,000. A lot of money. To him, he won't even notice it. Giving him a tax break he won't notice and taking away from health insurance from families who will be devastated, 16 million around the country.

My name is Miriam Turk. I have the honor of being co founder and CEO of clearblue Technologies. I'm joined today by our wonderful CFO Farooq Anwar and our lead in marketing Jonathan Vanderveen. Today we're going to be going over the earnings for Q2 and also talk about clear blue tier 2.0 which is the transition we've made from the last few years and is really building up strength and momentum for us to have a very strong growth path going forward. We're going to be recording this presentation so that people can download it and listen to it afterwards.</p><p>And I would please encourage you to ask all questions that you would like to talk about today. Farouk and I are at your disposal to answer any of those questions. As always, please be aware of forward looking statements with any public company. We do the best to give you the information we can, but as we all know, markets can change. Third party external factors can change at any time. So please take that under advisement when you're considering the information. So just want to talk a little bit about where the company is and where we're going from an investor perspective and from a company perspective and thought I would start off a little bit on what the company is all about.</p><p>So the market we're going after is the energy industry. And energy has become something that is now a very big channel, a challenge across the world. The world needs smart off grid because the grid is becoming more challenging in terms of its reliability and it's not able to handle the capacity that we all need. Whether we're in emerging markets like Africa or whether you're anywhere across North America, a reliable grid able to handle the capacity of the needs is very difficult. So the solution requires cost effective alternatives and integration with renewables. As a company we have a grand vision and that's to become the world's largest virtual renewable power utility.</p><p>Every single system we sell and deploy all over the world and we have many of them deployed and lots of them online and connected. We manage and control and operate on behalf of our customers. And so we are today already the world leader in delivering clean, managed, wireless power to meet the global need for reliable, low cost energy, for mission critical infrastructure. There's lots of people who've deployed technology and systems, but remotely managing, controlling them, operating them and integrated with renewable energy. As a reliable component of the business is key capability that Clearblue has. So we've entered the phase of Clearblue 2.0 and in order to do that we've done a number of things over the last few years.</p><p>We had a challenging few years starting with COVID and through all of the iterations since then where the company became heavily burdened with debt because of challenges in our market from a sales perspective and in the investor investment market for small cap companies. As a result of that and additional third party factors, we were hit a point where we needed to recapitalize and recalibrate the company. We have now completed that and we have emerged as a much more cost efficient cost structure. At the same time we were making lemonade out of lemons and making sure that we invested in growing our products and growing our channels.</p><p>And that has resulted in new partnerships to drive growth. There are three key market pillars that we are focused on. The first is in the emerging markets, specifically Africa. Taking cellular telecom infrastructure and moving it towards a renewable energy driven infrastructure that's basically consuming zero diesel. Today it's almost 100% diesel and we are on the R to zero diesel with our customers in getting off of that high cost, unprofitable and difficult energy source at the same time. High speed satellite Internet is now very quickly becoming a strong and key reliable alternative to cellular. It provides large amounts of data and gets people connected.</p><p>And enabling satellite Internet across Africa is a key area of our focus with the new products and partnerships we have. And lastly, our smart solar lighting business in North America, which generates a significant amount of recurring revenue and has a marquee customer list, is starting to go mainstream through the interests of power utilities and departments of transportation. So the transition from Clearblue 1.0 to 2.0 is quite significant. Having a smaller product range which was basically two products over the last few years. Part of the investment that that we did was to focus very heavily from an R and D perspective.</p><p>And also we did a small acquisition in Sweden to expand our product range so that we have full coverage to cover the three distinct market opportunities that we're focusing on. Significantly because of that R and D investment that was needed and other higher cost structures, we had a higher cost structure related to the margins and the revenue that we were at. And we have now been able to pare that down so significantly in order to position us at a point where we can get to positive cash flow, positive EBITDA for sustainable growth going forward. A big part of that was adjusting Our debt, it was putting too much pressure on our ability to execute.</p><p>And so we have now converted a lot of that debt to equity and are sitting at about a reduced debt of approximately 6.0 million on the balance sheet. Of that 6 million, 3.4 million is interest bearing. The rest is non interest bearing. I wouldn't use low quality. I'm going to edit that. We had smaller customers and early adopters in our book of business and we have now transitioned to newer, larger, better capitalized and more mature customers and partners. And that is also having an impact on the size of orders, the amount of orders, the ongoing rollout that we're seeing.</p><p>And in the same way as our customers have gone that way, so have our distribution partners. So as an example, we are very thrilled with the fact that we are now dealing with a number of power utilities throughout the market. So I've talked about the three markets. The telecom, Road to Zero, diesel enabling, satellite, Internet and solar mainstream. How does that Translate into investor KPIs? Well, the three KPIs that we are tracking and that I would think you would want to track as well are commercial contracts. Positive adjusted EBITDA and positive cash flow generation. Those are the things that we're keeping our eyes focused on from a commercial contract perspective.</p><p>I think we're at over 120 orders this year. Many of them are smaller and still, you know, valuable growing. But we have some larger commercial contracts that we have in the funnel and as they become online we will be announcing them and as you're going to see today and going forward, strong momentum towards positive adjusted EBITDA and positive cash flow generation. So this is quite an important slide because it's important to understand that whether you're 0 to 20 watts and you're an Internet small device powering a Starlink or a Utelsat or an Intelsat or whatever type of application in communities, in schools, in healthcare, or just for commercial uses.</p><p>You might need the Pico product, then your Nano, which is our core bread and butter project product that we've had for a while, our Illumient, which also needed to have expanded capability to cover all use cases. And then last but certainly not least, our micro product, which now gets us into the very large power power and gets us with an ability to tackle the diesel challenge. So to have a product range that goes from 0 watts to 30 kilowatts and is usable in all of those ranges. Important to understand that Nano, for example, wouldn't work at 10 to 20 watts in an economical way.</p><p>And Micro doesn't really work below, I would say 1 kilowatt to 3 kilowatt. You're kind of in a crossover and in the allumian business needing to be able to have products that generate across the entire market. So having this comprehensive portfolio and all of the money and time and energy invested by the company to deliver that creates a very strong asset both from an IP perspective as well as from a sales and marketing perspective to go after projects and market share. So from a business model perspective, we have created and built smart power systems. We've learned that in order to be smart you've got to integrate and embed right into the power electronics certain smart capabilities, edge computing and connectivity and communications capability.</p><p>With the cloud, we take that, we connect it to the cloud and we provide aftermarket service in terms of operating and manage not just warranty, but running and operating and managing these systems in partnership with our customer and delivering energy as a service in a variety of different contractual and and service capabilities. At this point I'm going to ask Farooq to step in and talk about the highlights of our financials.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>Sure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you Maryam. Hello everyone. So as we can see, you know, based on the new product offerings that we have. So what we've done is we are building a foundation for growth with all of these four distinct products sizes that we have in Q2 revenue grew 12% to 1.13 million bringing year to date revenue to 2.2 million. To put that in perspective, last year's full year revenue was 2.76 million and we are already near that level with two quarters still to go which will have historically been a strongest like our next two quarters have historically Q3, Q4 have historically been our strongest quarters.</p><p>Recurring revenue also grew by 6% in the quarter to 180,000. While year to date is slightly lower due to timing of renewals. The service base remains solid and expanding with over 15,000 units deployed worldwide generating recurring services and data insights. We are trying to build a strong foundation to scale profitability and deliver long term value. Mariam, do you want to take the next slide?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So we've talked about satellite Internet, we've talked about cellular telecom and as I've also mentioned we're seeing a lot of activity in the power utilities, in transportation, in municip and starting this fall we are going to be privileged to do. We actually got two agriculture projects now, one in North America and one in Africa. These markets are expanding significantly. Connectivity, the Internet of things and having the telecommunications industry which is really powering everything is a significant growth for us. Across all of our markets. We have some very strong advantages. Sorry, apologies for the dog. We have some very strong advantages going into those markets.</p><p>We drive higher performance and better economics than anyone else in the marketplace. We do that by delivering the smart power equipment on site, by having analytics driven, remote monitoring, remote cloud troubleshooting and repair, fixing things, whether it's power system things that need to be managed and operated, or even the telecom systems themselves need to be rebooted. We can do all of that remotely. And when you are dealing with multiple power sources and sources that are dependent upon solar or wind, they're not there 100% of the time. So weather and energy forecasting, for which we have some nice patents, is a key foundation of what we're doing.</p><p>Through that we've got more than 15,000 systems that we've shipped in 55 countries. We make our systems more and more power smart on an ongoing basis. We're using big data and predictive analytics. We can troubleshoot and remote remediate better than anyone else on the market. And we're managing and operating for our customers alongside our customers. Strategic partners are very important obviously to us. And I thought I would just spend a few minutes talking about utelsat. Utelsat is. You'll be familiar with low Earth orbit like Starlink and higher Earth orbit satellite services. Both of them are getting much faster with much higher capacity.</p><p>And Eutelsat has become a strategic asset for France, for the UK and for all of the EU for a security resiliency, infrastructure perspective. They recognize the importance of power alongside the connectivity and we have signed an MO with them for our partnership. We've been working heavily with them the last eight or nine months. Throughout all of this year, there's been some changes on their side. They have received $1.6 billion of investment from the French government and the UK government and other reference shareholders. So they are making significant investments in rolling out their services across the EU and across Africa.</p><p>And along with that we are expected to provide the power infrastructure. This represents a multimillion dollar opportunity over the next multiple years for clearblue. From a customer base. We have a marquee list of customers. We have the top telecommunications infrastructure customers across Africa, MTN being the largest telecom organization, IHS Towers being the largest tower operator in Africa. Satellite vendors, Utelsat, ViaSat, Intelsat, Avanti, ISAT and the entire service infrastructure across North America. Cities, municipalities, states, transportation, Pennsylvania Turnpike, Interstate 80 and commercial retail customers are our base of customers. And many of These customers have been using our services for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years now.</p><p>Just a bit of a refresh on our board. There's a lot of them that have gray hair or no hair. I don't have gray hair at all. That's why my hair's nice and brown. But those of you who've seen me lately know that there's a bit more gray there. We've been working really hard and we are a very determined team. We have a disparate set of, of assets and capabilities. The three founders, myself, John and Mark couldn't be more different people. But between the three of us, I think we make one hopeful, super person with individual skills.</p><p>And we are very focused as a company making sure everybody plays their position well. As a result of the, you know, the end of Clearblue 1.0 and the restructuring we have, it's time to refresh our board. We were thrilled to announce in the quarter that Greg Ross has joined our board as an independent director this quarter. He has a significant amount of industry and investment knowledge in the Canadian markets and global markets and is already providing us with sage advice. And we expect to expand our portfolio of independent directors from a go forward perspective. Farooq, would you like to talk a little bit about the trend lines and the work we've been doing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, for sure. So as we indicated earlier in the presentation, you know, we've been working really hard on our debt restructuring and you know, bringing debt to a level that is manageable and we've been successful so over, you know, quite a bit. So over the last year we have taken action to strengthen our balance sheet. As you can see from the graph, the net debt is down from 14.7 billion in Q3 last year to 5.7 million in Q2, a 61% reduction in less than a year. This was made possible through stakeholder support as we converted convertible debentures shareholder loans and into equity.</p><p>We restructured our debt to extend the terms and converted the short term loan into a mix of royalty equity and smaller debt balance payments. So the result is lower leverage, reduced near term cash needs and alignment of our stakeholders with Clear Blue's long term success. Most importantly, this structure gives us the breathing room to execute our growth strategy without an overhang of excessive debt. Right, the next slide please. So you can see if you look at our revenues, they've been improving and the gross margin is being supported by, you know, and giving us better profitability.</p><p>So in Q2 revenue grew 12% year over year to 1.13 million with gross margin improving to 44 from 24 last year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by a product mix more skewed forward, more skewed towards our more mature products and higher margin services. On a year to date basis, revenue is up 20% and gross profit has nearly doubled with margins expanding to 48% versus 32% in 2024. While restructuring activities temporarily impacted revenue in late 2024, we are now seeing a recovery with stronger profitability. These results validate our push towards improving cost control and higher margin business.</p><p>Next slide please. Maria. So the key levers and revenue recovery leading to inflection point we believe that we are at an inflection point in the business having a couple of challenging years. Our adjusted EBITDA has improved 69% in Q2 and 57% year to date, driven by higher revenues, stronger margin and reduced operating expenses. In fact, operating expenses were down 14% year over year in Q2 and down 20% year to date. Thanks to thanks to workforce automation, lower overhead and tighter GNA management, our R and D and business development remain tightly focused on revenue generation. With the shift from heavy R and D to commercialization, past sales investments are starting to yield orders from higher quality customers as Maria mentioned.</p><p>And we believe that we are on par towards positive adjusted EBITDA and improved cash generation. Next slide. Do you want to take it over from here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Sure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So lots of changes to the cap table, but we think we fixed it in terms of cleaning it up nicely. Now we did the share consolidation in Q2 as well and so we're now sitting with 78 million outstanding shares, a number of warrants for all the people who participated last year in helping us make the transition. And where we sit as a result is we're very honored that BDC Capital, who is our largest lender, is also now very large shareholder. And I think as you can see, there is a significant management focus and board focus and commitment to the company and as a result of investments that we've made, we're sitting at about 22%.</p><p>The shares are still sitting at a level that are quite flat and I think that our thoughts are that we need to show the trend line in a stronger way over more quarters. So we've got a good start when you look at where our EBITDA numbers are going and how our gross margin and revenue has been improving. But I think the market will want to to see how we do for the rest of this year to make sure it wasn't just a spot quarter and that the trend line is going forward in a strong way.</p><p>And once that happens, we think that there's significant potential for upside from where we are today. In terms of comparables, presenting a little bit of a basket of selected comparables, a range of small cap and microcap solar power electronics and energy management peers. We've provided a context here for valuation metrics relevant to companies that are similar stage of scale and market position. We're planning on bucking the trend and we aim for an EBITDA positive company. We think we're ready, we're at the point where we need to be, we've got the technology developed and once we've achieved that on a consistent go forward basis, this is a rarity seen amongst clean tech companies, then we think there's significant opportunity for upside.</p><p>So just to summarize where we're at, we have three core markets that provide a foundation for strong revenue growth and improved profitability. We're in the commercialization phase with our new products and that has allowed us to significantly reduce our operating expense, our R and D expenses and some automation that you know, you need to develop the product to automate it to get things going. And so that's helped on the OPEX side as well. That doesn't mean we're not doing R and D, it just means we've gotten a big chunk of it behind us. The 2024, 2025 debt restructuring has really helped to stabilize the business and provided breathing room for us to execute and grow our growth strategy.</p><p>We've reduced our operating expenses and we have a pathway to positive adjusted EBITDA and improve cash generation. And we've got new partnerships that are being formalized that are moving forward such as Utelsat and Growth Energy and they are going to support larger scale deployments and revenue growth. So that's the presentation for today. Going to stop sharing and I wonder whether there are any questions that we want to take at this point in time.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so we've got a couple in the chat I'll to you and Farouk. Okay, so the first one is what are you expecting in terms of the revenues for the second half of 2025?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So the second half of our fiscal year is typically when we see the highest revenue quarters. Last year was an exception because we were constrained by the restructuring activities. But we have a number of key projects that we are going to be in planning on delivering on and we need to deliver those in order to ensure that we have the two strong quarters in the back half of the Year. Sorry. And our team's focus is to make sure that happens and deliver on our goal of hitting a positive adjusted EBITDA this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, next one is. So what is driving the visibility for that stronger second half of 2025 then?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So this year is going to be particularly strong for our Micro and Nano products, which are mainly for telecom applications. The success in the second half will be predicated on making these deliveries on time along with winning further contracts to solidify the bookings for 2026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, now in terms of OPEX, are there any other costs that you can cut to reduce that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>I can take that question. So we've already made a significant amount of reduction in our overall operating expenses with this quarter. You know, it's, our quarter is down 16% year over year. There's, there's also, you know, there's a balance that we want to hit between revenue growth and cost structure. And going on forward, we're not trying to compromise our revenue growth. So I, I would say that our OPEX would remain flat. Where are there, there are opportunities. We are going to work on it. But like, we've already made significant, you know, strengths towards reducing our opex.</p><p>And I think it's, it's, it's a good, you know, now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, next one is how are you managing the debt on the balance sheet?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>So with the restructuring, the reduced, you know, we've reduced our debt by approximately 61% from its peak. Most of the remaining debt is with BDC or Fed Dev Ontario. Fed Dev is interest free and does not require any significant payments within the next couple of years. It's pretty, pretty, pretty small payments over the next couple of years. And with bdc we did our restructuring recently and you know, we, we've got manageable payments going on forward. So, you know, our goal is to improve our profitability and therefore our ability to service the debt will go hand in hand with higher revenues.</p><p>Once we get to that point, we have more flexibility and options on how to fund ourselves. But right now, I think, you know, we're managing our debt amicably after the restructuring that we've done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, now is the company thinking that it's going to need to do another equity raise is the next question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>I can take that one. So we want to keep all of our options on the table as we've entered this new phase of growth. And there may be situations and opportunities where more capital could help us to accelerate that growth. Historically, we funded ourselves with grants with debt, with equity raises and the management team and board are assessing those options on a go forward basis to decide if and when we want to approach that, when we put the pedal to the metal, etc. Etc. And taking all of those things into consideration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, what is happening with the Utelsat partnership? It's the next one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. So the Utilsat partnership is a huge ship. It's not a little sea doo. It's a huge ship. The opportunity in front of us is for tens and tens of thousands of systems being deployed across, as I said, all of the Europe and Africa. Right now we're focused mostly on Africa, but EU is entering the conversation as well. Well, you may have noticed there was a huge outage in Spain of power and that has triggered some concerns about the reliability of the grid in Europe, which is not unsurprising. So we are actively engaged with Utelsat.</p><p>Most people in the company at Clearblue touch many different people in Utelsat multiple times a week. And we're working towards formalizing the commercial terms of our rollout with them. They've had some significant developments on their side, raising 1.6 billion euros from the French government, the UK government to fund their growth, and they have very accelerated plans. So we'll update the market as things develop and become finalized. But as it stands right now, things are going all in the right direction with them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, I think this one might be for you, Farouk. So with recurring revenue, do we book the entire. So the annual amount, the month it was received, received, hence the timing issue on prepaid renewals, or treat it as prepaid revenue and kind of phase that in over the payment period as it's earned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>So with recurring revenue, what we do is we don't take it all at once. The way that it works is like if it's a three year contract, we take it over the three year period and then when there is a renewal, it's generally an yearly annual renewal and then we amortize it into income over the next 12 months. When we mentioned that the timing issue on prepaid renewals, it's basically the time lag between getting the renewal done. And so unless and until we get the money in, it's not deferred revenue. So just a time lag between when the three year ends and the fresh renewal is going to come in.</p><p>There's lots of processes that need to go in and work on and sometimes there's a delay on that because you know, the end customer changes and whatnot. Right. So that's just you Know why there was a delay in the long term prepaid renewals, but like it's, it's amortized accordingly and you can see the monthly renewal over there as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So you might, you might have a telco or a city that is fully intending to renew their, renew their ongoing recurring revenue. But we don't have the signed contract or the payment for two or three months of into the new term. So then the numbers go down in that quarter, but they come up the next corner because it's retroactive, that kind of thing. So it's just those types of items.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>We have a couple folks that are interested in more information about the agriculture contract. So like if we're powering irrigation pumps or kind of what, what those projects are about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so in. I don't actually know that exactly what we're powering in Africa. I just know we're doing an agricultural in Tanzania. But the interesting thing about agriculture is it tends to be outside the city. So power utilities are looking at, I've got this large distributed power infrastructure. I've got to provide mission critical power to them. It's going through forest fire territories and as a result I would like to look at providing green energy as an alternative. So I think we have some pilots coming up that we'll be announcing hopefully in the fall related to that type of an agriculture project.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>And then just one, one more thing like our Pico plus product like Smart Street Lights, you know, all in one lights. Those are also, you know like easily transportable and whatnot. So those are also pretty good fit for, for agricultural areas as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Well, awesome. Perfect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so now we have another question. So of the $3.5 million in bookings that will be recognized in 12 months, how much of that are we expecting to be invoiced in the 12 months? And how would we, how much would we estimate that to be invoiced in fiscal year end 2025?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So we would expect 100% of it to be invoiced in 12 months. In terms of the number for 2025, we're not going to give exact guidance at this point because things can still move a month here or a month there and it's all related to execution and timing, etc. Etc. What I can say is historically the last two quarters of the year have been significantly bigger than the first two quarters of the year and that is what we have seen most of the time is the trend that we have and that is the plan that we're working on.</p><p>For the end of 2025. One of the other things that we're focused on. So our definition of success at the end of December is good strong Q3 and Q4 and a nice bookings backlog to show that we're going into a good strong Q1 for next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>That's our plan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>The only thing I'd like to add in there as well, like is that, you know, there's, there's also recurring revenue inside the 3.5 million. So that would go more than, you know, if it's a three year contract. So that revenue is going to come in, in over more than 12 months. But you know, the rest of that, the cash we are expecting to be received in, in the next 12 months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Correct. So if you look at the bookings table, it shows a year one number and it shows a beyond year one number. When we show a booking, it's cash received from the customer. So we generally get the first three years of the ongoing service contract prepaid in the first year of the contract. So our cash receipts are higher than our revenue. Revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, we have another question here. So is the energy as a service and recurring revenue at or above the corporate profit margin levels?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Recurring revenue is a higher margin than one time hardware sales. Yes, that is in fact the case.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, another good one here. So is management still committed to long term or if a company comes along with for instance, $50 million takeover offer, will the company get sold asking as a diluted retail investor?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So as we've said with, with raising equity in the future and will we need to do another raise? Management and board, you know, will always look at those things and figure out what's the best, you know, opportunity from management's perspective. We're not looking to get out of this anytime soon. We're keeping our head down and building the business and I don't, and sorry, I'm just trying to think through all the scenarios. We don't see anything happening in the short term. One never knows though. But the key focus is to grow the business and have a long term roadmap and to make sure that the shareholders get the maximum return on their investment.</p><p>Certainly at the numbers we're sitting at right now, we consider that not to be the value of the company at all. And our intention most strongly is to deliver significant return on investment to our shareholders. We would not have gone through all of this pain if we were just going to, you know, take a few pennies on the dollar. This company has a significant amount of IP assets In both customers in revenue, in product technology and know how. And we're here to make sure that that value is realized.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome. Thanks, Miriam.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so we got another good question here. So what percentage of like a big installation does the power component make up for a total project's capex?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>It depends by product. But let's take a typical telecom installation. If you're establishing a new tower installation, I would say that the power is probably 50 to 60% of the capex. If it's a retrofit, it's probably 75% of it. In the street light business, it depends if we're supplying the entire system or not. But of course those percentages would be high. So I would generally say most of the time it's 50, 50% of the CapEx of the project.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, another one here. So, you know, understanding we can't give guidance, but do we expect to see revenue growth in the second half over last year? In the last two quarters? Year over year. To clarify, you say it would be weird aiming to be EBITDA positive by the end of the year. Is that the goal for Q4?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So our last two quarters are expect. We are targeting and working hard to deliver strong Q3 and Q4. Strong Q3 and Q4 would be nowhere near what we did last year. Last year's two quarters, last two quarters were significantly impacted by our, the restrictions due to the restructuring. And that's not what we're targeting. Those are very low quarters. We're more looking back to towards previous years and what we have traditionally been able to show in terms of growth on Q3, Q4 versus Q1, Q2 in terms of adjusted EBITDA. You could, you could see on the chart that there was a very strong go trajectory towards getting to positive adjusted ebitda.</p><p>And we are planning on continuing quarter after quarter to get better and better at that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>So I'm kind of piggybacking off of that one. Someone's interested in like what the sales level is required to be to become cash flow break even. I don't know if we're able to.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Share that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So Farooq, do you want to answer that question?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, yeah, for sure. So we've got so right now our. For. So to be EBITDA positive. So we looked at to be EBITDA positive. Right now we have in Q2 we had $1.1 million in revenue and our adjusted EBITDA was, was 222,000 negative. Right. At 40% margin. You can see at that, that price at that, you know, at that level. So if we get around, you know, around 2 million or 2.2 million a quarter, I think we would be a bit positive. And again, with, with the cash flow, our working looking, you know, we've got, we've reduced that debt significantly.</p><p>So if you look at our, our margins at 40%. So if we, on a quarterly basis, if we do $2 million in a quarter and at 40% margins, so and, and then looking at our expenses, I think at 2 million or 2.2 million, we would be cash flow positive as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, next question. So what is the payback time for a customer on replacing diesel in the telecom industry? And what is the IRR on this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>So the payback period is months, not years. The key challenge is what we're seeing in the industry is everyone's moving towards adding solar, but the operators who have historically run the site as diesel and a generator have not got the tools and the expertise to actually deliver the solar energy to the system. So we see a lot of customers who maybe have rolled out solar with other companies and they're not getting the benefit from that. So step one is to get the infrastructure built out, but step two is then to harvest the solar energy. And that requires significant configuration management analysis of the sites to make sure you're setting up the parameters, adjusting the parameters to doing that.</p><p>So that's why we talk about the road to zero diesel. Because we've seen sites where, you know, we start off with a system and okay, it's going to deliver 40% solar and with us doing the management of it, you know, we can get a, you know, 90, 95% plus solar operated on a way to getting it to zero diesel. So the payback is in months. But one of the key criteria is there are many, many installations we're seeing where they do the work, they do the upgrade, but don't actually get the benefit without the operational experience.</p><p>That's why we believe so strongly in our model of having the field operational expertise and skill sets, having the analytics and the data and the management team to do that, and then even to the next level, changing the technology and the hardware to respond to what's going on in the field. I call it the red dot problem. It's not about how to make this stuff work in the lab, it's about how to make this stuff work in the field. Whether it's in northern Saskatchewan at minus 40 and plus 40, 40, sometimes within the same week almost, or it's in Africa with dust, dirt, you know, no local maintenance people and, and 40 degrees, 50 degrees Celsius.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, this may be a fruit question, but do we have the tax loss carry forward dollar amount?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farrukh Anwar:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, for sure. So we can, we can break that up into two. So we've got, but at the end of the year last year we had non capital losses available for future periods of around $26 million, $26.6 million. And we had research and development tax credits that we had carried forward of around 8.6, 8.7 million.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome, thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, and this is the last one that we've got in the queue is going forward, can we expect more frequent news release updates?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Certainly. We expect to have more visibility in the market. I think the answer to that is yes. But I just wanted to emphasize that we've been keeping our heads down and making sure that we could deliver on a long term trend, not just a blip. We've now got two quarters behind us that have shown the new trend and we've got more coming. So we believe that the market is getting ready to see the results and see the progress. I do want to emphasize, as I said, you know, we've got over 120 projects that we've done so far this year that we've got orders for.</p><p>And you know, some of these are strategic nice projects. I've got, you know, projects that are a couple of thousand dollars but they lead to very significant follow on strategic projects. So we don't announce everything but yes, I would think that there's going to be more visibility, more news coming, coming forward now that we've kind of come out from dealing with all of the restructuring and are focused on sales. We're also seeing a lot of deals happening. So the activity is much higher as well as, as well given that the revenue is growing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Awesome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>All right, we had one more come through. So turning back to the power components of those large projects. So if we got 5% of util sats 1.6 billion, it would be 80 million of revenue to you over time. Is that in that kind of 5% ballpark?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the money that they're putting in is CapEx, not OpEx. So I'd have to take a look at that. But I think in looking at what the potential value of that contract is, we see the contract being potentially worth more than 20 million over the next two to three years. I'd say more than 20 million over the next three years is the potential that we see for that contract. And that is just for the Africa portion. How Europe starts to come into play might be very interesting. Those are still early days discussions when it comes to Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. All right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe give 30 more seconds if anybody has any last minute questions, but that is all of them in the queue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>That have come in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everyone. We really appreciate it. This webinar presentation and this PowerPoint presentation will be put onto the website for other people to listen to if they want. I do just want to give a shout out. Many of you have been part of the team in terms of doing the transition. We want to thank all of our stakeholders for the support that we got through this financial transition. We would not be here without you. And it is something we think about and hold ourselves accountable to every day. So a very big thank you for all of the supporters we have had and every person in this company is working hard to deliver on that and investment for you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no more questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>I think that's good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miriam Tuerk:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Have a great weekend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-dc29d64981085ba6ac8e0ade4e409371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMR-HT53-RSGN-421F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 AlphaStreet Inc.

Dick Durbin issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON- Ahead of an upcoming vote-a-rama, where Senate Democrats will expose the truth about Republicans' so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will slash Medicaid, Affordable Care Act, and Medicare coverage for more than 16 million Americans to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires, U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) delivered a speech on the Senate floor where he underscored the dangers of this Republican proposal and called on four of his Senate Republican colleagues to stand up and oppose this harmful legislation.</p><p>\"We're here today debating a clumsily assembled package-still a work in progress-that would rip away health care from 16 million American families to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and the largest corporations,\" Durbin said. \"Think about that for a moment. The Republicans have decided that the best avenue to generate revenue that they can then give in tax breaks to wealthy people is to eliminate health insurance coverage for 16 million Americans. That's going to have a dramatic impact on their lives. The notion of losing your health insurance leaves you as vulnerable as possible in some of the most important moments of your life. And that they would consider this provision-to eliminate health insurance coverage for 16 million families-is unimaginable and cruel.\"</p><p>Durbin continued, \"Let's not act like there is a unified Republican front on this issue. Even some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want to be here at this moment jamming this unpopular bill through this chamber under arbitrary deadlines. Behind closed doors, my Republican colleagues continued to be consumed with infighting, bickering over the bill's substance-and for good reason.\"</p><p>Durbin outlined how the Senate Republican bill cripples one of the main ways that states fund their Medicaid programs and keep hospitals afloat, especially in rural and low-income areas-the provider tax.</p><p>Earlier this week, a Republican Senator circulated a flyer to his fellow caucus members detailing just how much each state will lose in Medicaid provider tax funding under their proposal. It said: Iowa would lose $4.1 billion; Missouri would lose $6.1 billion; Kentucky would lose $12 billion; Louisiana would lose $20 billion; North Carolina would lose $38.9 billion dollars.</p><p>\"This list of states and what they will lose was passed around by a Republican Senator to his own caucus. They know what they are up against here,\" Durbin said. \"If Republicans have their way and pass this bill, hospitals will be forced to shrink or eliminate services. doctors and nurses will leave, and-in some cases-the hospital will close.\"</p><p>Durbin continued, \"As it stands today, half of the rural hospitals around the country already operate in the danger zone. If Republicans have their way, we are going to see massive layoffs-fewer nurses, technicians, and doctors-along with decreasing quality of care.\"</p><p>The American Hospital Association estimated how these cuts to Medicaid could impact not just the jobs at these red-state hospitals, but jobs across the entire state economy. Here's what they found: Maine could lose nearly 5,000 jobs. Kansas could lose 6,200 jobs. Iowa could lose nearly 11,000 jobs. And Missouri could lose 26,600 jobs.</p><p>Durbin then discussed the so-called \"rural hospital fund\" Senate Republicans concocted, which is designed to mask the harms of their own Medicaid cuts.</p><p>\"They [Republicans] came up with a rescue fund to solve the political problem. [the] overall cut in Medicaid now is about a trillion dollars. $1 trillion. Cutting Medicaid nationwide a trillion dollars. And the rescue plan for the small hospitals that are in danger, the ones I've talked about, a trillion dollars cut, how big is the rescue plan? 25 billion dollars. Do the math. It's a joke,\" Durbin said. \"If Republican leaders think this is an adequate amount to alleviate the pains all of our nation's rural hospitals are going to feel, then that's like trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose. This simply won't work.\"</p><p>Durbin concluded by highlighting how congressional Democrats worked in a bipartisan manner to craft the Affordable Care Act, which has allowed more than 40 million Americans to gain health insurance coverage and led to a historic decline in our nation's uninsured rate.</p><p>\"I want to conclude by saying this: we passed the Affordable Care Act 15 years ago. Of all the things that I've worked on in Congress, I think it had more positive impact to help the families across America than anything. We found a way to make health insurance more affordable for families, 15 years ago. And to do it, we held hearings-[Senate Democrats] [held] 100 hearings on theAffordable Care Act, roundtables, [and] walkthroughs. Two Committees spent a combined 21 days holding markups so that everyone could offer an amendment. Do you know how many amendments were made to the Obamacare program? 400 votes in Committee and on the Floor on amendments. 147 Republican amendments were included, though not a single Republican Senator ended up supporting Obamacare,\" Durbin said. \"At the end of the day, that legislation, Obamacare, allowed more than 40 million Americans to gain health insurance.\"</p><p>Durbin continued, \"Today, how many hearings have we had on this bill before us, this dramatic, multitrillion dollar bill? None, zero, not a single one. Zero markups for Senators to offer amendments. 400 amendments on Obamacare. None on this one, until it comes to the Floor today. Zero bipartisan input. Our friends on the Republican side have said basically, 'It's a big deal. Take it or leave it.' Should this bill become a law, do you know what it will have done? Thrown 16 million Americans off health insurance and closed many vulnerable, small hospitals all to pay fortax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. Maybe some of my Republican [colleagues] are okay with that. I don't think the American people are.\"</p><p>Durbin concluded, \"I'm hoping that sanity and commonsense prevail. We need four [Republican] Senators to step up and say stop this train. We've got to sit down and do our homework. We cannot expose the American families and the American economy to do this in the name of preserving tax breaks for the wealthiest people. Elon Musk seems to be doing okay in life, right? The wealthiest man in the world. Do you know what the tax break is for Elon Musk on the bill that is before us on the floor? $346,000. A lot of money. To him, he won't even notice it. Giving him a tax break he won't notice and taking away from health insurance from families who will be devastated, 16 million around the country. It's an important choice.\"</p><p>Video of Durbin's remarks on the Senate floor is availablehere.</p><p>Audio of Durbin's remarks on the Senate floor is availablehere.</p><p>Footage of Durbin's remarks on the Senate floor is availablehere for TV Stations.</p><p>-30-</p><p>(Category: News Release; Media Release; Announcement; Press Briefing; Remarks; Congressional Documents; Court Order; Court Judgement; Judgment; Court Opinion; Federal Government; Local Government; State Government; Speech; Transcript, Notice, Notification) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR5106262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G6J-BR63-RSTC-Y4CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><timeReceived>12:31 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 HT Media Ltd.

Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience.

It preserves houses and traditions from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). The forest fire broke out in Uiseong's Ansa district, about 7 km away from Hahoe, and smoke has flowed into the village along the direction of the wind.
