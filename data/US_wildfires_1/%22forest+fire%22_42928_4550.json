I'm Marc Goodman, one of the biotech analysts at Leerink, and we're very happy to have Avadel Pharmaceuticals here. And we have Greg, the CEO; Richard Kim, who's the Chief Commercial Officer; and everybody knows Tom as well, who's the CFO. Thank you so much for joining us. Obviously an exciting time, products doing well, getting off, certainly totally different from the last year, two years, whatever we've been talking about this.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe we can just start with just the broader oxybate market dynamics and just give us a sense of your sense of the broader market right now and what's happening, the growth dynamics?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Thanks, Marc, for allowing us to be here. Even if we take a step broader in the narcolepsy market, we see from claims data about 170,000 patients who are prevalent care in the US. Prior to LUMRYZ coming to the marketplace, there was about 16,000 patients who are on the twice nightly first generation oxybates. And as we sort of try that now, unfortunately, now we have to piece together the data. Some data is no longer publicly available. We have to rely on claims for other sources here, so we probably can't give an exact numeric number of where the size of the marketplace is. But what we can say from the launch thus far is we have seen segments like the previously discontinued well represented, which have come back into the mix, and we've also seen a really good representation of new to oxybate patients. So our belief is the marketplace is growing. We still have to sort of maybe put together all the data from the different sources to sort of show exactly how much numerically it's grown.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>But is your sense that the market's growing 2% or 3%, something like that? I mean, is that general?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the overall marketplace for narcolepsy maybe, yes, for oxybates, because, for example, some of the segments have come back in probably at a rate greater than that early on, but it's really an exact number to it. But we've definitely sort of seen representation from all three of the patient segments we've talked about in the past. So we definitely sort of feel, and mostly hear from the service providers that there's more patients coming to the mix now. That's what it feels like.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>I think the two things we know for sure is that patients who have come back in, who have previously been on an oxybate and had discontinued is a market growth. And we are seeing physicians treat patients who have right now and early in the launch.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Right. So that's specifically for oxybate, too?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Specifically for oxybate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Interesting. So what surprised you in the first six or so months of launch?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>This is going to sound like one of those cliche answers. Not a lot really happened. For better or worse, we actually had a little more time to prepare for this launch. So we had done a lot of market research, we had used claims, we had spoken to providers, patients and the payers. So I wouldn't say nothing was surprising. We would say there was things that were maybe a little more difficult. Things like the fact that it's difficult to change people's behavior that's ingrained for 20 years. The fact that some people, despite sort of seeing identifying patients, they wouldn't want to rock the boat, per se, providers. But we've also started seeing tremendous advancement that we've made with this launch, sort of eight months into launch now as well.</p><p>So everything from getting almost 1,900 REMS certified GCPs to now over 2,200 patients in rise up who are showing an interest in using our product, that our fulfillment works. And we have over 1,200 patients who were initiated by the end of January, and the fact that we have over 80% of commercially covered lives where there's a LUMRYZ policy in place now. So we're super proud of what we've done. We have, as Greg likes to say, we have more wood to chop, but not surprises. But just maybe you can't always have a great assumption on when everything will occur in the marketplace and who adopts sooner versus who may adopt later as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Any specific issues or anything you've had to deal with?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe the biggest one that is probably true for almost any new product launch in a specialty field is product fulfillment. It's just a pain. It's just different. It's new. You're working through coverage here. So candidly, I think some of the people who put their first patients through early on in the launch may have had a different experience than the ones who are doing it more recently now as well. But we've also sort of seen as especially high volume users once they've gotten their first or second patient through, the velocity seems to be faster for their next patients to come through the system. And we're also clearly getting better at getting those patients onto LUMRYZ and started as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>We have a colleague, and Richard quotes this often, which in launches, you always see little mini campfires. You just don't want the forest fire. Right? We haven't seen the forest fire, and the team has done a great job and we feel like we've really built an incredibly strong foundation early on in a launch to continue to build and grow, as Richard noted, with a lot more wood the chop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. And fulfillment was like, how long did it take at the beginning versus now?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Especially at the beginning, Marc, they were almost all the scripts growing through medical necessity, which generally requires sort of medical necessity appeal, denial, that process. What we can see now is as our coverage has really increased to now, over 80% of commercially covered lives. If there's a policy that exists and you meet the prior authorization criteria, those patients are going through under a month. If there's a criteria, but they don't meet all the sort of PA, the steps that were required before you can go into an oxybate, which are same steps for any oxybate, there's usually a little bit of back and forth, so those are probably a little bit over a month. And those where there is no policy in place, those ones generally take the longest still. But that's our smallest segment that exists today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>But even in a good scenario, it still takes a few weeks to get through this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>That's right. That's right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>It just is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Welcome to the United States, especially products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Right. Any anecdotal stories just about patients that you're hearing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Well, many. And in fact, what's really cool is we're about to launch our LUMRYZ brand ambassadors. These are real patients on LUMRYZ who are going to start to share their stories online. But maybe one of the, I think back to a call I had with a sleep physician in December, give me some great feedback on many things. Also some things we can do better in some areas. But he's like, Richard, the one area I got to talk to you about is new to oxybate patients. He said in the past, it was a battle. It was like arm wrestling with these patients because they just couldn't get over the fact that I finally got diagnosed. I'm going to get on this therapy. I just told you I'm struggling with the night, and you're going to force me to wake up, he said that battle is gone now with LUMRYZ, it's gone. So it's a fundamentally different conversation for getting new patients to oxybates on.</p><p>So once again, we think about all of our segments. We have really good catalysts for all of them. But to me, that was represented because we know that from our past market research 40% to 50% of patients when offered a twice nightly oxybate, refuse to take it, with the biggest reason being because of the dosing regimen. So we believe that LUMRYZ can take a lot of that off the table now, going forward.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Mind us, before the launch, where did you think the patients would come from? And here we are, six months in and are they coming from where you expected?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I mean, we sort of stated that the majority of patients are switch patients with more coming from the mixed salt versus the twice nightly sodium oxybates. And obviously we're seeing good representation from previously discontinued and new to oxybates. It doesn't sort of surprise us where we are right now, because there were just numerically more patients who were on twice nightly oxybates. But the fact that we're getting really good representation from these previously discontinued, we think is awesome, because that one was like, are they really going to come back in and reengage? And the answer is heck yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Which means they stopped for the exact reason that you benefit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>That's right. I mean, Marc, it's funny, when you asked before what surprises, we were super thorough in our pre launch market research and our claims analysis and our audits, that we did. So once again, maybe a few smaller things, that surprises. But the fundamentals, not really at all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. And the patients are having good experiences and you're not hearing any issues. There's no side effect issue that's popped up that we weren't expecting because we know what, oxybates are.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no, I think generally in line. I mean, is it perfect with every patient? The answer, of course, is no. But the vast majority of the feedback we receive has been very positive. And once again, especially from a patient perspective now to get those patient stories out there, and we sort of see that as a multiplier effect because the patient voice is very small at the beginning. Now, with over 1,200 patients who have initiated, more of those voices are out there to share their personal journeys as well. So we're just super excited to be in this next phase of our launch.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>And lastly, Xyrem versus Xywav, where are you getting more patients from?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>We're getting more from Xywav. And you're giving me that look that some people give to me as well, because people with that, I would have maybe thought it would be the other way around. There's maybe three fundamental reasons for that. The first is today there are more patients on the mix salts than the twice nightly sodium oxybates. But about a year and a half into the Xywav launch, we did market research with patients and showed them the profile of LUMRYZ, and both groups were super-excited to learn about LUMRYZ and want to consider switching to LUMRYZ. But the Xywav patients barely eked out the Xyrem patients. And when we dug into the data, what we saw was the Xywav patients tended to be diagnosed for a shorter period of time. They switch treatment sooner. They are the early adopters, and I believe we've seen some of that as well.</p><p>But fundamentally, if you think about the impact of the salt, magnesium, calcium, potassium or sodium, it really doesn't do anything different to the narcolepsy outcome for the GHB. So we just believe with the unique proposition we have for LUMRYZ, it's attracted patients from every segment and any therapy that they've been on as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>What about any commentary on just discontinuation patients to just stop on your therapy?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I mean, we will have discontinuations like every other therapy, but when we look back at claims for the first generation oxybates, what the data will tell you is almost a quarter discontinue at 30 days and almost 50% at 12 months. And what we can sort of see is we look at similar milestones. We are meaningfully lower than those rates that the twice on the oxybates have shown us through claims data as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>And the patients you're losing after 30 days, I mean, these can't be switches. They must just be -- it's bizarre.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>There's a little bit of everything. There's little things that we all get used to here as well. It could be insurance, it could be other things here. But let's face it, not any product gets 100% market share. There will people who may want to go back, and we've heard a couple of those cases, but what we can sort of say is the vast majority of patients have done very well and have stayed persistent on their LUMRYZ journey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>So what's realistic for us to be thinking about as a kind of market penetration rate for you into the oxybate market? Do you think you're going to grab 20%, 30%, 40%? What do you think is realistic?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for asking me. Between my boss and our CFO right now, Marc. But no. When we did a ton of research before and during our launch, we did six different quant demand market research studies where LUMRYZ was given the highest market share in the oxybate category, between 40% and 61% over six different studies. And they also told us that the marketplace would grow because of LUMRYZ, of new starts, somewhere between 25% to 50%, with an average of 38%. And we have seen nothing that deters us now that we've been in the marketplace from the work that we did before launch and the research that we continue to do during launch as well. So we definitely sort of see why LUMRYZ should be the market leader in the oxybate field and have a very meaningful share going forward.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>So 50% is not crazy, not a forecast?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Well, it's what our market research shows consistently, six times.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>That's why we feel really great about the foundation we built. But that's why we say we have a lot more wooded job, because we're not there yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So let's talk about the 2024 sales. I think you mentioned on the call consensus $150 million, or wherever the number is. And then you kind of said, yeah, that looks reasonable or whatever. So maybe you can just talk about some of the assumptions that you have and why that number is comfortable for you?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas S. McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, certainly. Starting call. Yeah. Consensus was about $155 million for 2024. And our comment was, we're comfortable with that. Across the various sell side, there's different assumptions that get to that number, of course, but from a pure numbers perspective, what we have to achieve is, on average, about 1,300 reimbursed patients on therapy during the course of 2024. That's the average. And we've been very consistent that we believe that the average net revenue per patient is about $120,000 per year. So that's the two baseline assumptions to achieve that consensus number. And we think that there's the opportunity to overachieve as well, go above and beyond $155 million if the pace of patient demand accelerates beyond what we're seeing today, if the total number of patients on therapy exceeds those assumptions at various points in time, of course, net pricing could be higher as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the number of patients today are what as of the end of January? I think you said 1,200, didn't you?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas S. McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. What we had reported was 1,200 patients who initiated therapy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>That's not an average on therapy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas S. McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Right. So you only need to get to 1,300 on average for the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas S. McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>Correct.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>I think the other point is that we're obviously really pleased with where we are, but we get asked all the time in one on one meetings about our view on consensus and we have a similar comment. We're comfortable with consensus, and we felt it was appropriate just to confirm that as kind of one time so everybody could hear it. But I think we feel really good where we sit today and with a lot of room to grow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Right. Well, I mean, I was saying when you look at the math, it would have to be pretty disappointing rest of the year for you not to beat that number. You're already at 1,200 patients.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, certainly. Everything we see is, as we always say, up and to the right in terms of continued enrollments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>That's an initial payment. Initial, that's 1,200. So when does it become fully, like, there's no scaling up of pricing and dosing and anything like that, right? So once they start, they're at that average dose right off the bat?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. We're assuming on average patients will be on a 7.5 gram dose. That's the nearest equivalent dose to where we see the twice nightly is, which is 7.6 grams. Not all patients get there right away. Some will switch immediately to that equivalent dose, others will start at 4.5 grams, our lowest dose, and tie, trade up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>What does the market research say about the orexin kind of noise and excitement? Does that impact oxybates, you think, down the line?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>It's a great question, Marc. We'd also sort of rely on a lot of our thought leader feedback that we're receiving as well. There's a lot of excitement. We're also excited. It's always great when new mechanisms potentially can come into marketplace. Obviously, some of the companies have shared some of their data. One of the companies announced that they'll be going to Phase III later on this year. I think we're still learning about what the true product profile is going to be. These orexin agonists look very exciting, but they've also come with different sorts of tolerability or adverse events as well. So these are chronic therapies.</p><p>And I think we're also trying to understand what the impact to sort of the nocturnal view will be on these. So I remind myself right now that the most used product has an 80% share, and that's because they're generic with stimulants in this marketplace. Oxybates today are used in less than 10% of the overall narcolepsy marketplace. So we sort of view LUMRYZ as an ideal product to address EDS and cataplexy without disrupting the night time. And we still believe that we'll be in a unique category, even if orexins come into the marketplace as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Greg, do you think about bringing an orexin in?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Well, as a company that's focused on rare sleep, it behooves us to have a sense of what's going on across all of our fellow companies and what they're working on and sharing with them what we're doing. So it certainly is something we're monitoring and staying close to in terms of what's happening from that standpoint, and certainly something we would, as a company in the space, would have to evaluate if that opportunity presented itself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>I want to talk about what you're working on from a pipeline perspective internally, but before we get there, just how you're thinking about external versus internal, because we're going to break even this year, which means we're going to start to make cash pretty soon, build it up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, first and foremost is to really execute our core strategy, which is continuing to launch and really realize the promise and potential of LUMRYZ and narcolepsy, execute our lifecycle, which we'll talk about in pediatric IIH and whatnot. But we are at a place where we're building capabilities to understand what's out there in the marketplace. Obviously, rare sleep is a place we want to be deep in and understand all the different things happening in terms of a develop from the development perspective, and be in a position where if opportunities present themselves to add an asset to our portfolio. We're in a position, but recognizing that the most important thing we can do in the near-term is continuing to deliver on the launch and execute our current game plan. That creates the greatest optionality for us to determine where we take the company next. But rare sleep, we want to be deep in anything that would come across our desk outside of that in the near-term would have to pass a pretty high bar.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>So if we're bringing in an orexin, it's probably next year, not this year. Let's talk about what you're working on in the pipeline. The pediatric, give us just the work that's been done, the timelines and how much you think that will add, and then IIHs?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think the first comment I would make generally about our lifecycle strategy is that when we talk to physicians and we talk to them about LUMRYZ and narcolepsy, it's very quick. We get asked about pediatrics and IIH. So they were obvious, clear next steps for us to pursue from that standpoint, because we heard it directly from prescribers. Pediatric status is we filed our supplemental NDA back in November. We'll have an action date. We have an action date of September 7 of 2024. So that's a Saturday. The FDA won't work on a Saturday, but we would expect a decision either the Friday before, the Monday after. From that standpoint.</p><p>Right now, today, that represents, depending on which claims database you look at, at 3% to 5% of the current treated oxybate patient population, we think there's more potential out there beyond that. But I will say that as much as we've heard from patients who are eligible for LUMRYZ today, we hear comparable request and interest from parents who have children who are on an oxybate. So although the pediatric patient population isn't the largest subset, it certainly introduces additional patient population, and it addresses a very significant need in terms of the family, the parents, and the caregivers, who, as we've heard numerous times, that when you have a child who takes an oxybate, it just doesn't disrupt the child, it disrupts the family. So again, we have that well in advance, and we'll look forward to a potential decision and approval later this year.</p><p>In terms of IIH, we've spent quite a bit of time really trying to understand that opportunity, even more so as we've watched the twice-nightly advance in their launch over the last couple two plus years, or whatever it's been now. And with over 30,000 uniquely diagnosed IIH patients, another 12,000 or so who are co-diagnosed with IIH and/or narcolepsy, there's a robust patient population that with only one currently FDA approved treatment, with less than 10% penetration of that marketplace, we think there's a lot of opportunity and the thing we hear about IIH is that these patients, different from narcolepsy in that they really physically struggle at times with waking up, with the deep sleep inertia that they suffer from. So the opportunity to give them a full course of therapy and not force them to wake up, that physically is hard for many of these patients, is highly attractive from the clinician community.</p><p>So we've advanced that study quite from a planning standpoint quite far, since over the last couple of months, in an accelerated fashion, we would expect to be in the clinic with first patient enrolled and initiated in the second half, and as early as we can in the second half. So we get asked all the time about how long do we think that study will take. We haven't given specific guidance yet, only because we're still doing site feasibility and really assessing enrollment timelines and enrollment target populations by site. But if you look at the two predecessor trials, between the Harmony trial and the Jazz trial, it took between really little more than 12 months to a little under 18 months to complete. So I think that's a reasonable proxy, as we think about it now, recognizing that we haven't completed site feasibility, but we should be initiating that in the second half and be off and running.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, just for completeness, just remind everybody what's still outstanding from a litigation perspective with Jazz? What have we learned? What do we solve outstanding?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So the most recent event was the patent litigation. So the trial was held a little over a week ago, and the jury trial came back with a verdict just this past Monday, just a week ago. So the bottom line is, in terms of the verdict, it was a split decision. It was determined that we didn't infringe one of the patents, and the jury determined that the other patent that Jazz has is valid. And what the jury awarded was the equivalent of a 0.7% royalty to Jazz. And this is only past damages. What you see in the headlines is a 3.5% royalty, but what the jury determined is that a 3.5% royalty would be applied to approximately 20% of our launch to date revenues. So we refer to it as the equivalent of about a 0.7% royalty. That's where we stand today in terms of that particular piece of litigation.</p><p>The next steps to put on the calendar, we don't have the exact date, but the judge will have to make a final ruling on that jury decision, as well as a determination of what, if any, future royalties might apply.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, so that's something we're expecting in the next few months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's probably, I couldn't even give you a time frame, but I'll say hopefully, this calendar year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Oh, it could be later in the year. Okay, so that's one and then the other.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So the next upcoming event is on April 9. This is where Jazz sued FDA, believing that the approval of LUMRYZ should be vacated. It's not a jury trial. This is strictly API hearing. So probably 2 to 3 hours length, then the judge will decide after that date. We're hoping for a ruling, probably by the time we exit Q2 on that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>2Q, interesting. Okay. And that'll be it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>That'll be it as far as those two pieces, right. There are two instances where we've initiated litigation against Jazz. Those hearings are now scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Fourth quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>So pretty far on the future. I'm sure we'll have more questions later on, but we're still in the early phases of those.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>This is for you suing jazz for.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>For suing Jazz for misappropriation at trade secrets as well as antitrust.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Never a dull moment. Richard, how do you see the oxybate market right now as far as just what's happening with the generics kind of coming in? Is it having any impact on your business at all? Or are they taking a lot of market share? I can't quite figure it out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's a great question, Marc. What we can sort of see is, ah, what the authorized generics have done is predominantly cannibalized, branded Xyrem and have that switch. Clearly there may be some new starts, but it looks like it's predominantly swapping one for the other. And that's really been the main impact in the marketplace thus far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, that's what it kind of feels like. Right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>That's right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, Greg, what's kind of -- you talk to people and you finish a meeting and you're like, I don't think they appreciate X or Y in our business. What's still a little bit underappreciated?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Well, I think we like to call ourselves a show me story, right. When we share how we view the opportunity, how we view the market. I think we're a bit of a show me story. And I think we've started the trend with our first two quarters of launch that we are delivering or exceeding what folks thought we would be able to do. But I do think that there's probably two things that we tend to address when we talk to investors. The first one is the litigation, and we're coming, at least the litigation initiated by the other company. We're coming to a point in time over the next couple of months when most of that lift will be behind us, right. And there'll be much more clarity. And last Monday's decision was a major step forward from that clarity standpoint in a good way for us.</p><p>And then I would say the second piece is just what is the true potential of LUMRYZ in the marketplace? We have a very clear view of what we think multi source generics, what impact they will or won't have in the future. So we have those discussions for sure. So I think for us, and working with folks like yourself, is to continue to print really strong quarters and see you up your future forecast and potential and peak sales down the road, and as we continue to deliver and execute. But I think ultimately those are the two biggest things, is what's the real potential, which we think from our perspective, and all the six quant studies that Richard talked about, that it's $1 billion product opportunity if we can execute it on basically what physicians are reporting to us in surveys of large numbers, and we continue to clear the last couple of remaining litigation matters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>So $1 billion was what you think the Street still not at $1 billion. Where's the Street now you think?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>The street has its pretty wide range out there, but there are certainly a few people on the sell side who have north of $500 million, up to $700 million, $800 million. I think at a minimum, most are moving at least to the $500 million mark at this point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>So $500 million to $800 million is the range. So the average is somewhere in there. Most people that were closer to $500 million.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>That's been a consistent upward movement. And to Greg's point, we've always believed we're a show me story. As we continue to put up good numbers, good quarters, the estimates continue to rise appropriately.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>And just back on the litigation, I just want to make sure I understand something when the judge comes back and talks about this royalty that the jury kind of ruled on. Can the judge come back and say, this is absolutely crazy, that the jury is making you pay X or Y and up it significantly? I mean, is that even possible?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Well, listen, anything is possible, and I want to get too far over my skis and certainly speak for the judge.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>You infringed on a patent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>But I think the jury to decision certainly has to weigh into that. And 0.7% royalty, perhaps, is a starting point. Listen, we maintain we don't owe royalty at all. We'll continue to fight that fight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>On appeal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>But if you can think about it in terms of brackets, the way we think about it right now, it's 0.7% on one end. Perhaps it's 3.5% on the other end. But we have to see what the judge decides at the end of the day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>I just was wondering if there was any case studies where judges just take the jury award and just double, triple it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Not aware of any.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>If you double, 0.7%, it's 1.4%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>I hear you. I mean, even 3% wouldn't be -- I think most people walked away thinking it was 3.5% that day and said, that's fine.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>It's been a very consistent discussion we've had in all of our meetings here at your conference, which is why we wanted to clarify here on the fireside. It's really a net effective royalty.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Goodman:</emphasis></p><p>Well, it was confusing. I mean, it was in the press release, and you can't blame us for being confused. Thank you for joining us, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory J. Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Appreciate it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-76d96771c48157d798bcd29a35f690b7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTM-9433-RW7V-B3VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5177\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001W4J</classCode><className>AVADEL PHARMACEUTICALS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS339114 DENTAL EQUIPMENT &amp;

Chinese NEV Tax Break Plan  </p><p>Following up on its previous pledge to promote automobile purchases which showed a 7.3% jump in May auto sales, China introduced new tax breaks to purchase new energy vehicles (NEVs). The boost in auto sales resulted from targeted policies bolstering car purchases, including encouraging financial institutions to provide more lending for car purchases. </p><p>The new tax package exempts NEV purchase tax from 2024 to 2025 and cuts the purchase tax by 50% from 2026 to 2027. The 2024 to 2025 purchase tax can amount to as much as 30,000 yuan or $4,170 per car. </p><p>Cutting the purchase tax in half reduces the exemption value to 15,000 yuan or $2,085 from 2026 to 2027. This extension of the current NEV purchase tax exemption, worth around 115 billion yuan, is scheduled to end after 2023. China classifies NEVs are all-battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (HFCVs.)   Raging Forest Fire Losses  </p><p>On June 9, NIO released its fiscal first-quarter 2023 results for the quarter ending March 2023. NIO reported an EPS loss of ($0.36) which was $0.05 better than analyst expectations. Gross profit fell (88.8%) to $23.6 million YoY. Losses from operations climbed 133.6% YoY ($744.3 million). Net loss climbed 165.9% YoY to ($690.1 million). </p><p>The company reported revenues of $1.55 billion, up 7.7% year-over-year (YoY), but missed analyst estimates by ($80 million). Total deliveries in the quarter rose 20.1% to 31,041. Vehicle margin fell to 5.1%, down from 18.1%, and gross margins fell to 1.5% versus 14.6% in the year-ago period due to the EV pricing wars in China. The company ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.   Glass Half-Full CEO  </p><p>NIO CEO William Bin Li stayed optimistic, \"On May 24, 2023, NIO launched the All-New ES6, an all-round smart electric SUV and started its deliveries the next day. With exquisite design, high performance, superior comfort, and advanced digital systems, the All-New ES6 has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our users. </p><p>With the volume ramp-up of our new models, including the All-New ES6, our teams are well prepared for a solid growth in vehicle deliveries.\" For Q2 2023, the company expects sequential vehicle delivery to decline from 23K to 25K. Revenues are expected between $1.27 billion to $1.36 billion, down (15.1%) to (9%) YoY. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/NIO/price-target/\">NIO analyst ratings and price targets  </url> are at MarketBeat. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-to-read-stock-charts-for-beginners/\"> The definitive beginner's guide to reading stock charts  </url> can be found free on Marketbeat. </p><p> \u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/financial-terms/momentum-indicator-relative-strength-index/\"> Learn how to use the RSI indicator  </url> on MarketBeat.

According to news reporting out of Jaipur, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires have become a growing concern worldwide, with climate change exacerbating their frequency and intensity. In the Simlipal region of India, forest fires are relatively rare; however, in 2021, significant damage occurred in the buffer area's forests.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Suresh Gyan Vihar University, \"Understanding the driving factors behind these events is essential for developing effective management strategies. This study investigates the impact of hydro-meteorological conditions on forest fire causes in the Simlipal region by analyzing Terra climatic data and geo-statistics for the period of 1984 to 2021. Long-term trends were determined using non-parametric tests on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Our findings reveal that the maximum burned area location has a decreasing trend in Land Surface Temperature (LST), with a small portion (&lt;10%) showing an increasing trend (0.02 degrees C/year) near burned locations. Wind speed is decreasing at a rate of -0.006 m/s/year. The sudden forest fires are caused by the combined effect of increasing LST and decreasing wind speed in some areas (&lt;10% of the region). However, the major factor contributing to forest fires in the entire area is the rising trend of annual potential water deficit and actual evapotranspiration, as well as an increasing trend of minimum temperature. The soil moisture deficit during the summer season, especially between 2012 and 2021, contributed to forest fires in the burned area. The soil moisture deficit during the summer season, particularly from 2012 to 2021, played a significant role in the occurrence of forest fires in the affected area. The study emphasized the need for increased attention to this region in order to preserve biodiversity, which was assessed through an analysis of burned severity mapping in GEE (Google Earth Engine). These findings have important implications for future forest management strategies in the Simlipal region. Climate variability is likely to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of forest fires in the region, necessitating effective management strategies to mitigate their impact. Such strategies could involve improving fire prevention and control measures, such as creating fire breaks and increasing the availability of fire-fighting equipment, as well as enhancing forest monitoring systems to detect potential fires early.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, efforts to address climate change, proper management of land use practices, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions could help to mitigate the future impacts of forest fires in the Simlipal region and elsewhere.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Uncovering the Hydro-meteorological Drivers Responsible for Forest Fires Utilizing Geospatial Techniques.

In Quebec alone, more than 20,000 square miles has burned so far this year \u2014 an area 176 times larger than all of last year.</p><p>Though the analysis, released Tuesday, looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \u201cand we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\u201d Boulanger said.</p><p>Ongoing wildfires have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index \u2014 which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation \u2014 averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.</p><p>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.</p><p>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year\u2019s fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.</p><p>\u201cTo me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\u201d said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s not just 10% more likely or 20%\u00a0\u2014 there\u2019s a 600%\u201d greater likelihood.</p><p>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn\u2019t capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cI've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time\u00a0\u2026 and fire season is not over yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. \u201cIt kind of feeds on itself,\u201d he added.</p><p>Canada\u2019s fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country.</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 yet researchers say they were disproportionately affected by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest.</p><p>Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. \"That's a very big wake-up call\u201d for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said.</p><p>Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are \u201cthe new reality\u201d and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,\" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p>He added: \u201cWe're really in uncharted territory.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-10764482</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691C-6431-JCM7-R009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 25, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

In order to get first hand information about reserve,local issues etc. the Union Minister had directed that henceforth these meetings will be held outside Delhi in forest areas or in tiger reserves.</p><p>On the occassion minister said that we should promote our tigers reserves across country which has immense flora and fauna while at the same time ensuring the livelihoods of the people dependant on forests.</p><p>Minister also pressed on active involvement of locals for conservation and better development of forest area and tiger reserve. He said that we should conduct meeting with all stakeholders including forest officials who deal with different issues, local villagers, experts, students for the same.</p><p>On the occasion around 100 air gun were surrendered by the local villagers. Rampant use of Air gun was a problem in north eastern states. Arunachal Pradesh in March 2021, had started the Air Gun Surrender Abhiyaan which has so far yielded great results.</p><p>The Minister released standard operating procedure for tiger reintroduction and supplementation in wild , forest fire audit protocol for tiger reserves , technical manual on MEE of Tiger reserves in India prepared by NTCA.</p><p>India harbors about 70% of the world's tiger population in wild. The tigers occupy different landscapes in the country. While some landscapes have rich and viable populations in accordance with the habitat and prey-base, there are some habitats that are under occupied for various regions but have potential to support better tiger population. There may be some more habitats where the population of tiger have disappeared.</p><p>In this scenario, it sometimes becomes imperative to re-introduce tigers or supplement the existing population. This being a sensitive and technical task, the NTCA has prepared a Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) to deal with the reintroduction and supplementation. The SOP takes into account, the scientific knowledge available on the subject as well as conditions that may be typical to India. To deal with tiger reintroduction and supplementation in the wild in areas where it was historically present but is now being extirpated or found in low densities viz-a-viz the carrying capacity, due to various reasons but welfare factors to foster tiger presence still exists or can be improved with adequate management intervention. Therefore, the NTCA is releasing a SOP titled, 'Tiger Reintroduction and Supplementation in Wild Protocol'.</p><p>Foret Fire Audit Protocol for Tiger Reserves</p><p>Forest Fires play a crucial role in maintaining the dynamics of forest. Fire can play a vital role in healthy forests, recycling nutrients, helping tree species regenerate, removing invasive weeds and pathogens and maintaining habitat for some wildlife. Occasional fires can keep down the fuel loads that feed larger, more destructive conflagration. However, as populations and demands on forest resources have grown, cycle of fire has spun out of the balance and these uncontrolled and repeated fires at short succession are one of the major causes behind forest degradation and biodiversity loss. Increasing forest fires have now become a global concern. So, in order to help the tiger reserve managers assess their fire preparedness and manage complete life cycle of forest fires, the NTCA has prepared a Forest Fire Audit Protocol for Tiger Reserves and is now being released.</p><p>Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) of Tiger Reserves in India</p><p>Survival of tigers is dependent on conservation and management efforts and to guage the success of conservation efforts as well as to guide management inputs, it is important to assess the management effectiveness of Tiger Reserves. India is amongst the selected countries in the world that have institutionalized the MEE Process. The globally accepted framework of Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) of tiger reserves has paved way for successfully assessing the tiger conservation efforts in the country. The MEE exercise in tiger reserves was initiated in 2006 and four cycle has been completed. Since then a lot of experience has been gained and need was felt revisit and review the whole process. Accordingly, a committee was constituted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority to revisit and review the MEE criteria for the 5th cycle of MEE exercise starting 2022. The intention was to bring about parity in the analysis of diverse tiger reserves of the country and to guide the evaluators with respect to the assessments to be made in the coming financial year. Based on the suggestions made by the committee, the technical manual on Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) of Tiger Reserves in India is being released by NTCA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125144854</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6567-BHG1-JCBF-S333-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 9, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000264</classCode><className>WILD CATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GS109</classCode><className>ARUNACHAL PRADESH, INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events.</p><p>Canada is in the middle of its worst wildfire season on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 59,000 square miles from one end of the country to the other, according the the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In Quebec alone, more than 20,000 square miles has burned so far this year - an area 176 times larger than all of last year.</p><p>Though the analysis, released Tuesday, looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \"and we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\" Boulanger said.</p><p>Ongoing wildfires have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>Fire Weather Index</p><p>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index - which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation - averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.</p><p>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.</p><p>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year's fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.</p><p>\"To me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\" said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \"It's not just 10% more likely or 20% - there's a 600%\" greater likelihood.</p><p>Broad impacts</p><p>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn't capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.</p><p>\"I've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time ... and fire season is not over yet,\" he said.</p><p>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. \"It kind of feeds on itself,\" he added.</p><p>Canada's fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country.</p><p>'New reality'</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous - First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit - yet researchers say they were disproportionately affected by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest.</p><p>Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. \"That's a very big wake-up call\" for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said.</p><p>Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are \"the new reality\" and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,\" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p>He added: \"We're really in uncharted territory.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DARRYL DYCK, The Canadian Press via AP The McDougall Creek wildfire burns on the mountainside above houses in West Kelowna, B.C., on Aug. 18.

Now, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have discovered that wildfires may have even bigger climate impacts than previously thought.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a new study published Aug. 7 in Nature Geoscience, researchers led by Rajan Chakrabarty, the Harold D. Jolley Career Development Associate Professor in the Department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering, found that wildfires are causing a much greater warming effect than has been accounted for by climate scientists. The work, which focuses on the role of \"dark brown carbon\" an abundant but previously unknown class of particles emitted as part of wildfire smoke highlights an urgent need to revise climate models and update approaches for the changing environment.</p><p>In this timelapse video, view the NOAA-CHEM Twin Otter sampling forest fire smoke in eastern Oregon from Granite Gulch Fire, during August 2019. (Video: NOAA OMAO)</p><p>To conduct a comprehensive analysis of what makes up wildfire smoke plumes, Chakrabarty's team spent 45 days traveling to different wildfire locations in the western United States, where they sampled gaseous smoke and aerosol species and analyzed their chemical and optical properties. This research was conducted as part of the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign, a joint venture led by the National Aeronatics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>\"The conventional understanding has been that dark plumes of wildfire smoke contain black carbon soot, which absorbs solar radiation, while lighter plumes contain mostly organic carbon that scatters sunlight, meaning it offsets the absorption or warming effect of soot,\" Chakrabarty said. \"Typically, climate models ignore or dismiss organic carbon as insignificant compared to black carbon when it comes to warming, but that is not what field observations reveal.</p><p>\"This is not a binary picture. Instead, we are looking at an entire continuum where there is strong light absorption by organic carbon, or dark brown carbon, similar to black carbon,\" he said.</p><p>During their sampling of ground and airborne smoke from largescale wildfires, Chakrabarty's team encountered an abnormally strong light absorber in plumes that wasn't black carbon, yet it accounted for more than half of observed total absorption.</p><p>Chakrabarty turned to Rohan Mishra, associate professor of mechanical engineering and materials science, to investigate this unknown material and its properties. Arashdeep Thind, who earned a doctorate in materials science and engineering in 2021 while working in Mishra's lab, used a sophisticated electron microscope housed at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, a U.S. Department of Energy user facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to measure the optical properties of individual particles from the smoke samples Chakrabarty's team collected.</p><p>\"We knew there was something unusual with this material in its composition, structure and absorption spectrum,\" Mishra said. \"By looking at the local atomic structure of the dark brown particles that are the size of only a few tens of nanometers and simultaneously measuring their optical properties using the electron microscope at ORNL, we were able to decipher that these particles are similar to black carbon. It's likely that they form similarly to soot in the high-temperature flames along the leading edges of wildfires.\"</p><p>Mishra and Chakrabarty found that dark brown carbon absorbs slightly less light than black carbon on a per particle basis, but it is four times more abundant in plumes. This means that stealthy dark brown carbon particles in wildfires probably result in much more climate warming than previously recognized.</p><p>They also noted that these particles absorb wavelengths of light from ultraviolet to near infrared, covering the entire visible spectrum. Surprisingly, this potent brown carbon is resistant to sunlight-driven photochemical bleaching that makes light-absorbing organic aerosols lose their absorptivity in the atmosphere.</p><p>The team's findings have broad implications. With wildfires predicted to rise globally in the coming decades, the role of dark brown carbon produced in fires will be even more impactful. Chakrabarty and Mishra say this underscores the need to harness multidisciplinary collaboration to revise existing climate models to account for the unexpected effects of brown carbon in wildfire smoke.

This initially caused a spike in shares of Chinese EV maker  as well as peers  and . However, NIO shares continued to fall lower afterward. NIO shares traded as high as $66.99 in January 2021 but have been on a heart-wrenching decline to $7.00 lows in May 2023. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares are edging closer to the apex on their weekly descending triangle, setting up a resolution for a breakout or a breakdown in the coming weeks. The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-li-auto-head-and-shoulders-above-its-chinese-counterparts/\">EV</url> pricing wars have been a race to the bottom as NIO's Q1 2023 margins fell to a stunning low of 5.1%, down from 18.1% in the year-ago period. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chinese NEV Tax Break Plan </emphasis></p><p>Following up on its previous pledge to promote automobile purchases which showed a 7.3% jump in May auto sales, China introduced new tax breaks to purchase new energy vehicles (NEVs). The boost in auto sales resulted from targeted policies bolstering car purchases, including encouraging financial institutions to provide more lending for car purchases. </p><p>The new tax package exempts NEV purchase tax from 2024 to 2025 and cuts the purchase tax by 50% from 2026 to 2027. The 2024 to 2025 purchase tax can amount to as much as 30,000 yuan or $4,170 per car. </p><p>Cutting the purchase tax in half reduces the exemption value to 15,000 yuan or $2,085 from 2026 to 2027. This extension of the current NEV purchase tax exemption, worth around 115 billion yuan, is scheduled to end after 2023. China classifies NEVs are all-battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (HFCVs.) <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raging Forest Fire Losses </emphasis></p><p>On June 9, NIO released its fiscal first-quarter 2023 results for the quarter ending March 2023. NIO reported an EPS loss of ($0.36) which was $0.05 better than analyst expectations. Gross profit fell (88.8%) to $23.6 million YoY. Losses from operations climbed 133.6% YoY ($744.3 million). Net loss climbed 165.9% YoY to ($690.1 million). </p><p>The company reported revenues of $1.55 billion, up 7.7% year-over-year (YoY), but missed analyst estimates by ($80 million). Total deliveries in the quarter rose 20.1% to 31,041. Vehicle margin fell to 5.1%, down from 18.1%, and gross margins fell to 1.5% versus 14.6% in the year-ago period due to the EV pricing wars in China. The company ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Glass Half-Full CEO </emphasis></p><p>NIO CEO William Bin Li stayed optimistic,  On May 24, 2023, NIO launched the All-New ES6, an all-round smart electric SUV and started its deliveries the next day. With exquisite design, high performance, superior comfort, and advanced digital systems, the All-New ES6 has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our users. </p><p>With the volume ramp-up of our new models, including the All-New ES6, our teams are well prepared for a solid growth in vehicle deliveries.  For Q2 2023, the company expects sequential vehicle delivery to decline from 23K to 25K. Revenues are expected between $1.27 billion to $1.36 billion, down (15.1%) to (9%) YoY. </p><p> are at MarketBeat. </p><p> can be found free on Marketbeat. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis> on MarketBeat. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Weekly Descending Triangle </emphasis></p><p>The weekly candlestick chart on NIO has been downtrend after peeking at $24.43 in January 2022. Shares continued to make lower highs on bouncing, forming the descending trendline against a flat-bottom trendline around $7.22. The weekly RSI has been rejected at the 50-band since the start of the triangle. </p><p>The weekly market structure low (MSL) at $10.75 continues to be a formidable resistance as it has rejected breakout attempts as recently as June 12, 2023. The weekly 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) is flattening at $9.06. The apex point is nearing, so a breakdown or breakout is imminent. Pullback supports are at $8.07, $7.33 triangle flat-bottom trendline, $6.00 and $5.65. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNWS-m5773026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JJ-MX11-JB40-X0K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 American Banking and Market News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Banking and Market News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 26, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOZ5</classCode><className>TAX BREAKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000141</classCode><className>AUTOMOTIVE SALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPM9</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5Y</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKET UPDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>TAX LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47237-0\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47237-0</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>2024 aerospace and defense industry outlook</p><p>In 2023, the aerospace and defense (A&amp;D) industry witnessed a revival in product demand. In the aerospace sector, domestic commercial aviation revenue passenger kilometers surpassed prepandemic levels in most countries.1 This surge in air travel led to an increased demand for new aircraft and aftermarket products and services. In the US defense sector, new geopolitical challenges, along with the prioritization of modernizing the military, drove robust demand in 2023, particularly for weapons and next-generation capabilities.2</p><p>The demand for A&amp;D products and services is expected to continue into 2024. On the commercial side, travel is likely to continue its upward trajectory. In the defense segment, demand for products is expected to continue to increase as geopolitical instability grows. Furthermore, companies in emerging markets, such as advanced air mobility, are expected to advance testing and certification as they prepare for commercialization.</p><p>While these trends are likely to drive both domestic and international spending, the increased demand may cause A&amp;D companies to deal with new challenges as they grapple with ongoing ones such as supply chain issues, longer lead times, and a talent shortage.</p><p>To address these challenges, A&amp;D companies may further embrace digitalization and adopt emerging, advanced technologies and, thus, could achieve profitability by both addressing their cost challenges and initiating the development of novel revenue streams. Such technologies may be foundational for A&amp;D companies in creating a more resilient supply chain, mitigating logistical issues, attracting new talent, and rapidly creating new products.</p><p>As A&amp;D companies prepare for the year ahead, there are some key trends they may consider focusing on to take on the challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities, with digitalization being the unifying theme across the trends:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Talent: A&amp;D companies are addressing workforce challenges amid rising demand and changing workforce expectations   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Supply chain: Global supply chain complexity is driving a multitiered solution   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Digital transformation: The industry can unlock growth and efficiency through digital technologies   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    New product introduction: Evolving customer preferences and growing emphasis on sustainability are fueling product innovations   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Defense and commercial spending: Industry spending is helping drive growth and innovation   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>For full report, see:   <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html\">https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/aerospace-defense/aerospace-and-defense-industry-outlook.html</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.arsa.org/\">Aeronautical Repair Station Association</url>   (ARSA)</p><p>A   <url normalizedValue=\"http://arsa.org/\">RSA</url>   is devoted to the worldwide civil aviation maintenance industry\u2014from its global corporations to the small, independent businesses.   <url normalizedValue=\"http://arsa.org/\">ARSA</url>   members are located on five continents and in nearly 20 countries.</p><p>The association's experts create tools for members to navigate the maze of government mandates while enhancing safety, efficiency and productivity.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://arsa.org/\">ARSA</url>   is managed by the law firm of   <url normalizedValue=\"http://potomac-law.com/\">Obadal, Filler, MacLeod &amp; Klein, P.L.C.</url>   , which provides management, government affairs, and legal services to trade associations and transportation-centric companies.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arsa.org/about/\">https://arsa.org/about/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aia-aerospace.org/\">Aerospace Industries Association</url>   (AIA)</p><p>For over 100 years, the American aerospace and defense industry has shaped the world around us in countless ways with immeasurable impact.

The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:</p><p>Core Operating Earnings/(loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(loss) Per Share</p><p>Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/ (loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and postretirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12.</p><p>Free Cash Flow</p><p>Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.</p><p>For full release, see:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/2024-03-Mar-31-8K-PR-Ex-99-1.pdf\">https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/2024-03-Mar-31-8K-PR-Ex-99-1.pdf</url></p><p>GE Aviation Group (NYSE: GE)</p><p>GE Aviation Group (GE Aviation) is comprised of subsidiaries of the United States company, General Electric Co.

Our teams achieved this milestone while delivering strong results in the first quarter led by significant profit and cash growth at GE Aerospace.\"</p><p>Culp continued, \"At GE Aerospace, Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies drove double-digit revenue, profit and free cash flow growth in the quarter. Given our solid start to the year and outlook for the remainder of 2024, we are raising our full-year profit and free cash flow guidance. Moving forward as a focused global aerospace leader, we will continue to prioritize safety, quality, delivery, and cost \u2014 always in that order \u2014 while also investing in our future and driving long term profitable growth.\"</p><p>GE delivered a strong last quarter as a combined company, reflecting great momentum in both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. In 1Q, orders were up substantially and revenue improved with all segments contributing to growth. Adjusted operating profit* was up more than 50% with 300 basis points of organic margin expansion*. Adjusted EPS* was up more than 3 times and free cash flow* (FCF*) was up more than 5 times.</p><p>GE Aerospace had a solid start to the year with double-digit growth across orders, revenue and operating profit, and free cash flow* doubling year-over-year. Orders grew 34% and revenue grew 15% from pricing, spare parts volume, and increasing deliveries in widebody and Defense. Operating profit* was $1.5 billion, up 24% with both Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies delivering double-digit profit improvement. Operating profit margins* of 19.1% expanded 140 basis points primarily driven by pricing, services volume and favorable mix.</p><p>For Commercial Engines &amp; Services, orders grew 34% and revenue was up 16% with services +12%, and equipment +31%. In Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies, orders were up 34%. Revenue increased 18%, driven by growth in deliveries, pricing and classified programs.</p><p>As more people fly, and fly more often, we're experiencing a tremendous demand cycle. With FLIGHT DECK, our proprietary lean operating model, we're delivering for our customers while maintaining the highest standards of safety and quality, with greater predictability and speed. However, we continue to face material availability challenges impacting our deliveries and we have intensified our efforts working with suppliers to problem solve these issues. At the same time, we remain focused on advancing the technology building blocks to define the future of flight.</p><p>The strength of our operational and financial fundamentals gives us the confidence in the capital allocation framework we laid out at Investor Day, including returning 70% to 75% of our available cash to investors through dividends and our newly authorized $15 billion buy-back program. And we are already taking action, initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.28, a 250% increase. Overall, GE Aerospace is well-positioned to create significant shareholder value while investing in growth and innovation.</p><p>Based on GE Aerospace's strong start and constructive outlook for the rest of the year, we are updating our full-year and business-specific guidance, and expect:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Low-double-digit adjusted revenue* growth, operating profit* of $6.2 to $6.6 billion, up from $6.0 to $6.5 billion, adjusted EPS* of $3.80 to $4.05, and free cash flow* of greater than $5 billion with over 100% conversion.   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>As a reminder, this is the final quarter that we will report GE's consolidated results and beginning in the second quarter of 2024, GE Aerospace will present Commercial Engines &amp; Services (CES) and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies (DPT) as our reporting segments.</p><p>We couldn't be more excited about our path ahead as a standalone company, and we thank you for your continued interest in GE Aerospace.

The first-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.</p><p>Aerospace Technologies sales for the first quarter were up 18% on an organic  1  basis year over year, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, as a result of ongoing strength in both commercial aviation and defense and space. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment, up over 20% year over year for the second straight quarter as shipset deliveries continued to increase sequentially. Commercial aftermarket grew 17% on increased flight activity, led by air transport. Defense and space grew 16% year over year as demand remained strong, while supply chain improvements allowed us to execute on our robust order book. Segment margin expanded 150 basis points year over year to 28.1%, driven by commercial excellence and volume leverage, partially offset by cost inflation and mix pressure within our original equipment business.</p><p>Industrial Automation sales for the first quarter were down 13% on an organic  1  basis year over year. Sales decline was primarily due to lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions. Sales in our short-cycle productivity solutions and services business were down versus the prior year, but orders grew double digits year over year and sequentially for the second straight quarter, an encouraging sign of recovering demand. Our lifecycle solutions and services business was a bright spot in the quarter, up double-digits year over year. Segment margin contracted 200 basis points to 16.8% driven by lower volume leverage and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence.</p><p>Building Automation sales for the first quarter were down 3% on an organic  1  basis year over year. Building solutions continues to be a bright spot, with double-digit growth in projects and another quarter of growth in services. Strength in building solutions was offset by building products, where lower volumes led to sales declines across fire, security, and building management systems. Segment margin contracted 120 basis points to 24.0%, slightly above fourth quarter levels, due to product mix headwinds and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence.</p><p>Energy and Sustainability Solutions sales for the first quarter were up 5% on an organic  1  basis year over year. Advanced materials led ESS with 6% sales growth, primarily driven by another quarter of double-digit improvement in fluorine products. UOP sales grew 3% in the quarter as a result of double-digit growth in petrochemical catalyst shipments and refining equipment, partially offset by expected challenging year-over-year comps from large gas processing equipment projects. Segment margin contracted 70 basis points to 19.8% as one-time factory restart costs were partially offset by favorable business mix and productivity actions.</p><p>For full release, see:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2024/04/honeywell-delivers-strong-first-quarter-results-and-beats-earnings-guidance\">https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2024/04/honeywell-delivers-strong-first-quarter-results-and-beats-earnings-guidance</url></p><p>L3Harris Technologies Group (NYSE: LHX)</p><p>The parent company of the international L3Harris Technologies Group is the United States company, L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

First quarter 2024 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services. First quarter 2024 net earnings totaled $944 million, or $6.32 per diluted share, as compared with $842 million, or $5.50 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>\"Northrop Grumman's first quarter performance includes 9 percent sales and double digit earnings growth, showing we are off to a strong start to the year. We're also seeing the results of our focus on productivity and cost efficiency to improve operating margin in many of our businesses,\" said Kathy Warden, chair, chief executive officer and president. \"Robust global defense spending and our strong backlog, along with expanding margins, continue to support our multi-year outlook for free cash flow growth.\"</p><p>Sales</p><p>First quarter 2024 sales increased $832 million, or 9 percent, due to higher sales at all four sectors, including 18 percent growth at Aeronautics Systems. First quarter 2024 sales reflect continued strong demand for our products and services.</p><p>Operating Income and Margin Rate</p><p>First quarter 2024 operating income increased $124 million, or 13 percent, and operating margin rate increased to 10.6 percent, primarily due to higher segment operating income and a benefit associated with the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.</p><p>Segment Operating Income and Margin Rate</p><p>First quarter 2024 segment operating income increased $102 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to higher sales. Segment operating margin rate increased to 10.9 percent and reflects higher operating margin rates at Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate at Space Systems.</p><p>Federal and Foreign Income Taxes</p><p>The first quarter 2024 effective tax rate increased to 16.5 percent from 15.6 percent in the prior year period principally due to higher interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits.</p><p>Net Earnings</p><p>First quarter 2024 net earnings increased $102 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to a 13 percent increase in operating income and a $36 million increase in the non-operating FAS pension benefit, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.</p><p>Cash Flows</p><p>First quarter 2024 cash used in operating activities was comparable with the prior year period. Higher net earnings were offset by changes in trade working capital. First quarter 2024 free cash flow increased $35 million, or 3 percent, principally due to lower capital expenditures largely driven by timing. The net use of cash during the first quarter is consistent with the company's historical timing of operating cash flows, which are generally more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year.</p><p>Awards and Backlog</p><p>First quarter 2024 net awards totaled $6.5 billion and backlog totaled $78.9 billion. Significant first quarter new awards include $3.1 billion for restricted programs (primarily at Aeronautics Systems, Space Systems, and Mission Systems). As previously disclosed, in January 2024, the company received a termination for convenience in our restricted Space business. The company reduced unfunded backlog by $1.6 billion during the first quarter of 2024 related to the termination.</p><p>For full release:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/9be084e2-5e58-4b17-b7c2-b349bd85caf4\">https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/9be084e2-5e58-4b17-b7c2-b349bd85caf4</url></p><p>Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX)</p><p>The parent company of the Raytheon Technologies Group is the United States company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX).</p><p>Raytheon Technologies Corporation describes as its reportable segments and businesses: Collins Aerospace, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense (RMD).

When we provide our expectation for adjusted EPS and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS and expected cash flow from operations) is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity, and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures, and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results. See \"Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p>Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p>RTX Corporation (\"RTX\" or \"the Company\") reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP information presented provides investors with additional useful information but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the Company's ongoing business performance. Other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparisons with such other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP appears in the tables in this Appendix. Below are our non-GAAP financial measures:</p><p>Non-GAAP measure</p><p>Definition</p><p>Adjusted net sales</p><p>Represents consolidated net sales (a GAAP measure), excluding net significant and/or non-recurring items1 (hereinafter referred to as \"net significant and/or non-recurring items\").</p><p>Organic sales</p><p>Organic sales represents the change in consolidated net sales (a GAAP measure), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the preceding twelve months and net significant and/or non-recurring items.</p><p>Adjusted operating profit (loss) and margin</p><p>Adjusted operating profit (loss) represents operating profit (loss) (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs, acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or non-recurring items.

It is the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 our Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station. Soon we will be the first private company to take humans there as well.</p><p>Reusability</p><p>SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which historically has flown only once.</p><p>Compare that to a commercial airliner - each new plane costs about the same as Falcon 9 but can fly multiple times per day and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of traveling to space by a hundredfold.</p><p>While most rockets are designed to burn up on reentry, SpaceX rockets can not only withstand reentry but can also successfully land back on Earth and refly again.</p><p>Landing</p><p>SpaceX's family of Falcon launch vehicles are the first and only orbital class rockets capable of reflight. Depending on the performance required for the mission, Falcon lands on one of our autonomous spaceport droneships out on the ocean or one of our landing zones near our launch pads.</p><p>SpaceX Facilities</p><p>California - Build Facility</p><p>SpaceX designs and builds its reusable rockets and spacecraft at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California. As a company, SpaceX is vertically integrated, building the vast majority of the vehicle on the Hawthorne campus. SpaceX headquarters remains one of the few facilities in the world where you can see an entire launch vehicle or spacecraft come together under one roof.</p><p>Texas - Testing Facility</p><p>SpaceX tests its engines, vehicle structures, and systems at a 4,000-acre state-of-the-art rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. Outfitted with 16 specialized test stands, the facility validates for flight every Merlin engine that powers the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, and every Draco thruster that controls the Dragon spacecraft.</p><p>Florida - Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Space Launch Complex 40</p><p>The site's location on the southeast coast of the US provides access to a wide range of low and medium inclination orbits frequently used by communications and Earth-observing satellites and by supply missions to the International Space Station. The site also allows access to geostationary orbits, as well as departures to the Moon and interplanetary destinations.</p><p>Florida - Kennedy Space Center, Launch Complex 39A</p><p>SpaceX is honored to launch from Kennedy Space Center's historic Launch Complex 39A, home of the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. In addition to commercial satellite launches and space station resupply missions, LC-39A supports crew launches of the Dragon spacecraft.</p><p>California - Vanderberg Air Force Base, Space Launch Complex 4 East</p><p>The site's location on the California coastline provides customers with access to high inclination and polar orbits, frequently used by satellite communication constellations, defense intelligence and Earth-observing satellites, and some lunar missions. Launches from Vandenberg heading straight south traverse open ocean all the way to the Antarctic, by which time the vehicles have long since reached orbit.</p><p>Texas - South Texas Launch Site</p><p>SpaceX is building the world's first commercial launch site designed for orbital missions in the Cameron County area of South Texas.

Whitefish began to tackle its housing crisis with the approval of developments and work done by committees and nonprofits. Groups found ways to donate money and time to those in need, while individuals continued to shine in unique and exciting ways. Below are a few of the highlights or moments that stand out from the last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Housing</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whitefish kicked off its new Growth Policy, Vision Whitefish 2045, by inviting the public to join in the process. A growth policy is intended to be a guide for making decisions about the city's future and one of the policy's goals is to consider how to ensure adequate housing.</p><p>The Whitefish City Council approved several housing projects in 2023.</p><p>In June, the Whitefish Corridor Community, a 146-unit apartment complex to be located between Texas Avenue and Colorado Avenue north of Edgewood Place was approved. Forty-four of the units will be deed-restricted for affordability. The project is proposed by Ruis Texco LLC which is owned by Columbia Falls developer Mick Ruis.</p><p>In November, developer Alberto Valner got the green light for his project called Alpine 93/40. The project is located on about 10 acres east of U.S. Highway 93 and south of Montana 40. The development includes 210 residential apartment units and no more than 15,000 square feet of commercial space. Ten percent of the units will be deed-restricted and Valner agreed to offer a discount to local businesses on the market rate units.</p><p>The council voted unanimously to approve a zone change and planned unit development for two parcels on Edgewood Place to develop 42 multi-family dwelling units in two buildings on the 1.66 acres. Eight of the units will be deed-restricted. One building is located along the northern property line and will have 26 units while the other is situated to the east with 16 units.</p><p>In the November election, voters approved a reallocation of the resort tax to support community housing. Ten percent of the 3% resort tax funds will be designated specifically for community housing development projects and programs. The reallocation will begin in February 2025, after the Haskill Basin Conservation Easement bond is paid off at the end of January 2025.</p><p>Explore Whitefish reallocated funding to support Housing Whitefish in a more significant way, doubling its support for affordable housing initiatives.</p><p>In December, Explore Whitefish penned a check to Housing Whitefish for $52,012, the first increased Community Sustainability Fund allocation for housing. The fund is the 1% voluntary assessment that Explore Whitefish manages from revenues collected at member restaurants, hotels and transportation companies. Fifty percent of the funds collected at member restaurants now support affordable workforce housing.</p><p>The Whitefish City Council pledged its support for the new Whitefish Workforce Assistance Program and, shortly thereafter, was pleased to learn that local businesses were stepping up to help.</p><p>The city committed to contributing $200,000 to the program, and the Whitefish Chamber of Commerce and the Whitefish Convention and Visitors Bureau (Explore Whitefish) each contributed $25,000.</p><p>The goal of the program is to help full-time employees successfully live and work in the Whitefish area by providing rental assistance to retain housing or to get into rental units.</p><p>New faces</p><p>In January, Dwarne Hawkins became the new executive director of the Whitefish Housing Authority (WHA). Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Hawkins worked for the Housing Authority of Baltimore City. Later, Hawkins worked with the Housing Authority in East St. Louis.</p><p>\"We try our best to do what is necessary to put more of a dent into homelessness, put more of a dent into poverty,\" Hawkins said in an interview with the Pilot. \"It is technically the Housing Authority that is that transition \u2014 it's almost like a gateway to upward mobility.</p><p>\"We have our hands in a lot but we're just trying to help the system to be better,\" Hawkins added. \"We're in it for the well-being of the community we're in.\"</p><p>In April, Julie Mullins took the helm of Explore Whitefish, also known as the Whitefish Convention and Visitors Bureau (WCVB). Mullins brought over 30 years of hotel and destination management experience to the job, including 15 years with Choose Chicago, the Chicago CVB.</p><p>\"I want to hear from the residents to understand what are the real pain points and then really throw our focus,\" Mullins told the Pilot. \"If it is affordable housing then how do we work as a community to provide more affordable housing which then can help us with our mission.\"</p><p>Whitefish hired Cole Hadley to be the new Fire Chief. The department's previous chief, Joe Page, retired in the summer and Hadley began his new position in September. Hadley has been with the Whitefish Fire Department since 2009. He served as a captain for six years and as the union president for the last seven.</p><p>\"It's great to be able to be born and raised in the valley and then be able to continue to move up through this department to the chief position,\" Hadley said in September. \"This is my home. This is the community that I've worked in the longest, here in Whitefish, so I have some really strong ties to this community and to the valley as a whole.\"</p><p>In November, the Whitefish Community Foundation named Alan Davis as its new president and CEO. Davis joined the foundation after working with Whitefish Legacy Partners, where he led that organization's fundraising efforts to build and maintain the Whitefish Trail since 2015. He succeeded Linda Engh-Grady, who retired at the end of 2022.</p><p>\"I am excited to work with all of our community donors and nonprofits to increase their impact, especially during a time when rapid growth is creating gaps in our community's most basic needs,\" Davis told the Daily Inter Lake.</p><p>Continuing efforts</p><p>Former Big Mountain ski patroller and Whitefish resident, Gary Cabell, inspired a band of people to get together and help make his life easier. Cabell lived for years without running water but medical issues last year affected his ability to haul water. Due to his physical limitations, his home needed improvements and he needed a bit of help with medical bills.</p><p>The call for assistance went out and helping hands showed up. Their efforts not only brought running water to Cabell's cabin, but they assisted with other basic needs like stacking wood, shoveling snow and keeping his stairs clear. A GoFundMe campaign was also established for Cabell.</p><p>\"It's pretty fun now. Shower, use the toilet and do the dishes, you know, I mean, a lot has changed,\" Cabell said last spring when asked about getting used to his new plumbing. \"It feels good. I think that when you don't have all the necessities, you learn to adapt and your appreciation value changes a lot. And I'm really appreciating this.\"</p><p>Early in the summer, DREAM Adaptive Recreation and Flathead Area Mountain Bikers (FAMB) teamed up to make trails rideable for a wider range of the mountain biking community.</p><p>The two organizations refreshed Otter Pop, one of the most popular trails on Spencer Mountain north of Whitefish, making it wide enough to handle three-wheeled bikes.</p><p>\"It's exciting to do any of these projects but it's even more exciting when leaders of other organizations grasp onto what we're trying to do and you can tell it's in their heart,\" said DREAM Executive Director Julie Tickle of working with FAMB. \"They are not just going through the motions.\"</p><p>\"DREAM has not asked us to make the trail easier. That is not the intention,\" said Ron Brandt, executive director of FAMB. \"You can make the trail work for everyone and it doesn't negatively affect the experience for two-wheeled bikes.\"</p><p>Whitefish Legacy Partners enjoyed another successful Whitefish Trail Hootenanny in 2023 and the nonprofit continues its work to ensure conservation, recreation and education on the lands around Whitefish for future generations.</p><p>Whitefish Legacy Partners worked with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to make improvements to the Smith Lake area, including a dock, a viewing platform and a bench. They also rebuilt the trail that leads to the south end of the lake. The trail is more sustainable, will experience less erosion, and features crib steps, which are easier for people to use.</p><p>On July 29, a human-caused fire was sparked by equipment in a dry hayfield north of Delrey Road and spread into forested areas of the Stillwater State Forest. Fire crews were quick to jump on the wildfire with a heavy aerial and ground attack that knocked down the initial blaze that evening.</p><p>The fire was initially detected by the Werner Peak Lookout. Aerial support was dispatched, including Type 1, 2 and 3 helicopters. Five engines, two water tenders, a hand crew and hotshot crew also assisted. No evacuations were issued.</p><p>Schools</p><p>Voters turned down a $33.7 million bond issue put forward by the Whitefish School District that would have funded an expansion of the high school and its athletic facilities. The measure failed 2,313 to 2,161.</p><p>About $22.1 million of the bond would have gone toward adding classrooms, shops and labs to the high school. The remaining $11.6 million would have funded the construction of an athletic complex for the high school. The school district now is back to the drawing board, considering ways to handle the increasing enrollment at the high school and figuring out the next steps to present another bond for the high school expansion.</p><p>The Whitefish High School music department saw a record number of musicians earn all-state honors. In addition to sophomore alto Scarlet Burke, an all-state honoree, seven students from grades 7-12 in WHS choir director Sky Thoreson's choirs were selected for the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) All-Northwest Honor Choirs.</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Whitefish Pilot (Whitefish, Mont.)

Culler and the Board of Aldermen, John N. Mackall, chairman of the State Roads Commission, R. Paul Smith, representing the Potomac Public Service Company, and others. The square between All Saints and South streets will be repaired and there is a likelihood that instead of this asphalt street ending at Fifth street, it may be continued to Seventh street.</p><p>More money has been spent fighting forest fires in the Catoctin mountain region during the past few years that in all the rest of the state, Assistant Forest Warden R.

The City Club has been a meeting place for Frederick's who's who since 1988.

Nor is interagency cooperation in responding to and suppressing wildfires. But this summer has been far from normal, and in the case of Louisiana wildfires this August unprecedented.</p><p>\"For more than 40 days, we've experienced temperatures over 100 degrees with low relative humidity, sometimes dipping into the teens,\" said Wade Dubea, Louisiana State Forester. \"For Louisiana, which typically has a wetter, humid climate, this is record-breaking.\"</p><p>Lisa Lewis, Forest Supervisor of the USDA Forest Service Kisatchie National Forest grew up in Louisiana and said she has never experienced weather \"so hot, so dry, for so long.\" With such prolonged weather conditions, she recognizes no one agency can sustain such a wildfire response tempo and is appreciative of the cooperation among the USDA Forest Service, Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry and partners, having provided large air tankers, other aircraft and hundreds of support personnel.</p><p>According to the National Incident Management Situation Report (IMSR) a synopsis of wildland fire and all-hazard activity across the country the Southern Area remains the number one priority geographic area for wildfires nationally. Underscoring an already noteworthy North American summer fire season, this year is the first time on record that the Southern Area has been the top national priority area for wildfire response during this time of year when historically the West has experienced the most critical fire activity.</p><p>In fact, the only other time the Southern Area was the top priority region on the IMSR during the month of August was in 2005 for Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>This summer, the areas where many of the wildfires are occurring in Louisiana are the same areas where Hurricanes Delta and Laura left behind an abundance of downed trees and debris in 2020. This has created a tinderbox for fire conditions as the severity of the fire environment is influenced by the amount of available vegetative fuels, and how susceptible those fuels are to burn. This concern extends across the Southeast, where devastating hurricanes have, and continue to leave behind, conditions conducive to wildfire.</p><p>\"The fire environment is extreme. We only saw similar conditions back in 2000, but this year, we're having wildfires grow to over 10,000 acres, that run quickly and produce major crown fires in the tops of pines,\" said Dubea. \"That is totally unusual for us.\"</p><p>The impacts that these high-intensity wildfires are having on the landscape is also extreme.</p><p>\"Here in Texas, going out after a fire and seeing the devastation, it literally looks like a nuke was dropped,\" said Mandy Chumley, USDA Forest Service National Forests and Grasslands in Texas Public Affairs Specialist. \"The level of intensity of the fires and the effects on the landscape are what is unprecedented for me.\"</p><p>In Texas, 4,279 wildfires have burned 165,837 acres since Jan. 1, 2023. Texas AandM Forest Service personnel responded to 942 of these wildfires for 112,091 acres.</p><p>For perspective, on average during the month of August, Texas AandM Forest Service firefighters typically respond to 151 wildfires. This year, agency firefighters responded to 519 wildfires during the month. Likewise, Louisiana experienced an average of 34 wildfires for 295 acres in August during 2019-2022, while in 2023, there have been 555 wildfires for approximately 53,464 acres.</p><p>The response to these wildfires has also been monumental. On Aug. 24, Al Davis, Texas AandM Forest Service Director and Chair of the South Central Forest Fire Compact activated an interagency agreement that allows for enhanced personnel and equipment resource movement among states.</p><p>\"We are supporting the Texas AandM Forest Service and local fire resources to improve conditions in Texas,\" said Shardul Raval, Fire and Aviation Management director for the Forest Service's Southern Region. \"The interagency response has been robust.\"</p><p>In Texas, there are 322 personnel and 131 pieces of equipment from land management agencies from 36 states, and 52 aircraft staged and assisting in wildfire response. Also responding are more than 690 firefighters from Texas AandM Forest Service and Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System, to include those sent to assist with Louisiana wildfire response.</p><p>\"The current drought in Texas and Louisiana is unprecedented. Thankfully, fires on the National Forest and Grasslands in Texas have remained relatively small as a result of our prescribed fire program,\" said USDA Forest Service National Forests and Grasslands in Texas Forest Supervisor Kimpton Cooper. \"This has allowed the NFGT to support our state and federal partners with ground resources, heavy equipment and aircraft to protect the communities we serve. The collaborative effort between states, communities and federal agencies working together across boundaries is extraordinary.

In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state is only now recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildfires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.</p><p>DEM will hold the no-cost, four-day, and classroom- and field-based training course - with the curriculum designed by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) - at its George Washington Management Area office in Chepachet in June. It will qualify students to a higher skill designation level recognized by the NWCG and expand the state's capacity to respond to wildfires, which are expected to become more frequent as climate change continues to create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons.</p><p>\"DEM's Forest Fire Program works closely with Rhode Island fire departments to suppress wildfires,\" said Principal Forest Ranger and Training Officer Ben Arnold of the DEM Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment. \"We rely on municipal fire departments to fight wildfires and fire departments rely on us in the same way. This training will allow us to build the capacity needed to address the increasing wildfire activity we've seen in recent years. The program offers an opportunity to both DEM employees and Rhode Island firefighters who seek wildfire suppression training at the national standard.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, DEM announced a policy of increasing the use of prescribed fires in 2023. Arnold noted that training firefighters is one of the major goals of prescribed fires, so the training course aligns with DEM's forestry management strategy. \"We strongly believe that more planned, prescribed fires mean fewer unplanned, extreme wildfires,\" Arnold said.</p><p>Space will be limited with priority given to local municipal firefighters and DEM employees. Registration is open until Feb. 28. Acceptance letters will be sent notifying applicants of their admission.

No fires were found on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. One fire was detected on the Fremont-Winema National Forest. Two aerial reconnaissance flights will be flown again today. Ground resources including engines, water tenders and hand crews continue to be available and staged throughout the forest for quick response and aggressive initial attack on fire starts throughout RRSNF or to assist neighboring fire agencies. HIGH fire danger continues with hot and dry weather conditions.</p><p>Firefighting resources were requested and sent to multiple fires Sunday. A Type 1 Skycrane helicopter and a fixed wing air attack assisted with fire suppression efforts on the Fremont-Winema National Forest.</p><p>Conscientious actions by recreationists is greatly appreciated in the prevention of fire starts. Be aware and follow any fire restrictions to help limit possible fire starts. Any activity using fire such as a campfire, smoking, charcoal or even driving through dry grass have the potential to start a fire. Many of these activities or prohibited this time of year.

In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state is only now recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildfires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.</p><p>DEM will hold the no-cost, four-day, and classroom- and field-based training course with the curriculum designed by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) at its George Washington Management Area office in Chepachet in June. It will qualify students to a higher skill designation level recognized by the NWCG and expand the state's capacity to respond to wildfires, which are expected to become more frequent as climate change continues to create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons.</p><p>\"DEM's Forest Fire Program works closely with Rhode Island fire departments to suppress wildfires,\" said Principal Forest Ranger and Training Officer Ben Arnold of the DEM Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment. \"We rely on municipal fire departments to fight wildfires and fire departments rely on us in the same way. This training will allow us to build the capacity needed to address the increasing wildfire activity we've seen in recent years. The program offers an opportunity to both DEM employees and Rhode Island firefighters who seek wildfire suppression training at the national standard.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, DEM announced a policy of increasing the use of prescribed fires in 2023. Arnold noted that training firefighters is one of the major goals of prescribed fires, so the training course aligns with DEM's forestry management strategy. \"We strongly believe that more planned, prescribed fires mean fewer unplanned, extreme wildfires,\" Arnold said.</p><p>Space will be limited with priority given to local municipal firefighters and DEM employees. Registration is open until Feb. 28. Acceptance letters will be sent notifying applicants of their admission. Questions may be directed to Ben Arnold (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Ben.Arnold@dem.ri.gov\">Ben.Arnold@dem.ri.gov</email>) or Patrick MacMeekin (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Patrick.Macmeekin@dem.ri.gov\">Patrick.Macmeekin@dem.ri.gov</email>) of the Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125731393</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67K0-CVB1-DYTH-G4V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At least, with the qualifier, \"in this circumstance.\"</p><p>In total, the 723 acres of the fires are 39% contained, and a crew of 265 people were staffing the complex on Friday.</p><p>\"We've made quite a bit of progress,\" Green said on Wednesday, standing in the firefighting team's briefing tent in Randle. \"It does feel good, at the end of the day, to know that you made a difference and you're setting the next team up to be successful.\"</p><p>There are four sections of the district where fires started after lightning on Aug. 25. Green's job is to run a risk assessment and assign section chiefs tasks each day. So far, that's been successful, too.</p><p>\"Safety reports (are) out every day, if we have any injury or illnesses. And I think there was one spider bite or bug bite,\" Green said. \"That's the only \u2014 knock on wood \u2014 the only incident that we've had.\"</p><p>Out of 43 fires, 28 are \"out.\" For firefighters to declare a forest fire \"out,\" everything in the vicinity, including the dirt and underground layers of leaves and organic material, must be cool to the touch.</p><p>Of the remaining blazes, 11 are \"controlled,\" meaning they are mostly or completely extinguished. One, the Mission Fire southeast of Packwood, is \"contained,\" which means the fire is unlikely to leave natural or firefighter-established boundaries.</p><p>Upon the firefighting team's arrival, the Grassy Mountain Fire was the most worrisome. As the crow flies, it's less than 3 miles north of Randle in extremely hard-to-reach terrain. That's a blessing and a curse. It makes firefighting without air operations extremely challenging, but also means the blaze would take a week of hot, dry weather and growth to climb up and down the ridges between it and Randle.</p><p>Its proximity to the community makes the fire a priority. As of Wednesday, the complex's about 300-person staff had established containment boundaries on the southern, northern and eastern side of Grassy Mountain. The perimeter would allow for growth until a season-ending weather event fully extinguishes the fire, but would make containment easy, if that growth does occur.</p><p>As fall begins, with cooler temperatures and high humidity, the Grassy Mountain Fire doesn't pose as many concerns, Green said.</p><p>On the southern half of the Cowlitz Complex, the Spencer Quartz and Snagtooth fires had grown to 206 and 118 acres, respectively, by Friday morning. Though, neither are likely to threaten significantly valuable resources (human or natural), before a season-ending weather event.</p><p>And, pointing to a map of the fire on Wednesday, Green is proud to say the same about the Grassy Mountain Fire.</p><p>It's likely to burn until very heavy rains can penetrate the \"duff\" layer, of decomposing, unburnt organic debris, ash from Mount St. Helens and a second duff layer underneath. The duff makes for delicious fuel, if you're a fire. And thick tree canopies make it difficult for rain to reach the forest floor.</p><p>\"That's Mother Nature's way of cleaning up the forest floor. In my opinion, it's really doing nothing but good,\" Green said. \"We're not seeing a lot of tree torching. ... It's really not doing any damage to the land.\"</p><p>The Cowlitz Indian Tribe has a history of controlled burning in what is now the Gifford Pinchot, according to a U.S. Forest Service archeological report that cites various court cases and oral histories. It can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/usfs/fmt-v53n2-2003.pdf\">http://npshistory.com/publications/usfs/fmt-v53n2-2003.pdf</url>.</p><p>However, that practice ceased when the Cowlitz River Valley was occupied by settlers, according to a statement by Mary Kiona, an Upper Cowlitz elder, in a 1955 land claim case.</p><p>Over the weekend and early next week, the complex's meteorologist is forecasting a rainy front will carry in about 2 inches of precipitation, which is expected to make a significant impact on the fires.</p><p>\"We do take all the values at risk into consideration when we come up with the plans we're doing,\" Green said. \"And, even though we're not directly fighting the fire on the fire's edge, we are coming up with plans to keep the fire out of the communities.\"</p><p>Fore more information:</p><p>Cowlitz Complex Fires information phone line: 360-208-8075 between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:2023.cowlitzcomplex@firenet.gov\">2023.cowlitzcomplex@firenet.gov</email></p><p>Online: Cowlitz Complex Information on InciWeb, <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov</url>/</p><p>Facebook: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/cowlitzcomplex\">https://www.facebook.com/cowlitzcomplex</url>/</p><p>Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/GPNF\">https://twitter.com/GPNF</url></p><p>Glossary</p><p>Incident Management Team: For large wildfires, responders include teams with varying complexity levels. Type 1 teams manage the largest, most difficult fires. On Sept. 25, the Cowlitz Complex will shift down to a Type 3 incident management team, which will have a smaller, more appropriately sized team as the fires start to reach containment.</p><p>Cowlitz Complex Fire: A joint name for several dozen fires across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest that began after an Aug. 25 lightning storm.</p><p>Duff: Layers of forest floor made of unburned, decomposing leaves, needles, cones, branches, etc., that fuel fires and can cause underground burning.</p><p>Contained: When a fire has been restricted to a boundary, whether natural or one that was created by firefighters digging around the fire's perimeter.</p><p>Out: When there is absolutely no danger of a fire's reignition. Firefighters test this by sticking their fingers in the dirt to ensure it is cool to the touch.</p><p>___ (c)2023 The Chronicle (Centralia, Wash.)

What does this mean for locals, and the tourism most of them depend on?Images of tourists fleeing from fires on the Greek island of Rhodes, or wildfires raging out of control in Sicily have dominated the headlines in European media, raising questions about whether the Mediterranean Sea will remain a popular destination for summer vacations. </p><p><br/>Mediterranean region particularly affected <br/>Scientists are convinced that extreme weather events, such as heat waves, will occur more frequently in Europe in the future. The region around the Mediterranean Sea is warming particularly rapidly, according to the World Meteorological Organization. <br/>Parched soil under a scorching sun provide ideal conditions for spreading fires. <br/>In April 2023, extreme temperatures were recorded in Spain, and the July heat wave was expected to be the longest in the history of recordings for Greece.  <br/>In July alone, over 50,000 hectares (123,000 acres) burned in Greece, which is slightly less than half the area of the German capital Berlin. Fires in Spain had reached this magnitude already at the beginning of April, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). <br/>Throughout last year, an area of approximately 800,000 hectares, about the size of Montenegro, was destroyed within the EU. Estimated costs were at least \u20ac2 billion ($2.21 billion), said Janez Lenarcic, the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, in January 2023. <br/>Where there are fires, GDP declines <br/>Uncontrollable fires that rage for days not only have devastating consequences for nature but also destroy livelihoods and harm the economy. <br/>Sarah Meier, who researches extreme weather events and the economic impacts of fires at the University of Birmingham, says that where fires rage, gross domestic product (GDP) declines. \"Employment figures for the tourism sector show that fewer people are employed after fires,\" she told DW. <br/>In the 27-nation EU, countries affected by wildfires can apply for assistance from Brussels. In Greece, for example, more than 500 firefighters from other countries were deployed, and the EU sent nine additional firefighting aircraft. All of this is covered by the EU's disaster relief mechanism. <br/>Moreover, funds for reconstruction can be tapped trough an EU solidarity fund on which, however, the European Parliament has the final say. <br/>Fires and tourism in Europe's south <br/>The travel industry is probably as important for Greece as the automotive industry is for Germany. About 20% of the Greek economic output comes from tourism. In Spain and Italy its 12% and 9% respectively. <br/>However, southern European travel destinations could lose attractiveness in the long term due to heat and wildfires, which would harm the economy, international ratings agency Moody's warned in a recent report. <br/>The agency's predictions, based on climate models, suggest that coastal regions as tourism destinations will significantly decline under various warming scenarios, while more northern countries could gain attractiveness. <br/>Even though climate models predict heat, drought, and fires, \"tourism in the Mediterranean region will not collapse overnight,\" says Harald Zeiss, director of the Institute for Tourism Research at Germany's Harz University. He told German TV channel ZDF that he expects traveling seasons could change, as tourists might prefer to take vacations in the Mediterranean region during spring or autumn rather than in summer. <br/>\"Wildfires and other extremes are perceived by people as isolated regional events and are not a deterrent, as humans tend to forget,\" says Petro Beritelli from the Research Center for Tourism and Transport at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. He told DW that destinations like Dubai and Las Vegas show that extreme heat doesn't deter people from traveling to such places. <br/>Innovations to the rescue of tourism <br/>Johann Goldammer is the director of the Global Fire Monitoring Center (GFMC) in Freiburg, Germany, and suggests more innovations to contain forest and bushfires in the long run. <br/>\"Due to urbanization, too much land lies fallow, and when climate change, accompanied by dry periods and heat waves, exacerbates this, fires are practically inevitable,\" he told DW. <br/>Goldammer thinks that tourism should become \"more sustainable and participatory.\" Mass tourism must be curbed in favor of concepts that give travelers, for example, the possibility to help Greek farmers in their olive farms or on vineyards, he said. <br/>After the devastating fires on the Greek island Euboea in 2021, Goldammer presented his proposals to the Greek government. They include a long-term land-use concept and measures to prevent fires. Instead of focusing solely on boosting firefighting capacities, prevention should take precedence, Goldammer said. <br/>Portugal took concrete measure after damaging wildfires in 2017. In an effort to prevent them from happening, the government banned the replanting of eucalyptus trees, for example, because they ignite too easily. The latest data from EFFIS show fires in Portugal are less severe than in Spain, Italy, and Greece. <br/>This article was originally published in German. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/wildfires-how-will-the-tourism-industry-cope/a-66399082?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_business-6126-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109991169097073907825876100186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7829</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VD-PS51-F03R-N4N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567697</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><timeReceived>10:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Tapping the ubiquitous Aleppo pines for their resin, the viscous, sticky substance the trees use to protect themselves from insects and disease, provided a key source of income for hundreds of families. But now, hardly any forest is left. A devastating wildfire, one of Greece's most destructive single blazes in decades, rampaged across northern Evia for days earlier this month, swallowing woodland, homes and businesses and sending thousands fleeing. </p><p>The damage will affect the crop not just this year, resin collectors and beekeepers say, but for generations to come. \"It's all over. Everything has turned to ash,\" said Christos Livas, a 48-year-old resin collector and father of four. Resin has been used by humans since antiquity and is found today in a dizzyingly broad array of products, from paint and solvents to pharmaceuticals, plastics and cosmetics. The north of Evia, Greece's second-largest island, accounted for around 80 percent of the pine resin produced in Greece, and about 70 percent of the pine honey, locals say. Satellite imagery shows that the wildfire destroyed most of the island's north. The devastation is breathtaking. Tens of thousands of hectares of forests and farmland were reduced to a dystopian landscape of skeletal, blackened trees silhouetted against a smoke-filled sky. For trees to grow back to the point where resin can be extracted will take more than two decades, and probably twice as long for the production of pine honey. \"In 10 years, the forest will become green again,\" Livas said. \"But for tapping, it will take 20, 25 years. For me, it's all over. Even for a 30-year-old - what's he going to do, find a job and then come back when he's 50, 60 to tap pines? His legs won't even hold him.\" Livas walked through the still smoldering remnants of the forest on the outskirts of his mountain village of Agdines, puffs of white and gray ash rising from beneath his boots as he surveyed the damage. \"This one, I remember since I was a young boy, from 15 years old,\" he said, pointing to a blackened pine, the strip of peeled bark where resin had been extracted still visible. \"This must have been tapped for 32, 33 years.\" Most of his livelihood has literally gone up in smoke, lost in a horrifying roar as the giant wildfire raced toward the village. \"You could hear a rumble. ... It was like an earthquake,\" Livas said. The flames moved fast, leaving no time to collect the thousands of plastic bags pinned to the trees to gather the precious resin. Instead, local residents turned their attention to the village, ignoring an evacuation order and staying to save their homes. They managed. But they couldn't save the forest. And the villagers' anger - at the government for not sending more firefighters sooner, for ordering evacuations when they say locals could have helped fight the flames - is palpable. Livas had been extracting resin from about 3,000 trees, producing about 9 to 10 tons per year at 27 euro cents (32 cents) per kilogram. Of all the trees he was tapping, just one survived. He supplemented his income by farming olive trees, raising animals and occasionally logging. But there are no trees to log now, and most of the olive trees are gone, too. \"I have nowhere left. Everywhere I've been, everything is burnt,\" he said. The government has vowed to compensate all those affected by the fire. But nothing can make up for the loss of the source of their livelihoods for decades to come, the residents of north Evia say. \"We've lost everything for the next 30 to 40 years,\" said beekeeper Makis Balalas, 44, who relied on Evia's forests for pine honey each year. The forest's destruction, he said, was far worse than the loss of any beehives. \"I can create new beehives,\" he said. \"But this that has been lost, you can't create that again.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017b7355d1d1a57ff35f6fc90000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63N8-BRB1-DY7N-F0MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 23, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNW4</classCode><className>GUM &amp; WOOD CHEMICALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001332</classCode><className>PLASTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N325211MM</classCode><className>RESIN MFG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N112910MM</classCode><className>APICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009S6Q</classCode><className>PLASTIC FILM SHEETS &amp; BAGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001911</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICALS &amp; BIOTECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009S3C</classCode><className>COSMETICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC319</classCode><className>GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Meanwhile, a network of fire guards, sprinklers and water cannons was established to try to protect the city from the fire, which had moved within about 9 miles.</p><p>\"We've still got some really difficult days ahead. There's no denying that,\" said Fire information officer Mike Westwick. He said winds from the north and northwest predicted for Friday and Saturday could \"push the fires in directions we don't want them to go.\"</p><p>Gas stations that still had fuel were open Friday morning, though the city was virtually empty, with one grocery store, a pharmacy and a bar still open.</p><p>\"It's kind of like having a pint at the end of the world,\" said Kieron Testart, who went door-to-door in the nearby First Nation communities of Dettah and NDilo to check on people. Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants.</p><p>Hundreds of miles south of Yellowknife, homes burned in West Kelowna, British Columbia, a city of about 38,000, after a wildfire grew \"exponentially worse\" than expected overnight, the fire chief said.</p><p>Residents already were ordered to evacuate 2,400 properties, while another 4,800 properties were on evacuation alert. The BC Wildfire Service said the fire grew six times larger overnight and it stretches over 26 square miles.</p><p>Some first responders became trapped rescuing people who failed to evacuate, said Jason Brolund, chief of the West Kelowna fire department, who said residents face another \"scary night.\" There was no known loss of life.</p><p>\"There were a number of risks taken to save lives and property last night,\" Brolund said at a news conference, describing how first responders had to rescue people who jumped into a lake to avoid the flames. \"It didn't have to be that way.\"</p><p>'It is still coming'</p><p>In Yellowknife, northwest winds combined with minimal rain were complicating efforts to slow the fire - one of hundreds raging in the territories - which could reach the city limits by the weekend, emergency officials said. There was a chance of limited rain on Friday, but officials said it likely wouldn't be enough to stop the fire.</p><p>\"We're heading into a critical couple of days,\" said Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories.</p><p>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty said the fire didn't advance as much as expected on Thursday, but \"it is still coming,\" and heavy smoke that is expected to move in increases the urgency of evacuating while it's still possible.</p><p>Officials said roads would stay open and flights would continue past the noon deadline as long as it is safe, though they worry access could be cut off if the fire advances.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year - contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. - with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>As of Friday morning, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning across the country, over half of them out of control.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with his incident response group Thursday. He asked ministers to work to ensure communication services remained available and said there would be no tolerance for price gouging on flights or essential goods.</p><p>Federal Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez said Friday that all commercial airlines added more flights from Yellowknife, and that the government was contracting private aircraft to supplement military flights.</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory already had to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.</p><p>Alice Liske left Yellowknife by road with her six kids earlier this week because the air quality was so bad.

At the same time, the new products still keep the features of high specific energy, operation safety, and environmental adaptability. The new METARY\u00aeEL battery demonstrates a high capacity retention over 90% after 300 cycles, and the mass-specific energy density retains 400Wh/kg after 250 deep charge-discharge cycles.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2039378/METARY_EL_series_lithium_metal_batteries.jpg\"/></p><p>The groundbreaking cycle performance of METARY\u00aeEL series lithium metal\u00a0batteries will make many application scenarios with high requirements for energy density and cycle life a reality. Take the \"ultra-long endurance\" solar-powered UAV as an example. It has been pursued by many international companies because of its application potential for communication relay, forest fire monitoring, atmospheric environment observation, and geographic mapping. The practical application value and economic cost relies on the endurance of the solar-powered UAV in the air, yet the commercial Li-ion battery's energy density is generally lower than 300Wh/kg, which can barely meet the night time energy need of the solar-powered UAV. Now the lithium metal batteries with an energy density of over 400Wh/kg, such as METARY\u00aeEL, have become the enabler for its practical payload applications.</p><p>The longest flight duration record for a solar-powered UAV is 64 days, set by Airbus Zephyr S on August 15, 2022. To reach the ultimate goal of hundreds of days aloft, a future solar-powered UAV will need batteries with super-stable cycling performance while maintaining high energy density. To meet such requirements, Montavista has developed the new METARY\u00aeEL lithium metal battery series products.</p><p>Montavista has always adhered to the philosophy that \"Customer's Need Is the Source of Our Innovation.\" Through continuous improvement of product performance, the company strives to help world-wide customers turn their bright ideas into reality, and benefit humanity with better technologies.</p><p>About Montavista</p><p>Montavista is a startup company based in Hefei, China.

The U.S. Forest Service said federal, state and local personnel responded to a fire on state land in Crawford Notch State Park in New Hampshire at around 11 a.m. Saturday. The Bemis Fire was burning in steep, mountainous terrain near the Arethusa Falls trail. </p><p>Its size was estimated to be about 250 acres, the Forest Service said in a statement Saturday night. The agency said there were no significant threats to life or property but asked the public to stay away from the area until the fire was considered controlled. The Arethusa Falls trail was closed until further notice. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The New Hampshire Forest Rangers said on Twitter that Saturday afternoon rainstorms helped slow the fire's progression but also forced firefighters to suspend their work due to lightning. The Bethlehem Fire Department said in a Saturday Facebook post that firefighters were expected to return to the site yesterday morning. Meanwhile, another significant brush fire in the White Mountains was considered \"100% contained and controlled\" Saturday afternoon, the Forest Service said. The nearly 50-acre Centennial Fire was reported early last week west of the Lead Mine State Forest and burned across part of the Appalachian Trail. The agency said there's still work being done in the area, so the Appalachian Trail Corridor from the Lead Mine State Forest to the junction of the Centennial Trail and the Mahoosuc Trail remains closed until further notice. Forest officials have said that fire might have been caused by a person who started the fire for warmth or cooking. A man in Vermont was killed after apparently trying to battle a wildfire last week, state police said Friday. Firefighters in Rochester found the man's body about 200 yards east of a homestead while they extinguished a fire that burned about 2 acres of woods Thursday night, police said. Authorities say the man appears to have been attempting to suppress the fire by himself. They also said there's no indication that the fire was the result of direct human involvement and does not appear to be a criminal event.

A force of one hundred fire fighters brought the fire under control. About 1,000 acres of land from Fishing Creek hollow to the Hamburg road was burned over, it was said. At one time the entire mountain side was in flames and it was feared that the fire would reach the city water shed property on Tuscarora Creek.</p><p>One man is totally blind and never will see again, and six others, men and women, are partially blind, but are expected to recover from the effects of drinking moonshine whisky containing wood alcohol at a party staged on Hagerstown's Bowery early Sunday.</p><p>50 Years Ago</p><p>April 25, 1973</p><p>The world famous developer of the oral polio vaccine, Dr. Albert Sabin, indicated Tuesday that the work he has just completed at the Frederick Cancer Research Center may comprise his last laboratory research effort of his illustrious career.</p><p>The Penn Central Railroad Company has been given court approval to abandon its railroad tracks in Frederick and ownership of the tracks is expected to be assumed by the Baltimore and Ohio Co.

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon today.<br/>\"I want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there's a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \"Without rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\"<br/>Evacuating such a large number of people is \"going to be tough,\" but people were cooperating and staying calm, Westwick said.<br/>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year - contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. - with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control.<br/>In the Northwest Territories alone, 268 wildfires have already burned more than 8,100 square miles.<br/>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta.<br/>\"It's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\" because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community.<br/>Resident Angela Canning was packing up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities and leaving with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker.<br/>\"I'm really anxious and I'm scared. I'm emotional   I'm in shock,\" she told The Canadian Press. \"I don't know what I'm coming home to or if I'm coming home. There's just so much unknowns here.\"<br/>At the Big River Service Station about 185 miles south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \"phenomenal,\" employee Linda Croft said. \"You can't see the end of it.\"<br/>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.<br/>A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told the CBC that their car began to melt as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle began filling with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead.<br/>\"I was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,\" said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times.<br/>She said her son kept saying: \"I don't want to die, mommy.\"<br/>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was convening an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation.<br/>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. In-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital would be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website.<br/>Officials said evacuations have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from Yellowknife who can't find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the province of Alberta.

Air tankers flew missions overnight to keep the highway out of Yellowknife open, and authorities were guiding a long caravan of motorists through fire zones, officials said. Meanwhile, a network of fire guards, sprinklers and water cannons was being established to try to protect the city from the fire, which had moved to within 9 miles. Northwest winds combined with minimal rain were complicating efforts to slow the fire, which could reach the city limits by the weekend, emergency officials said. </p><p>There was a chance of limited rain Friday, but officials said it likely wouldn't be enough to help. \"We're heading into a critical couple of days,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Northwest Territories, told a news conference. Thousands of people have fled the fire, one of hundreds of wildfires raging in the territories, driving hundreds of miles to safety or waiting in long lines for emergency flights, as the worst fire season on record in Canada showed no signs of easing. Ten planes left Yellowknife with 1,500 passengers Thursday, said Jennifer Young, director of corporate affairs for the Northwest Territories' Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, adding that the agency hoped 22 flights would leave Friday with 1,800 more passengers. Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty said the fire didn't advance as much as expected Thursday, but \"it is still coming,\" and heavy smoke that is expected to move in increases the urgency of evacuating while it's still possible. Alice Liske left Yellowknife by road with her six children earlier this week because the air quality was so bad. She worried about how so many people would flee the city in such a short time. \"Not only that,\" she said, \"but when we go back, what will be there for us?\" Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year - contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. - with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. As of Friday morning, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning across the country, over half of them out of control. Hundreds of miles to the south of Yellowknife, hundreds of properties were ordered to evacuate because of the threat from a wildfire near West Kelowna, British Columbia. The evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta. \"It's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later\" because of the danger the fire could block the only escape route even before reaching the community. As people fled, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with his incident response group. He asked ministers to work to ensure communication services remained available and said there would be no tolerance for price gouging on flights or essential goods. On Thursday, at the Big River Service Station, about 185 miles south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \"phenomenal,\" employee Linda Croft said. \"You can't see the end of it.\" Resident Angela Canning packed up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities as she prepared to leave with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker. \"I'm really anxious and I'm scared. I'm emotional. ... I'm in shock,\" she said. \"I don't know what I'm coming home to or if I'm coming home. There's just so much unknowns here.\" The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applied to Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah. Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants. About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive. A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told CBC that their vehicle began to melt as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle filled with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead. \"I was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,\" said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times. She said her son kept saying: \"I don't want to die, mommy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018a091fd30ea5ebabdf3c960000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695W-7621-DY7N-F00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 18, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GX245</classCode><className>YELLOWKNIFE, NT, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX052</classCode><className>OTTAWA, ON, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS172</classCode><className>NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The fire was within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the northern edge of Yellowknife, and people in the four areas of the city of 20,000 at highest risk were told to leave as soon as possible, Fire Information Officer Mike Westwick said. Residents in other areas should be out by noon Friday, because strong north winds could push the fire toward the highway needed for evacuation, Westwick said. Although some rain was forecast for the region, first responders were taking no chances. </p><p>\"I want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there's a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \"Without rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\" Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. Inpatient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital would be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients have been transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was convening an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation. About 6,800 people in eight other communities have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, where 80% of the town was destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive. A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told the CBC that their vehicle began melting as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle began filling with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead. \"I was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,\" Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children, told the CBC. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times. She told CBC her son kept saying: \"I don't want to die, mommy.\" Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles), according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control. In the Northwest Territories alone, 268 wildfires have already burned more than 21,000 square kilometers (8,100 square miles). Officials said evacuations from the Northwest Territories have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from the capital who can't find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the nearby province of Alberta that were expected to open by noon Thursday. The closest of those centers is more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) by road from Yellowknife. Only those without the option of leaving by road should register for the evacuation flights, officials added. People who are immunocompromised or have a condition that puts them at higher risk also were encouraged to sign up. \"We're all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,\" Premier Caroline Cochrane posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. She urged residents to obey emergency management officials, traffic control devices and posted speed limits. \"The country is watching, and our neighbors are keeping us in their thoughts and prayers.? The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applies to the city of Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah. Eight communities totaling nearly 6,800 people, or 15% of the Northwest Territories' population, have already left, Mike Westwick, the region's fire information officer, said earlier in the day. Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities like hunting, fishing and gathering native plants. The U.S. has also seen devastating wildfires, including one on the Hawaiian island of Maui, which killed more than 100 people and destroyed a historic town. Rural areas near California's border with Oregon were placed under evacuation orders Wednesday after gusty winds from a thunderstorm sent a lightning-sparked wildfire racing through national forest lands, authorities said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press People without vehicles lineup Thursday to register for a flight to Calgary, Alberta, in Yellowknife.

We shower and cook our breakfasts in contaminated water that we actually stole from the neighboring state - but hey at least we have our oil fields!</p><p>We don't have toast because there is a shortage of wheat due to what seems to be the new 100-year war in Ukraine, but hey at least we made over $175 billion in arms transfers and sales to other countries and it's all wrapped up in Tucker Carlson's snazzy bow tie.</p><p>We take our kids to school fully outfitted in masks and bulletproof vests. They enter a windowless, doorless school surrounded by armed teachers and principals, where they learn a history which removes so much of the truth that it might as well be the fantasy that the pigs fed their comrades at the end of Orwell's Animal Farm, but hey - maybe they won't die from the latest pandemic.</p><p>Since we can't really afford gasoline, we walk to work, where we trip on homeless people - because hey - their lives don't matter. If we are lucky, we only suffer superficial wounds from the armed Proud Boys regulating our streets. We get to work relieved until we remember that we will have double the responsibilities because, Tina, our colleague, has been removed from the building in handcuffs since she tried to illegally purchase the morning-after pill.</p><p>Now, Tina is shackled in a jail cell with all the other women who wanted to control their own bodies. She and those lives will be shackled to the ground for nine months as their bellies swell, until they are inevitably shackled to a bed, and forced to push out a baby. Those women will then either be let free; in which case they will look for employment, but since they now have a criminal record, they will be denied a place in the workforce. But, so what if they can't afford their baby, and there is no baby formula available anywhere, even if they could? As Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested, they can just drop off the baby at the local fire station. But oh wait, the firefighters are off fighting that interminable forest fire.</p><p>Those women who stay in jail will raise their children among bars and the police. In all honesty, it's not too dissimilar from the schools themselves and at least the jailed children won't be exposed to some radical leftist teacher mentioning the word slavery or the like.</p><p>Enough about Tina's life though, we have our own lives! We finish work, go back out into the wild, Wild West, pick up our kids (as long as they have not been murdered by some enraged teenager who picked up an assault rifle after his girlfriend ghosted him the night before), take them home and feel truly blessed to have another day in this paradise on earth.</p><p>Seriously, is this the plan?</p><p>Rachel Stofocik has been in education for over 20 years, 12 of them in Santa Fe. She lives with her husband and two daughters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15690110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6688-RM31-JBSG-12F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 28, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

Promising a seamless integration of multiple network technologies, it aims to  provide enhanced reliability, flexibility, and performance. However, upon  closer examination, what many believe to be hybrid connectivity, isn't truly hybrid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, we need to think  differently and take a close look at the \"classic networking approach,\" and how  failover, whilst offering a degree of resilience and redundancy, isn't truly hybrid. Despite its apparent benefits, hybrid  does not truly embody the essence of hybrid connectivity. Failover refers to  the ability of a system to switch to a backup connection when the primary  connection fails. While failover mechanisms do indeed provide a level of  redundancy, they do not fundamentally transform the nature of the connectivity  architecture. Consequently, the degree of resilience is inherently constrained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a truly hybrid-or  heterogeneous-network, multiple network technologies seamlessly work together,  actively sharing the load and resources, combining, and binding together a  variety of bearers from cellular and LTE to satellite and Wi-Fi into a single \"pipe\".  In this way, it can deliver a faster and, more importantly, more reliable  service.</p><p>In fact, a truly  hybrid platform should go a stage further than that, accommodating and  configuring itself for a range of other variables, depending upon each bearer's  performance and other environmental conditions affecting it at any one moment  in time to optimize performance and reduce costs-but I'll  touch on that later.</p><p>When optimized in  this way, a hybrid system can work through degradation and failure to ensure  that single TCP connections are maintained and accelerated, regardless of the availability  and performance of the underlying networks. This ability to optimize  connectivity, even in the most challenging conditions, will deliver a truly consistent  and uninterrupted user experience. In critical operations, where connectivity  can be the difference between life and death, hybrid and resilience take on a  whole new meaning.</p><p>Failover, on the  other hand, relies primarily on a backup connection to take over in case of an  outage, without actively utilizing the strengths and capabilities of both  primary and secondary connections simultaneously. It is the concept of failover,  I would suggest, which challenges the traditional orthodoxy of what hybrid  connectivity really means.</p><p>\"The lack of a unified security framework can result in vulnerabilities and inconsistencies that make the overall network infrastructure more susceptible to cyber threats.\"</p><p>Redundancy Is  Not Optional</p><p>The need to be able  to \"connect\" within any given environment-regardless of whether terrestrial  infrastructure is available or has been compromised-is now more significant  than ever. Live streaming of video, the transfer of data and voice calls are  crucial within countless sectors.</p><p>Defense will  always require multiple ways to communicate with fallback options. Emergency  services need real-time access to ongoing incidents-whether that be drone video  footage above a forest fire in a remote or rural area-where cellular infrastructure  isn't an option. The ambulance service is reliant  on good connectivity to access patient data or the services of a clinician  while on the move or at curb side. Telehealth triage will not work without hybrid  connectivity and the robust bonding of all and any available networks.</p><p>Likewise, the  marine industry meanwhile is utilizing the power of hybrid connectivity as  yachts and commercial vessels navigate the seas, and even utilities require  machine-to-machine (M2M) and IoT capability to control and monitor operations  on windfarms, oil rigs and installations that are traditionally \"out of reach\".</p><p>With the relay of  live video no longer the preserve of news organizations, but a mainstay of  multiple sectors and consumers, the biggest challenges are no longer around  relaying footage from A to B, but with the network and available bandwidth. Now,  the key to delivering the highest quality video is bonding available networks  to increase bandwidth, seamlessly correcting errors and optimizing the link.</p><p>Even the cars we  drive and the appliances we use daily are harnessing variations of satellite, Wi-Fi,  and cellular communications, and with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites becoming  increasingly accessible, the applications and opportunities are endless.</p><p>Factors such as  latency, packet loss, and network congestion can hinder the integration of  networks, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. As a result, the envisioned  performance improvements of hybrid connectivity become overshadowed by the  complexities and compromises it introduces in the classic approach-hence a need  to think differently.</p><p>Security and  Compliance vs Cost and QoS</p><p>Integrating different  network technologies from diverse sources introduces additional security  challenges and consideration across various network endpoints and connection  points. The lack of a unified security framework can result in vulnerabilities  and inconsistencies that make the overall network infrastructure more  susceptible to cyber threats. Moreover, ensuring compliance with industry  regulations and data protection standards becomes increasingly challenging in a  fragmented network environment which incorporates public networks and the  Internet.</p><p>When it comes to  being efficient with cost-management, a key consideration is that with true  hybrid, heterogeneous connectivity, different parameters can be configured to  allow for cost efficiencies to be made. For example, with the transmission of  voice calls, parameters can be set to allow for the most cost-effective bearer  to be used if it's good enough-i.e., cellular can  take preference over satellite if it's \"stable  enough,\" thus reducing the costs of always using satellite.</p><p>This also applies  to the handling of Quality of Service (QoS), to ensure the performance of  critical applications where there's limited network capacity, rapid variations  in bandwidth and latency across each network. While security and compliance remain  a network engineer's priority in many organizations, it should never be compromised  by cost. In a true hybrid ecosystem, this compromise need never be a concern  because factors such as priority, efficiency, and cost have formed part of the  underlying design and mirrored in the configuration settings.</p><p>Why does all  this matter?</p><p>The adage says  that if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you always got. But that's not the case in networking. If you do what you've always done in a networking environment-where  the explosion of tech, amount of data being transferred, and the sheer weight  of traffic vying for space on our heavily congested networks-you will in fact  get less than you always got.</p><p>So, we need to  think differently. Many hybrid systems are not the least bit hybrid, they simply  provide a backup where the switchover is often measured in minutes. While this might  be adequate for some, it doesn't meet the evolving  requirements of industries that rely upon always-on, fail-safe connectivity, as  cited earlier.</p><p>To achieve full  hybrid connectivity, and as part of a European Space Agency (EAS) contract, we at  Livewire Digital developed RazorLink, an industry-first Software Defined  Networking (SDN) solution that can seamlessly and dynamically bond any number  of bearers, from satellite, cellular, Point to Point radio, Wi-Fi, and  terrestrial services in line with user-defined objectives and prevailing  conditions. This is true hybrid, a WAN which is capable of efficiently combining  high latency VSAT with low latency cellular, and any range of other bearers in between  to create an aggregate service with optimized configurable bandwidth. We  believe failover is not an ideal option in our data-hungry world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISEMAG-14298098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISEMAG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BD4-D0F1-F155-T070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487200</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Endeavor Business Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>ISE Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"60906\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 23, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Thank you for supporting the conference and maybe you could give us a little bit of a top-down overview of how you see the state of the economy and the state of your business.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIRECTOR, CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY CO: Yeah. Let me -- maybe I'll start. So firstly, thank you for this. It may only be 9:00 AM, but we're halfway through validations and railroading by now, trains have been running for hours and all night. But it's good to be here in New York. I was just talking about whether we could swing a weekend out of this. I don't know if we're going to get a chance to this time, but what a fabulous place. Thank you.</p><p>And maybe I'll just start with a couple of some comments for context as we go forward. We introduced, as you know, a new operating model just over two years ago. And schedule operating and finance -- it's not complicated. That's the whole point of it is not complicated.</p><p>We have a network operations team that designs it. They look at all of the volume across the railroad, and they build a plan that moves it all that optimized for whole. And so it's not the long train strategy. It's not optimizing for any individual terminal. It optimizes the whole.</p><p>And then the field operations team runs that plan. So this is our make the plan, run the plan, sell the plan model. And we've been doing that for just over two years now, and it's working very well. We are faster. We are more efficient. Our dwell time over two years has gone down by more than 10%. Our velocity is up by 25%. Our on-time departure and arrival performance is up 47% and 53%, I think, respectively.</p><p>And most importantly of all, our customer service levels are very strong. They are consistent. We've seen a dramatic change in (technical difficulty) pricing power. So we've been able over that two years to drive EPS growth back to the bottom-line growth in EPS of 22%.</p><p>So I'm happy with the way the railroad is running. This is working. This is the right model for us. We're not done yet. We're still tweaking. We're still making it better, but we've got significant traction on the ground every day running this model.</p><p>And as we turn our attention to growth, once we had that kind of running, we looked forward and didn't then assessment on how much growth we could see looking out over the next 5, 7, 10 years. And that led us to an investor day, I guess about a year -- what a year and a half ago -- we put out a growth plan. And the big question was how much growth is there in rail and rail growth. And we came up with a plan that we laid out in front of you all. It's going to drive 10% to 15% EPS growth on average over the next three years.</p><p>But it was driven on two things. One was as railroads do, we will grow with the economy. And the scheduled operating plan is a consistent kind of operation that allows us to really understand our capacity and allows us to respond to what's going on in the economy effectively. Whether it is a positive growth, which we're seeing some of now or whether it's some of the shocks to the system like the fires and the port strike we had last year, this operating model allows us to recover very, very quickly.</p><p>So about half of our growth as we look forward this year or as we look forward over the next three years is from what we believe will be and hope will be a recovering economy. We're starting to see some green shoots on that now. I'm sure we'll talk about that to your questions today.</p><p>We have a path. Our CN's specific initiatives -- these are efforts that we're making with our customers that leverage our network, leverage at customer service levels that we're providing, where they're growing and we're growing with them, but they're making investments (technical difficulty) and we are making investments together that's going to drive growth in both of our businesses.</p><p>And that is the long list of initiatives. We've talked about bits and pieces of these. We'll get into details, I'm sure, over the course of the next hour here, but that's coming on exactly. It's actually it's a little bit ahead of plan as we watch those companies.</p><p>There's a lot of upfront investment. We're starting to see that volume move now, and it will form 50% of our growth as we look forward this year as well as the next three. So that is -- I'm comfortable with that. We've got the pricing power that's going to support margins on this as well.</p><p>And then the final piece that we've been working on over the last two years, is, of course, the team. It's important. You have all the plants in the world that you want, but you need the right team to be able to execute them and are available to respond and anticipate all of what goes on in the world that's moving very, very quickly.</p><p>And we started at the top. We now have a home that is a great combination of deep relative expertise and some very different eyes, different perspectives. And what's really important -- so we have some new folks, right? We've got some old folks right here that have been around for a very, very long time. Can I say -- how verys should I say? A very, very -- a long time.</p><p>But what's really important is the way that we're coming together, and this team is moving. Just runs our operating committee where we bring the commercial folks together with the operations folks with the finance folks. And there just as planned is to run a process that has us pull all the levers and is going to have to execute the plan that we have and respond to whatever is coming. So it's a collaborative and very tight process.</p><p>So I'm happy with where we are. Lots more to come as we look at growth in the future, but I'll maybe leave it there's context.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Sure. So that's a great introduction. Coming back to your commentary around green shoots. I often say -- feel as a sell-side analyst, whenever I say green shoots. I'm holding up a sign that says, green shoot me.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Yeah, you may be right.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: But what are you seeing in the business? What are you hearing from your customers around the economy starting to get a little bit better? Because it does seem like, at least in the US side, looking at all the surface-grade data things are still kind of slow.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Yeah, it's -- I would say that we're cautiously optimistic. But one of the good things about our business is we're very diversified. So it's really, it's a tale of a bunch of different industries. So we saw a very strong grain movements over the past number of months. We did expect them earlier in the season.</p><p>Potash has been very strong. Those are less consumer centric. Coal is a little bit -- it's off in the US because its thermal coal and metallurgical coal volumes will have another mine opening up in British Columbia. We're seeing some strength there. We're seeing some real strength in petroleum and the fuels and petroleum record kind of exports of propane. For example, we've got a new fuel facility starting up in Toronto.</p><p>But there's an -- automotive continues to be strong. The biggest kind of shift over what we would have been saying, if we were here last year was the strength in the international business, the containers coming over. We've reconstructed our portfolio there to fit our Rupert corridor, our Vancouver corridor. And of course, Halifax is a little soft right now because of what's going on in the Red Sea. But we've constructed this portfolio to fit our network, and it's really strong right now.</p><p>So that is underpinned by some consumer demand, fuel restocking, I think. But we're going to be watching that very closely as we go forward. Ghis watches, what 150 or so --</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY CO: 150 economic indicators. Maybe I can add to what, Tracy, you're saying. When I look at the volumes right now are holding quite well. I mean, when you look at our volumes in terms of RTMs in Q2, we're up 8%. And in fact, we'll talk increasingly about in intermodal, international. Intermodal international is up 22%. Petroleum and chemicals, which is a sign of again the economy and so on. is up 17%. And merchandise in and of itself is up 10%.</p><p>So I think the volumes are holding quite well. I think to your point, inventories have stabilized. We are not assuming that intermodal international will come back to pre-COVID levels. But we're assuming in our modeling in this year that it will get better than last year. When you look at the economic indicators -- and I know for shareholders to your point, Tracy, we follow 150, but we gave one, which is industrial production. Industrial production in Canada started with plus 0.3 in January and now it's plus 0.9.</p><p>So economists, they do forecast very often and change by small increments. So they can never be wrong, but it's going in the right direction. Same thing as housing starts -- it started at 1.3 and now it's 1.4. So all of this is telling us that was going in the right direction, but we're cautiously optimistic. Like in our modeling, we did not assume that we would go back to pre-COVID levels, whether it's in intermodal International, whether it's in lumber, whether it's in the automotive sectors and so on and so forth. So we're doing pretty good, and it's holding together.</p><p>I'll finish to say that lumber is stabilizing. That was the other big weakness last year, if you remember, David, in Q2, when we hit the trough, and I would say that number when you look at car orders and I'm talking about center beams because these are like the sailboats with bundles of lumber, in the trough last year, we would have 1,600 or car orders per week. We finished the year around 1,800 to 1,900, and we've modeled in that range. And I think we've been doing, Tracy, something like in the range of about 2,000.</p><p>So but there's ups and downs. When you look at every week, there's ups and downs on the demand. But overall, that's what we've been seeing, and there's still a shortage of houses in the US. And I think hopefully people -- two things, I think. Number one, people don't believe that we will have a recession which that was not the case last year.</p><p>And second, interest rates, although we know it's questionable as to whether interest rates will come down and there will be some interest rate cuts but people don't see interest rates going way back up. I think it's people are saying that it's either going to be there or maybe come down a little bit. So that's good for housing starts, and that's good for lumber. So we're doing pretty good here.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Yeah, we are. So if you look at the year -- and we've kind of guided to mid-single digit growth -- just as I think we're about 3% year to date -- accelerating 8% year over year on second quarter. And we've got -- talked about all the economic place. We're watching all of this and specific initiatives coming in about on plan, and that's about half.</p><p>And then if you look at -- as we move out in the year and you look at the compares, you'll recall that we had a pretty significant forest fire season that did impact more customer operations in our operations last year, and we had a pretty significant West Coast port strike last year. So the compares -- the volumes last year went down a little bit. So we're pretty comfortable as we look out for the remainder of the year on where we are expecting volumes to go down.</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: That West Coast port strike actually cost us 1% of volume growth. So we're not assuming this year that this will happen again, obviously. So --</p><p>DAVID VERNON: You get to wait another three years till the contract's up.</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Exactly.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: So one thing when you think about feeling pretty good about the economies accelerating, is that a more Canadian thing or is that also south of the border? Like is there -- like how do you guys --</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Yeah, it's a little bit of both. Like I said, it's not coming back to the pre-COVID levels. When we talk to our customers, when we talk to the shipping lines, demand is better than it was last year. Inventories are now back at normal levels. So they will have to be restocked. People are starting to consume -- I mean, remember, last year, people were worried about a recession and the interest rate. So they needed to know where am I going to cut?</p><p>I mean, if you look at traveling and I speak to Michael Rousseau, the the CEO, Air Canada is saying just -- we're even short of pilots. So people are not cutting on traveling. People did not cut on restaurants. They cut on consumption. Now it's starting to come back, because those fears are mostly behind them. So slowly but surely, we can see signs that the -- and it's not in one thing, it's across the board, P&amp;C, plastics and chemicals. It's frac sand.</p><p>And then when you look at frac sand, Tracy, I think our volumes are up 50% in frac sand, which some of the drilling that's happening in Northern BC (multiple speakers) That's right. Exactly.</p><p>So the (technical difficulty) is what really we see weakness is thermal coal. This is coal coming from Southern Illinois, going to Convent, Louisiana, and then exported to Europe with the with some of the demand out there that's soft and also the weak natural gas prices. And frankly, I believe that thermal coal eventually will probably go away, but that represents -- like coal for CN represent -- overall metallurgical and thermal coal represents only 3% of our book of business.</p><p>So that's one of our strength, too, is we're well diversified. The biggest segment we have is intermodal at 25%. Everything else is lower.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: And as you think about the interest-rate environment, we had the CEO of Prologis, one of the bigger industrial real estate companies or the biggest industrial real estate company around supply chain yesterday for a fireside chat. And he was talking about how the construction part of his business is basically shut, right? The new builds on warehousing space has really, really come down as a result of interest rates. Does that have a chance of maybe still having some lingering effects on parts of the construction market or -- ?</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: So I think the way we look at it as we look forward. A number of things, if you look at the short term, building permits, housing permits, what's happening in the short term, surprisingly, it means that it's not really high, but it hasn't plummeted. But as you look over the longer term, there's a structural shortage we know in housing in this continent. And so there's going to have to be some work done on that. And so we believe that over the longer term, this is going to be a pretty stable market from a lumber perspective.</p><p>There's a question on where it's going to come from and where -- is how much will come from Western Canada, Eastern Canada in the US -- that structurally housing needs investment. We're seeing the same things from an industry perspective as mortgages that haven't come up yet. There's going to be a shock on this mortgage.</p><p>There's just -- I think the encouraging piece is there seems to be a comfort that interest rates are no longer going up more. It's how you manage the current exposures that happens. The thing that we hear about around them, whether it's in Canada or the US is around, it's just a general housing shortage. So we're going to have to deal with that.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Okay. So you mentioned the guidance for the year being mid-single digit RTM growth. I know you guys have been on the road quite a bit and talking to investors. That guidance was initially met with a lot of skepticism. And as you've had those conversations with investors, can you help us kind of maybe share with us what you think the market wasn't getting about your outlook and why that 5% growth in RTMs, even in the sort of slowly recovering, but maybe not super robust economy (multiple speakers)</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: I think they didn't perhaps get a couple of things initially, although I think that most do now. Often, the railroads will follow the economy. And so often we have our volumes moving up or early indicator of where the economy is going, and we all have a certain view. We're now calling it cautiously optimistic around what the economy is going. We're not sure, but it's feeling a little firmer than it was before.</p><p>That 6% of our growth is not based on the macro economy, what it's doing. 50% of our growth is on specific initiatives with our customers that we're tracking very well too. So we've got a dual facility that we've talked about before that's going to handle thousands of cars is now open and starting to move big. We spent a little bit of money up in Northern BC to build an extra line for the frac sand, and it's up 50%.</p><p>And we've just had an announcement -- we've had a couple of FID announcements at Rupert that will come into play in a couple of years, but we've got the canola crush facilities that we've been working on starting to come on in the prairies. We're now moving some of that early -- lifting them down the northern part of Eastern Canada into markets and for exports. So these were all very specific initiatives that are unrelated to how the economy goes. So that's one thing that I think that we've been able to drive some clarity to.</p><p>The other one is that what I just mentioned was that if you -- what we've guided is year-over-year volumes, and we did have an impact last year from both the port strike and from the fires, and that took our volumes down lower than they would have otherwise have been to last year. And so it's a bit of an easier compare. So you look at those two things, along with a cautiously optimistic view on the economic drivers, we're pretty comfortable in where we are on a volume forecast</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Yeah, I would say, Tracy, it's exactly right. So investors at the beginning, when we said mid-single digits volume growth, call it 5%, people thought that we were banking on a positive economy way too much. When you break it down to her point, half of it comes from our CM-specific growth initiative. 1% comes from the fact that we are not assuming that there will be a West Coast port strike, but really, we're looking at the economy to give us about 1% -- maybe 1% to 1.5%, where so many industrial production, we'll not go back to 2%, which is what we've talked about as a supportive economy when we did our Investor Day, we're assuming slightly positive, call it, 0.5%. That's what we're assuming.</p><p>So when you demystify it, then people -- because the other rows were call it low-single-digit volume growth from the economy, we're about the same. I mean, we're even probably maybe a little lower, but we've got the CN specific.</p><p>What I like about those is they're diversified across commodities, across geography. So if we're wrong on one of them from a negative standpoint, we're probably wrong on another one from a positive standpoint. And you've got the law of compensating areas. So we're not banking on one initiative. We're banking on a laundry list of initiatives. So we're quite positive about that.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Okay. And then you mentioned at the Investor Day about a year and a half ago, and seeing it laid out a multi-year 2026, 10% to 15% EPS guidance range. And we are starting a little bit at the lower end of that range. Can you kind of help quantify for investors how much of the CN-specific growth projects are going to be in this year, and what's going to accelerate?</p><p>Maybe, I know it's a big, broad, diversified business, but if you get into a little bit more on detail some of the bigger items like AltaGas and really help us understand kind of how much of this is really bankable growth versus maybe a special (multiple speakers)</p><p>Why don't I go through the initiatives, and you can sum up the numbers at the end. Does that make sense?</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: No, I'm not that good with numbers. (laughter)</p><p>DAVID VERNON: No, you're better than average. (laughter)</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Slightly better than average. So why don't we just go through some of the initiatives. I think we've spoken to many of these, but I'll give you a kind of a round above them maybe. We'll start with the energy sector and you mentioned AltaGas. So we're hitting records with the propane export to Japan, but there are other countries in Asia that's looking for as well. And it was just this week, that AltaGas and Vopak announced a final investment decision on a new facility -- a new liquids facility in Rupert, it will be an operation, I think they said by 2026.</p><p>So we've got a contract from the largest contracts we've ever signed with AltaGas for propane expansion to Rupert in the exports. That's now going to be supported by additional capacity as we look out beyond 2026. In the energy sector and how it's going in natural gas, the Montney region, the competitive buffers is the frac sand that we've built from capacity frac sand to get up into Northeast BC, right in the key Montney areas. It gives that sand, very proximate to where the drilling is taking place, a number of partnerships in doing that (technical difficulty)</p><p>Fuel (technical difficulty) refined petroleum -- our volumes moving refined petroleum and fuels into Toronto right now, into Eastern Canada, are up significantly. Your bridges will give you the number, but that tenant created demand for some of the pipelines in Eastern Canada are being rated. So in advance of that, we've partnered with two of the big players in that space.</p><p>We've contributed some space in our Toronto yard. They are building tanks and big facilities. This will ultimately, we've just started these big shipments. We have sold out even Phase 2 now. And so this is going to be thousands of railcars. But we're starting to see that move now, for example.</p><p>We put a -- if you think about the ag sector, you know everything that's going on in potash, but we're looking at our partnerships with the biodiesel (technical difficulty) with the canola crush facilities. With number of that capacity announced, some of those are starting to come into operation this year. So we've got money in the plan. We're seeing that come in around some increased canola oil and canola crush and oil (technical difficulty) that are coming.</p><p>When we think about it, a big part of our growth story was going to be international. And we have reconstructed our portfolio coming in the West Coast, both Toronto and Prince Rupert. Prince Rupert's 1.6 million TEU capacity now, soon to be 1.8 million and then 2 million, and they've got another facility that they can double that again. And so that volume is lifting per plan. And we've announced -- we haven't announced that can export facility -- the logistics facility was announced. Was it last week now? That got final investment decision, and this is the logistics facility.</p><p>We're going to haul rail carloads, various commodities pulses, grains, plastic pellets, wood chips, and they will be transloaded at that facility in the containers. This makes Rupert an even more attractive place. Already, it's the fastest and the most economic way to get from Asia to the US. That's going to help by giving them loaded, returned containers on the way. And so that's very supportive.</p><p>If you think about -- typically on yet, but we are starting to move, as I mentioned, the lithium out of Eastern Canada itself. We've started our short sea service out of Mexico into mobile that goes up in Chicago. So it serves a port in Mexico that is not rail served. So we're taking truck traffic and putting it up.</p><p>And of course, we're looking at -- we're advancing a let's just talk about the underlying relationships that service (technical difficulty) and also are curious with the NS. So these are all initiatives that manifests itself. And as we look at the plan as we sit here in -- is it June today? It's the end of May -- as we look forward that single that mid-single digit kind of plan -- pretty much, 50% of it, maybe a little bit more is going to happen this year from those [stand] specific initiatives. And as we refresh our view three years out, there's reason to be very optimistic on it.</p><p>Ghis, you want to talk about the airline (technical difficulty)</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Not really. No, I'm kidding. So when we were at Investor Day, as you remember, we said that all of these added together would be 800,000 to 900,000 carloads, obviously, in our plan. And in our guidance, we did not assume that everything will happen.</p><p>But just as an example, AltaGas, we have a target overall of 40,000 to 45,000 carloads of NGLs, and AltaGas locked up about half of that already. So the notion is we're banking on this this year to be half of our volume growth. And as we get to the out years, you get a compounding effect of some of these initiatives, because what happens is now you get the full-year effect of the 2024 and 2025. So you'll get the new 2025. So you get a compounding effect in 2025 and 2026 up some of these stan-specific growth initiatives.</p><p>And my hope, my belief is as the economy does a little bit better, maybe we will not reach 2% by 2026, but we'll get away from the 0.5% in 2024 more to 1%, 1.5%. Then hopefully, we get from the low end of our range of EPS guidance of 10% more in the middle or hopefully to the top end of the range by 2026. So and like I said, what I like about this is it's diversified.</p><p>So it's not banking on one. It's a laundry list of about a dozen initiatives. So some of them will fall off. But the Remi, our new guy, by the way, which I'm ecstatic about him joining the team. And he is it an enterprise leader, and I think that Tracy and I -- and she's smiling. So I would like her to smile when you guys talk about me more. But he's not sitting on this Laurel. They are finding new initiatives like this is a living thing.</p><p>And then on the Falcon service, I'm quite bullish. And if you listen to a couple of conferences we've done in the past, I think this will change the way railroads need to work together North America going forward. Because when you look at railroads, there's only three ways to grow volume. You either grow with your customers. You either to convince somebody to build a facility on your line, and then you've gotten that customer's commitment for the next 30 years or you extend your network reach.</p><p>And when you look at us, we've got great network reach in Canada with the railroad of the north. We have better access to Canada's natural resources, but we're quite limited in the US. We have a street fight from Chicago, New Orleans.</p><p>So how do you do that? How do you extend your network reach? Well, you can do that through acquisitions and we are -- a whole -- we're hoping to get the STB's approval on the Iowa Northern that's contiguous to our line, that gives us market access and geographic access to more grain and in Iowa and so on.</p><p>These are going to be small Class 2 railroads, and we're there. We have a laundry list of railroads that we would be interested in. It's got to be contiguous to our network. But the STB, I think, has spoken that there will not be another round of Class 1 consolidation anytime soon. I'll be retired way before it happens.</p><p>So how do you do it? It's going to have to be done by partners. And I think that when you look at -- the partnership we have with UP, and we've operationalized with -- Tracy started this with Lance Fritz and now with Jim. Jim knows us extremely well, good buddies with him and so on, and he understands it. When you look at our service -- from Monterrey to Toronto five-day service. And this is not about taking market share from other railroads. This is about taking long-haul trucking 1,200-, 1,300-, 1,500-mile long-haul trucking, put them back on the rails.</p><p>I think I'm pretty bullish and I think you can expect and investors can expect that there's going to be more of these partnerships that are going to pop up. And I think that we will be successful, and we are successful in the Falcon service. I think that will be the model of how railroads needs to partner together and operationalize to get market share back from the trucks, which, by the way, Dave and I'll finish on this has been the most overly promised and under delivered in the last 20 years.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Let me just make a couple of comments on that. So this is an easy work, right? Railroads traditionally have optimized to their own network. So this is something that's new. It's heavy lifting; it's not natural for us. And so it takes a commitment right at the top. So Fernando, Jim and I get together frequently -- we're getting to get us next week in Montreal again -- and you need to be consistent with it.</p><p>And the way this works is is that we play this off into each other. If we were one single railroad, the three of us owned this whole network, how would this go? From a routing perspective, from a -- with three guys together so that we can be -- we can have a positive interface with customers. We can be easier to do business with. Those are not easy discussions but we have them with the team in the room so that we're all aligned that this is where it's going to go.</p><p>Doesn't always optimize one or the others. So we have to put a lot of give and take in this. But I'm legit in that, this is -- we're up 47 -- the frontline business is up 46% year over year. But it's a very (multiple speakers)</p><p>So it's a lot of work for very small, but this is our effort to step back in as Ghis does to a market that we largely exited a number of years ago and to demonstrate that we can provide consistent truck-like service that is going to allow this and it's good for climate and emissions. It's good for our business, but we need to demonstrate that we can do it.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: So you've teed up an area that I was going to get into a little bit later, but since we're on it. Growth, you didn't mention one or the other reasons -- ways that you grow, because you're in the right place, right? The growth in petrochemicals off the western part of Canada because of (multiple speakers) mobilizations projects moving out of China and other parts, that's just a good place to be.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: We get to be (technical difficulty) a tremendously positive net worth.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: So you've got a group of generalists here, many of whom are not going to be your typical Merlin investors. And they haven't, in fact (technical difficulty) from your guidance perspective, at a very high level, what are those three or four things that's very, very unique about the CN franchise, the differentiated versus other railroads upside?</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: I'll start. You can close. The very first thing, we touch all three coasts. But it's more than that; we've got optionality. On the West Coast with Vancouver and Rupert; Rupert is the fastest way to get from the Asia to Mid-Con. If you look at the East Coast, we've got we've got Port of Montreal. We access Port Saint John, but we have Halifax deepwater port. And when that volume is moving, it's a little bit lighter right now, but we just had the largest container ship in the world partner with PSA at Halifax. That is the fastest way to get from Southeast Asia into the mid-continent North America.</p><p>So we've got port access and optionality. We've got mobile and New Orleans on the south. And so it's a third of our business moves globally. We, as you made the point, David, we are the Northern Line in Canada which means it's the best agricultural growing area, and it's where all the petrochemicals and the energy businesses, including all of the inputs like frac sand. And in the East and the North, that's where the precious minerals are, the lithium and some of the other critical minerals that are starting to develop out there.</p><p>We've got the flattest network on the West Coast of any North American railroad, which is a privilege. I've worked for another railroad. It doesn't have a flat network, and it adds a lot of operating complexity. We have the best route around Chicago, which I think 75% of all volume in North America finds its way to Chicago. We've got the bypass around Chicago that ticks up a considerable time sufficient there.</p><p>So we've got some real structural advantages, and we have an incredibly diversified portfolio. 3% coal and 25% intermodal, but it's diversified across commodity and geographically. A third of our business touches global markets, a third of it goes across the Canada US border and the rest of the value within Canada and the US. [65%] of our business originates investments on our line, but we're getting better and better at being partners with the other railroads on the rest of it on a single-line haul. Ghis, what did I miss?</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: Not much. I think -- I'll finish on this the -- you've touched upon everything about the network. I think when I look at since Tracy joined, what has changed is really don't underestimate the value of the team, okay? The network -- we had that network in '18, '19. We had the same locomotives; we had the same railcars.</p><p>What has changed really is two things. Number one, we've clarified the operating model we're going to use is -- we're going to get our trains on time. That was not clear, and if it's not clear and if you're in Winnipeg and you're newer superintendent in about a 7,000-foot train and you know your incoming traffic, you've got 4,000 coming, you're going to wait -- and your train supposed to go at 1,400 -- you're going to wait another two hours to get that 4,050 so that now you can maximize and optimize that train. And you optimize your region, but you suboptimize the networks.</p><p>So when Tracy came on board, I remember we had many discussions together with you, Tracy and with the rest of the teammates, we're going to get these trains on time. Now some people have said well, now you agreed to run the trains short. No, we don't. Because if now that train continues to be short, we're going to do two things. We're going to push them into fill it up and two, we're going to tweak the schedule but from a network perspective, to make sure that again, we run long trains.</p><p>So the other pieces she made -- we made some key people decision to make sure we have the right people in the right spot and the team is gelling and the team trust each other and so on and so forth. And then there were some changes at the Board. We have a brand-new Board.</p><p>When you put that together, you can have the best network out there, but if you don't have the right people in the right spot to convert that value -- that network into value for shareholders and stakeholders, you have nothing. And do not underestimate the value of the team.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Okay. So coming back to that topic of growth, before you mentioned really sitting down with the FXE and the UP and managing that business as if you were one railroad sounds great, but you're not one railroad. And typically when you're talking about railroad partnerships, and you're talking about interline moves, at some point, you've got to divide the revenue.</p><p>How do you get out of that being the hurdle that constrains that growth for highly competitive traffic? At some point, if you're taking 200 miles out of a 4,100-mile move, it's not going to be appropriate on a percentage basis, but somebody is going to make more money than the other guy and you need both of them to (multiple speakers) and that's where we've always --</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: But you have to do this on principle. The principle is this. You can create the fastest service and the most direct route. In the case -- we're working on a lot with our partner railroads. We've got a long list of efforts with the UP and the same with some of our other partners. So this isn't the only one, but the principle of the mall is that you can -- if you can offer it the fastest route or the quickest turn times, the utilization of assets, that's number one.</p><p>So what way is that? And I would say that we want the business that deserve -- that should be online. We don't want the business that shouldn't be on your line, because there's a faster route elsewhere. And I would say (technical difficulty)</p><p>So when we look at it is one railroad, we choose the (technical difficulty) that have the lowest miles in the fastest time. And those are facts. And so it can be difficult for the commercial teams, because they've worked so hard and sometimes for the operations team, but we look at -- that's the rule that we choose that.</p><p>And then you do your commercial negotiation based on the changing -- and change in mileage and workload and who's doing the workload and how you divvy up the revenue. But we are staying true to that first principle which is fastest and shortest and the most natural interchange.</p><p>And so you are seeing them through this process, some of our volumes that we were handling before -- carload volumes -- are changing their change points, because if that is the only way to make this pie bigger is to offer our customers, service levels that are fast and consistent and efficient. And it's a bit of a you've got to belief, but we do believe that there's going to be more to move if we can do this one.</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: And we're interchanging information. So with this partnership, you're right; partnerships and the massive network. Okay. So the naysayers would say and it would be CEOs going and having been having dinner and nice press releases and so on. But the partnership would never be operationalized at the ground level and the one level folks with screw each other up.</p><p>What we've done here differently is -- number one is we have operationalized. So we know -- so when we are in Markham and we interchange with UP, UP brings their train from Eagle Paths to Markham. We actually know the inbound and the incoming traffic as if it's our online. We know it's coming. We interchange and we exchange information so that now we can be ready. We can have the track available in Markham so that that train gets there.</p><p>We call up our crews an hour in advance. They get on. They exchange the paperwork. They exchange of [TGPO], they get on the train. That train does not sit there for a couple of days. It sits there for maybe half an hour, an hour, and it goes. And we do that consistently and then what we do is we measure. So every day, she gets the report; I get the report, okay, what has gone well, what has gone wrong, so that we can -- If things have gone wrong, then you can have a constructive discussion about instead of pointing fingers.</p><p>And we all know that this is a win-win because for us, it gives us access to Mexico. Extends our network reach for UP, gives them access to everything north of Chicago. So it's a win-win.</p><p>And you're right. In the past, railroad would quibble, well, I'd like to interchange in Jackson and well, because I get a bigger piece of the pie. I'd like -- to her point when we -- this was the best for the service for customers and to be to be competitive with truckers. And that's what we looked at. And getting a smaller piece of something is better than getting a bigger piece of nothing.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: But one of the things -- I'll just have one final thing. This is you got to believe, because what would happen traditionally is the volume flow incoming, it is up 46% year over year, but it's still incoming. And so part of this that we need to service in place. We don't muck with it, because there's not enough volume. We leave it in place. That's going to be the discipline we have to demonstrate to the market.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: So and just to be clear, I'm not necessarily being a naysayer on this, but I do think that there are sometimes competing incentives on the economic side that do limit the growth rate. If you look at like East West intermodal traffic originating 100 or 200 miles across the Mississippi River and going the other direction, rail share is way lower than over the same distance on one railroad. But how do you get around that economic issue and the sharing of profit?</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: The way we think about we're [sitting] UP, for example, the Falcon service is kind of our banner for service. And it is one that we're leaning into, and the performance is going very well. It's composed of two countries, the three railroads that is going very well. But it's one of a number of roles. The way that I look at this is that we may lose out on some of this from a user to changing their chain point or our mileages, but as long as we're doing better off on the total.</p><p>We have forest products business we're looking at. We've got biofuels business that we're looking at. We've got all of the trucker business that we're looking at. So we look at it from a broader perspective. You don't have to win every piece.</p><p>I think that that's an important -- Jim and I talk about that a lot. That's an important way to think about that. And there's times where he is going to go off and want to do something that's -- and if I can't compete with whatever that is, then I'm out. He'll work with somebody else on the same thing we talked about that. You know, we've had a couple of instances where it's better that CN work for someone else, something at that time as well. You've got to bring the grow-ups' table on this.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Okay. So one of the things that has come up a couple of times in discussions around Canadian National because Rupert being a gateway to the China trade into the Mid-Con. We're in a period where China is no longer manufacturing for the world, and we're shifting towards Mexico. Big broad brushes speaking here, not like tomorrow. Does that create a challenge for you longer-term in terms of being able to continue to mine the economic value out of that cohort?</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: One of the things I love about our networks and our business is it's optionality. We've got the two coasts -- the two ports on the West. We've got Halifax that we're constructing in a way our business with them to pick up Southeast Asia kind of production that's going to find its way into North America, but we haven't -- moved for -- what makes room for the gym that it is, is that it is a multi-commodity facilities.</p><p>We take (technical difficulty) up there. We do a lot of the liquids business up there. We do forest products business up there. So it is a big intermodal terminal. And everything that we can see that's going to last some time.</p><p>Mexico could become competitive. There will be one other outlets. We like the positioning of Rupert is the fastest way. If you're in China, the fastest way to get to Mid-Con is going through Rupert and most economic play. And so if we can be competitive and make that link competitive, I feel pretty good about it.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: So coming back to North Americas for a second. Obviously, the landscape did shift a couple of years ago with CP acquiring Kansas City Southern and that whole thing shaking out. How has that impacted your business, right?</p><p>So historically, I've always sort of thought as because you are the railroad of the north, you have a much broader set of destinations you could offer your customers, and you've got a little bit better market share. Now they've kind of gotten a little bit of a leg up on that on that side. Is that having an impact on your day-to-day business? Pretty much the growth opportunities, which you --</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Yeah. I would say one of the things the team did very well long before I arrived is they were looking at all of that business booking opportunities for stan and also more dependently what the exposures were. And the team had in place already plants covered off almost all of the exposure.</p><p>So for crude example that we would have been taking an interchanging with KCS that could have then gone to another Canadian carrier. We now have a different destination. So we're moving all of that business but to a different destination as one on the KCS.</p><p>So a lot of that exposure to plants were already in place to mitigate that. So there's really no downside exposure. What I have seen based on my past in the industry that this triggers something really (technical difficulty) we used to not work well together with other railroads. This has kind of put everybody off-center, whether it's the UP and the CP (technical difficulty) or there any. We are working together in a completely different way.</p><p>I think that that's going to be a net positive for our customers and for the potential to pick-up truck business is just the way that we're looking at how we use our networks together, which started off defensive, and it's now much more offense around where are the opportunities think about service levels and service offerings. And there's a whole new kind of way we come together on this across every single one of the railroads. So that net, if we look backwards on all this -- back on it, I think that's going to be one (technical difficulty) the industry.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: And does that include UP or does that just include the US (multiple speakers)</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Yeah. UP do all kinds of (technical difficulty) to get the next go into the Southeast, and everybody's moving. And it's moving more quickly, more dynamically (technical difficulty) I think it's going to be more competitive. I think it's going to be different and better services for the industry that would (technical difficulty) I think it's going to be an (technical difficulty)</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Okay. And then as you think about the we've talked a lot about the UP and the Falcon service and that partnership there. You guys have done other partnerships, I think with (technical difficulty) roads or Norfolk. Can you give us any update in terms of like how that collaboration is working? Obviously, with there's now only, I guess, technically a friend of CN at the head of (multiple speakers)</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: We've got friends of CN everywhere with the drafting theme of all the other railroads. So I think this -- we have a partnership with NS to go to Kansas City and Atlanta. I think again, remember these are going to start small, because if you are a shipper and you have been given your box to the truck for the last 25 years, you're not all of a sudden wanted to give it to the rails and say, go ahead.</p><p>So we're being tested right now. And I'll test you with 30 loads, 40 loads. I like what I see. I'll give you more. I'll give you more. So this is just another example of another partnership. And as I said, you will see others, and we're working currently to get more of these because we want to (technical difficulty) and I think that this is a way to grow volumes and the US rails, it will be like us. They won't be able to get to double-digit EPS growth just on cutting costs.</p><p>I mean, at one point, you can't do that only on one metric. You've got to have a little bit of pricing. You've got to have a little bit of volume. You got to have a little bit of operational efficiency, maybe a little bit of help from share buyback, depending on where interest rates are and so on after financing costs. And when you put all that together, we're shooting to be double-digit EPS growth, which we believe will keep our growth PE.</p><p>And so they're recognizing the fact that CP with KCS and the message that now railroads need to work better together. And I think you start -- you can start seeing this happening. I think that they are realizing that they need a little bit of volume. They need the grow. And that's one of the things is to extend network reach.</p><p>So you'll see more of those. And then NS is just another example. And I just congratulated Claude. I was supposed to -- I asked him to play golf tomorrow morning, and he's a busy now. But is the new Chair of NS. So happy for him. Claude, congratulations. And yeah, I mean, we're well positioned to do these partnerships because we have friends at all over the industry.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Okay. As you think about the -- I don't want to get too far into the plumbing of the partnership stuff. I'm still trying to figure out how you get over the economics. So I guess we're coming up here to the end of our time together. So maybe, Tracy, I'm going to leave it to you for some closing comments around why now is a good time for investors to be thinking about deploying capital into CN and what kind of the algorithm looks like from a shareholder perspective.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Thank you for that setup. So listen, as I come into -- back into the industry and particularly CN, this is a -- and we've talked about it today, David -- a tremendous network that's got a lot of just structural advantages to it. It's our job now is to leverage.</p><p>And so we've got a strong network. We've picked the right operating model for this company. It's executing well. It's moving well. That gives us very positive customer service, which gives us pricing power. We've got inflation plus pricing power as we go. And this has allowed us over the past two years we've had in place to the end of the last year, as I said, to drive 23% EPS growth.</p><p>As we look forward at the end of this year, with our growth -- as modest as it may be -- but with our growth projections of this year, we'll be pushing 35% over since we've implemented this model of EPS growth and growth of about 6%, say, on volumes. So this is a model that works. We've got a strong balance sheet, really strong balance sheet that allows us to be nimble, but it also means we've got a new target on leverage that pushes out when we can buy back shares.</p><p>Our dividend policies remain consistent for as long as we've been a public company, which is we -- our dividend increases run roughly into with how our earnings growth is. So I think this is a strong, consistent model. We've got a growth plan out there. We've got really good line of sight too.</p><p>And this is one where it's important to us to what we talk about a lot of times is we're going to do what we say we do. And that's what we're going to do. This growth plan number over the next -- we've got line of sight -- we've guided to three years, but we've got line of sight beyond that.</p><p>I'm pretty excited about the most important part of it, which is the team. Because we can have a plan in place, but this engine, it's got to work no matter which one of us is sitting in the chair. And I like what I see around our senior team. We've made the right choices, but we're doing that throughout the organization now focusing on giving the next generation the right experiences, the right exposures so that they're ready as they come up. And there's no place I'd rather be.</p><p>GHISLAIN HOULE: All right. I think I think CN is in good hands with Tracy as a leader. And you owe me $20 on this (multiple speakers)</p><p>But I'm not kidding. I think she has done great, and we're very fortunate to be able to work with her. And I think shareholders can see that she's made a difference. And like I said, I'm very fortunate to be able to work with or have been around for -- and I've seen a lot of different leaders, but CN is in good hands under her leadership.</p><p>TRACY ROBINSON: Thank you.</p><p>DAVID VERNON: Well, thank you. And with that, I would like to thank you all for the support of the conference. Stacy and for everyone in the audience, enjoy the rest of your day here with Bernstein.

Men of power and wealth were being disturbed in their daily perambulation by young beggars. Starving, sick children would accost them for money. Some of these guttersnipes would pick their pocket. Being without housing and proper clothing, the children would naturally get sick and spread disease to unsuspecting passersby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, this conduct just couldn't be allowed. This behavior was an annoyance to the rich and powerful, interfered with commerce and was just too unpleasant for the fragility of proper women. The Christian nation was stymied. Fortunately for society, a brilliant thinker analyzed the problem and arrived at a simple solution to the issue.</p><p>Johnathon Swift made a modest proposal to just gather up the children and eat them. Problem solved.</p><p>Today our society is plagued by another confounding problem, that being the number of mass shootings. Now, once again, an individual of great intellect and discernment has stepped forward to help society. I do not request fame or fortune, I merely wish to be of service to society. The solution is so simple and yet elegant. The answer is suggested by nature, if one studies forest fires or plague and disease.</p><p>There is a natural limit to the spread and progression of disease. If enough of the host bodies die, the disease stops because of a lack of new hosts. Like a forest fire, it burns out because there is no new fuel. So the solution to our problem of mass murder can be solved by simply speeding up the process. We need to increase the access to more effective firearms and make those weapons available to more people. It is brilliant, if counterintuitive. The more people killed in mass shootings, the quicker we get to the natural limit of death.</p><p>Just like disease, we just need to kill off enough hosts. What people should understand is that society will learn to change behavior given enough time. The issue with firearms and mass killings will require aggressive and useful education. Maybe we need 10 million dead to effect change concerning mass shootings. Sounds like a lot, but it's only 3% of our population, so let's stop playing around and solve the problem.</p><p>No single-shot firearms. Make machine guns available to all. Allow next-day delivery by Amazon. Stoke demand by running public service ads. \"Did your boss fire you? Killing is always a solution.\" \"Family strife too much? Kill 'Em All with this handy machine gun.\" \"Never stand in line again. Kill all those irritating people ahead of you.\"</p><p>Now I admit, my math may be off to accomplish our goal of stopping mass murder. Perhaps we need to kill 10% of the population, or about 32 million people. Eventually, we will kill enough people that those still alive realize they should take some sort of action of a different nature. There are a lot of stupid people in America, so who knows how many people must die before we are willing to change. But instead of waiting 50 years for sanity to rule, let's get this done in the next year.</p><p>No namby-pamby AK-47's.

Such arguments are not about convincing those on the right to join efforts to address environmental risks, but to tear down others to make yourself appear more righteous by comparison.<br/>Putting political point-scoring ahead of effectiveness also makes environmental issues more partisan and undermines opportunities for cooperation.<br/>For example, after it took the unusual step of endorsing Joe Biden for President, Nature found \"little evidence that the endorsement changed views about Biden and Trump.\" On the contrary, Nature's own study found that \"political endorsement by scientific journals can undermine and polarize public confidence in the endorsing journals and scientific community.\"<br/>Conflating science and politics didn't change the politics but did undermine the science.<br/>Ironically, even after acknowledging these results, Nature said it would consider making endorsements in the future, throwing their own study aside in favor of virtue signaling.<br/>That problem becomes more acute when environmental issues are used to \"own\" the other side.<br/>A Tesla catches fire? Clearly EVs are dangerous.<br/>A forest fire puts smoke into a community? It is obviously a \"climate fire.\"<br/>\u00a0Of course, there are legitimate critiques of policies that spend taxpayer dollars to promote EVs and of the impact of dry summers have on already unhealthy and fire-prone forests. I spend a great deal of time showing that Washington's environmental policies aren't achieving the goals they purport to address.<br/>But injecting more politics into environmental issues makes it difficult to discern between accountability and political attacks.<br/>As a result, the reaction to many environmental discussions is to entrench. For the Right, the risks from climate change aren't merely exaggerated - it is a hoax. For the Left, the risks from climate change aren't merely serious - they are a threat to human existence.<br/>Both forms of entrenchment encourage absurd claims and undermine the claimants. For example, the claim the Governor and staff at the Department of Ecology have staked themselves to, claiming that a big increase in taxes on CO2 emissions won't increase gas prices even as they admit that is the purpose and every climate expert says it does.<br/>We are certain to see people again using Earth Day as a political weapon to critique political opponents and demand policies that suit the ideological agenda of politicians.<br/>Instead, I would encourage people to spend Earth Day appreciating the wonder of nature and the creation that surrounds us. Simple acts of good stewardship, like planting a tree that is needed or picking up litter, makes a difference and does more than many of the symbolic efforts that will be on display.<br/>    Sign up for the WPC Newsletter      Please enter full name        Please enter e-mail address            <br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-183491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:682N-CM11-DYY9-00FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 Washington Policy, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Policy Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 21, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NATURE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>BLOG</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>PIERRE ALEXANDRE, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ORBIT GARANT DRILLING INC.: Thank you, Joel, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With me on the call is Daniel Maheu, CFO. Following my opening remarks, Daniel will review our financial results in greater detail, and I will conclude with comments on our outlook. We will then welcome questions.</p><p>We generate improved financial performance during the fiscal 2023 as strong customer demand in Canada drove increased specialized drilling activity and improved pricing on contract relative to the prior year. Revenue for fiscal 2023 was a record of $201 million, an increase of 2.8% compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted gross margin increased to 16.2%, up from 12.2% last year. And adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $19.1 million compared to EBITDA of $10 million last year. However, the positive momentum that we carry through most of the year was impacted in our fourth quarter by a temporary reduction of drilling activity in Canada.</p><p>The decline is partly attributable to forest fire in Quebec. We had to suspend drilling activities on all of our surface and underground drilling projects in Quebec as well as one surface project in Ontario for various period beginning on May 29 and continuing into July. This resulted in a revenue reduction in Q4 of approximately $3 million.</p><p>In addition, certain customers decided to temporarily suspend our reduced drilling activity on other projects. These decisions were company-specific and have nothing to do with our performance. However, the impact revenue in Q4. Fortunately, we began ramping up the project that were suspended due to forest fires in early July. By July 26, all of these projects were fully resumed.</p><p>We expect to resume operation on all our projects in which drilling activity was temporarily suspended and reduced due to customer decision by January 2024. One of this project, which is a major customer already resumed in the middle of the last month.</p><p>Our fourth quarter results were also impacted by a onetime noncash restructuring charge of $4.2 million related to our decision to wind down drilling activities in Burkina Faso and exit the country. We expect to complete our drilling program in Burkina Faso during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This decision to exit Burkina Faso is based on our assessment of the significant additional investment required to generate an acceptable return on our investment in this market as well as the increased and ongoing security concerns within the country.</p><p>I will now turn the call to over to Daniel to review our fiscal fourth quarter and full year results in more detail. Daniel?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU, CFO &amp; CORPORATE SECRETARY, ORBIT GARANT DRILLING INC.: Thank you, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal 2023 fourth quarter revenue totaled $46.8 million compared to $53.8 million in Q4 last year. Canada revenue totaled $32.6 million, a decline of 22.6% from Q4 last year. As Pierre noted, the decline reflects the reduction of drilling activity in Canada due to forest fire in Quebec and customer decision to temporarily suspend or reduce activity on certain other projects.</p><p>International revenue increased to $14.2 million compared to $11.8 million in Q4 last year, primarily reflecting increased drilling activities in Chile. Our drilling utilization rate in Q4 was approximately 54%. That was lower compared to the recent quarter due to the impact of forest fire and customer decision to temporarily suspend or reduce activity on certain other projects.</p><p>The $4.2 million onetime noncash restructuring charge relating to our decision to accept Burkina Faso, reflect a write-down of inventory to the net realizable value. Gross profit for the quarter was $0.7 million compared to $6.9 million in Q4 of last year. The decrease was primarily due to the restructuring charge and the reduced activity in Canada.</p><p>Adjusted gross margin, excluding depreciation expense and the write-down of inventory from restructuring was 15.9%, compared to 17.2% a year ago, reflecting lower revenue due to reduced drilling activity in Canada.</p><p>G&amp;A expenses were 10.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to 7% of revenue in Q4 last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.8 million compared to EBITDA of $5.7 million in Q4 last year, reflecting the reduced drilling activity in Canada.</p><p>Net loss was $4.1 million or $0.11 per share compared to net earnings of $0.5 million or $0.01 per share in Q4 a year ago. The net loss in Q4 this year was primarily attributable to the restructuring charge and reduced drilling activity in Canada.</p><p>Now turning to the results for the fiscal year-end June 30, revenue for fiscal 2023 was a record $201 million, an increase of 2.8% compared to fiscal 2022. Canada revenue totaled $152.1 million, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year, reflecting increased specialized drilling activities and improved pricing, partially offset by the reduction of drilling activity in Canada during the fourth quarter.</p><p>International revenue was $48.9 million, a slight reduction from $50.3 million last year, reflecting reduced drilling activity in Burkina Faso, partially offset by increased activity in Chile and Guinea.</p><p>Gross profit for fiscal 2023 increased to $18.3 million from $13.7 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to increased specialized drilling activity, improved pricing and cost control in Canada, partially offset by the $4.2 million restructuring charge and the reduction of drilling activity in Canada during Q4.</p><p>Prior year margins were also impacted by higher project ramp-up cost in Canada, mobilization costs for a new long-term project in Guinea and Chile and Omicron-related work interruption that began in November 2021.</p><p>Adjusted gross margin, excluding depreciation expense and write-down of inventories from restructuring was 16.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to 12.2% a year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to increased specialized running activity, improved pricing and cost control in Canada, partially offset by the reduction of drilling activity during Q4. G&amp;A expense were 8.2% of revenue in fiscal 2023 compared to 7.4% of revenue in the prior year.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023 increased to $19.1 million compared to EBITDA of $10 million last year. Net loss for fiscal 2023 was $0.7 million or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.6 million, or $0.18 per share in fiscal 2022. Our growth in adjusted EBITDA and our reduced net loss for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a higher of specialized drilling activity, improved pricing and cost controls in Canada, and a foreign exchange gain of $1.9 million, partially offset by right down of inventory from restructuring and reduction of the drilling activity in Canada during Q4. Our net loss for fiscal 2023 also reflect $1.1 million increase of interest expenses. EBITDA and our net loss in fiscal 2022 also reflect higher ramp-up cost and mobilization costs and Omicron-related work interaction.</p><p>Now turning to our balance sheet. During fiscal 2023, we repaid a net amount of $4.4 million of long-term debt and lease liabilities. In fiscal 2022, we generated a cash flow of $2.7 million from financing activity.</p><p>We repaid a net amount of $9.3 million on our credit facility during fiscal 2023 compared to a withdrawal of $7.3 million last year. Our long-term debt under the credit facility including USD 2 million drawn from our USD 5 revolving facility and the current portion, was $22.2 million as at fiscal year-end, compared $31.5 million as at June, a year ago. The reduction primarily reflect the utilization of a substantial portion of the $8.5 million loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada that was secured in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.</p><p>As of June 30, 2023, our working capital position was $50.4 million, compared to $53.4 million at our fiscal 2022 year-end.</p><p>I will now turn the call back to Pierre for closing comments. Pierre?</p><p>PIERRE ALEXANDRE: Thanks, Daniel. We are pleased with our overall performance for fiscal 2023. Unfortunately, our results for the year were negatively impact by the suspension of drilling activities in Canada late in the fourth quarter as discussed previously. These project suspension will negatively impact our fiscal 2024 first quarter results and to a lesser extent, our second quarter results.</p><p>Despite this temporary challenge, we remain positive on our longer-term outlook. Customer demand, particularly in Canada, remains strong, although we have experienced a softening in demand from our junior customers. We are experiencing in our drilling activities in Chile -- we are experiencing growth, sorry, in our drilling activity in Chile and Guinea. Our pending exit from Burkina Faso will allow us to focus more on these markets and customers.</p><p>The underlying fundamentals driving our business are solid. Gold price remained at historically strongly a bit above $1900 an ounce, gold producers are generating very strong margin at this price while struggling to replace their reserves. We are confident that continued high level of exploration and development spending will be maintained in this industry for the foreseeable future. We continue to generate approximately 2/3 of our revenue from gold drilling. So we have high exposure to this sector.</p><p>Copper price have also remained at elevated level over the past 12 months despite rising interest rate and economic uncertainty. Copper is needed for the ongoing electrification of the global economy, which is expected to drive strong demand for the red metal for many years to come. A healthy copper market is positive for our Chilean operations.</p><p>Looking ahead, we remain focused on our 5-point plan, which consists of primarily focusing on Canadian gold drilling operation, prioritizing long-term specialized drilling contract with major and intermediate customer, pursuing international contract that offer attractive return and high degree of cost and margin certainty, continued investment in driller training and computerized drilling technology and building a team-oriented leadership structure that fosters collaboration and personal accountability. By continuing to execute on this plan, we believe we can drive growth and build value for our shareholders.</p><p>That concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now welcome any questions. Operator, please begin the question period.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gordon Lawson with Paradigm.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON, ANALYST, PARADIGM CAPITAL INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Your International segment had an excellent year-over-year gain. Can you provide more insight into the Chilean contribution and if you can further break that down, how much of that comes from senior and intermediate copper companies?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: Yes. In Chile, most of our $30 million revenue came from major company in Chile, and Anglo American and also this kind of companies. So the level of $30 million increase from the $27 million last year. So from $27 million, we came to $30 million this year, and we expect to increase this level of income because we are actually in the process of being with the major customer for new contracts in Chile, at least 1 or 2 major contracts are in discussion actually in Chile.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON: Okay. Great. Also, your margins had an excellent improvement from last year. And aside from the ramp-up costs you mentioned earlier, can you help us get a better understanding of that increase in terms of which segments and commodities are providing the boost?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: Essentially, the ramp-up cost is related to copper contract with essentially a major customer in Chile and we -- actually, these contracts are going well, and they are extend for 2024 as well. So these costs are nonrecurring, and we expect margin in Chile to be stable or increase in the next fiscal year. And we see very good opportunity actually in Chile.</p><p>GORDON LAWSON: How much of that would you say is specialized versus simply having an excellent relationship with the majors?</p><p>PIERRE ALEXANDRE: Well, I would say that the type of service that we offer over there. So we do dewatering and other service that we offer that's one of the reasons why our margins are better with this customer, this client.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question comes from [Terry Balima] with -- he's a private investor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: In the fourth quarter, the adjusted EBITDA had a $1.8 million income tax hit -- I'm sorry, a $2.1 million income tax hit. Did I see the table correctly there? So the actual you had a net loss in the quarter, yet the company paid $2.1 million in taxes. And so the adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the income tax expense would actually be the $1.8 million plus the $2.1 million added back that you paid in taxes, it would be $3.9 million?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: You're right. In the Q4, we made an adjustment for income tax because essentially in Chile, in the last 2, 3 years, we are negative. So we don't record any income tax expenses or, let's say, tax loss was not accounted as an asset, so a future asset income tax. So with the results we have in Chile in the last year, so we are, let's say, more -- that's reduced a lot our income tax expense for the year, and we take this provision in Q4. So essentially, as we -- so it's a kind of adjustment for the Chilean tax, which affect our global tax expenses and we do this adjustment in Q4.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Also, the $3 million revenue loss to fires reduced your adjusted EBITDA, roughly how much in the Q4? I'm assuming you had to pay crews despite no revenues. So maybe a $2 million, $2.5 million EBITDA was affected there?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: You see we have an adjusted percentage as a percentage of roughly 10%. So I don't think it's $2 million, but it's probably more around $1 million EBITDA adjustment negatively for the quarter and Q4, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And when I see your adjusted gross profit margin in the high teens, and I compare it to your market peers, the adjusted gross profit percent is below your market -- below the market peers who are in the low to mid-20%. What is the reason for that. Is that from Burkina Faso losses possibly? Or is there something else?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: No, you're right. This is related to our International operations. We are experiencing very hard results in Burkina Faso and that's why we want to exit this country. And also Chilean operation is going well now. But in the last few, let's say, in calendar year 2022, Chilean operation was not so good. So we are not -- we are now since January 2023 in a better position in Chilean operation. But if we look only our Canadian operations, the margins are near the 20%, you're right, the International operation in fiscal 2023 affect us a lot. And we expect to have a better contribution with the International operation in the 2024 and 2025 fiscal year, essentially based on the exit of Burkina Faso and the growth of the gross margin in Chilean operation. And as I mentioned before, we are looking for major contract in Chile for 2024, 2025. And if that -- its conclude, that will be a good contribution to our gross margin in the next fiscal year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. In the last 12 months, what was the amount of losses for Burkina Faso?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: It's too much. First, I would like to say that is too much, and that's why we go through. You see we take a $4.2 million write-down essentially based on the inventory. The loss, let's say, EBITDA is -- if we look only at Burkina Faso, the EBITDA was negative for roughly $2 million.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That was for the last 12 months, yes?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Okay. Last question. In the Q4 with the $3 million sales from the revenue from fires loss and the $6 million temporarily suspended being pushed out into future quarters. So without those two things happening, your sales would have been about $56 million in the Q4 versus $53 million year-over-year. Is that about right?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: It will be -- the sales in the Q4 should be around $8 million and $10 million better if we don't have this suspension and fire, let's say, between $8 million to $10 million...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Those $8 million to $10 million -- okay. The $8 million to $10 million sales have not been lost, they've been pushed out to future quarters. Is that correct?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU: We are affected with the fire till the end of July. So in Q1, it will be, let's say, around $1 million less, between $1 million and $2 million less revenue in Q1 and the suspension will be less than 6, it will be around 4 let's say, but we saw some customer start operation, but we saw in the market actually with large, major and intermediate customer, a reduction of budget for exploration. We -- they want to restart later in the year, in the calendar year of 2023. So Q1 will be effect for sure with fire for a month and for the suspension of operation or reduction because in one contract we have 4 drill, and now we run only 1 or 2 drills. So this is -- we saw this trend with a lot of, let's say, 5, 6 large customer in Canada.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time.

Consolidated gold production of 90,392 ounces in the first quarter exceeded expectations. First quarter production benefitted from the continued mining of high copper and gold grades at the Pampacancha deposit in Peru, continued high gold grades mined at Lalor and strong performance from the New Britannia mill in Manitoba, and the operational stabilization efforts at the Copper Mountain mine in British Columbia. Full year 2024 production guidance for all metals has been affirmed.</p><p>Industry-leading consolidated cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product creditsi, was $0.16 in the first quarter of 2024, consistent with the favourable levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was primarily the result of continued high by-product credits, partially offset by higher mining costs and lower copper production. Consolidated sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product creditsi, was $1.03 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2023. This improvement was primarily due to lower sustaining capital expenditures. Full year 2024 consolidated cash cost, sustaining cash cost and capitalized expenditures guidance has been affirmed.</p><p>Cash generated from operating activities in the first quarter of 2024 of $139.7 million was lower than the fourth quarter of 2023 but better than anticipated, primarily because of strong gold sales volumes and higher realized copper prices, partially offset by a $30.1 million increase in cash taxes paid mainly in Peru. Operating cash flow before change in non-cash working capital of $147.5 million also exceeded expectations due to the same reasons.</p><p>Similarly, adjusted EBITDAi of $214.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 benefited from the solid operating performance outlined above and remained comparable to the strong levels achieved in recent quarters, including $274.4 million in the fourth quarter and $190.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.</p><p>Net earnings and earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 were $18.5 million and $0.05, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of $33.5 million and $0.10, respectively in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted net earningsi and adjusted net earnings per sharei in the first quarter of 2024 were $57.6 million and $0.16 per share, after adjusting for a $5.3 million non-cash gain related to the quarterly revaluation of the environmental reclamation provision at the closed sites, a $12.8 million mark-to-market revaluation loss related to share-based compensation expense, a revaluation of the gold prepayment liability and a revaluation of the company\u2019s strategic gold and copper hedges, and a $9.0 million write-down of PP&amp;E, among other items.</p><p>As at March 31, 2024, total liquidity increased to $618.9 million, including $284.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as undrawn availability of $334.5 million under the company\u2019s revolving credit facilities. Net debt declined by $43.5 million during the quarter to $994.2 million as at March 31, 2024. Based on expected free cash flow generation beyond the first quarter of 2024, the company continues to make progress on the deleveraging targets as outlined in the 3-P plan for sanctioning Copper World.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Consolidated Financial Condition ($000s)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Mar. 31, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Dec. 31, 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Mar. 31, 2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash and cash equivalents</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">284,385</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">249,794</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">255,563</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total long-term debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,278,587</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,287,536</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,225,023</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net debt1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">994,202</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,037,742</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">969,460</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Working capital2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">200,850</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">135,913</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">100,987</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5,231,283</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5,312,634</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4,367,982</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Equity3</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,107,532</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,096,811</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,574,521</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net debt to adjusted EBITDA1,4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1 Net debt and net debit to adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS.

While high grade copper and gold ore continued to be mined from Pampacancha in the first quarter of 2024, the mill processed less Pampacancha ore than in the fourth quarter of 2023, which resulted in lower copper, gold and silver production, in line with mine plan expectations. The company is on track to achieve its 2024 production guidance for all metals in Peru.</p><p>The Constancia operations benefited from strong mill throughput, averaging 89,000 tonnes per day in the first quarter. Mill ore feed has reverted to the typical blend of approximately one-third from Pampacancha and two-thirds from Constancia, which is expected to continue throughout 2024. The operations benefited from strong cost performance, achieving lower unit operating costs, cash cost and sustaining cash cost compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Cash cost also benefited from higher gold sales volumes in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>Total ore mined in the first quarter of 2024 decreased by 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and was in line with the mine plan, which included supplemental ore feed from stockpiles during the quarter as the company advances pit stripping activities. Ore mined from Pampacancha during the first quarter was 2.2 million tonnes at average grades of 0.56% copper and 0.32 grams per tonne gold.</p><p>Ore milled during the first quarter of 2024 was 2% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 mainly due to the treatment of softer ore from stockpiles. Milled copper and gold grades decreased in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of a normalized blending of ore feed from Pampacancha, as described above. Recoveries of copper, gold and silver during the first quarter of 2024 were 84.9%, 73.4% and 70.7%, respectively, and were in line with metallurgical models.</p><p>Combined mine, mill and G&amp;A unit operating costsi in the first quarter were $10.92 per tonne, 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower milling costs and higher ore throughput.</p><p>Cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product creditsi, in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.43, a 20% improvement over the favourable levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher by-product credits, lower milling costs, lower treatment and refining costs and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher copper production. Cash cost for the quarter was below the low end of the 2024 guidance range primarily due to high gold by-product credits, and it is expected to increase during the remainder of 2024 with full year cash cost expected to be within the 2024 guidance range.</p><p>Sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product creditsi, for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.06, a 12% improvement over the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to the same factors affecting cash cost.</p><p>The collective bargaining agreement with the labour union representing a portion of the Constancia workforce expired in November 2023, and Hudbay continues to negotiate the terms of a new agreement with the union.</p><p>In March 2024, the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines indicated an intention to make regulatory changes to allow mining companies to increase their permitted mill throughput levels by up to 10%. The company is monitoring the status of this proposed regulation and evaluating the potential to increase future production at Constancia.</p><p>Manitoba Operations Review</p><table

Production of gold in the first quarter was better than expected as a result of many operational improvement initiatives and record performance from the New Britannia mill, as described below. The company is on track to achieve its 2024 production guidance for all metals in Manitoba.</p><p>The strong production results in the first quarter of 2024 were partly attributed to the successful implementation of improvement initiatives at the Lalor mine that were completed in the second half of 2023 and in early 2024. Noteworthy improvements include high shaft availability, efficient ore hoisting, stope fragmentation reduction and mucking productivity enhancements. In 2024, the company\u2019s primary focus entails implementing stope design modifications aimed at improving mucking efficiency throughout a stope's lifecycle. The company also continues to focus on maintaining the quality of ore production with elevated metal grades through diligent efforts to minimize dilution and enhance ore recovery from stopes.</p><p>Total ore mined in Manitoba in the first quarter of 2024 was 9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. Grades for all metals reflect the successful execution of the company\u2019s strategic mine plan that prioritizes gold and copper production with a focus on enhanced ore recovery. This resulted in the continued mining of higher gold and copper grade zones and robust grade control practices, including assaying and sampling of blastholes, which further improved ore quality. This also resulted in reduced mining from the zinc areas, lowering the overall zinc grade at Lalor in the first quarter of 2024, in line with the mine plan.</p><p>Consistent with the company strategy of allocating more Lalor ore feed to New Britannia, the New Britannia mill throughput averaged a record 1,870 tonnes per day in the first quarter of 2024, a 4% improvement over the previous record level achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023. Recoveries of gold, copper and silver in the first quarter of 2024 were 88.6%, 96.2% and 82.0%, respectively.</p><p>The Stall mill processed 4% less ore in the first quarter of 2024 than the fourth quarter of 2023, which is aligned with the strategy of allocating more Lalor ore feed to New Britannia, as noted above. With the completion of the Stall mill recovery improvement project in 2023, recoveries of gold, copper and silver in the first quarter of 2024 were consistent with the fourth quarter, achieving targeted gold recovery levels of approximately 68%.</p><p>Combined mine, mill and G&amp;A unit operating costsi in the first quarter of 2024 were C$235 per tonne, a small increase of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to higher mining costs as a result of lower capitalized development costs and longer haulage distances and higher milling costs at Stall associated with lower throughput.</p><p>Cash cost per ounce of gold produced, net of by-product creditsi, in the first quarter of 2024 was $736, an increase compared to the uncharacteristically low fourth quarter of 2023 which benefitted from record gold production and higher by-product credits. However, the first quarter cash cost was well positioned at the lower end of the 2024 cash cost guidance range, and the company expects full year gold cash cost to remain within the 2024 guidance range.</p><p>Sustaining cash cost per ounce of gold produced, net of by-product creditsi, in the first quarter of 2024 was $950, an increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to the same factors affecting cash cost as well as lower sustaining capital costs during the quarter.</p><p>The New Britannia mill achieved record quarterly throughput of 1,870 tonnes per day in the first quarter due to ongoing improvement initiatives and effective preventative maintenance measures. Noteworthy enhancements in the elution circuit, which facilitates efficient carbon transfer and gold stripping, have bolstered gold recovery to dor\u00e9. During the first quarter, Hudbay received a permit approval from the Manitoba Environment and Climate Change ministry (\"MECC\") to increase the New Britannia mill production rate above nameplate capacity to 2,500 tonnes per day. This key approval aligns with the company\u2019s long-term objectives to further increase gold production at the Snow Lake operations by directing more gold ore from Lalor to the New Britannia mill to achieve higher gold recoveries.</p><p>At the Anderson tailings facility, Hudbay successfully improved the tailings deposition process during the quarter, leveraging new equipment and procedural refinements, enabling optimized storage capacity and deferred dam construction capital to future years. To further optimize the storage capacity of the facility, a permit to conduct a subaerial tailings deposition trial study was submitted to MECC during the quarter.</p><p>British Columbia Operations Review</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">British Columbia Operations</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Three Months Ended5\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mar. 31, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Dec. 31, 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ore mined1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">tonnes</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,722,496</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2,627,398</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Waste mined</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">tonnes</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">15,276,598</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">14,032,093</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strip ratio2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.10</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.34</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ore milled</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">tonnes</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,180,149</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3,261,891</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Copper</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.27</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.33</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">g/tonne</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.07</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.06</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Silver</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">g/tonne</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.19</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.36</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Copper recovery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">83.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">78.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold recovery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">61.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">54.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Silver recovery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">72.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">73.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total contained metal in concentrate2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Copper</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">tonnes</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7,024</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">8,508</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ounces</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4,417</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3,495</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Silver</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ounces</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">88,376</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">105,295</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total payable metal sold</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Copper</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">tonnes</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,933</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">9,119</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ounces</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,401</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3,091</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Silver</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">ounces</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">83,300</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">98,441</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Combined unit operating cost3,4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">C$/tonne</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">23.67</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">20.90</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash cost4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$/lb</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.49</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.67</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sustaining cash cost4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$/lb</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.85</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3.93</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1 Reported tonnes and grade for ore mined are estimates based on mine plan assumptions and may not reconcile fully to ore milled.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2 Strip ratio is calculated as waste mined divided by ore mined.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3 Reflects combined mine, mill and G&amp;A costs per tonne of ore milled.

Production of copper and silver was lower than the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily as a result of lower head grades, partially offset by higher recoveries. Production of gold was higher than the fourth quarter of 2024 as a result of higher grades and higher recoveries. The company is on track to achieve 2024 production guidance for all metals in British Columbia.</p><p>Since completing the acquisition of Copper Mountain on June 20, 2023, Hudbay has been focused on advancing operational stabilization plans, including opening up the mine by adding additional mining faces and re-mobilizing idle haul trucks, optimizing the ore feed to the plant and implementing plant improvement initiatives that mirror Hudbay's successful processes at Constancia. While the benefits of these stabilization plans are not expected to be fully realized until 2025, the company successfully increased the total tonnes moved and has seen stronger mill performance as demonstrated by higher mill availability and above-target copper recoveries of 83.4% in the first quarter of 2024, achieving the highest quarterly copper recoveries in the last decade. Stabilization benefits continued to be realized into April with 83% copper recoveries and approximately 40,000 tonnes per day average mill throughput, an increase of approximately 9% over throughput levels in the first quarter.</p><p>Hudbay has exceeded the targeted $10 million in annualized corporate synergies and is on track to realize the three-year annual operating efficiencies target.</p><p>Total ore mined at Copper Mountain in the first quarter of 2024 was 3.7 million tonnes, a 42% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2023. The mine operations team continues to implement a fleet production ramp up plan to remobilize idle capital equipment at the Copper Mountain site as part of the accelerated stripping program to access higher head grades. This plan entails remobilization of the mining truck fleet, deployment of an additional shovel, production drill and associated equipment. During the quarter, the company also advanced the delivery of five haul trucks to self-perform additional stripping activities over the next three years at a lower cost than the contractor mining approach that was contemplated in the technical report. As a result, total material moved is expected to continue to increase quarter over quarter in line with the mine plan.</p><p>The mill processed 3.2 million tonnes of ore during the first quarter of 2024, a 3% decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Benefiting from stabilization and reliability initiatives within the comminution circuit, the average mill availability during the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 4% to 90.4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, while maintaining a stable throughput rate. Mill throughput in the first quarter 2024 was impacted by reduced reliability of the crushing circuit, caused primarily by elevated levels of magnetite and scrap metal as mining progresses through areas of historical underground workings. During the quarter, a number of initiatives were advanced to address these issues and other identified constraints and improve throughput to targeted levels, with the benefits expected to be realized throughout the rest of 2024. These initiatives include reprogramming of the mill expert system, installation of advanced semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) control instrumentation, redesign of the SAG liner package and updated operational procedures intended to remove magnetite from the pebble stream.</p><p>Maintenance practices to improve mill availability continue to be a key pillar of the stabilization initiatives. The first quarter planned maintenance shutdown focused on achieving 100% compliance to planned execution. Future maintenance practice enhancements are planned for rollout over the second and third quarters of 2024, which entail the implementation of improved maintenance management processes and a change in the maintenance organizational structure. Work has begun to analyze the trade-off among the various alternatives to further enhance mill performance.</p><p>Milled copper grades during the first quarter of 2024 averaged 0.27%, lower than the fourth quarter of 2023 but higher than the reserve grade of 0.25%. Copper recoveries of 83.4% were higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and higher than expectations for the first quarter due to relieving the regrind circuit constraint and implementing the flotation operational strategy improvements, including reagent selection and dose modification.</p><p>Work continues on the expert system that controls mill feed with implementation expected during the second quarter. Throughput in April increased to approximately 40,000 tonnes per day as the mill began realizing benefits from the recalibrated expert system, amongst other initiatives. The benefits of the operational stabilization improvements are expected to continue to be realized throughout 2024. The company is also accelerating engineering studies to debottleneck and increase the nominal plant capacity to 50,000 tonnes per day earlier than was contemplated in the technical report.</p><p>Combined mine, mill and G&amp;A unit operating costs in the first quarter of 2024 were C$23.67 per tonne milled, 13% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher mining costs. Combined unit operating costs are expected to decrease over time as the company continues to implement its stabilization and optimization initiatives at Copper Mountain. As the hiring and training of additional haul truck drivers continues, the company expects to have a fully trained complement of truck drivers by July to support the larger mining fleet, which is expected to increase material moved and reduce unit operating costs.\u00a0</p><p>Cash cost and sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, in the first quarter of 2024 were $3.49 and $4.85, respectively. Cash cost for the quarter was above the upper end of the 2024 guidance range; however, it is expected to decline during the remainder of 2024 and the full year cash cost is expected to be within the 2024 guidance range.</p><p>Generating Free Cash Flow with Increased Production and Continued Financial Discipline</p><p>Hudbay delivered a third successive quarter of positive free cash flow during the first quarter of 2024 as the company executed its plan for higher copper and gold production from Pampacancha and higher gold production at Lalor, both driven by higher grades, throughput and recoveries. The company continues to expect to see strong production levels throughout 2024 from sustained higher grades in Peru and Manitoba, along with additional production from Copper Mountain.</p><p>During the first quarter, Hudbay completed $10 million in net repayments on its revolving credit facilities. The company also completed three additional months of deliveries under the gold forward sale and prepay agreement, further reducing the outstanding gold prepayment liability, and is scheduled to fully repay the gold prepay facility by August 2024. Despite these debt repayments and gold deliveries, the company increased its cash and cash equivalents to $284.4 million and reduced overall net debt to $994.2 million as at March 31, 2024, compared to $249.8 million and $1,037.7 million, respectively, as at December 31, 2023. The $43.5 million decline in net debt, together with higher levels of adjusted EBITDAi in the first quarter, have improved Hudbay\u2019s net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratioi to 1.3x compared to 1.6x at the end of 2023. Subsequent to quarter-end, the company continued the deleveraging efforts with an additional $10 million repayment on the revolving credit facilities in May 2024.</p><p>During the first quarter, the company continued to exercise financial discipline and take steps to support free cash flow generation during the stabilization period at Copper Mountain. To this end, Hudbay entered into new forward sales contracts at Copper Mountain for a total of 3,600 tonnes of copper production over the twelve-month period from May 2024 to April 2025 at an average price of $3.97 per pound, as well as zero-cost collars for 3,000 tonnes of copper production over the twelve-month period from May 2024 to April 2025 at an average floor price of $4.00 per pound and an average cap price of $4.36 per pound. As at March 31, 2024, 15.9 million pounds of copper forwards and 19.8 million pounds of copper collars were outstanding, representing approximately 44% of 2024 production guidance levels for Copper Mountain. The company also entered into zero-cost collars for 36,000 ounces of gold production over the period from April to December 2024 at an average floor price of $2,088 per ounce and an average cap price of $2,458 per ounce.</p><p>Annual Reserve and Resource Update </p><p>Hudbay provided its annual mineral reserve and resource update on March 28, 2024. Current mineral reserve estimates at Constancia and Pampacancha total an aggregate of approximately 548 million tonnes at 0.27% copper with approximately 1.5 million tonnes of contained copper. The expected mine life of Constancia has been extended by three years to 2041 as a result of the successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves with the addition of a further mining phase at the Constancia pit following positive geotechnical drilling studies in 2023. There remains potential for further reserve conversion and future mine life extensions at Constancia through an additional 172 million tonnes of measured and indicated resources at 0.22% copper and 37 million tonnes of inferred resources at 0.40% copper, in each case, exclusive of mineral reserves.</p><p>Current mineral reserve estimates in Snow Lake total 17 million tonnes with approximately 2 million ounces in contained gold, and the expected mine life of the Snow Lake operations has been maintained until 2038. The Snow Lake operations continue to achieve higher gold production levels due to the New Britannia mill operating well above design capacity, the recent completion of the Stall mill recovery improvement project in 2023 and the implementation of several optimization initiatives at the Lalor mine to improve the quality of ore production and minimize waste dilution. There remains another 1.4 million ounces of gold in inferred resources in Snow Lake that have the potential to maintain strong annual gold production levels beyond 2030 and further extend the mine life in Snow Lake. The company is advancing an access drift at the nearby 1901 deposit to enable infill drilling aimed at converting the inferred mineral resources in the gold lenses to mineral reserves.</p><p>Current mineral reserve estimates at the Copper Mountain mine total 367 million tonnes at 0.25% copper and 0.12 grams per tonne gold with approximately 900,000 tonnes of contained copper and 1.4 million ounces of contained gold. Hudbay acquired the Copper Mountain mine as part of the acquisition of Copper Mountain Mining Corporation in June 2023. The company holds a 75% interest in the Copper Mountain mine, while Mitsubishi Materials Corp. holds the remaining 25% interest. The current mineral reserve estimates support a 21-year mine life, as previously disclosed in Hudbay\u2019s first National Instrument 43-101 technical report in respect of the Copper Mountain mine filed in December 2023 (the \"Copper Mountain Technical Report\"). There exists significant upside potential for reserve conversion and extending mine life beyond 21 years through an additional 140 million tonnes of measured and indicated resources at 0.21% copper and 0.10 grams per tonne gold and 370 million tonnes of inferred resources at 0.25% copper and 0.13 grams per tonne gold, in each case, exclusive of mineral reserves.</p><p>Hudbay released updated three-year production guidance with its annual mineral reserve and resource update, as presented below. Consolidated copper production over the next three years is expected to average 153,000ii tonnes, representing an increase of 16% from 2023 levels. Consolidated gold production over the next three years is expected to average 272,500ii ounces, reflecting continued high annual gold production levels in Manitoba and a smoothing of Pampacancha high grade gold zones in Peru over the 2023 to 2025 period. Annual production at the Constancia operations is expected to average approximately 101,000ii tonnes of copper and 62,000ii ounces of gold over the next three years. Annual gold production from Snow Lake is expected to average approximately 185,000ii ounces over the next three years, in line with 2023 levels. Annual copper production at the British Columbia operations is expected to average approximately 41,000ii tonnes of copper over the next three years. British Columbia production guidance ranges in 2024 and 2025 are wider than typical ranges and coincide with the operation ramp up activities over the stabilization period. Copper production at the Copper Mountain mine is expected to increase by 32% in 2026 compared to 2024, reflecting operational improvements consistent with the Copper Mountain Technical Report.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">3-Year Production OutlookContained Metal in Concentrate and Dor\u00e91</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2024 Guidance</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2025 Guidance</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2026 Guidance</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Peru</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Copper</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">tonnes</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">98,000 -

This approval was challenged in state court, but the challenge was dismissed in May 2023. In late 2022, Hudbay submitted the applications for an Aquifer Protection Permit and an Air Quality Permit to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. Hudbay continues to expect to receive these two outstanding state permits in 2024. Hudbay also received the floodplain use permit approval from Pima County in April 2024.</p><p>Copper World is one of the highest-grade open pit copper projects in the Americasiii with proven and probable mineral reserves of 385 million tonnes at 0.54% copper. There remains approximately 60% of the total copper contained in measured and indicated mineral resources (exclusive of mineral reserves), providing significant potential for Phase II expansion and mine life extension. In addition, the inferred mineral resource estimates are at a comparable copper grade and also provide significant upside potential.</p><p>Exploration Update</p><p>Progressing Maria Reyna and Caballito Exploration Permits</p><p>Hudbay controls a large, contiguous block of mineral rights with the potential to host mineral deposits in close proximity to the Constancia processing facility, including the past producing Caballito property and the highly prospective Maria Reyna property. The company commenced early exploration activities at Maria Reyna and Caballito after completing a surface rights exploration agreement with the community of Uchucarcco in August 2022. As part of the drill permitting process, environmental impact assessment applications were submitted for the Maria Reyna property in November 2023 and for the Caballito property in April 2024.</p><p>Executing Largest Snow Lake Exploration Program</p><p>The planned 2024 exploration program is Hudbay\u2019s largest Snow Lake program in company history and consists of modern geophysical programs and multi-phased drilling campaigns:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Modern geophysics program \u2013 A majority of the newly acquired Cook Lake and former Rockcliff claims have been untested by modern deep geophysics, which was the discovery method for the Lalor deposit.

The 1901 development and exploration drift is proceeding on schedule and on budget and is expected to reach the mineralization in late-2024, followed by planned definition drilling in 2025 intended to confirm the optimal mining method, evaluate the orebody geometry and continuity, and convert inferred mineral resources in the gold lenses to mineral reserves. In addition to the benefits of being able to cycle development rounds faster, the smaller profile drift has significantly reduced the cost per metre of advance by 33% compared to average 2023 development costs incurred at Lalor.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Flin Flon Tailings Reprocessing</p><p>Hudbay is advancing studies to evaluate the opportunity to reprocess Flin Flon tailings where more than 100 million tonnes of tailings have been deposited for over 90 years from the mill and the zinc plant. The studies are evaluating the potential to use the existing Flin Flon concentrator, which is currently on care and maintenance after the closure of the 777 mine in 2022, with flow sheet modifications to reprocess tailings to recover critical minerals and precious metals while creating environmental and social benefits for the region. The company is completing metallurgical test work and an early economic study to evaluate the tailings reprocessing opportunity.</p><p>The Flin Flon tailings facility contains materials generated from the metallurgical complex and confirmatory drilling has been conducted over the last several years:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Mill tailings \u2013 Initial confirmatory drilling completed in 2022 indicated higher zinc, copper and silver grades than predicted from historical mill records while confirming the historical gold grade.

Mr. Tavchandjian is a qualified person pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d).</p><p>For a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves and resources at Hudbay's material mineral properties, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates of scientific and technical information may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant factors, please see the technical reports for the company\u2019s material properties as filed by Hudbay on SEDAR+ at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedarplus.ca\">www.sedarplus.ca</url> and EDGAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures</p><p>Adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted net earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, net debt, cash cost, sustaining and all-in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced, cash cost and sustaining cash cost per ounce of gold produced, combined unit costs and ratios based on these measures are non-IFRS performance measures. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating gross profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.</p><p>Management believes adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share provides an alternate measure of the company\u2019s performance for the current period and gives insight into its expected performance in future periods. These measures are used internally by the company to evaluate the performance of its underlying operations and to assist with its planning and forecasting of future operating results. As such, the company believes these measures are useful to investors in assessing the company\u2019s underlying performance. Hudbay provides adjusted EBITDA to help users analyze the company\u2019s results and to provide additional information about its ongoing cash generating potential in order to assess its capacity to service and repay debt, carry out investments and cover working capital needs. Net debt is shown because it is a performance measure used by the company to assess its financial position. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is shown because it is a performance measure used by the company to assess its financial leverage and debt capacity. Cash cost, sustaining and all-in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced are shown because the company believes they help investors and management assess the performance of its operations, including the margin generated by the operations and the company. Cash cost and sustaining cash cost per ounce of gold produced are shown because the company believes they help investors and management assess the performance of its Manitoba operations. Combined unit cost is shown because Hudbay believes it helps investors and management assess the company\u2019s cost structure and margins that are not impacted by variability in by-product commodity

According to news reporting out of Istanbul, Turkey, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Wildfires have become a global problem in recent years. Authorities are looking for various technological and auxiliary solutions to deal with this environmental crisis.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Turkcell-istanbul Technical University. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Istanbul Technical University: \"One of the advances being utilized in the forest fire field and its aftermath is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs play a fundamental role in wildfire-fighting solutions due to their ease of use and high accessibility. However, the energy constraints of a single UAV and the fire areas make monitoring challenging. Therefore, to address these issues, we propose a monitoring application called Phoenix. We make three main contributions with the Phoenix application. Firstly, we implement a monitoring application consisting of path planning, graph engine, and modified TSP algorithms to help the UAV's fire tracking and shorten its route. Secondly, we develop a network architecture to transfer the tracking data we obtained to provide information to the fire brigade and other firefighting units. Thirdly, we provide energy optimization for a single UAV mission. The first part of the application uses the elliptical fire model and simulation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In addition, Phoenix utilizes fuel moisture content ( f m c ) data of the fire zone to analyze the critical fire regions. The simulation results show that our Phoenix application reduces energy consumption by 38 % and enhances coverage by up to 51%.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Phoenix: Aerial Monitoring for Fighting Wildfires.

According to news reporting originating from Sanandaj, Iran, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This article discusses the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to detect, warn, and suppress forest fires. The proposed system consists of: 1) an energy harvesting-assisted surveillance UAV (SUAV) that detects and reports fires and 2) multiple ground-based firefighting UAVs (FUAVs) that travel to fire spots to suppress the fire.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Kurdistan, \"First, the SUAV carries out the forest fire detection using the onboard color and infrared cameras. The SUAV then uses fire alarm signals to warn/inform the ground-based FUAVs to begin the firefighting mission. The goal is to inform as many FUAVs as possible as the required task (extinguishing the fire) can be completed more effectively and faster with more FUAVs. To do this, the SUAV with onboard processing capabilities makes use of the advantages of reinforcement learning.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In particular, we propose a double Q-learning-based trajectory design problem that enables the energy-constrained SUAV to find the optimal sequence of FUAVs to visit (optimal flying trajectory) in order to maximize the number of informed FUAVs while considering the limited execution time, as the crucial issue is to control fire from the beginning to prevent uncontrolled spread of fire.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: A Reinforcement Learning-based Fire Warning and Suppression System Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

A CAF Liaison Officer is already integrated into the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre to help assess the situation and assist with planning efforts.</p><p>CAF resources will be provided for an initial period of three weeks, with a one-week possible extension.</p><p>In addition to the CAF deployment, the federal government is also providing the following supports:</p><p>* As a member of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), Parks Canada collaborates with other Canadian fire management agencies to provide support to our partners across the country and internationally when they require assistance by providing specialized equipment and wildland fire management personnel. Parks Canada currently has resources deployed to support various partner agencies and will continue to coordinate with CIFFC on all future requests for resource.</p><p>* Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is prepared to provide contracting support to the Province for supplies and logistics.</p><p>* Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is prepared to support impacted Canadians with enhanced Service Canada hours, outreach to evacuees, and deployment of mobile outreach to evacuation centres to support applications for services, such as employment insurance. ESDC is prioritizing employment insurance claims for those impacted. Additional procedures are in place to facilitate employment insurance claims where employers are not able to issue records of employment or where paper cheques may not be deliverable as a result of emergency situations.</p><p>* Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) continues to support affected First Nations through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP). Through EMAP, ISC keeps in close contact with affected First Nations and can advance funds or reimburse them for eligible expenses as needs are identified during daily communications with leadership and other partners, such as tribal councils as well as with the province.</p><p>* Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) National Emergency Strategic Stockpile (NESS), is engaged and standing by to assist with the delivery of any additional resources that can be leveraged.</p><p>* Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) regional staff are on the ground and working with the province and telecommunications service providers to keep people connected.</p><p>* Health Canada has deployed six air quality monitors to Nova Scotia to provide additional air quality monitoring capacity during emergency response efforts.</p><p>* The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as Nova Scotia's provincial police service, has been engaged in the response to the wildfires since the outset by assisting with evacuation efforts and road closures, publicly communicating vital public safety information, proactively patrolling communities to ensure safety and adherence to mandatory evacuation orders, and providing assistance to all partner agencies involved.</p><p>* Transport Canada (TC) will work with provincial officials to better understand the needs for potential flexibility in federal regulations to address any gaps in emergency firefighting and evacuations while ensuring aviation safety is maintained. TC has issued one Notice to Airmen in support of aerial forest fire suppression in Nova Scotia and will continue to support the efforts of the authorities in order to ensure the safety of aerial operations.</p><p>* The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) currently has response personnel and assets deployed to provide support to the Province of Nova Scotia in the form of Mobile Incident Command Post trailers, crew support trailers and helicopters for airlifts and aerial surveillance.</p><p>* Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) will continue providing weather forecasting capabilities to the Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office.</p><p>The Government of Canada is also assessing what additional resources can be made available through other federal departments and agencies.</p><p>In addition to these supports, the Government of Canada is establishing a donation matching program with the Province of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Red Cross to support Canadians who have been impacted by wildfires in the province.</p><p>The Government Operations Centre is working to coordinate the federal response to the wildfire situation in Nova Scotia and across the country. Officials are working closely with federal and provincial partners to coordinate this assistance.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"When it comes to managing these fires, it's all hands on deck. We recognize how traumatic and impactful displacement and evacuation can be for people who have had to flee their homes and the great anxiety this can cause. I am very grateful for the work of all of our first responders, firefighters, community volunteers, and the Canadian Red Cross and other local organizations. I want to also acknowledge the sacrifice and the challenges that Canadians have faced during these fires and assure them that the Government of Canada will always be there to help in times of need.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness</p><p>\"The Canadian Armed Forces are always prepared to support our federal and provincial partners in keeping Canadians safe, while simultaneously meeting our commitments to Allies and protecting Canadian interests abroad. Our assistance to the Province of Nova Scotia, as they fight these unpredictable and devastating fires, is a tangible demonstration of the CAF's dedication to their ongoing readiness to assist civil authorities in times of natural disaster.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Anita Anand, Minister of National Defence</p><p>\"This unprecedented wildfire season is incredibly stressful and emotionally devastating for affected First Nations communities in Nova Scotia and across the country. We continue to work with First Nations and provincial leadership to protect life and property on reserves during the ongoing emergency and when the time comes we will be there to help with community rebuilding efforts. Thank you to all those working to ensure communities are safe at this challenging time.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"We stand in solidarity with Nova Scotians in the face of these devastating wildfires. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting Nova Scotia in every possible way during this challenging time. We have heard the call for assistance, and we are mobilizing our resources to provide the necessary support. Together, we will overcome this and rebuild stronger and more resilient communities. Our thoughts are with the people of Nova Scotia, and we will stand by them every step of the way.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</p><p>\"Our thoughts go out to the people affected by the wildfires. The Canadian Coast Guard is onsite ready to support and provide our assets and services to the Province of Nova Scotia. We are deeply grateful to the first responders, fire fighters and all those working tirelessly to tackle these wildfires.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Joyce Murray, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* The Government Operations Centre is responsible for coordinating the Government of Canada's response to emergency events.</p><p>* In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the municipal level and if they need assistance, they request it from their province or territory. If the emergency escalates further, provinces or territories can request assistance from the federal government.</p><p>* A Request for Federal Assistance is initiated when an emergency event overwhelms or threatens to overwhelm the resources of a province or territory and additional federal resources are needed to effectively support the impacted region.</p><p>* Should a province or territory make an official Request for Federal Assistance, there is a well-established process in place for managing the request, through the Government Operations Centre, and includes provincial/territorial and interdepartmental consultation and coordination.</p><p>* If provincial and territorial authorities require assistance, they may ask the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) for help. When the CAF responds to natural disasters in Canada, it is known as Operation LENTUS.</p><p>* CAF assistance complements and enhances provincial and local resources with unique capabilities, including military personnel and equipment. The primary objective is to help provincial and local authorities stabilize the situation and to reassure Canadian residents in the affected areas.</p><p>* The number of CAF members deployed across the region will vary based on tasks that are identified by the provinces.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/06/government-of-canada-to-provide-assistance-to-nova-scotia-in-response-to-extreme-wildfires.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/06/government-of-canada-to-provide-assistance-to-nova-scotia-in-response-to-extreme-wildfires.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8174865 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8174865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CF-9CR1-JC11-14J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1643\"/><timeReceived>11:47 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 2, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Responders put lines of containment around the affected region, brought in brush trucks to spray water on hot areas and deployed overhead firefighters and strike teams. The fire was 95% contained as of Tuesday.</p><p>Kitchenges and the response team's considerable effort comes as Texas faces a period of increased fire activity \u2014 largely propelled by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/07/texas-hottest-summer-2023/\">record high temperatures</url>  and drought. Making matters worse, there is a growing shortage of volunteer firefighters, who are often the first responders in rural areas of the state.</p><p>Local fire chiefs worry that if the trend continues, fires could get out of hand more quickly and further strain local departments. About 70 percent of Texas' firefighters are volunteers, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/registry/summary#footnote5\">data</url>  from the U.S. Fire Administration. And despite the high volume of wildfires in East Texas, the region has only about 3,100 firefighters, which is fewer than the number in Houston alone, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tcfp.texas.gov/about/fire-department-by-region\">according to</url>  the Texas Commission on Fire Protection.</p><p>The Texas A&amp;M Forest Service, a state agency that responds to fires and monitors wildfire conditions, last month upped its wildfire preparedness level to a 4 \u2014 the second highest rating. There's a high volume of wildfires that are resistant to control. Soon after, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a wildfire disaster declaration for about 75% of Texas counties. He renewed the declaration Sept. 1.</p><p>The intensity is unlikely to let up any time soon. The National Interagency Fire Network, which mobilizes resources to fight wildfires nationally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nifc.gov/nicc-files/predictive/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf\">predicts</url>  that much of Oklahoma, Texas and the Mississippi Valley will continue to have above normal fire potential throughout September due to extreme heat and below normal precipitation.</p><p>'Drought development and the number of consecutive 100-plus degree days has contributed to critically dry vegetation across much of the state, which is supportive of wildfire activity,' said Erin O'Connor, program specialist for the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service. 'With current conditions, we have wildfires that are more complex and show extreme fire behavior, hold heat longer and require more time and effort to suppress.'</p><p>Since 2005, the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service has responded to an average of 103 wildfires in July and 151 in August. This year, those numbers skyrocketed to 163 wildfires in July and 501 in August. That acreage is concentrated in East Texas, the state's principal forest region.</p><p>Texas has two wildfire seasons, one in the winter and one in the summer. The winter season features wind-driven fires focused on grass-dominant landscape. The summer fire season is more intense, with active fire behavior in brush and timber vegetation. The forest service has responded to fewer wildfires this year than last year, but more of this year's fires have been in the more intense summer months.</p><p>Local fire departments, especially in rural areas that often rely on volunteers, of which there's a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/13/texas-rural-volunteers-ems-fire-fighters/\">shortage</url> , are strained.</p><p>'It's become very difficult to recruit people,' said Mickey Hamilton, chief of the Overton volunteer fire department. Overton is a town of about 2,200 people that lies in both Smith and Rusk counties. 'And I'll get people who say they'll come but they never show up.'</p><p>Hamilton attributes part of the challenge to the increase in certification requirements to volunteer. In 2010, the Texas Commission on Fire Protection adopted a new initiative requiring certified fire protection personnel to complete additional training. Those certification courses are not always offered in rural areas, so volunteers have to travel to larger cities.</p><p>Hamilton said he is sending at least two people to Smith County this year to complete their training.</p><p>In Walker County, the Huntsville Fire Department relies on both full time personnel and volunteers. Fire chief Greg Mathis said that during times of intense wildfires, it's useful to have external response teams come in to help manage the disaster. He appreciates the Florida response team who helped put out the Game Preserve Fire.</p><p>Kitchenges, who is continuing to help manage the fire, said he is not sure where he and his team will be deployed next. So far, Texas A&amp;M Forest Service has mobilized more than 1,400 firefighters from 38 states and territories to assist with wildfire response this year.</p><p>As of Tuesday, 28 wildfires remain active in Texas, and all but one of them are in East Texas. Mathis encouraged people to stay prepared and watchful and to adhere to the burn bans.</p><p>The full program is now LIVE for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://trib.it/HmQ\">2023 Texas Tribune Festival</url> , happening Sept. 21-23 in Austin.

Between the unusually warm winter to start the year off and the two-month work stoppage during the summer because of the unprecedented forest fires in this part of Qu\u00e9bec, it's been very challenging to get our work programs completed this year. I am very confident the results from the large amount of work done over the past two years has set the table for continued success at Ducros.\"</p><p>2023 Exploration Diamond Drilling</p><p>The 2023 drilling program tested a wide variety of prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets across the entire Ducros Property. In total, 17,815 metres were completed in 50 holes at multiple target areas such as the Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex (DUSC), the Ducros Sill Trend, the Q-Zone Target as well as at the greater Fortin Sill Zone area. Of note, and as previously announced, two large nickel + cobalt-bearing ultramafic intrusions were discovered at the Ducros Sill Trend and Q-Zone target earlier this year (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F07%2Fquebec-nickel-intersects-152-metres-of-0-21-nickel-114-ppm-cobalt-at-ducros-sill%2F&amp;esheet=53870161&amp;newsitemid=20231213130536&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=July+12%2C+2023&amp;index=3&amp;md5=39cd682d7910f23ab912356a1538fd09\">July 12, 2023</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F09%2Fquebec-nickel-decouvre-une-nouvelle-grande-intrusion-ultramafique-contenant-du-nickel-cobalt-a-ducros%2F&amp;esheet=53870161&amp;newsitemid=20231213130536&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=September+12%2C+2023&amp;index=4&amp;md5=368979f75f7d2e7e9b0dbcc6a611ab5f\">September 12, 2023</url> News Releases for more information).</p><p>Drilling at the Fortin Sill Zone began in April with the completion of four short holes at the main Ni-Cu-PGE showing. These HQ-diameter holes supplied the materials required for a scoping-level metallurgical test program of the Fortin Sill Zone sulphides. Upon the lifting of the summer 2023 forest fire-related work stoppage, drilling at Fortin Sill resumed in August. The program was designed to explore for additional Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides at regular intervals along strike of the main outcropping mineralized zone. A total of eight holes for 5,883 metres was completed over a distance of approximately 1.2 kilometres along the interpreted strike of the Fortin Sill Zone. Downhole electromagnetic geophysical surveys were completed in four of the longer holes in efforts to locate sulphide-related conductors. Although this new drilling encountered mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks as far away as 750 metres from the Fortin Sill Zone, no new Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization was identified in this new drilling.</p><p>Fortin Sill Zone Metallurgical Study</p><p>As discussed in the Company's <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F05%2Fquebec-nickel-initiates-metallurgical-test-program-at-fortin-sill-zone%2F&amp;esheet=53870161&amp;newsitemid=20231213130536&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=May+10%2C+2023+News+Release&amp;index=5&amp;md5=6f412cffbb3368f7340da96995cd372a\">May 10, 2023 News Release</url> , SGS Canada was contracted to complete a scoping-level evaluation of the amenability of the Fortin Sill Zone to produce saleable Critical Metals concentrate. A total of 150 kilograms of Ni-Cu-Co-PGE-Au mineralized HQ diameter drill core was collected and delivered to SGS's Qu\u00e9bec City laboratory for the study. The scope of the work program includes bond ball mill grindability testing, floatation test work, solid-liquid separation testing and environmental analyses. As of this news release, the test program is approximately 95% complete and the delivery of the results and interpretative report is expected in the coming weeks.</p><p>AI Targeting Project</p><p>In October 2023, QNI released the results from a Ducros property-wide Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted Ni-Cu-PGE targeting exercise that was completed by ALS GoldSpot Discoveries Ltd. (ALS GoldSpot). The results of this study are highlighted by the identification of more than a dozen new and untested nickel-sulphide targets distributed across the Ducros Property (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F10%2Fai-technology-identifies-multiple-nickel-copper-pge-sulphide-targets-at-ducros-qni%2F&amp;esheet=53870161&amp;newsitemid=20231213130536&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=October+3%2C+2023+News+Release&amp;index=6&amp;md5=08b6a0d9cc7b83dd6dcf6f46e0ceb37a\">October 3, 2023 News Release</url> for more details, Figure 1). The unique geological and geophysical fingerprint of the Ni-Cu-PGE Fortin Sill Zone was used to train ALS GoldSpot's SmartTARGETTM targeting AI algorithms.</p><p>In parallel with the AI targeting project, ALS GoldSpot also completed a litho-structural reinterpretation of the Ducros Property. It is expected this new geological interpretation will greatly enhance the Company's exploration efforts going forward by allowing future work programs to focus on the most prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets within the large &gt;15,000 hectare Ducros property.</p><p>Environmental Baseline Studies</p><p>In March 2023, Qu\u00e9bec Nickel commissioned BluMetric Environmental, of St-Laurent Qu\u00e9bec, to complete a baseline description of the hydrological and biological characteristics of QNI's Ducros property and surrounding lands. Together with its partner, T2 Environment, of McMasterville Qu\u00e9bec, BluMetric technical teams completed two separate site visits during the 2023 field season to obtain the necessary samples and data for the study. The results from this first year's work are being synthesized into a final report, which is expected to be delivered early in the new year and will serve as the basis for future environmental baseline and monitoring work.</p><p>Other Exploration Work</p><p>In addition to the work summarized above, the Company completed further studies during the year that have greatly advanced the understanding of the Ducros Property geology and have led to the development of new highly prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets. Examples of some of these other studies include the semi-automated detailed petrographic characterization of 33 drill core samples collected from the 2022 &amp; 2023 exploration drilling programs. This work, which was completed by IOS Services G\u00e9oscientifiques inc. (IOS), of Ville de Saguenay, Qu\u00e9bec, builds upon the petrography IOS and the micro-XRF work completed by the Mineral Deposit Research Unit of the University of British Columbia completed in 2022.</p><p>In addition, to follow-up on positive results of a 2022 biogeochemistry orientation survey completed across much of the Ducros property, over 500 additional samples were collected during the 2023 field season at the Fortin Sill Zone. The samples were collected from a 50 metre by 50 metre-spaced northwest-southeast oriented grid covering an area of ~2.5 kilometres long by 750 metres wide and included the Fortin Sill Zone surface showing and its interpreted strike extension. Results from the 2022 and 2023 biogeochemistry surveys were fed into the AI targeting exercise completed by ALS GoldSpot. Distinctive biogeochemical anomalies coincident with Fortin Sill Zone are highlighted as well as additional anomalies along the interpreted strike from the Zone in areas that have yet to be drill tested.</p><p>About Qu\u00e9bec Nickel Corp.</p><p>Qu\u00e9bec Nickel Corp. is a mineral exploration company focused on acquiring, exploring, and developing critical metals (Ni-Cu-Co-PGE) projects in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.

The moon is making its closest annual approach to Earth, and will reach its instant of fullness over Philly at 9:37 p.m. Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Its proximity makes it a \"super\" moon in what has been a harvest season for those things. And since it is the second of the month, it is knighted a \"blue\" moon. Savor it: You won't have a chance to see a super-blue moon again until 2037.</p><p>Here are a few things to know, including the fact that while the term has a questionable history, yes, the moon really has turned blue on several occasions.</p><p>But not this week.</p><p>Tidal waves</p><p>Blame the moon for the nuisance flooding expected this week at the Shore and along the Delaware River. The moon is a grand mover of the tides, those \"long-period waves that roll around the planet,\" in NOAA's words. The moon's influence ebbs and flows depending on its distance from Earth, and it's making its closest encounter of the year.</p><p>During its elliptical orbit in a 29.5-day cycle, the moon's distancefrom us typically ranges from 226,000 to 253,000 miles. On Wednesday night, however, it will come extra close, within 222,000 miles.</p><p>The moon doesn't act alone: The gravitational might of the sun also has an effect on tides, and during full and new moons the earth, sun, and moon are aligned directly. But our natural satellite's proximity makes its influence twice as strong as the sun's.</p><p>Another major factor in tide levels is water temperature. Warmer waters take up more room. Thus full-moon high tides at perigee, when the moon is closest to Earth, can be 10 to 15% higher in summer than in winter, according to NOAA data.</p><p>Just what all this would mean for Florida's west coast on Wednesday would depend on when in the tidal cycle Hurricane Idalia approaches land.</p><p>'Super' summer</p><p>This \"super\" moon - using the definition of the moon's perigee coinciding with the full moon - is the third in a quartet that began in July. We'll get another one in September. How unusual is it to get four in a row? Evidently, not very. It will happen against next year.</p><p>Why the 'blue' moon?</p><p>What is different about this sequence is that the four are occurring within three months. That's because this one is a so-called blue moon, which has come to mean the second full moon in a month. The first was on Aug. 1.</p><p>How the term took on its current meaning remains somewhat of a mystery. NASA says the label dates to the 1500s, when it was used to designate the third of four full moons in a season.</p><p>Philip Hiscock, a folklorist with Canada's Memorial University, searched long and hard to find out how it came to mean what it does today. In a 2012 article in Sky &amp; Telescope, he said that the popular definition appeared in the magazine in the 1940s but that the writer was incorrectly describing a reference from an old almanac. The new meaning took on a life of its own, he said, and even appeared as a Trivial Pursuit question. The rest is history, or at least distorted folklore.</p><p>The blues</p><p>It has been a while, but the moon has appeared blue on several occasions.</p><p>After the cataclysmic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, ash plumes that were filled with particles that scattered red light transformed the volcano's clouds into blue filters. Full moons, quarter moons, crescent moons, in-between moons all appeared blue for years, according to NASA, with sightings reported all over the world.</p><p>A hundred years later, blue moons developed after the eruption of the El Chich\u00f3n volcano in Mexico, and reportedly were visibleafter the eruptions of Mount St. Helens in 1980 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991. And in 1953, a massive forest fire in Alberta, Canada, created blue moons all the way to England.</p><p>The whites</p><p>The moon will look oversized and spectacular rising in the southeast Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., and will outshine every star.</p><p>Although physically it will be 14% closer than a full moon at apogee - when the moon is at its furthest point from Earth - it will look 30% brighter, said Karen Masters, professor of astronomy and physics at Haverford College. No need to rub your glasses, she said: That's the result of \"the same physics that makes headlights of nearby cars look so much brighter than distant ones.\"</p><p>Double-shot</p><p>If you miss it this time around, you'll get another shot at a super blue moon in January 2037, and another two months later. The Phillies' Bryce Harper will be 44, and it's possible you'll be older, too.</p><p>Good morning, moon</p><p>The sky conditions, unfortunately, aren't looking great for Wednesday night, but the prospects are considerably better Thursday and Friday nights. The moon is 100% full for roughly a nanosecond. On Thursday, it still will be at 99% fullness, and 95% on Friday.</p><p>Masters said that a \"personal favorite\" of hers is the \"morning moon.\" It won't be setting until 6:53 a.m. Thursday, and 8:11 a.m. Friday. It will be visible after sunrise for a week to 10 days.</p><p>\"The moon is always beautiful,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:twood@inquirer.com\">twood@inquirer.com</email></p><p>@woodt15</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692C-WRK1-JC3R-B000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 30, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001990</classCode><className>SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000A2Y7</classCode><className>EARTH'S MOON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000A26S</classCode><className>EARTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
