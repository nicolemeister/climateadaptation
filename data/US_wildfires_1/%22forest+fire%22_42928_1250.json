One of the most recent, the Conner Fire south of Reno, expanded to over 17,000 acres in just two days. Wildfires like this are becoming more frequent and intense; a clear signal of the changing environmental conditions we face.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The aftermath of a forest fire is devastating, leaving trees charged, and ecosystems depleated. Photo by Scott Hinton.</p><p>Showcased at Reno's local Sierra Arts Foundation, Convergence Zone is a collection of artists and scientists where the subject of fire, specifically forest/wildland fires connect aesthetics, research, concern and conservation. It is evident in the devastated landscapes of the west where forest and wildland fires have been fueled by a variety of factors and continue to result in large catastrophic disasters. As the human wild interface expands into a mosaic filled forest of combustible fuel and homes, the conversation is a complex negotiation living with and adapting to the new paradigm of an extended fire season in the Western United States and now across the country. Convergence Zone is an exhibition that brings together various creative and scientific perspectives to provide outreach and detailed imagery of our critically strained forests and wildland deserts.</p><p>Originally shown at the University of Nevada, Reno at Lake Tahoe in partnership with the Lake Tahoe Wildfire Summit, Convergence Zone was curated by Scott Hinton and supported by faculty member Sudeep Chandra, who helped link campus researchers with artists.</p><p>The exhibition includes striking visual works:</p><p>* Lindsay Godin's black and white photos capture the stark aftermath of fire-scorched landscapes.</p><p>* Ahren Hertel's smoke-heavy paintings show the choaking glow of flame-lit skies.</p><p>* Bobby Lee's prints are from his summer documenting the Whittell Forest highlight the living laboratory of the forests between Lake Tahoe and Washoe Valley.</p><p>Bobby Lee's photography of Whittell Forest, NV currently displayed in the exhibit, Convergence Zone.</p><p>* Richard Bednarski brings a journalistic angle, focusing on life in California's fire-prone foothills.</p><p>On the scientific side, research teams are using advanced modeling to study wildfire behavior and its impacts:</p><p>* Facundo Scordo's team models smoke and ash movement near Lake Tahoe.</p><p>* Erin J. Hanan, Jianning Ren and others examine how wildfires affect soil biology and how bark beetles change fire patterns.</p><p>* The AlertWildfire camera network, developed by Graham Kent and Bill H. Savran, is featured for its role in detecting and monitoring fires in real time.</p><p>* Sudeep Chandra, Ph.D. University of Nevada, Reno Foundation professor and director of the Global Water Center, and the Castle Lake Environmental Research Program and team use the research station at Castle Lake to understand how smoke from regional wildfires alter lake ecologies.</p><p>Combining art and science helps turn complex wildfire data into something people can feel and understand on an emotional level. The passion each researcher brings to studying wildfires, along with the need for more collaboration in this changing ecological landscape, is key to finding ways to understand, protect, restore and heal areas damaged by fire.</p><p>Convergence Zone invites viewers to experience wildfire as both data and emotion, science and story - a shared challenge in a changing world.</p><p>(Category: News Release; Media Release; Announcement; Press Briefing; Remarks; Congressional Documents; Court Order; Court Judgement; Judgment; Court Opinion; Federal Government; Local Government; State Government; Speech; Transcript, Notice, Notification) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR5106707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G6R-JTX3-RXYT-611S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><timeReceived>12:31 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 HT Media Ltd.

(TSX.V: NAM | OTCQB: NMTLF | FSE: P7J) ('NAM' or the 'Company') is pleased to report assay results for antimony (stibnite) and gold mineralized grab samples from the Company's properties in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p><br/><br/>A total of 286 grab samples were collected as part of the Phase 1 exploration program in May-June to locate and confirm priority areas of interest for follow-up work during Phase 2 of the exploration program in south-central Newfoundland. Phase 2 exploration work, mainly prospecting and sampling, is currently underway in the St Alban's area of south-central Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Phase 1 Highlights<br/><br/>Grab samples returned up to 15.2% Sb from Antimony Ridge (St. Alban's area)<br/><br/>High-grade Au assays included 1.52 g/t Au from the Citadel Property and 1.45 g/t Au from the Antimony Ridge Property<br/><br/>Fort Property samples returned up to 131 g/t Ag and 29.3% Pb<br/><br/>Rampart Property samples assayed up to 1.88% Pb and 1.81% Zn, indicating new<br/><br/>Zn-Pb-Cu potential and Beaver Brook Area samples returned high Au and As values, including 274 ppb Au and 1,047 ppm As from the Sentinel Property and 118 ppb Au with elevated As and Sb from the Sentry Property.<br/><br/>Antimony, a critical metal: China, the world's largest producer/refiner severely restricted antimony exports in December 2024, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $ 60,000 per tonne, which more than quadrupled since early 2024. The antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal.<br/><br/>Harry Barr, NAM Chairman and CEO, comments, 'The results of our Phase 1 program, led by Axiom Group, are highly encouraging and demonstrate the potential of NAM's Sb-Au properties in Newfoundland. Surface sampling returned grades of up to 15% Sb, along with assays of up to 1.5 g/t Au, 131 g/t Ag, and 29% Pb. These results underscore the presence of a robust multi-metal system, where metals beyond antimony may enhance overall economic potential. Phase 2 follow-up work, which began in mid-August, is designed to expand on these discoveries while continuing to evaluate additional ground. We look forward to reporting further results as they become available and to advancing these properties in a disciplined, systematic manner at a time when both antimony and gold are trading at historically strong levels.'<br/><br/>Phase 1 Results Summary<br/><br/>St Alban's Area Properties<br/><br/>Phase 1 results confirm that the Bay d'Espoir Group is highly prospective for structurally controlled Au-Sb mineralization within quartz veins, particularly within the Joseph's Cove Formation. NAM is building on a newly emerging 16 km Au-Sb trend that extends from Canstar Resources Swanger's Cove Sb occurrence1 through the Antimony Ridge (MODS# 001M/13/Sb 002) and Golden Grit (MODS# 001M/13/Au 015) occurrences to the True Grit (MODS# 001M/13/Au 014) Au occurrence.<br/><br/>Antimony Ridge-Citadel: A float sample (445108) grading 15.2% Sb was collected 2 km southeast of the historical Antimony Ridge Sb occurrence, suggesting a broader overlapping Au-Sb zone than previously recognized. In addition, a quartz float sample (441194) from the SW portion of the Citadel property returned 1.52 g/t Au, representing the first-time high-grade gold has been documented in this area. This discovery corresponds with historical till anomalies, reinforcing the potential for additional gold discoveries within this trend.<br/><br/>Fort Property: Located within the Riches Island Formation, the Fort property hosts quartz veins and broad zones of silicification within psammitic rocks. Samples 441234, 441235, and 441236 returned grades up to 29.3% Pb and 131 g/t Ag, with elevated barite. While Pb occurrences were historically documented in the area, these results represent previously undocumented Pb-Ag-Ba occurrences and significantly upgrade the polymetallic potential of the property.<br/><br/>Rampart Property: A new occurrence of Zn-Pb-Cu mineralization was discovered (sample 441288) grading up to 1.88% Pb and 1.81% Zn. This demonstrates strong base-metal potential and occurs adjacent to Canstar Resources' Golden Baie Au-Sb project in the Little River area.<br/><br/>Summary: NAM's Phase 1 program in the St. Alban's area both confirms the presence of high-grade Sb mineralization along a 16 km Au-Sb trend and identifies new gold, Pb-Ag-Ba, and Zn-Pb-Cu occurrences. Collectively, these results highlight the multi-commodity potential of the Bay d'Espoir belt and position the St. Alban's properties as a key focus for Phase 2 exploration.<br/><br/>Beaver Brook Area Properties<br/><br/>The Beaver Brook Area properties are geologically significant as they lie within the same structural corridor that hosts the Beaver Brook Antimony Mine, one of North America's largest primary Sb deposits. Mineralization at Beaver Brook is characterized by fracture- and fault-controlled, stibnite-quartz veins developed within Silurian sedimentary rocks of the Indian Islands Group, structurally imbricated against the Ordovician Davidsville Group along major thrust faults (Lake and Wilton, 2006; Sandeman et al., 2018).<br/><br/>Phase 1 assays on NAM's nearby claims confirm this dual potential<br/><br/>Sentinel Property: Boulder sample 441162 returned 274 ppb Au with arsenopyrite, identifying a new Au-As system along strike of the Beaver Brook Sb trend and adjacent to New Found Gold's Queensway South Project. This is the first recognition of elevated gold values in this part of the trend and highlights exploration upside; Sentry Property: Float sample 441104 returned 118 ppb Au with elevated Sb and As in an altered monzogranite, indicating significant mineralizing fluids in the area and Exploration Upside: The presence of mineralized float and boulders raises the question of whether these samples represent erosion from nearby undiscovered outcrops or glacial transport. A follow-up exploration strategy is currently in development for this region.<br/><br/>Summary: Phase 1 results demonstrate that NAM's Beaver Brook properties host potential for both Sb and Au systems, consistent with the broader Beaver Brook mineralizing environment.<br/><br/>Antimony and Gold Markets Commentary<br/><br/>Reuters reported on June 17th, 20252 that China severely restricted antimony exports, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $ 60,000 per metric tonne, having more than quadrupled over the past year. As a critical metal, antimony's market dynamics are influenced by its applications in various industries and geopolitical factors. China's recent antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal. Approximately 70% of antimony is produced or refined in China.<br/><br/>Spot gold prices have traded as high as US$ 3,500 per ounce, likely driven by heightened global uncertainties and increased demand from institutional and retail investors. Central banks have continued their robust gold purchasing in 2025, adding 244 tonnes to their global reserves in Q1 and maintaining a strong pace into Q2, putting them on track for approximately 1,000 tonnes of purchases for the year. This sustained buying action underscores gold's role as a strategic asset amid economic instability and inflation concerns. Retail investors and family offices have also increased their gold holdings, seeking to hedge against market volatility. In Q1 2025, gold ETF inflows surged by 1,114% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 226.5 tonnes. Despite some outflows in May, year-to-date ETF inflows remain strong at over 322 tonnes, reflecting a continued revival in retail appetite for gold.<br/><br/>About NAM's PGE Division<br/><br/>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical/green metal projects in North America. The Company has three critical metal divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.<br/><br/>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.<br/><br/>About NAM's Lithium Division<br/><br/>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. ('MinRes'), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area<br/><br/>In April 2024, a $ 1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $ 107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will, subject to precautions for regional wildfire, will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.<br/><br/>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $ 180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $ 90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed and the post-doctoral research phase is ongoing at UNB.<br/><br/>This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analytical costs and adding long-term value to the project.<br/><br/>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.<br/><br/>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $ 120 million has been spent on the project. High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024.<br/><br/>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for its River Valley Palladium Project and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.<br/><br/>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities.<br/><br/>Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and mid-tier mining companies through to production.<br/><br/>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements<br/><br/>This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

(TSX.V: NAM | OTCQB: NMTLF | FSE: P7J) ('NAM' or the 'Company') is pleased to report assay results for antimony (stibnite) and gold mineralized grab samples from the Company's properties in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p><br/><br/>A total of 286 grab samples were collected as part of the Phase 1 exploration program in May-June to locate and confirm priority areas of interest for follow-up work during Phase 2 of the exploration program in south-central Newfoundland. Phase 2 exploration work, mainly prospecting and sampling, is currently underway in the St Alban's area of south-central Newfoundland.<br/><br/>Phase 1 Highlights<br/><br/>Grab samples returned up to 15.2% Sb from Antimony Ridge (St. Alban's area)<br/><br/>High-grade Au assays included 1.52 g/t Au from the Citadel Property and 1.45 g/t Au from the Antimony Ridge Property<br/><br/>Fort Property samples returned up to 131 g/t Ag and 29.3% Pb<br/><br/>Rampart Property samples assayed up to 1.88% Pb and 1.81% Zn, indicating new<br/><br/>Zn-Pb-Cu potential and Beaver Brook Area samples returned high Au and As values, including 274 ppb Au and 1,047 ppm As from the Sentinel Property and 118 ppb Au with elevated As and Sb from the Sentry Property.<br/><br/>Antimony, a critical metal: China, the world's largest producer/refiner severely restricted antimony exports in December 2024, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $ 60,000 per tonne, which more than quadrupled since early 2024. The antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal.<br/><br/>Harry Barr, NAM Chairman and CEO, comments, 'The results of our Phase 1 program, led by Axiom Group, are highly encouraging and demonstrate the potential of NAM's Sb-Au properties in Newfoundland. Surface sampling returned grades of up to 15% Sb, along with assays of up to 1.5 g/t Au, 131 g/t Ag, and 29% Pb. These results underscore the presence of a robust multi-metal system, where metals beyond antimony may enhance overall economic potential. Phase 2 follow-up work, which began in mid-August, is designed to expand on these discoveries while continuing to evaluate additional ground. We look forward to reporting further results as they become available and to advancing these properties in a disciplined, systematic manner at a time when both antimony and gold are trading at historically strong levels.'<br/><br/>Phase 1 Results Summary<br/><br/>St Alban's Area Properties<br/><br/>Phase 1 results confirm that the Bay d'Espoir Group is highly prospective for structurally controlled Au-Sb mineralization within quartz veins, particularly within the Joseph's Cove Formation. NAM is building on a newly emerging 16 km Au-Sb trend that extends from Canstar Resources Swanger's Cove Sb occurrence1 through the Antimony Ridge (MODS# 001M/13/Sb 002) and Golden Grit (MODS# 001M/13/Au 015) occurrences to the True Grit (MODS# 001M/13/Au 014) Au occurrence.<br/><br/>Antimony Ridge-Citadel: A float sample (445108) grading 15.2% Sb was collected 2 km southeast of the historical Antimony Ridge Sb occurrence, suggesting a broader overlapping Au-Sb zone than previously recognized. In addition, a quartz float sample (441194) from the SW portion of the Citadel property returned 1.52 g/t Au, representing the first-time high-grade gold has been documented in this area. This discovery corresponds with historical till anomalies, reinforcing the potential for additional gold discoveries within this trend.<br/><br/>Fort Property: Located within the Riches Island Formation, the Fort property hosts quartz veins and broad zones of silicification within psammitic rocks. Samples 441234, 441235, and 441236 returned grades up to 29.3% Pb and 131 g/t Ag, with elevated barite. While Pb occurrences were historically documented in the area, these results represent previously undocumented Pb-Ag-Ba occurrences and significantly upgrade the polymetallic potential of the property.<br/><br/>Rampart Property: A new occurrence of Zn-Pb-Cu mineralization was discovered (sample 441288) grading up to 1.88% Pb and 1.81% Zn. This demonstrates strong base-metal potential and occurs adjacent to Canstar Resources' Golden Baie Au-Sb project in the Little River area.<br/><br/>Summary: NAM's Phase 1 program in the St. Alban's area both confirms the presence of high-grade Sb mineralization along a 16 km Au-Sb trend and identifies new gold, Pb-Ag-Ba, and Zn-Pb-Cu occurrences. Collectively, these results highlight the multi-commodity potential of the Bay d'Espoir belt and position the St. Alban's properties as a key focus for Phase 2 exploration.<br/><br/>Beaver Brook Area Properties<br/><br/>The Beaver Brook Area properties are geologically significant as they lie within the same structural corridor that hosts the Beaver Brook Antimony Mine, one of North America's largest primary Sb deposits. Mineralization at Beaver Brook is characterized by fracture- and fault-controlled, stibnite-quartz veins developed within Silurian sedimentary rocks of the Indian Islands Group, structurally imbricated against the Ordovician Davidsville Group along major thrust faults (Lake and Wilton, 2006; Sandeman et al., 2018).<br/><br/>Phase 1 assays on NAM's nearby claims confirm this dual potential<br/><br/>Sentinel Property: Boulder sample 441162 returned 274 ppb Au with arsenopyrite, identifying a new Au-As system along strike of the Beaver Brook Sb trend and adjacent to New Found Gold's Queensway South Project. This is the first recognition of elevated gold values in this part of the trend and highlights exploration upside; Sentry Property: Float sample 441104 returned 118 ppb Au with elevated Sb and As in an altered monzogranite, indicating significant mineralizing fluids in the area and Exploration Upside: The presence of mineralized float and boulders raises the question of whether these samples represent erosion from nearby undiscovered outcrops or glacial transport. A follow-up exploration strategy is currently in development for this region.<br/><br/>Summary: Phase 1 results demonstrate that NAM's Beaver Brook properties host potential for both Sb and Au systems, consistent with the broader Beaver Brook mineralizing environment.<br/><br/>Antimony and Gold Markets Commentary<br/><br/>Reuters reported on June 17th, 20252 that China severely restricted antimony exports, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $ 60,000 per metric tonne, having more than quadrupled over the past year. As a critical metal, antimony's market dynamics are influenced by its applications in various industries and geopolitical factors. China's recent antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal. Approximately 70% of antimony is produced or refined in China.<br/><br/>Spot gold prices have traded as high as US$ 3,500 per ounce, likely driven by heightened global uncertainties and increased demand from institutional and retail investors. Central banks have continued their robust gold purchasing in 2025, adding 244 tonnes to their global reserves in Q1 and maintaining a strong pace into Q2, putting them on track for approximately 1,000 tonnes of purchases for the year. This sustained buying action underscores gold's role as a strategic asset amid economic instability and inflation concerns. Retail investors and family offices have also increased their gold holdings, seeking to hedge against market volatility. In Q1 2025, gold ETF inflows surged by 1,114% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 226.5 tonnes. Despite some outflows in May, year-to-date ETF inflows remain strong at over 322 tonnes, reflecting a continued revival in retail appetite for gold.<br/><br/>About NAM's PGE Division<br/><br/>New Age Metals is a junior mineral exploration and development company focused on the discovery, exploration, and development of critical/green metal projects in North America. The Company has three critical metal divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.<br/><br/>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.<br/><br/>About NAM's Lithium Division<br/><br/>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. ('MinRes'), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area<br/><br/>In April 2024, a $ 1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $ 107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will, subject to precautions for regional wildfire, will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.<br/><br/>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $ 180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $ 90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed and the post-doctoral research phase is ongoing at UNB.<br/><br/>This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analytical costs and adding long-term value to the project.<br/><br/>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.<br/><br/>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $ 120 million has been spent on the project. High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024.<br/><br/>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for its River Valley Palladium Project and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.<br/><br/>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities.<br/><br/>Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and mid-tier mining companies through to production.<br/><br/>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements<br/><br/>This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Unfortunately, with wildfires continuing to devastate vast areas and communities, these roles are predicted to continue in high demand.</p><p>Flight attendants follow closely with a median pay of $68,370. Responsibilities for this role extend beyond safety checks to include managing in-flight emergencies, and providing customer service, which requires emotional intelligence, and adaptability.</p><p>Staying with hospitality, lodging managers earn around $65,360 annually. This role involves overseeing hotel operations, managing staff and resolving guest issues, which depend heavily on personalized service, and critical thinking.</p><p>Next, we move onto skilled trades. Electricians, plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters all earn median salaries around $61,500, while industrial machinery mechanics command around \u200b\u200b$61,170 per year.</p><p>All of these occupations require real-time, and hands-on problem solving with customized solutions that are beyond robots\u2019 abilities.</p><p>Back to hospitality, chefs and head cooks receive a median salary near $59,000. They bring creativity, taste, and leadership to the kitchen, all qualities AI do not have.</p><p>Hearing aid specialists are listed in eighth place, and have a low-risk of automation as these professionals fit and adjust devices based on personalized patient care.</p><p>Finally, personal service managers, who oversee wellness programs or concierge services, round out the list, earning around $57,570. This work demands emotional intelligence and team management skills, further highlighting the human element that AI struggles to match.</p><h>Moderately at-risk careers</h><p>Some careers shared by the report face moderate risk of AI automation, but still remain stable due to the need for complex decision-making.</p><p>For example, maintenance workers for machinery perform routine upkeep, which could be automated, however, more intricate repairs requires human expertise. The median pay for this role is $61,170.</p><p>Next up on the moderate-risk list is insurance sales agents, whose media pay is $59,080. Though assessing client needs can be covered by AI-driven underwriting, personalized service, relationship building, and trust-based sales remain human-driven. </p><p>Next time you\u2019re at an airport, keep an eye out for aircraft cargo handling supervisors. Though automation is hugely affecting cargo handling roles, supervisors are still required to manage logistics, ensure safety compliance, and handle unexpected challenges. The median pay for this title is $58,920.</p><p>And in thirteenth place, it\u2019s security and fire alarm systems installers, who command a median pay of $56,430. Whether it\u2019s a residential or commercial property, these professionals install, maintain, and repair systems that require hands-on skills, and adaptability.</p><h>New pathways</h><p>These 13 careers really show that a high-school diploma can be the gateway to a number of stable jobs in an increasingly AI-driven economy.</p><p>All roles listed emphasize skills that machines cannot easily replicate: human judgment, creativity, adaptability, and interpersonal communication.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to see why for those hesitant about the rising costs and uncertain returns of college, these roles offer a viable alternative. As the job market evolves, employers and educators can play a crucial role in guiding talent toward these AI-resistant paths, ensuring a workforce prepared for the future without the requirement of a four-year degree.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://jobs.thehill.com/?source=article&amp;utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=TH2825\">Ready to find a new role?

Friday was forecast to have temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees, relative humidity under 35%, and gusts of wind near 25 mph.</p><p>It's also peak wildfire season for the Philly region amid moderate to severe drought conditions in both states.</p><p>\"These conditions, along with the continued drying of fine fuels, could support the rapid spread of any fires that ignite, which could quickly become difficult to control,\" the National Weather Service said.</p><p>The NWS is discouraging outdoor burning and asking that all potential ignition sources - including cigarette butts - be disposed of properly.</p><p>Crews Friday were into their fourth day of battling the Jones Road Fire, a blaze miles from the Jersey Shore in Ocean County that has since swelled to cover 15,300 acres.</p><p>The fire was 60% contained as of Friday, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, and was threatening four unspecified structures, down from eight earlier in the day.</p><p>New Jersey Acting Gov. Tahesha Way said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has awarded the state a grant that will be used to help pay for the response to the fire.</p><p>The blaze started at about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday inside Ocean Township's Forked River Mountain Wilderness Area near Jones and Bryant Roads. Since then, the fire has spread from the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area to the Pinelands wilderness.</p><p>No injuries have been reported, but the inferno has destroyed several vehicles and one commercial building, according to the state's forest fire service. Way declared a state of emergency Tuesday as more than 5,000 people in neighboring Ocean and Lacey Townships were ordered to evacuate. They have since returned home.</p><p>Arson</p><p>Joseph Kling, 19, of Waretown, was arrested at his home Wednesday morning and charged with arson, according to a joint statement from Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette.</p><p>Kling set flame to several wooden pallets to start a bonfire Tuesday morning, the statement said, and then left them to burn unattended. Kling is being held at Ocean County Jail pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>LaTourette has repeatedly told reporters that the Jones Road Fire could grow to become New Jersey's largest wildfire in 18 years, when 17,000 acres in the same general area burned for days in 2007.</p><p>New Jersey has had an especially damaging wildfire season this year, which meteorologists and fire experts expect to calm by mid-May.

Spain broke its June heat record, and extreme temperatures are expected to move toward Germany by midweek.Authorities in Spain on Monday confirmed the country's highest-ever June temperature, as an ongoing heat wave pushed the mercury at one point on Saturday to 46 degrees Celsius (115 F).The record was set in Huelva, near the border with Portugal, topping the previous record of 45.2 C set in 1965 in the nearby city of Seville.The record-breaking temperatures come as a \"heat dome\" continues to sit over Western Europe, a weather phenomenon during which a high-pressure system holds dry, hot air in place over an extended period of time.On Monday, health authorities issued red alerts in parts of Spain, warning vulnerable groups to avoid being outside during the afternoon.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was in Seville for the UN's Conference on Financing for Development, said he was experiencing the heat wave \"firsthand.\"\"Extreme heat is no longer a rare event. ... It has become the new normal,\" Guterres said in a post on X.In Guterres' home country, Portugal, authorities are still confirming if a reading on Sunday of 46.6 C in the town of Mora east of Lisbon is indeed a new June heat record.On Monday, Portuguese authorities issued a red heat warning for seven districts, with forecast temperatures of 43 C.Germany up next The extreme heat is expected to push northward, with Germany bracing for scorching temperatures on Tuesday and Wednesday.In southwestern Germany, temperatures already edged close to 35 C on Monday.The heat wave in Germany is expected to peak on Wednesday, with some areas in the south expected to near 40 C, while most of the rest of the country is expected to experience 30+ C temperatures.On Monday, the German national weather service confirmed that June temperatures in Germany were on average 18.5 C, which is 3.1 C warmer than the international reference period of 1961 to 1990.Southwestern Germany was particularly affected by the high temperatures. </p><p>Average rainfall was also lower.Paris on red alertMost of France is currently baking in extreme heat, which, as in other parts of northern Europe, is exacerbated by the general lack of air conditioning. \"This is unprecedented,\" said Agnes Pannier-Runacher, France's ecology transition minister, on Monday.For Tuesday, French weather authorities said Paris and 15 other departments are to be placed on \"red alert,\" the highest weather warning level.In the Aude region on the southwest Mediterranean coast, the first large forest fire of the season has burned through 400 hectares (988 acres) of woods. A nearby campground was evacuated, and water-dumping aircraft and around 300 firefighters have been mobilized.Wimbledon when it sizzlesAs the heat wave reaches into the southern UK, tennis grand slam Wimbledon saw its hottest-ever opening day on Monday.Meteorologists on Monday recorded a provisional 29.7 C at nearby Kew Gardens in southwest London. That would beat the previous record for a Wimbledon opening day, which was 29.3 C set on June 25, 2001.At the tournament venue, a high temperature of 33 C was also recorded. Tournament organizers call for breaks between the second and third sets of women's matches or between the third and fourth sets of men's matches when the mercury climbs above 30.1 C.Temperatures were forecast to reach 34 C in London and southeast England Monday, where authorities have also issued heat alerts.A cold front later in the week is expected to provide relief from the record-high temperatures.Edited by: Zac Crellin</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL10998901JZ0Z42STG4NGKAZS9E3NGJ2N</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G59-NYH3-S0VJ-P4NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><timeReceived>4:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

However, none were damaged, and no one was injured.</p><p>Crews from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service are expected to remain on scene in the township's Franklinville section at least until rain arrives, possibly Friday.</p><p>The fire service said it had contained the blaze in the area of Pennsylvania Avenue and Proposed Avenue, near Mary F.Janvier Elementary School, as of 8 a.m. Thursday.</p><p>The fire was first spotted from the Blue Anchor Fire Tower in Winslow Township at 3:34 p.m. Wednesday. Crews responded with bulldozers and a helicopter.</p><p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p><p>On Thursday, state fire and environmental officials urged residents to conserve water as drought conditions from last year are persisting into spring - peak wildfire season at the same time water demand grows for lawns and gardens.</p><p>The state is already well ahead of the normal amount of fires as the true wildfire season begins. So far this year, there have been 381 wildfires that have burned 1,242 acres, representing a 266% increase over the same period as last year.Three of those have been major wildfires, meaning they were 100 acres or larger.</p><p>Much of the state faces drought conditions, with all of South Jersey either in a severe or extreme drought, and the risk of wildfires remained high throughout the state Thursday, according to the Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Shawn LaTourette, the commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, said the state is already at high risk for fires because of the dense population that lives near large tracts of protected lands, such as the Pinelands.</p><p>The state remains under an official drought warning as rainfall is still running below normal, although February was close to normal. January, however, was the third-driest on record, coupled with well-below average precipitation in fall through December.</p><p>As a result, officials said, reservoirs and waterways are still well below normal.</p><p>Because of the conditions and the abnormal number of wildfires in recent months, the risk for more wildfires has increased dramatically. It's also decreased the number of prescribed, or preventive, burns by the Forest Fire Service. Typically, the Forest Fire Service targets 25,000 acres of forest, grasslands, and marshlands for prescribed fires that consume dried fuel, such as branches and twigs, on forest floors. But the drought has reduced that to 1,707 acres of grasslands and six acres of forest to date - a historic low.</p><p>\"Our forests are very dry, and our precious drinking water sources remain stressed from lack of precipitation,\" LaTourette said.</p><p>All regions of New Jersey have been under drought warning since November, and residents have been urged to voluntarily conserve water to prevent mandatory restrictions if a drought emergency has to be declared.</p><p>Among ways to conserve water: If you must water a garden, do it in the morning or evening with drip irrigation; water lawns only if necessary; set up a rain barrel and reuse the water, and run the dishwasher only with a full load.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB7-GXB3-RTDF-C4DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 14, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002L0U</classCode><className>BLUE ANCHOR INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCQkNBRjUwM0UxNDFCQ0E2NkM1MEREOTFGRjczQ0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEJGM0REMThGNjk0NDBGNUE3RUM0ODg1N0U3NTczMDc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

However, none were damaged, and no one was injured.</p><p>Crews from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service are expected to remain on scene in the township's Franklinville section at least until rain arrives, possibly Friday.</p><p>The fire service said it had contained the blaze in the area of Pennsylvania Avenue and Proposed Avenue, near Mary F.Janvier Elementary School, as of 8 a.m. Thursday.</p><p>The fire was first spotted from the Blue Anchor Fire Tower in Winslow Township at 3:34 p.m. Wednesday. Crews responded with bulldozers and a helicopter.</p><p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p><p>On Thursday, state fire and environmental officials urged residents to conserve water as drought conditions from last year are persisting into spring - peak wildfire season at the same time water demand grows for lawns and gardens.</p><p>The state is already well ahead of the normal amount of fires as the true wildfire season begins. So far this year, there have been 381 wildfires that have burned 1,242 acres, representing a 266% increase over the same period as last year.Three of those have been major wildfires, meaning they were 100 acres or larger.</p><p>Much of the state faces drought conditions, with all of South Jersey either in a severe or extreme drought, and the risk of wildfires remained high throughout the state Thursday, according to the Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Shawn LaTourette, the commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, said the state is already at high risk for fires because of the dense population that lives near large tracts of protected lands, such as the Pinelands.</p><p>The state remains under an official drought warning as rainfall is still running below normal, although February was close to normal. January, however, was the third-driest on record, coupled with well-below average precipitation in fall through December.</p><p>As a result, officials said, reservoirs and waterways are still well below normal.</p><p>Because of the conditions and the abnormal number of wildfires in recent months, the risk for more wildfires has increased dramatically. It's also decreased the number of prescribed, or preventive, burns by the Forest Fire Service. Typically, the Forest Fire Service targets 25,000 acres of forest, grasslands, and marshlands for prescribed fires that consume dried fuel, such as branches and twigs, on forest floors. But the drought has reduced that to 1,707 acres of grasslands and six acres of forest to date - a historic low.</p><p>\"Our forests are very dry, and our precious drinking water sources remain stressed from lack of precipitation,\" LaTourette said.</p><p>All regions of New Jersey have been under drought warning since November, and residents have been urged to voluntarily conserve water to prevent mandatory restrictions if a drought emergency has to be declared.</p><p>Among ways to conserve water: If you must water a garden, do it in the morning or evening with drip irrigation; water lawns only if necessary; set up a rain barrel and reuse the water, and run the dishwasher only with a full load.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB7-GXB3-RTDF-C4BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 14, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002L0U</classCode><className>BLUE ANCHOR INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCQkNBRjUwM0UxNDFCQ0E2NkM1MEREOTFGRjczQ0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEJGM0REMThGNjk0NDBGNUE3RUM0ODg1N0U3NTczMDc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

On the shore, where the ash accumulates, it is even black. And it is warm. The image contrasts with that of a week ago, or rather with that of always in this landscape of Zamora. The transparent water, typical of a lake of glacial origin with an area of 350 hectares, the largest in Spain. The area, within a Natural Park, is cordoned off under strict security measures and the sound of sirens is constant. So is the noise of seaplane engines. A helicopter flies over the reservoir, shrouded in smoke. It descends, loads itself with water and heads for one of the three outbreaks of the Porto (Zamora) fire that are still active on Thursday.</p><p><br/>Uncertainty has been spreading through the villages of Sanabria for a week. On Thursday 14, lightning struck in the Sierra de Valdeinfierno, enveloping the neighbors of the region -very few of all life, many vacationers whose families were born here or outsiders in search of an unparalleled enclave for rural tourism- in their own avernus. Since then, everyone has been up to their eyebrows in smoke, under a sun they could stare at for a long time through the gray veil and with the anxiety of being evacuated at any moment -8,000 people have been evicted from 12 towns during the last few days-. Seven days in which they have been mostly imbued with fear for the consequences of the flames for the Natural Park.<br/>The Sierra de Valdeinfierno belongs to the municipality of Porto de Sanabria, in the northwest of the province of Zamora, on the border with Ourense. The village has 156 inhabitants, but hardly any children. There is no school. The last minor was going back and forth by cab to A Mezquita (Ourense) to go to class after a journey of more than an hour on a winding road.<br/>Health care is also a problem for the neighbors because of the difficult access. \"Here a helicopter arrives before an ambulance\", ironizes Angel Rodriguez, 65 years old, this Wednesday, while he observes in the distance the burnt surface left by the flames and the smoke columns. There was even a time when the medical services, after landing in Porto, realized that the pacemaker they had brought was not the one a patient needed.<br/>Rodriguez did go to school in his village, but it has been 30 years since the center no longer exists. \"We are the Spain that has been emptied and burned,\" he laments, while explaining all kinds of adverse circumstances that reflect the \"abandonment\", in his opinion, of the public administrations. A depopulation that has contributed to the devastation of the fires this summer.<br/>Almost 90% of the hundred localities affected by the forest fires this August -with land razed by fire or evacuations or confinements of population- have lost inhabitants so far this century: in some municipalities of the northwest peninsular above 50%, according to data collected by the agency Efe. Both Porto and the 15 municipalities - made up of small villages - that make up the region of Sanabria are suffering the loss of inhabitants.<br/>The town of Quintana is located in one of these municipalities, Cabreros. Just before the entrance to the houses, some 130 cows are concentrated on a farm of 8,700 meters. Next to the cattle, \u00c1ngela Membrive, 29, looks after them. Her family is from Palacios, another village in the area, but four years ago she moved from Madrid because her partner, who comes from a cattle-raising family, lived and grew up here. Their cows were grazing in the Sierra de Valdeinfierno, during the transhumance, when lightning struck and caused the fire. They kept the cattle grouped together, watching the field they feed on in the summer burn, and even spent the night sleeping in the car to keep an eye on them. They thought the flames would not advance that far. But they did. And they decided to take the animals down to the farm. \"In a matter of seven days, the fire took our saw ahead of us,\" says Membrive, who hasn't slept all week. Some of the cattle are still up there and they coordinate with other ranchers, who keep an eye on the state of the fire, in case they also have to lower them.<br/>This young rancher, who lives in Palacios de Sanabria, complains that many farm owners -mainly those who no longer raise cattle or cultivate the fields- do not clean the weeds and undergrowth. He also assures that the municipalities do not do the same in the areas under their jurisdiction. And he criticizes the fact that violators are not fined. Outside the hot season, notices are distributed among the municipalities ordering neighbors to clear the brush. Membrive criticizes in turn that the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n also does not clean the roads through the forests, which contributes to the spread of fire, he argues. \"It's a jungle up there,\" he says.<br/>The problem of the lack of cleaning of forests and fields as one of the causes of the spread of fires is a constant that is repeated in the outbreaks in the communities most affected by this unusual August of fires: Extremadura, Galicia and Castilla y Le\u00f3n. In Sanabria, the controversy is accentuated because it is a Natural Park, and many of the neighbors consider that there are innumerable obstacles to request permits. \u00c1ngela Alonso, 70 years old, agrees with this thesis. \"The environment won't let us clean up. When the dana of Valencia I thought: there has been the flood and here is going to be the fire, with all those oaks and undergrowth,\" says Alonso at the gates of Quintana. She walks without a mask, but there are those who, even on Wednesday, covered their mouths and noses because of the smoke. \"I'm panicking, I'm afraid. It was already a shame when the Sierra de la Culebra burned. And now this, our lake,\" laments the septuagenarian. \"What are now oak trees used to be planted. And controlled burns could be made\".<br/>Sources from the Consejer\u00eda de Medio Ambiente de Castilla y Le\u00f3n explain that the responsibility for cleaning the roads lies with the owners. Most of them are the Town Councils or other local entities or associations of owners, with some areas remaining under autonomous demarcation. As for the possibility of cutting or not the vegetation, they detail that natural parks, such as Lake Sanabria, \"are places with protected species and you cannot clear without knowledge of what is being eliminated\". Each protected natural area has its own management plan, which seeks to protect the natural values that led to the declaration of that area as protected. In Lago de Sanabria it is possible to clear brush, but with an authorization that the neighbors consider to be very late.<br/>The expert in Forest Fire Prevention Paco Casta\u00f1ares indicates that not freeing the fields and areas surrounding the villages from brush and weeds contributes to the spread of fire, although it is not the only cause. \"The loads of vegetation that are there, which we call fuel, influence how the flames spread. But there are also atmospheric conditions that cause the high propagation speeds,\" Casta\u00f1ares explains.<br/>Former director of the Environment Agency of the Junta de Extremadura with the PSOE, Casta\u00f1ares puts the focus, moreover, that small municipalities have no capacity for the prevention of forest fires and asks the communities to get involved. \"Stop messing around with things that are so important,\" he claims. The expert also points to depopulation as another reason for the critical situation experienced this year, because there is less tilled land or land for livestock, which translates into more \"forest fuel\". And also because firewood is no longer extracted, which influences the proliferation of scrub, he argues.<br/>In Sanabria, the security measures imposed by the device coordinated by the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n after the Porto fire started last week have been increasing. In addition to the evacuated municipalities, the area of Lake Sanabria is cordoned off and under strict control measures. Not even the press can approach with special authorization.<br/>On one of the rural trails starting from one of the villages, the lack of cleanliness of the road is palpable. At many points, weeds cover the road. And on its margins there are many bushes. At the end of the road, the Los Robles campsite appears, which has been vacated. On the adjoining road, in a span of 10 minutes at 16.00 hours on Wednesday, circulates a patrol of the Civil Guard, a car of the Air Force, several Civil Protection and one of the Military Emergency Unit (UME). The mixture between the noise of the sirens and the helicopter, over the murky water of the lake, and the closure to the passage of citizens generates the image of a battlefield.<br/>The extinguishing forces continue to work on the three active outbreaks of the Porto fire. \"That it is controlled does not mean that it is extinguished,\" says Esther Iglesias, director of the Extinction Operative, late on Wednesday at the advanced command post of Casa del Parque Natural Lago de Sanabria y Sierras Segundera and Porto. Behind Iglesias, several brigadistas stained with ash accuse fatigue and denounce lack of means. The lightning strike in Porto remained latent, that is to say, with the heat under the ground, and that ended up causing the disaster. There were two reactivations and finally it spread. Several neighbors point out that no action was taken in time.<br/>Since then, troops from Castilla y Le\u00f3n, the Ministry of Ecological Transition, the Military Emergency Unit, the Diputaci\u00f3n de Zamora, Catalonia and France have been fighting to prevent its expansion. The wind and the location of the outbreaks, which are very difficult to access, have generated very unfavorable conditions. In addition, the aerial resources have had to stop at times due to the intense smoke.<br/>A few kilometers from the command center, in Paramio, neighbors of this village are concentrated in the square, next to the village church, where you can still pull the rope to alert with the bell that the fire is coming -what is known as calling fire-.<br/>In July, Sanabria was full to the brim, with tourists attracted by the rural enclave and the climate - the rise in temperatures increases its visitors, paradoxically -, who are added to those who in summer go to the village of their parents. But in the last few days, time has stopped. Some left because of the evictions. Others stayed, but without being able to bathe in the pools or do water activities in the lake. Also with difficulties to sleep. Paramio's festivities were to begin this Friday, and although the situation is more under control, they will most likely be canceled. \"We are not here to celebrate anything,\" says Mar\u00eda Maisonave, 44, who lives in Pozuelo (Madrid). Her family is from Paramio and every August since she was a child she returns to her village. Now with her husband and two children. \"The water has always been crystal clear since you entered the beaches there. In fact, you could see fish as soon as you entered from the shore. We'll see if when the first rains fall it's still the same,\" Maisonave concludes.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72284134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G0W3-RRVG-8132-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Junta Castilla y Le\u00f3n</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> PP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> UME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Guardia Civil</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ganader\u00eda</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Desastres naturales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Pedro S\u00e1nchez</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> PSOE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

According to news reporting originating in Para, Brazil, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Machine learning tools have demonstrated promising results for fire prediction, which have included the generation of models that have been developed across a large range of contexts and locations. This research aims to map areas susceptible to forest fires within the Triunfo do Xingu Environmental Protection Area, employing machine learning algorithms to ascertain the influence of environmental, topographic and socioeconomic factors on fire occurrence.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement - Brasil (CAPES-Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior). <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Federal University Western Para, \"For this purpose, the Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting regression models were used to predict kernel density values calculated over 15,291 confirmed burn points between 2010 and 2020, using 11 predictor factors, including Altitude, Slope, Aspect, Topographic Wetness Index, Precipitation, Temperature, Proximity to Inhabited areas, Proximity to Roads, Land Use and Cover, Vegetation Continuous Fields, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, the metrics used were Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, and the Coefficient of Determination. The test results showed that the models had similar performance, and both the Random Forest (RMSE = 36.26, MAE = 17.45, and R2 = 0.99) and the Extreme Gradient Boosting (RMSE = 35.73, MAE = 18.74, and R2 = 0.99) demonstrated good predictive capacity. The elaborated map presented areas of high and very high susceptibility occupying 39% of the total area of the conservation unit, mainly located in the central-east and central-west regions.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The variables with the greatest importance and contribution to the final model were environmental and socioeconomic variables, notably precipitation, distance from inhabited areas, and land use type.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Prediction of Forest Fire Susceptibility Using Machine Learning Tools In the Triunfo Do Xingu Environmental Protection Area, Amazon, Brazil.

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities.

The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada.

The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets. The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 13, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience.

The National Weather Service discouraged any outdoor burning with low humidity, temperatures reaching near 80 degrees Fahrenheit and southerly winds that could gust up to 20 mph across a swath of the mid-Atlantic. There's a chance of rain over the weekend in the region. </p><p>In its most recent update, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said about half of the fire spread over nearly 24 square miles in the southern part of the state was contained. No injuries or deaths have been reported, but buildings have burned along with cars. Officials have charged a 19-year-old man from the area with starting the blaze that led to the wildfire. Prosecutors on Thursday said Joseph Kling, 19, from Waretown, New Jersey, was arrested and charged with arson and aggravated arson, saying he lit wooden pallets on fire and left the area before they were fully put out. A public defender representing him during the hearing said she had \"nothing further\" when asked by a judge. Emails from the public defender's office said Thursday it could not comment on a pending case so early in the process. An email message seeking comment on his behalf was sent Friday to the public defender's office. Attempts to reach Kling by phone were not successful. Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn't been put out. Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer said \"we can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\" He declined further comment on why authorities believe the man they arrested was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing. It's forest fire season in the pinelands, a wilderness that encompasses more than 1 million acres - an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon. Firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a monthslong drought in the region. Though parts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles Thursday. The fire is roughly 54 miles south of New York City. It's about 60 miles east of Philadelphia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001966d47dd1da59ffdff354a0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FW7-85G3-RRP5-14VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"442\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 44.8 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 23.6:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 44.8 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 23.6 and market average of 24.3.</p><p>6.1 3-DAY: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN </p><p>WY dips 0.4% on average volume 1.1 times average.

Billhimer, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette and Ocean Township Chief of Police Michal Rogalski .</p><p>Officials said that as part of their investigation into the wildfire, they plotted the origin of the fire and determined the cause of the fire was an improperly extinguished bonfire. Officials said further investigation revealed that Kling was responsible for setting wooden pallets on fire - and then leaving the area without the fire being fully extinguished.</p><p>According to officials, Kling was taken into custody at Ocean Township (Waretown) police headquarters and then transported to the Ocean County jail, where he is awaiting a detention hearing.</p><p>Like all defendants, Kling is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p><p>Progress Against Fire </p><p>New Jersey firefighters reported Thursday at 1 p.m. that the wildfire in Ocean County has been 50% contained after burning 15,100 acres.</p><p>About 8 structures remain under threat, down from 12 on Wednesday, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. One commercial building has been destroyed and multiple outbuildings and vehicles have been damaged.</p><p>Evacuation orders that affected 5,000 people were lifted on Wednesday, when the fire service reported that about 11,500 acres had burned and the wildfire was 30% contained.</p><p>No injuries have been reported.</p><p>The Jones Road wildfire began Tuesday in the Pine Barrens area in Barnegat township and then moved north into Lacey.</p><p>Forest Fire Service firefighters and local fire, rescue, county and other state responders are battling the blaze.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://weather.com/weather/weekend/l/8da742603f3c923b3d99648a83ecd6dd09d68de68d92980dfbbd14f28b0e44eb\"> weekend weather report</url> calls for rain, which could help efforts to fight the blaze.</p><p>The ratings and analytics firm Moody's has been monitoring the wildfire in the Garden State. Firas Saleh, director of wildfire models, North America, at Moody's, said it is one of the largest wildfires in the state's recent history. \"This event underscores that wildfire risk is not confined to western states alone. It highlights community vulnerability to such events and the importance of resilience.\" Saleh commented.</p><p>According to the Moody's executive, the Jones Road wildfire is a \"stark reminder\" of the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires due to factors such as prolonged drought conditions, higher temperatures, and low humidity.</p><p>Saleh noted that last year at this time, the fire service reported there were 310 wildfires that burned 315 acres across New Jersey. This year so far, 662 wildfires have burned 16,572 acres across the state.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLINJN-ij821131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLINJN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN1-M1X3-RS6T-P3PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2025 Wells Media Group, Inc.

According to news reporting from Hanoi University of Science and Technology by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Quadrotor is an unmanned aerial vehicle widely used in traffic construction monitoring, volcano monitoring, forest fire, power line inspection, missing person search and disaster relief.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Socialist Republic of Vietnam Ministry of Education And Training. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Hanoi University of Science and Technology: \"The dynamic model of quadrotor becomes complex and non-linear due to four motors with four propellers to control and stabilize the motion. One disadvantage of the traditional PID controller is that its parameters are tuned based on trials and errors, but the fuzzy PID controller will automatically adjust its PID gains based on the IF-THEN rules and the parameters of the fuzzy systems are designed beforehand. For other adaptive fuzzy controllers, their parameters are online updated with large computational load. In this paper, we design an intelligent controller to manage the operating state of quadrotor (UAV) by combining the advantages of traditional PD controller with fuzzy logic inference systems to tune its parameters. These Fuzzy PD controllers performs control of the movement of the quadrotor along three axes to follow the desired trajectory. The proposed Fuzzy PD control system for the quadrotor is simulated and evaluated on Matlab-Simulink, then conducted with real-time experiments on QDrone2 physical system.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Simulation and experimental results with comparisons to the PD controller have proven the effectiveness of the proposed control method with small tracking error under the impact of time-varying disturbance and additional load.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fuzzy PD control for a quadrotor with experimental results.

Thanks to Randy for sharing what he found.</p><p>From the summer of 1965</p><p>Sekiu Mountain Lookout Station</p><p>From her forest fire lookout tower atop 1,960 foot Sekiu Mountain, Mrs. Della Turner of forks keeps a watchful eye on more than 700 square miles of valuable private and state owned timber land.</p><p>The new 40 foot Sekiu Mountain tower was put into operation by the Department of Natural Resourced on June 15, Mrs. Turner, wife of DNR fire warden Pete Turner, was the fist to live in the new cabin-on-stilts.</p><p>The Sekiu Mountain Lookout provides fire detection on lands owned by Crown Zellerbach and Rayonier Inc,. and other scattered ownerships. Rayonier and West Coast Plywood logged the lookout site and built the logging road which provides access to the tower.</p><p>Two fires have broken out during the past two months in Mrs. Turner's lookout area. Quick detection and control held the damage on the two fires to less than half an acre.</p><p>The new tower is equipped with weather observation instruments. It provides Crown Zellerbach and other private companies as well as the DNR with information on winds, humidity, fuel moisture readings and air temperature several times daily.</p><p>This alerts fire fighting officials to dangerous fire weather situations, such as the one that occurred recently, At the Sekiu lookout on that day the humidity was recorded at two percent, the only such reading ever recorded in Washington State.</p><p>The Sekiu lookout is one of 86 such towers operated by the DNR throughout the state.

Friday is forecast to have temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees, relative humidity under 35%, and gusts of wind near 25 mph.</p><p>It's also peak wildfire season for the Philly region amid an moderate to severe drought conditions in both states.</p><p>\"These conditions, along with the continued drying of fine fuels, could support the rapid spread of any fires that ignite, which could quickly become difficult to control,\" the National Weather Service said.</p><p>The NWS is discouraging outdoor burning and asking that all potential ignition sources - including cigarette butts - be disposed of properly.</p><p>Friday's weather will be particularly challenging for crews going into their fourth day of battling the Jones Road Fire, a blaze miles from the Jersey Shore in Ocean County that has since swelled to cover 15,300 acres.</p><p>The fire was 60% contained as of Friday, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, and threatens four unspecified structures, down from eight earlier in the day.</p><p>New Jersey Acting Gov. Tahesha Way said that Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded the state a grant that will be used to help pay for the response to the fire.</p><p>The blaze started at about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday inside Ocean Townships's Forked River Mountain Wilderness Area near Jones and Bryant Roads. Since then, the fire has spread from the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area to the Pinelands wilderness, burning for four straight days.</p><p>No injuries have been reported, but the inferno has destroyed several vehicles and one commercial building, according to the state's forest fire service. Acting Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency Tuesday as more than 5,000 people in neighboring Ocean and Lacey Townships were ordered to evacuate. They have since returned home.</p><p>Arson</p><p>Joseph Kling, 19, of Waretown, was arrested at his home Wednesday morning and charged with arson, according to a joint statement from Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette.</p><p>Kling set flame to several wooden pallets to start a bonfire Tuesday morning, the statement said, and then left them to burn unattended. Kling is being held at Ocean County Jail pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>LaTourette has repeatedly told reporters that the Jones Road Fire could grow to become New Jersey's largest wildfire in 18 years, when 17,000 acres in the same general area burned for days in 2007.</p><p>New Jersey has had an especially damaging wildfire season this year, which meteorologists and fire experts expect to calm by mid-May. Over 16,500 have burned across 662 wildfires, New Jersey Forest Fire Service chief Bill Donnelly said, compared to only 315 acres of damage by this time in 2024.</p><p>Pa.'s wildfires</p><p>But Pennsylvania has also had its challenges this week, with a blaze starting on Bear Mountain Saturday one quarter mile from homes in the tourist mecca of Jim Thorpe, Carbon County.</p><p>That fire was near fully under control by Thursday.</p><p>However, two separate wildfires broke out in Michaux State Forest in Cumberland County starting Wednesday, according to Wesley Robinson, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR).</p><p>The Thompson Hollow Fire started at around 5 p.m. on Wednesday and has spread to about 1,150 acres as of Friday afternoon, Robinson said. No buildings were burned but homes in the area that were asked by local officials to evacuate out of caution.</p><p>Shippensburg/Baltimore and Thompson Hollow Roads are closed indefinitely.</p><p>The Hammond's Rocks Fire broke out at around 11 a.m. on Thursday and has spread to around 200 acres.</p><p>No structures are currently at risk, but Ridge Road and Cold Springs Road are closed.</p><p>DCNR firefighters are being supported by the Cumberland County Commissioners, Cumberland County Emergency Agency, local volunteer firefighters, PennDOT, Appalachian Trail and National Park Service, Pennsylvania Game Commission, and Bureau of Forestry Fire Warden Crews.</p><p>\"The greatest danger of wildfires in Pennsylvania occurs during the spring months of March, April, and May, and the autumn months of October and November,\" Robinson said. \"In Pennsylvania, 99% of all wildfires are caused by people.\"</p><p>He said burning of vegetation such as leaves, equipment use, power lines, and campfires are some of the most common causes of wildfires in Pennsylvania.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bforman@inquirer.com\">bforman@inquirer.com</email> and <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>beaformanwrites</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FND-7VT3-RVDV-Y2K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 27, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Public Health &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.37% is 0.81 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.14%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.37</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.14</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.77</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.4% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.4%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 177.4%.

According to news reporting from Seattle, Washington, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Wildfire activity in the western United States has been on the rise since the mid-1980s, with longer, higher-risk fire seasons projected for the future.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Nsf Growing Convergence Research Program; Us Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Washington: \"Prescribed burning mitigates the risk of extreme wildfire events, but such treatments are currently underutilized. Fire managers have cited lack of firefighter availability as a key barrier to prescribed burning. We use both principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression modeling methodologies to investigate whether or not (and if yes, under what conditions) personnel shortages on a given day are associated with lower odds of a prescribed burn occurring in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. We utilize the logit model to further assess how personnel availability compares to other potential barriers (e.g., meteorological conditions) in terms of association with odds of a prescribed burn occurring. Our analysis finds that fall and spring days in general have distinct constellations of characteristics. Unavailability of personnel is associated with lower odds of prescribed burning in the fall season, controlling for meteorological conditions.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"However, in the spring, only fuel moisture is observed to be associated with the odds of prescribed burning. Our findings suggest that if agencies aim to increase prescribed burning to mitigate wildfire risk, workforce decisions should prioritize firefighter availability in the fall.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Quantitative Analysis of Firefighter Availability and Prescribed Burning in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.

Andy Kim, D-New Jersey, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Emergency FEMA Funding Granted for South Jersey Wildfire</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Andy Kim Utilizes Oversight Role in Senate to Ensure Resources for South Jersey</p><p>*</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - As South Jersey continues to work through containing the April 22nd Jones Road Wildfire', local law enforcement and other first responders will see federal funding being sent to New Jersey to assist response efforts after being granted approval for a Fire Management Assistance Grant. This announcement comes after Senator Kim spent Wednesday afternoon in South Jersey inspecting the areas impacted and checking in with first responders who have been on the frontlines of this fire.</p><p>\"As I walked around the areas scorched by the fire, I wanted to ensure our brave firefighters and first responders had everything possible to help contain this disaster,\" said Senator Andy Kim. \"As Ranking Member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees FEMA, I'm grateful to be able to help bring federal support to help our state during a time of critical need.\"</p><p>\"I wish to thank Senator Kim on behalf of the DEP's Forest Fire Service and the many state and local agencies that responded to the Jones Road wildfire,\" said New Jersey Environmental Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. \"As devastating as this wildfire was, the heroic efforts of the Forest Fire Service and our many partners on the ground protected many thousands of lives and averted what could have been extensive loss of property. This wildfire, the most significant to impact the state in many years, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance or partnerships across all levels of government - from federal agencies to state agencies and down to the local first responders who work tirelessly to protect their communities.\"</p><p>While the total amount of funding provided by FEMA won't be known until the fire is 100% contained, this grant will help with costs for equipment and supplies, alleviate costs for food and other aid needed by firefighters who are on the ground, and will help make sure first responders have what they need to fully contain the fire.</p><p>This funding comes at a time when the Trump Administration is threatening to eliminate FEMA which would leave communities and families without necessary assistance to rebuild after hurricanes, tornadoes and other disasters like wildfires, and has directed his agencies to discriminate against 'blue states' and prioritize funding for those states who politically support him.</p><p>Senator Kim is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP); Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and the Special Committee on Aging.

Fitted with Airbus' Roll-on/Roll-off modular kit, the turboprop performed multiple passes in April under the supervision of Entente-Valabre's Test and Research Centre (CEREN), a globally recognised authority for evaluating forest-fire equipment and training. Engineers placed hundreds of calibrated cups in a grid across a section of the airfield so analysts could measure exactly how much retardant reached each point and how evenly the pattern spread. Early findings show the aircraft consistently hit its target zone while flying lower than 30 metres and at roughly 230 km/h, replicating the demanding profiles used during real wildfire sorties. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>The centrepiece of the concept is a self-contained tank system that slides into the cargo hold without altering the airframe. Because crews can install or remove the module in hours, any aircraft in an A400M fleet could be reassigned to firefighting duties at short notice-an attractive option for governments that need extra capacity only during peak fire season. Once airborne, the kit can release up to 20,000 litres of water or chemical retardant through two pipes mounted on the rear ramp. Refilling on the ground takes less than ten minutes with standard pumps, allowing faster turnaround than many dedicated water bombers. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>Jo M\u00fcller, who heads sustainability and communications at Airbus Defense and Space, said the successful French campaign builds on initial drops conducted in Spain in 2022 and confirms that the A400M can form the centre of a broader wildfire-response ecosystem spanning satellites, drones and ground assets. He added that the aircraft's rough-field performance offers another operational benefit: \"Because the A400M can operate from short or unpaved strips, fire crews can stage much closer to the perimeter, shortening ferry times and boosting daily sortie counts.\" &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>The platform's 20,000-litre payload dwarfs the roughly 6,000 litres carried by the iconic Canadair CL-415. The latter retains one key advantage-its ability to skim lakes and refill on the fly-but Airbus believes the A400M's speed, range, payload and multi-role flexibility offset that limitation, especially in regions where large bodies of water are scarce or fires occur at altitude. In addition, the A400M's four-engine design lets it cruise at jet-like speeds, reposition between theatres rapidly and perform missions such as medical evacuation, cargo delivery or troop transport when flames are not raging. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>Regulatory certification and customer funding will determine when the system reaches operational status, yet several European nations and export operators already fly the A400M for military duties, giving Airbus a ready customer base. As fire seasons lengthen under climate pressure and emergency agencies search for scalable solutions, a heavy-lift aircraft that can transform overnight into a water bomber could fill a growing capability gap. With the N\u00eemes tests validating drop accuracy and coverage, Airbus now plans further trials focused on night operations, varied retardant mixes and integration with advanced mapping tools, putting the 20,000-litre A400M firmly on the radar of firefighting strategists worldwide. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>Related News: <url normalizedValue=\"https://airguide.info/category/air-travel-business/airline-finance/\">https://airguide.info/category/air-travel-business/airline-finance/</url> &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>AirGuide and Pyramid Media connects you to an affluent, influential group of business and leisure travelers from across the globe with our Advertising Multimedia Network, Advertising eMail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:advert@AirGuideOnline.com\">advert@AirGuideOnline.com</email> and Elevate your Customer Experience with our Tech and Content Solutions.

Civil Protection Minister Ioannis Kefalogiannis said 18,000 permanent and seasonal personnel, supported by thousands of volunteers, would be mobilized as wildfire damage has increased steadily over the past two decades. \"It is clear that the conditions this year will be particularly difficult,\" Kefalogiannis told reporters after attending a firefighting exercise south of Athens. </p><p>Rising average temperatures and low rainfall have significantly worsened conditions in recent years. Greek Fire Chief Lt. Gen. Theodoros Vagias told the Associated Press that additional elite firefighting units would be deployed to high-risk areas during the May 1-Oct. 31 fire season. \"The climate crisis is here to stay, and we must be more effective in surveillance, preparedness, and how we mobilize our resources,\" Vagias said. Wildfire damage surged to more than 500 square miles in 2021 and 675 square miles in 2023 - roughly three times the 2011-2020 average - according to data from the European Union's Forest Fire Information System. Firefighters held an exercise Thursday to test Greece's evolving wildfire response, which increasingly relies on advanced technologies such as drone surveillance and mobile command centers. Fire planes skimmed treetops, releasing plumes of water in coordinated low-altitude drops, as commanders on the ground huddled over tablets streaming real-time drone footage. The coast guard and armed forces took part in a drill simulating the evacuation of a children's summer camp threatened by fires on multiple fronts. Officials said the number of firefighting personnel has increased by roughly 20 percent over the past two years, while the fleet of fire-surveillance drones has grown to 82, up from 45. Around 300 firefighters from the Czech Republic, France, Romania, Moldova, and Bulgaria are being sent to Greece under a European Union prepositioning program, officials said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000196f85cd122ad9ffc7c694b0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G30-G4S3-S66P-S53K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 22, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With the N\u00eemes tests validating drop accuracy and coverage, Airbus now plans further trials focused on night operations, varied retardant mixes and integration with advanced mapping tools, putting the 20,000-litre A400M firmly on the radar of firefighting strategists worldwide. &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>Related News: <url normalizedValue=\"https://airguide.info/category/air-travel-business/airline-finance/\">https://airguide.info/category/air-travel-business/airline-finance/</url> &lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;</p><p>AirGuide and Pyramid Media connects you to an affluent, influential group of business and leisure travelers from across the globe with our Advertising Multimedia Network, Advertising eMail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:advert@AirGuideOnline.com\">advert@AirGuideOnline.com</email> and Elevate your Customer Experience with our Tech and Content Solutions.

The fire erupted on April 22 in Waretown \u2014 an unincorporated community on the Jersey Shore \u2014 and rapidly spread throughout the southern Ocean County area.</p><p>At about 9:45 a.m. on April 22, the Cedar Bridge Fire Tower located a column of smoke coming from the area of Jones Road and Bryant Road in Ocean Township, authorities said. There, emergency personnel saw a fire within the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust's Forked River Mountains Wilderness Area, which is on the east side of Jones Road.</p><p>Following an investigation conducted by local and state authorities, the cause of the fire was determined to be incendiary by an improperly extinguished bonfire, according to the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutors accused Kling of setting wooden pallets on fire and then leaving the area without the fire being fully extinguished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to discuss a motive at this time, nor does the state have to prove what the motive is,\u201d Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer said at a news conference. \u201cWe can just confidently say that we can think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d</p><p>Kling was taken into custody at Ocean Township Police Headquarters and then transferred to Ocean County Jail, pending a detention hearing.</p><p>By 7 p.m. on April 24, the fire had burned more than 15,000 acres and was 50% contained, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Though no injuries have been reported from the wildfire, it destroyed a commercial building and multiple other outbuildings and vehicles, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said. About 5,000 residents who evacuated have since been allowed to return home, while authorities predict the fire will keep spreading until the area gets a soaking rain.</p><h>Jones Road wildfire causing air quality issues as far as NYC</h><p>Heavy smoke from the wildfire was affecting visibility in neighboring townships, and authorities warned residents to drive cautiously.

The technology enabled an Earth-observing satellite for the first time to look ahead along its orbital path, rapidly process and analyze imagery with onboard AI, and determine where to point an instrument. The whole process took less than 90 seconds, without any human involvement.</p><p>Called Dynamic Targeting, the concept has been in development for more than a decade at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The first of a series of flight tests occurred aboard a commercial satellite in mid-July. The goal: to show the potential of Dynamic Targeting to enable orbiters to improve ground imaging by avoiding clouds and also to autonomously hunt for specific, short-lived phenomena like wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and rare storms.</p><p>\"The idea is to make the spacecraft act more like a human: Instead of just seeing data, it's thinking about what the data shows and how to respond,\" says Steve Chien, a technical fellow in AI at JPL and principal investigator for the Dynamic Targeting project. \"When a human sees a picture of trees burning, they understand it may indicate a forest fire, not just a collection of red and orange pixels. We're trying to make the spacecraft have the ability to say, 'That's a fire,' and then focus its sensors on the fire.\"</p><p>Avoiding Clouds for Better Science</p><p>This first flight test for Dynamic Targeting wasn't hunting specific phenomena like fires -- that will come later. Instead, the point was avoiding an omnipresent phenomenon: clouds.</p><p>Most science instruments on orbiting spacecraft look down at whatever is beneath them. However, for Earth-observing satellites with optical sensors, clouds can get in the way as much as two-thirds of the time, blocking views of the surface. To overcome this, Dynamic Targeting looks 300 miles (500 kilometers) ahead and has the ability to distinguish between clouds and clear sky. If the scene is clear, the spacecraft images the surface when passing overhead. If it's cloudy, the spacecraft cancels the imaging activity to save data storage for another target.</p><p>\"If you can be smart about what you're taking pictures of, then you only image the ground and skip the clouds. That way, you're not storing, processing, and downloading all this imagery researchers really can't use,\" said Ben Smith of JPL, an associate with NASA's Earth Science Technology Office, which funds the Dynamic Targeting work. \"This technology will help scientists get a much higher proportion of usable data.\"</p><p>How Dynamic Targeting Works</p><p>The testing is taking place on CogniSAT-6, a briefcase-size CubeSat that launched in March 2024. The satellite -- designed, built, and operated by Open Cosmos -- hosts a payload designed and developed by Ubotica featuring a commercially available AI processor. While working with Ubotica in 2022, Chien's team conducted tests aboard the International Space Station running algorithms similar to those in Dynamic Targeting on the same type of processor. The results showed the combination could work for space-based remote sensing.</p><p>Since CogniSAT-6 lacks an imager dedicated to looking ahead, the spacecraft tilts forward 40 to 50 degrees to point its optical sensor, a camera that sees both visible and near-infrared light. Once look-ahead imagery has been acquired, Dynamic Targeting's advanced algorithm, trained to identify clouds, analyzes it. Based on that analysis, the Dynamic Targeting planning software determines where to point the sensor for cloud-free views. Meanwhile, the satellite tilts back toward nadir (looking directly below the spacecraft) and snaps the planned imagery, capturing only the ground.</p><p>This all takes place in 60 to 90 seconds, depending on the original look-ahead angle, as the spacecraft speeds in low Earth orbit at nearly 17,000 mph (7.5 kilometers per second).</p><p>What's Next</p><p>With the cloud-avoidance capability now proven, the next test will be hunting for storms and severe weather -- essentially targeting clouds instead of avoiding them. Another test will be to search for thermal anomalies like wildfires and volcanic eruptions. The JPL team developed unique algorithms for each application.</p><p>\"This initial deployment of Dynamic Targeting is a hugely important step,\" Chien said. \"The end goal is operational use on a science mission, making for a very agile instrument taking novel measurements.\"</p><p>There are multiple visions for how that could happen -- possibly even on spacecraft exploring the solar system. In fact, Chien and his JPL colleagues drew some inspiration for their Dynamic Targeting work from another project they had also worked on: using data from ESA's (the European Space Agency's) Rosetta orbiter to demonstrate the feasibility of autonomously detecting and imaging plumes emitted by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p><p>On Earth, adapting Dynamic Targeting for use with radar could allow scientists to study dangerous extreme winter weather events called deep convective ice storms, which are too rare and short-lived to closely observe with existing technologies. Specialized algorithms would identify these dense storm formations with a satellite's look-ahead instrument. Then a powerful, focused radar would pivot to keep the ice clouds in view, \"staring\" at them as the spacecraft speeds by overhead and gathers a bounty of data over six to eight minutes.</p><p>Some ideas involve using Dynamic Targeting on multiple spacecraft: The results of onboard image analysis from a leading satellite could be rapidly communicated to a trailing satellite, which could be tasked with targeting specific phenomena. The data could even be fed to a constellation of dozens of orbiting spacecraft. Chien is leading a test of that concept, called Federated Autonomous MEasurement, beginning later this year.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-nasa-is-testing-ai-to-make-earth-observing-satellites-smarter/\">https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-nasa-is-testing-ai-to-make-earth-observing-satellites-smarter/</url></p><p>Contact: Melissa Pamer</p><p>Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</p><p>626-314-4928</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:melissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov\">melissa.pamer@jpl.nasa.gov</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9344580 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9344580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBK-T1J3-RTD7-610H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities. However, the company faces challenges in revenue and profit growth, and technical analysis suggests a lack of momentum in the stock.

This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada. The company is recognized for its commitment to sustainability, operating all its timberlands in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards.

The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 13, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.4% is 0.83 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.11%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.11</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.71</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.4% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.4%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 178.0%.

Last year, insurers in our state drastically raised rates to reflect the increasing threat of extreme weather disasters and to recoup money they had to pay out after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/09/hawaii-wildfires-maui-explainer\">deadly 2023 Maui wildfires</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But why should everyday people be asked to shoulder these costs, while an industry that actively made the problem worse pays nothing? Giant fossil fuel corporations <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateintegrity.org/evidence/climate-deception\">predicted decades ago</url> that the unchecked burning of their products could lead to out of control weather disasters, creating chaos in insurance markets. Don't they bear some of the responsibility for making this nightmare a reality?</p><p>Insurers shouldn't push the costs of climate change on to their policyholders while letting the companies causing it off the hook. That's why Hawaii is pursuing a fairer model that other states can emulate: make the fossil fuel industry help pick up the tab. Our state recently passed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/hawaii-wants-fuel-giants-pay-rising-insurance-costs-2065459?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">a first of its kind resolution</url> encouraging insurance companies to take Big Oil to court for climate damages before raising rates on their customers.</p><p>Simply put: fossil fuel-driven climate change is creating a nationwide cost-of-living crisis, especially when it comes to housing. Supercharged wildfires in Los Angeles and Maui and unprecedented flooding in the Carolinas from Hurricane Helene have displaced thousands of Americans. When they do get a check from their insurance company, many find that it only covers a fraction of the cost of rebuilding their homes.</p><p>Faced with mounting claims, insurance companies are pulling out of entire communities, canceling existing policies, and refusing to issue new policies. Given that insurance is generally required on new mortgages, uninsurable homes are essentially unsellable homes. Mortgage lenders in wildfire-stricken Colorado communities are reporting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mpamag.com/us/mortgage-industry/industry-trends/forget-rate-hikes-climate-change-is-already-killing-mortgage-lenders-deals/534122\">a rash of home sales falling apart</url> because buyers can't secure insurance.</p><p>Experts warn that this growing crisis threatens to infect the broader economy. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgjrcS8QKRM\">a recent Senate hearing</url>, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) warned of an \"economic cascade\" of consequences for real estate markets, and cited a Freddie Mac chief economist predicting that if left unchecked, the insurance crisis could cause \"a 2008-style economic recession.\"</p><p>We're on track for economic disaster, while fossil fuel industry giants who put us in this position keep raking in billions of dollars in profits. Rather than pulling the rug out from under hardworking families and abandoning entire communities, insurance companies should make the fossil fuel industry pay their fair share of the costs.</p><p>While they may not seem like the most likely group to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable, insurance companies are already well-practiced in taking bad actors to court for their role in extreme weather disasters. When utilities' unmaintained power lines ignited devastating wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, insurers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11774069/pge-insurance-companies-strike-11-billion-deal-to-settle-wildfire-claims\">successfully forced them to pay up</url>, temporarily reducing the severity of rate increases on homeowners and slowing the trend of insurance companies fleeing the state.</p><p>Just like the companies who sparked a blaze, the fossil fuel industry bears responsibility for contributing to the soaring high temperatures and drier atmosphere that turn a routine forest fire into a blazing inferno. Researchers who measure climate change's contribution to extreme weather disasters estimate that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/04/23/climate-attribution-damages-lawsuit/\">companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil are each responsible for nearly $2 trillion</url> in economic losses from extreme heat between 1991 and 2020.</p><p>This isn't a surprise to Big Oil\u2014<url normalizedValue=\"https://climateintegrity.org/evidence/climate-deception\">internal documents show</url> their researchers warning as far back as the 1970s that their products would warm the global climate and fuel \"potentially catastrophic events.\" Industry executives were convinced enough to invest in <url normalizedValue=\"https://graphics.latimes.com/oil-operations/\">making their own oil wells and pipelines resilient to climate change</url>, while also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucs.org/about/news/new-ucs-report-details-fossil-fuel-industry-decades-deceit\">working for decades to mislead the public</url> about their products' connection to the problem. That <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateintegrity.org/evidence/climate-deception\">deception continues today</url>, with oil and gas majors proudly advertising their commitment to clean energy while they ramp up the production and burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>Since 2002, <url normalizedValue=\"https://global.insure-our-future.com/scorecard/\">climate change has cost the insurance industry an estimated $600 billion</url> in insured losses, costs that were likely recouped from consumers through higher premiums. The oil and gas industry, which has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/revealed-oil-sectors-staggering-profits-last-50-years\">averaged nearly $3 billion in profit per day</url>, could have covered those losses without breaking a sweat.</p><p>As policymakers nationwide grapple with a growing insurance crisis, our first priority should be to protect consumers from extreme rate hikes and stabilize markets for insurers. When you make a mess, you clean up after yourself. It's time for the fossil fuel industry to do the same.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Lee serves as president of the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a bi-partisan organization of 1,500 state legislators from all 50 states.

According to news reporting out of Malang, Indonesia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"South Sumatra Province has characteristics that significantly increase hotspots and produce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in strong El Nino phenomena. This study investigates the impact of forest fires on GHG emissions during extreme climate in the South Sumatra Province from 2010 to 2020.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Brawijaya University: \"This research analyzes the effects of La Nina and El Nino on the region by analyzing factors such as precipitation patterns, temperature fluctuations, hotspots, and greenhouse gas emissions. This study indicates that forest fires mostly happen during the dry season (May to October). El Nino occurred for the second time in 2015-2016 and 2018-2019, which affected the highest fire (hotspots, HSs) during the strong El Nino. Meanwhile, La Nina occurred three times in 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2017-2018, which is related to the low HSs found and represents the highest annual rainfall in the last ten years. The highest forest fire (HSs = 17.559) occurs in the characteristics of A1-B4 (precipitation 0-100, SSTA &gt; 0.5\u00b0C). The highest GHG emission (&gt;400 Mton) occurred in 2015 when the strong El Nino occurred in South Sumatra Province.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The strong and weak El Nino produces the highest GHG emissions of more than 30 megatons per day, while the maximum mean daily GHG emission is under 10 megatons per day. Hotspot numbers rise exponentially with increasing SSTA, showing strong statistical relationships (R\u00b2 &gt; 0.80, r &gt; 0.79) with burned area (R\u00b2 = 0.90, r = 0.92) and burned area with CO emissions (R\u00b2 = 0.77, r = 0.79).\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Greenhouse Gases Produced During Forest Fires in the La Nina and El Nino Periods in South Sumatra Province.

According to news reporting from Seoul, South Korea, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"This paper proposes a new method to improve the prediction accuracy of wildfire spread simulators by updating the Rate of Spread (ROS) adjustment factor in near-real-time using wildfire detection data from geostationary satellites. While geostationary satellites can collect wildfire detection data in near-real-time with minimal constraints from external environmental conditions, the advantage of this capability requires updating the ROS with each new data collected.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the National Institute of Forest Science, \"To address this, the proposed algorithm describes the time required for wildfire to spread over the distance equivalent to one pixel in geostationary satellite observation data as a linear model of various factors. Subsequently, ROS adjustment factors are determined by least square estimation of the model parameters based on the spread duration obtained from multiple pixels. Using each newly collected observation dataset, the algorithm updates the ROS adjustment factors and incorporates them into FARSITE for a continuous updating of the wildfire spread prediction results. This paper demonstrates the efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithm by a numerical example of the 2020 Creek Fire in California, USA. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances wildfire spread prediction accuracy by updating the ROS adjustment factors.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The proposed algorithm is expected to effectively support wildfire response decision-making in situations where high-resolution data collection is challenging because of bad weather conditions such as strong winds, thereby reducing the overall impact of wildfires regardless of weather conditions.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Near-real-time updating of ROS adjustment factors based on geostationary satellite observation data.

Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said. The wounded firefighter was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after surgery and was in stable condition, Norris said.</p><p>The scene was sheer pandemonium as the brush fire burned and firefighters rushed to the scene only to come under heavy fire.</p><p>First responders made urgent calls for help on their radios: \u201cEverybody\u2019s shot up here ... send law enforcement now,\u201d according to one dispatch.</p><p>Gov. Brad Little said \u201cmultiple\u201d firefighting personnel were attacked.</p><p>\u201cThis is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters,\u201d Little said on X. \u201cI ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more.\u201d</p><p>Norris said it appeared the sniper was hiding in the rugged terrain and using a high-powered rifle. He said he instructed deputies to fire back.</p><p>Just as the evening press conference was expected to begin, the bodies of the slain firefighters arrived in the nearby city of Spokane, Washington, escorted by a procession of fire and law enforcement vehicles. Firefighters and others saluted as the vehicles passed by.</p><p>An alert by the Kootenai County Emergency Management Office asked people to avoid the area around Canfield Mountain Trailhead and Nettleton Gulch Road, about 4 miles (6.5 km) north of downtown Coeur d\u2019Alene.</p><p>Though the shelter-in-place order was lifted, the sheriff\u2019s office cautioned residents to be prepared because the fire was still burning.</p><p>The FBI responded to the scene with technical teams and tactical support, Deputy Director Dan Bongino said.</p><p>The Idaho House Republican Leadership said in a statement: \u201cWe are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d\u2019Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.\u201d</p><p>Coeur d'Alene is a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington. Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the city's outskirts, covered with trees and heavy brush and crisscrossed with trails that lead into a national forest.</p><p>Fire is always a big concern for the region, said Bruce Deming, whose property abuts the trail system. When he noticed smoke on the ridge Sunday afternoon, he wondered why no firefighting helicopters were responding.</p><p>When a friend texted to tell him about the shooting, he realized why he wasn\u2019t seeing aircraft: \u201cBecause they\u2019re concerned about being shot at,\u201d he said.</p><p>As deputies set up posts nearby, Deming pointed them to a trail that starts near his backdoor and leads directly to the site of the fire.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to figure if somebody\u2019s out prowling around my place,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Weber reported from Los Angeles.

It burned almost 5,500 acres and forced authorities to close a campground and part of the Garden State Parkway. (Photo courtesy of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four months after state officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/11/13/new-jersey-moves-to-drought-warning-as-wildfires-rage/\">declared a drought warning, New Jersey environmental officials said Thursday that ongoing, record-setting dry conditions portend a busy wildfire season, and they urged residents to voluntarily conserve water before mandatory restrictions become necessary.</url></p><p>Firefighters already have battled 381 wildfires this year, according to the state fire warden, William Donnelly. While most forest fires in New Jersey don't spread beyond five acres, three major blazes burned over 100 acres each \u2014 and altogether, this year's fires have torched 1,242 acres, Donnelly said. That's a 266% increase compared to the same time last year, he added.</p><p>#8216;Now, peak wildfire season in New Jersey is upon us, at a time when water demand for landscaping, gardening, and lawn care is typically set to increase across the state, as the temperature warms and New Jersey remains under an official drought warning,#8217; state Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette told reporters Thursday.</p><p>State geologist Steven Domber rattled off a list of recent meteorological records that have desiccated vegetation and lowered reservoir levels across the state. January was New Jersey's third driest, while October, and autumn more broadly, were the driest since record-keeping began in 1896.</p><p>While February's precipitation was nearly normal, it wasn't enough to replenish reservoirs and groundwater, which prevented the state forest fire service from doing prescribed burns that minimize wildfire risk, Domber said. The service typically targets 25,000 acres of forest, grasslands, and marshlands for prescribed burns \u2014 but has burned just 1,707 acres of grasslands and six acres of forest because of the persisting drought, he said.</p><p>Gov. Phil Murphy added $1 million to his <url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/02/25/governor-murphy-proposes-58-1b-budget-that-raises-fees-avoids-broad-tax-hikes/\">$58.1 billion budget proposal for the service to add staff and equipment, said John Cecil, an assistant commissioner in charge of state parks, forests, and historic sites. The state forest fire service now has 70 full-time firefighters and 1,400 part-time firefighters who can be called into service, Cecil added.</url></p><p>An extra $3 million Murphy allocated two years ago helped the service add staff, a bulldozer, upgraded command post radio and communications equipment, personal protective gear, and aviation support, he said.</p><p>Officials described New Jersey as an #8216;extreme risk wildfire state#8217; because of its dense, volatile vegetation especially in areas like the Pinelands in South Jersey and the Highlands in North Jersey, and that vegetation's proximity to homes and other development.</p><p>New Jersey likely won't ever face the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268672/santa-ana-winds-la-fire-risk\">devastation southern California suffered in January, when Santa Ana winds fueled fires that decimated parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, officials said Thursday.</url></p><p>And LaTourette said he's not overly worried that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/02/21/trumps-cuts-to-federal-wildfire-crews-could-have-scary-consequences/\">federal funding cuts President Donald Trump has ordered for fire management staff and services will impact New Jersey.</url></p><p>The state forest fire service mostly relies on state funding, not federal, he said. But he also pointed to Attorney General Matt Platkin's partnerships with other Democratic states in challenging Trump's various orders in court.</p><p>#8216;Now, courts have informed the Trump administration of the import of following the law and the import of minding the coequal branches of government,#8217; LaTourette said. #8216;Funding appropriated by Congress that flows to this agency or DEP, we expect will continue to flow. And if it doesn't, we will take all appropriate action to make sure that it does.#8217;</p><p>YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.</p><p> SUPPORT </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000995154277475570025205600102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB6-6J43-RRX1-R0GB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><timeReceived>8:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Officials did not release his name, nor did they say what kind of gun was found.</p><p>Authorities planned a news conference later Sunday to provide more information.</p><p>Sheriff's officials said crews responded to a fire at Canfield Mountain just north of Coeur d'Alene around 1:30 p.m., and gunshots were reported about a half hour later.</p><p>Sheriff Bob Norris earlier said officials weren't immediately sure how many people were shot and deputies were \"actively taking sniper fire as we speak.\"</p><p>Three victims were brought to Kootenai Health, said hospital spokesperson Kim Anderson. Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said. The wounded firefighter's condition wasn't known.</p><p>The scene was sheer pandemonium as the brush fire burned and firefighters rushed to the scene only to come under heavy fire.</p><p>First responders made urgent calls for help on their radios: \"Everybody's shot up here ... send law enforcement now,\" according to one dispatch.</p><p>Gov. Brad Little said \"multiple\" firefighting personnel were attacked.</p><p>\"This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters,\" Little said on X. \"I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more.\"</p><p>Norris said it appeared the sniper was hiding in the rugged terrain and using a high-powered rifle. He said he instructed deputies to fire back.</p><p>\"I'm hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize, because they're not at this point in time showing any evidence of wanting to surrender,\" the sheriff said.</p><p>An alert by the Kootenai County Emergency Management Office asked people to avoid the area around Canfield Mountain Trailhead and Nettleton Gulch Road, about 4 miles (6.5 km) north of downtown Coeur d'Alene.</p><p>Though the shelter-in-place order was lifted, the sheriff's office cautioned residents to be prepared because the fire was still burning.</p><p>The FBI responded to the scene with technical teams and tactical support, Deputy Director Dan Bongino said.</p><p>The Idaho House Republican Leadership said in a statement: \"We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.\"</p><p>Coeur d'Alene is a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington. Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the city's outskirts, covered with trees and heavy brush and crisscrossed with trails that lead into a national forest.</p><p>Fire is always a big concern for the region, said Bruce Deming, whose property abuts the trail system. When he noticed smoke on the ridge Sunday afternoon, he wondered why no firefighting helicopters were responding.</p><p>When a friend texted to tell him about the shooting, he realized why he wasn't seeing aircraft: \"Because they're concerned about being shot at,\" he said.</p><p>As deputies set up posts nearby, Deming pointed them to a trail that starts near his backdoor and leads directly to the site of the fire.</p><p>\"I just don't want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to figure if somebody's out prowling around my place,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-httpswwwdeseretcomthewest20250629idahosnipershootingmanfounddeadlockdownlifted</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G57-7673-RRHD-G3MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Deseret News Publishing Co.

Williams joined the CBC/Radio-Canada as Executive Vice-President of English Services in 2019.</p><p>Over her six year tenure at the national public broadcaster, Williams reimagined the way the CBC could serve existing audiences and welcome new ones, all while navigating the complexities of a global pandemic and the relentless pace of digital transformation.</p><p>In the words of CBC/Radio-Canada President and CEO, Marie-Phillipe Bouchard: \u201cThe CBC we know today was born out of Barb\u2019s vision to make our English Services platform-agnostic, a transformation that repositioned how Canadians consume CBC\u2019s content. Barb\u2019s dedication, integrity, and passion for public broadcasting has propelled CBC forward. Her presence will undoubtedly be missed by all who had the pleasure of working with her. I am incredibly grateful for her immense contribution.\u201d</p><p>Williams\u2019 supportive and empowering leadership style, her commitment to audience, and her passion for Canadian content and creators made a significant difference.</p><p>She has consistently fostered a collaborative environment and inspired countless individuals, something she will continue to do early into the new calendar year to ensure a smooth transition for her successor. That search will begin shortly.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/barbara-williams-to-retire\">https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/barbara-williams-to-retire</url></p><p>Latest Research</p><p>Media Literacy Policy as a Response to Platform Domination and Information Disorder</p><p>Harry Peter</p><p>Abstract</p><p>In an era dominated by digital platforms, the global information ecosystem has become increasingly vulnerable to misinformation, disinformation, algorithmic manipulation, and declining public trust in news. As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships. The initiative aims to strengthen bilateral connections between French and Canadian producers, with a focus on the development of new English-language television series across genres.</p><p>In addition to bringing together experienced producers from Canada and France to strengthen bilateral content collaboration, the CMPA and USPA will discuss the ongoing shared challenges faced by the independent production sectors in their respective countries.</p><p>\u201cUSPA is thrilled with the ongoing international cooperation fostered by its partnership with CMPA in Canada. In the current international context, it is necessary to strengthen the links between our two countries, both operationally and politically,\u201d said Amanda Borghino, Deputy General Delegate of the USPA. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this collaboration and shaping together new paths for transatlantic content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrance has long been a valued production partner for Canada, and we are thrilled to collaborate with USPA on this initiative,\u201d said Reynolds Mastin, President and CEO of the CMPA. \u201cToday, our two countries are leading global efforts to ensure foreign streaming services respect the right of national governments to require equitable contributions to domestic production, and opportunities for local producers to hold and exploit their own intellectual property. This is critical to the success of local independent production sectors, and to safeguarding individual countries\u2019 national cultural sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Participants from Canada:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Amos   Adetuyi, Circle Blue Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Alfons Adetuyi, Inner City Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Kerry Appleyard, Lionsgate Canada  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Eli Campbell, Peacock Alley Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Annette Clarke, Ruby Line Productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Lauren Corber, LoCo Motion Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   David Cormican, Fun Republic Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Malachi Ellis, Area V5 Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sibel Guvenc, Kybele Films Inc.  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Frederick Kroetsch, Catapult Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michelle Morris, Lily Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michael Souther, Amaze Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Steven Thibault, Screen Siren Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Participants from France:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Iris Bucher, Quad Drama (USPA President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Thomas Anargyros, Mediawan Studio France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Isabelle Degeorges, Gaumont Televisions France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Patricia Boutinard Rouelle, Nilaya Productions (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Odile McDonald, Wildcats Productions (USPA Drama college VP)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Arnaud de Cr\u00e9miers, Jour Premier  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sophie Deloche, Ashart\u00e9&amp;Cie  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Nicolas Deprost, What\u2019s up productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Fabrice Est\u00e8ve, Yuzu Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Emmanuel Fran\u00e7ois, Brother Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Corine Janin, Bleu Kobalt  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Betty Johnson, Hababo Studios  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Am\u00e9lie Juan, Morgane Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Jean-Marie Laronze, Monde et media TV  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Gini Lorin, Scriptline  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Tatiana Maksimenko, Hamak (Effervescence group)  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The initiative is presented in collaboration with Telefilm Canada, the Canada Media Fund, CanExport for Associations (Global Affairs), the French Embassy in Canada and the Canadian Embassy in France.</p><p>Source: The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/\">https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/</url></p><p>Canada Media Producers Association</p><p>The Canadian Media Producers Association is Canada\u2019s trade association for independent producers.

Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share. In addition, BCE's common share dividend payout policy has been updated to target a dividend payout range of 40% to 55% of free cash flow.

Adjusted EBITDA projections remain the same as previously disclosed. The Corporation expects additional pressure on its revenue, particularly in\u00a0the United States, driven by increased competition. As part of its three-year transformation program, the Corporation has initiated several cost reduction initiatives and operating efficiencies across the organization in order to minimize the revenue impact on adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, net capital expenditures are expected to be lower than under the previous financial guidelines, partially resulting from operational efficiencies following the combination of the Canadian and U.S. management teams.</p><p>Consequently, compared to fiscal 2024, on a constant currency and consolidated basis, we are lowering Cogeco's revenue projections for fiscal 2025 to a low single digit decline, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain stable.

As part of its three-year transformation program, the Corporation has initiated several cost reduction initiatives and operating efficiencies across the organization in order to minimize the revenue impact on adjusted EBITDA.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion. On August 12, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d) for the sale of Freedom to Videotron Ltd. (\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.  It will also enable network expansion, bridging the digital divide, and the next-generation wireless and wireline networks that will drive innovation and economic growth.</p><p>As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes and related hearings, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust have agreed to extend the outside date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from July 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which outside date may be further extended to January 31, 2023 at the option of Rogers or Shaw, demonstrating their commitment to completing this transformative combination. The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

This increase is mainly attributable to the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, mostly offset by lower volume and a less favourable product mix in the Packaging Sector as well as the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $54.7 million, or 74.5%, from $73.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $128.1 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the previously explained increase in operating earnings before depreciation and amortization as well as lower financial expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher income taxes. On a per share basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.85 to $1.53, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $14.5 million, or 10.8%, from $134.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $148.6 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to lower financial expenses. On a per share basis, adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $1.55 to $1.77, respectively.</p><p>For more detailed financial information, please see the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter ended July 27, 2025, as well as the financial statements in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of our website at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/investors/overview\">www.tc.tc</url>  .</p><p>Outlook    (1)</p><p>The investments in our growth activities, including flexible packaging and in-store marketing, position us well for the future and should be a key driver of our long-term growth.</p><p>In terms of profitability, despite a weaker than anticipated demand in the third quarter, we expect to generate organic growth in adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization of the Packaging Sector for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. In the Retail Services and Printing Sector, given the higher than anticipated growth in earnings since the beginning of fiscal 2025, we expect adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2025 to rise compared to fiscal 2024.</p><p>Lastly, we expect to continue generating significant cash flows from operating activities, which will enable us to pursue our strategy launched in 2023 to reduce net indebtedness while investing in our growth and returning capital to our shareholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2\">https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2</url></p><p>Vividata</p><p>Vividata Leader In Canadian Cross-Media And Consumer Research</p><p>Offering the largest syndicated study in Canada, Vividata\u2019s SCC | Study of the Canadian Consumer is the go-to source for demographics, psychographics, lifestyle, life events, media, purchasing and brand preferences.

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities. However, the company faces challenges in revenue and profit growth, and technical analysis suggests a lack of momentum in the stock. Despite these hurdles, Weyerhaeuser's strategic initiatives and commitment to shareholder returns remain positive indicators for investors.</p><p>As the largest private owner of timberlands in North America, Weyerhaeuser operates across various sectors, including timberlands, real estate, energy, and natural resources.

This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada. The company is recognized for its commitment to sustainability, operating all its timberlands in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. In 2024, Weyerhaeuser reported net sales of $7.1 billion and employed around 9,400 people globally.</p><p>The Gorman Group, a family-owned business founded in 1951, operates multiple divisions in Southern British Columbia and northern Washington state, employing about 900 individuals. The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets. The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 13, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.42% is 0.83 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.11%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.42</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.11</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.69</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.4% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.4%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 179.1%.

According to news reporting from the University of La Laguna (ULL) by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires are one of the risks with the greatest socio-territorial impact in island areas with Mediterranean precipitation characteristics.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Ministerio De Ciencia, InnovacioN Y Universidades Del Gobierno De EspanA; Catedra De Medio Ambiente Y Desarrollo Sostenible Cabildo De Tenerife-universidad De La Laguna. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of La Laguna (ULL): \"Regions such as the Canary Islands, densely populated and where there is no clear differentiation between land uses, regularly suffer major forest fires that devastate a large part of their forest mass and endanger the lives and property of thousands of people. This paper characterizes the forest fire that occurred on the island of Tenerife during the month of August 2023-defined as the most severe in Spain during that year-from a double perspective: on the one hand, analysis of the exposure and vulnerability of the buildings located in the surroundings of the fire and, on the other hand, economic quantification of the assets salvaged thanks to the intervention of the means and resources deployed by the authorities. The conclusion is that the analyzed buildings exhibit moderate vulnerability and exposure, being high in aspects such as their poor accessibility, their proximity to forest areas and, specifically, to dangerous fuel models, as well as the slope of their surroundings and their proximity to ravines.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In terms of the evaluation of what was salvaged, the losses avoided are estimated at EUR 187 million, which would have been added to the actual losses-EUR 164 million-especially thanks to the interventions carried out around the nearby buildings and agricultural areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fires, Vulnerability, and Exposure: The Evaluation of What Was Salvaged in the 2023 Fire in Tenerife (Spain).

Cities have increasingly tough issues in developing efficient transportation systems,mitigating urban heat island effects, and meeting the ever-increasing demand for clean water and air open space, parks, and species habitats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sustainable development, as an approach toward development based on the mutual coordination and co-development of society, economy, population, resources, and the environment, is widely recognized around the world to alleviate these pressures and also has influenced landscape design (Steiner, 2020). Sustainable landscape can optimally be developed in such a way that it does not prohibit natural functions and be designed and maintained to avoid, even reverse the frequently deleterious impacts of development, its also responsive to avhive a healthy community (Pieranunzi et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2024; Sundus et al., 2024).</p><p>The Sustainable Sites Initiative(TM) (SITES(TM)) is a program based on the understanding that land is a crucial component of the built environment and can be planned, designed, developed, and maintained to avoid detrimental impacts, Sustainable landscapes create ecologically resilient communities better able to withstand and recover droughts, landscapes and green infrastructure have the capacity to protect and even regenerate natural systems, thereby increasing the ecosystem services they provide, such as sequestering carbon, filtering air and water, and regulating climate (Ragab et al., 2017; Ashinze et al., 2024).</p><p>Sustainable site assessment site v2 includes 18 prerequisites and 48 optional credits in 10 sections, the value or number of points allocated to each credit is determined by its potential efficacy in achieving the objectives including, soil conservation, efficient energy usage, air and water pollution reduction, and enhancement to human health and well-being. The rating system itself is a 200-point system with four certification levels depending the score of the site, bonus points are awarded for innovative and exemplary performance outside the 200-point system. A total of 70 points are required to be certified, 85 points to receive silver, 100 points for gold, and finally, 135 for platinum certification (Jin and Wang, 2023; Mansor et al., 2023).</p><p>Among the universities that used the SITES v2 environmental sustainability assessment system is the University of Texas UTEP, one of the highest-ranked universities in America, with an area of 11 thousand square meter The university's sustainability was assessed using the SITES v2 assessment system in 2016. After considering the considerations that must be taken for sustainability, the university administration converted a group of parking lots on campus into outdoor spaces with a distinctive natural landscape, seating areas, and holding events and activities for students, encouraging cognitive abilities, increasing opportunities for meeting between campus users, increasing the percentage of vegetation cover by 60%, emphasizing the cultivation of native plants and increasing their percentage, and recycling materials in the landfill on the university site.</p><p>In July 2016, the CTP received SITES Silver, and became the first project certified under v2 of the SITES Rating System (Konbar et al., 2023; Arafat et al., 2023). Among the examples of Arab universities is Kafr El-Sheikh University in Egypt, with an area of 449,400 square meters. After being assessed using the SITES v2 system, the university obtained 67 points, and thus did not obtain any level of qualification. Therefore, the University tried to develop the environmental performance of some of its projects, but they were not implemented according to the standards that qualify them to enter this system (Ragab et al., 2017; Ma, 2024).</p><p>The objectives of using the SITES v2 framework for landscape assessment include, enhancing metrics for environmental quality, biodiversity analysis, and habitat evaluation. Research gaps often revolve around the applicability of these metrics in diverse geographical contexts, such as adaptation in regions and how effectively they can measure various ecological aspects across different landscape projects, The framework promotes a systematic approach to assessing landscapes, ensuring better integration of ecological and human factors in planning.</p><p>The research aims to establish principles for achieving sustainability in site coordination, by shedding light on the first system approved in the United States of America to evaluate the processes of designing and maintaining sustainable sites, Sites V2, and evaluating the environmental performance of the open space model for some Iraqi universities as a site coordination model, reaching the most important considerations that must be taken into account to enhance sustainability efforts in the coordination of these sites, and then developing visions that help develop in this direction in the future.</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>Sites of Universities</p><p>Baghdad university-site: University of Baghdad is located in Al-Al-Jadriyah near the Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq. It lays according to coordinate's 33\u00b016'12\"N 44\u00b022'54\"E. Baghdad city experiences a hot and arid climate in the summer, while the winter season is cool and humid. Despite their short duration, spring and autumn bring about pleasant weather conditions, the average temperature from May to September reaches 40\u00b0C, with the highest temperatures recorded in July and August. Winter temperatures average around 10\u00b0C during the day and occasionally drop below freezing. Rainfall is observed from December to April, with an average annual precipitation of 150 mm.</p><p>The northwest wind during spring and early summer gives rise to sandstorms, University area identified through on-site inspections and utilizing the Global Positioning System (GPS) device, which operates on a satellite network to ascertain the precise geographical coordinates of the user, offering the latitude, longitude, and elevation details of a given location (Kusay and Muntaha, 2015). Baghdad campus includes two universities which consider the largest universities in Iraq, the largest scientific institution in Iraq, the Baghdad campus, was established in 1957 AD (Ramadan and Hassan, 2018). With an enrollment capacity exceeding 80,000 undergraduate students and over 10,000 postgraduate students. The total area of the Baghdad campus is 325 hectares (Mehdi and Jasim, 2023; Jasim and Al-Fatlawi, 2023).</p><p>Diyala university site-2</p><p>The study area \"University of Diyala\" is located to the east of Baghdad and away from the city of Baqubah, the capital of Diyala province, around 11 km to the northeast, with an area of 1654774 square meters, the university's location is on the outskirts of the city near the Diyala River basin and the palm and orange groves, in addition to its location on an international road linking the northern governorates and the capital Baghdad, which gave it a semi-urban importance and a natural scene, the university includes eight colleges and many research centers and presidency of the University (Al-Zuhairi and Jasim, 2021; Fadhil and Waheeb, 2021).</p><p>American university in Baghdad AUIB-site</p><p>The AUIB is located on Airport Road, Baghdad, Baghdad Governorate, and Iraq. The total area is 26.7 hectare. It is noted that the university aims to provide a beautiful and comfortable campus to enhance the study and intellectual development experiences, and to prepare international leaders by adhering to rich traditions of knowledge and human understanding while engaging with contemporary intellectual challenges. It was officially established in 2018 and began operations in January 2021. and aims to create a thriving educational community with a distinguished faculty and international partnerships. The university is located on a site that was originally intended by Saddam Hussein for a grand resort project (https auib.edu.iq/ar).</p><p>The researchers relied on a set of sources to collect and analyze information to evaluate the campuses of the three universities under study, namely: The website of each university, personal interviews with engineers from the engineering consulting center, agricultural and irrigation engineers, and officials of the agricultural and horticultural departments, field visits, and observations during those visits. This research is primarily a literature review based on the scorecard of SITES certification, public documents, reports, and articles with the specific context of three Iraqi universities, was chosen to present an example of a landscape design site with the profile of being sustainable and certified within the SITES v2 rating system.</p><p>The systematic literature review was conducted, the first with the review of the history, principles, and purposes of SITES v2 a strategic search for three Iraqi universities was first launched around, how to use SITES v2 as the guidance to operate in the project toward sustainable outcomes, Then, we were deeply involved with the components and final result of the scorecard for these universities, Specifically, according to the scores of each credit, this paper analyzed the innovation points, the strategies adopted, and how to solve the multi-objective project tasks, such as design evaluation and planning, water resources, soil and vegetation, material selection, public education, and monitoring. Then, we singled out the scorecard criteria which can be improved at the site and made suggestions for techniques and systems to better these. The second stage provided an example of how to use SITE v2 to continue development at an already certified site by enhancing sustainability further.</p><p>In the context of contemporary landscape design, further thinking of the potential and future evolution of SITES v2 is presented in the discussion part, Table 1 showed Sustainable features of university sites according to the sustainable sites rating system sites.</p><p><br/>Table 1: Sustainable features of university sites under consideration according to the sustainable sites rating system sites. <br/>American university                            Diyala university                              Baghdad university                    Site<br/>251.75hectare                                  108.6 hectare                                  87.5 hectare                          Total Area <br/>2021                                           1999                                           1957                                  Establish- <br/>                                                                                                                                    ment date <br/>2024                                           2024                                           2024                                  Evaluation <br/>                                                                                                                                    date <br/>It is located in Al-Radwaniyah area,           The university land is located on agri-        Quiet agricultural area away          Site<br/>which is one of the green belt areas           cultural land due to its proximity to the      from traffic congestion and           selection <br/>surrounding the city of Baghdad.

The original definition of \"Ecosystem Services\" has been expanded to include the ecosystem services of designed landscapes in addition to constructed landscapes (Woodruff and BenDor, 2016). SITES v2 provides an active and valuable exchange mechanism for creating sustainable landscapes and meeting long-term sustainability goals. The system encourages early engagement with the local community, which can improve the understanding of the project and its surrounding area, and helps ensure that the undertaking meets the needs of the community. SITES projects could gain up to 11 certification points based on their capacity to educate the public about the importance of sustainable landscapes-(Jin and Wang, 2023). In addition, SITES v2 requires project teams to with contractors and maintenance professionals for better coordination of design with construction and maintenance.</p><p>Adaptive management and performance monitoring are highly recommended as a way to create a feedback loop for understanding how the site performs over time and collecting facts to support the case.</p><p>Site context</p><p>It is clear from Tables 2, 3, 4 that the University of Baghdad and the American University achieved (7/13) due to the site location is linked to transportation networks and movement routes, which is an advanced educational site, while Diyala campus achieved (10/13) because the site evolved into a university after it was a camp, in addition to same tow pre-requests.</p><p>Pre-design assessment + planning</p><p>In this section AUIB and Diyala campus achieved (3/3) due to the planning team's ability to engage users and stakeholders in the pre-design and planning part of the project.</p><p>Site design water</p><p>AUIB campus achieved (15/23) because it relies on fresh lake water from the fresh Tigris River to irrigate the green spaces within the site and does not rely on any external water, large lakes collect rainwater and reuse it to irrigate green spaces, Baghdad campus scored (6/23) points in this axis due to the relying on the Tigris River water from which the water channel inside the university is derived, in addition to a number of small lakes and sub-canals, Diyala campus scored (4/23), there were basins for collecting water and storing it for irrigation purposes</p><p>Site design soil + vegetation</p><p>Regarding the soil and vegetation of the SITE V2 system, the AUIB scored 26/40, followed Baghdad campus 24/40, and Diyala campus achieved 13/40. AUB campus, maintain native plants, to adopt sustainable practices that promote ecological health, focusing on preserving biodiversity by selecting plants suited for the local environment, avoiding invasive species, implementing conservation strategies to create a natural habitat that supports the local ecosystem, engages in research related to local biodiversity and promotes the study of native flora, which supports sustainability and environmental awareness in the region, using river shoulder soil with good specifications and uses organic and bio-fertilizers to maintain soil properties and plant growth, AUIB has established a vibrant educational community and is likely engaged in various initiatives related to local plants and sustainability, particularly highlighted through their agricultural projects, as mentioned during earth day celebrations.</p><p>However, specific information on the percentage of native plants found at their campus is not directly available, but through the site observation of campus, most of the vegetation is local and adapted to the environment and soil and is growing excellently. Baghdad campus contains healthy soil, in which fertilizers and pesticides are not used except when necessary. The area allocated for green use within the university is about 43% (Jasim and Kamel 2017; Jasim and Al-Fatlawi, 2023),There are plants of a special nature in the gardens. All plants used on campus are 100% native. The local plant communities within the university are 100%. The effect of heat islands is reduced by increasing the density of vegetation and green spaces, the cultivated area, vegetation with its various densities comprises 43% of the total area, The campus has a variety of vegetation such as trees, palm trees, etc.</p><p>The main purpose of which is to provide shade in open spaces, the are designed with a compact fabric system, The university does not measure the percentage of energy consumption or the energy that is saved. There are windbreaks surrounding some sides of campus with different trees and shrubs. For Diyala campus, all plants used on campus are native plants, the local plant communities within the university are 100%.</p><p><br/>Table 2: Evaluation of the Baghdad campus according to the sustainable sites assessment system-SITES V2. <br/>Points of Site V2 Assessment of baghdad campus                                          Pre-requests                          Section <br/>project   points <br/>No        Manda- The university land is located on agricultural land due to its         Limit encroachment on agri-           Site context <br/>          tory   proximity to the Tigris River, and the surrounding areas are           cultural land <br/>                 planted with agricultural crops for local production, the land <br/>                 where the Baghdad campus could be considered a transgression <br/>                 against agricultural land.

The AUIB provides community support through its marketing and communications department, which offers assistance in strategic communications, media relations consulting, and development of community engagement initiatives, This support helps foster a connected and informed university community, to reduce light pollution at AUIB, several strategies can be implemented, include using shielded outdoor lighting fixtures that direct light downward, employing lower-intensity lighting in non-essential areas, and utilizing timers or sensors to minimize unnecessary lighting during off-hours.</p><p>Additionally, promoting awareness among the university community about the impacts of light pollution and encouraging participation in initiatives aimed at preserving the night sky can be effective. The AUIB aims to provide food production and regular distribution on campus as part of its commitment to creating a thriving educational community. This initiative resonates with the broader challenges facing Iraq regarding food security, particularly amid economic, political, and environmental changes, emphasizes fuel efficiency and multi-modal transportation options to enhance student success and sustainability. By promoting better transportation practices, the university aims to create a more efficient campus experience while contributing to environmental stewardship. Students are encouraged to utilize various transport means, which can help reduce congestion and fuel consumption on campus.</p><p>To reduce exposure to smoking at the campus, it is essential to implement a comprehensive smoke-free policy that prohibits smoking within all buildings, including classrooms, laboratories, and offices, as outlined by public health laws. Providing designated smoking areas outside of the main facilities may help to manage smoking without compromising public health. However, compliance with health regulations must be strictly enforced to ensure a smoke-free environment. The AUIB supports the local economy by empowering future generations through education. It focuses on equipping young leaders with knowledge and skills essential for contributing positively to society. Additionally, being a non-profit institution, it competes in providing quality education, which can enhance the local workforce's capabilities and drive economic growth.</p><p>Baghdad campus site has signage and lighting poles for easy access and safety, used by the public for public events or occasions, it is characterized by its wide spaces that provide visual and physical contact with the external areas, helping students to hold various social activities, it has open fields where sports such as football, volleyball, campus's spaces courtyards and multiple outdoor seating areas provide gathering places for students. Diyala campus has open fields where sports such as football, volleyball etc., and the campus is characterized by its wide spaces that provide visual and physical contact with the external areas, helping students to hold various social activities.</p><p>Construction</p><p>As for the construction section, the points achieved by the universities under study were close, with Diyala University and America University scoring 3/17 and Baghdad University scoring 2/17. Baghdad campus, does not restore soil damaged by any previous development, but rather transfers soil from construction areas first before starting the construction process to areas designated for crop, Diyala campus, disposes of construction and demolition materials and reuses them in roads and other places or throws them outside. American campus, restoring damaged soil after previous development projects at the American University in Baghdad would likely involve techniques for remediating contaminated land, such as phytoremediation (using plants to absorb pollutants) and soil amendment to enhance fertility. These methods can turn contaminated soils, such as oil-polluted areas, into valuable land for future use, although specific local practices may vary.</p><p>It's essential to consult with environmental experts and follow regulatory guidelines to ensure safe and effective restoration. The university replaced some of the soil in the damaged areas after 2003 and added large quantities of healthy mixed soil suitable for agriculture.</p><p>Maintenance and operations</p><p>It is very clear that the maintenance and operation section, in terms of the evaluation of the universities under study, was below standard, as the universities obtained 2, 1 and 0/17. Baghdad campus, uses organic plant fertilizers from the university's plant waste, and chemical fertilizers are used when necessary to obtain healthy plants (2/22). American campus, recycling organic materials, such as plant waste, to create compost is a beneficial practice for universities like the American University. This process not only reduces waste but also produces nutrient-rich fertilizer that can be used in landscaping and agricultural practices on campus. The environmental and economic benefits of reusing organic waste are significant, as it promotes sustainability and reduces the reliance on chemical fertilizers.</p><p>Education and performance monitoring</p><p>First, the interests of the community and public in a sustainable Landscape are inspired by clearly and successfully demonstrating the Summary of such a SITE v2 certified project.

(Photo by Clark Kauffman/Iowa Capita Dispatch) </p><p>Smoke from the fires currently ravaging the Canadian wilderness arrived at Iowa's northern border Monday night and will likely impact air quality throughout the state in the coming days. </p><p>The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has announced an air quality alert across Iowa that will be in effect until 6 a.m., Thursday, June 5. During this time, Iowa DNR expects the air to contain an unhealthy amount of hazardous airborne pollutants from the wildfire smoke.</p><p>#8216;It's like predicting snowfall,#8217; said Todd Russell, one of the ambient air monitoring staff at Iowa DNR. #8216;It's difficult to tell how much smoke is up there, how much smoke will reach the ground and how long it's going to last.#8217;</p><p>Russell said the decision to put the alert in effect came after observing levels of particulates #8216;multiple times the federal standard#8217; in northern Iowa towns, such as Emmetsburg, for several hours. Areas near the Minnesota border are still seeing high levels of particulates, he said. </p><p>Based on several models of smoke movement that mirrored the changes the Iowa DNR observed on Monday night, Russell says his #8216;conservative#8217; estimate is that the smoke will remain at least through Wednesday evening.</p><p>According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/wildfires/be-smoke-ready/\">AirNow, a central hub of EPA air-quality information at state and national levels, individuals with lung or heart diseases, children, teenagers, pregnant women, adults over the age of 65 and people more likely to be outside for extended periods are at risk of more severe health effects caused by the smoke. However, AirNow recommends everyone reduce their exposure. </url></p><p>#8216;Stay away from it if you can and minimize your exercise or intake of that smoke if you can't get away from it,#8217; Russell said. </p><p>As of June 3, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center<url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/situation/2025-06-03\">reports 213 active fires, of which 106 are #8216;out of control.#8217; The area burned by these fires since the start of 2025 is greater than 4.8 million acres of land.
